On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;8th of Hearth Fire&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Darkness Nocturnal may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nOn the 8th of Hearth Fire, the Agent may attempt to summon &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Darkness, from a summoner from either the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Successfully contacting the Prince will result in the Agent receiving a vision of Nocturnal, who asks that the Agent \"destroy one who brings me pain.\" Should the Agent accept Nocturnal's quest, they will be instructed to slay a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; in return for the famed &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, held by one of her \"slaves.\"\nA Better Offer?\nWith that the Agent must head to the mage's lair, a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; identified by Nocturnal, and hunt them down. Upon striking the correct mage, for their may be multiple mages in the dungeon, the Agent will receive an offer to spare the mage's life:\n\"Wait! I know that Nocturnal has sent you, and that she has promised you the Skeleton's Key. But if it is truly power you seek, I can top her offer -- if you cease your attack, I will tell you where to find [Artefact]. Do you agree to my offer?\"\nThe Agent must now choose: reject the offer and slay the mage; or try and find the mage's prize.\nThe Key's Calling.\nRejecting the mage's offer will result in the Agent having to slay the mage, before escaping the dungeon. They must then head to the town mentioned by Nocturnal and speak with the Prince's apostle, whom will hand the Agent the Skeleton Key should they arrive before the time limit expires.\nThis is the only way to successfully complete the quest.\nA Mercenary Heart.\nAccepting the mage's offer will see the Agent given the general location of a famed artefact, either &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Warlock%27s%20Ring%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Warlock's Ring&lt;/a&gt;. With that, the mage disappears and the Agent must head to the dungeon the mage identified, searching through the dungeon to find the artefact. The artefact will be laying somewhere on the floor on the dungeon, disguised as a randomly generated piece of scrap.\nHowever, within a few moments of taking the artefact off the floor, the Agent will receive the following notification:\n\"Mocking laughter echoes in your mind,\"\n\"You should have known better than to trust me, [Agent's name]. Perhaps this shadow of power can satisfy your craving for a time, while you rage vainly against those who actually possess it. Me for example. I do hope sweet Nocturnal won't be too displeased with your treachery.\"\n\"(Artifact) crumbles to dust in your hand.\"\nFurthermore, until the time limit expires the Agent will have to defend themselves from Nocturnal's servants. These servants are &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Daedra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;frost daedra&lt;/a&gt; that spawn every few minutes from the moment the Agent accepts the mage's offer.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nocturnal's&lt;/a&gt; signature tool, the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the Agent will receive a boost in reputation with whatever faction they used to summon Nocturnal for ending the quest in triumph. Conversely, failing the quest will cost the Agent reputation with the summoner's faction, with further penalty in reputation applied for betraying Nocturnal.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:\nFailing the quest by betraying Nocturnal will also see the Agent receive an additional penalty to their reputation:"}

It took me several days of watching and waiting, but I am patient. I was rewarded with a mass exodus at twilight yesterday. The entire group, accompanied by their &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cave bears&lt;/a&gt;, left on some quest that was doubtless of great importance to them.\nThe door to their caves beneath &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Hollow%20Cave%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Serpent Hollow&lt;/a&gt; had been left slightly ajar and I slipped inside. I moved cautiously through the cave's winding passages, fearful of meeting a guard. But there were none. I found a perfect observation post, secreted myself behind some boxes, and was settled in with my supplies long before the expedition returned.\nI am elated to report that the rumors are true. The &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; residing here are indeed unusually intelligent. I will take diligent notes for the three weeks my supplies will last. I can already hear the applause when I present my findings to my colleagues in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, once this foolish war is over.\nDay 1: Settled into my post undetected. Ogres and cave bears returned hours later. Several seemed to hesitate, sniffing the air deeply, but they soon moved on to normal activities.\nDay 2: I have witnessed tool use and rudimentary communication among these ogres! The big one, the one I have dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Bruuke\"&gt;Bruuke&lt;/a&gt;,\" pointed at a crate and grunted several times at one of his underlings. That worthy scowled, grabbed the crate, and threw it into a corner, shattering it and scattering its contents about. That seemed to appease Bruuke, who scratched himself in satisfaction.\nDay 3: These caves were obviously once the site of humanoid habitation, likely Imperial miners. Possibly the ogres came upon these folk and killed them in the process of claiming the cavern for their own. But the ogres have cleverly adapted the implements the miners left behind. Fires have been carefully tended and kept burning, and I have seen a shield used as a plate. The ogres also stage impromptu concerts using human bones and skulls as primitive instruments.\nDay 4: Today I witnessed play behavior among the clan. Bruuke picked up a long bone, possibly a miner's femur, struck a bear on the nose with it, and threw it into the water. The bear chased after it and returned it to Bruuke. Soon the other ogres and bears were playing this game as well. It entertained the entire clan for most of the day. I believe this is behavior never before documented among ogres.\nDay 5: I have no doubt that Bruuke is the source of this clan's cleverness. Several times yesterday, as I wrote in my journal, I saw him peer suspiciously about. I believe he hears the sound of my quill scratching on the paper and recognizes it as unusual, possibly dangerous. If he ever comes over here to investigate, then I will \u2014"}

If we focus our efforts on the indriks, we should be able to refine the process until we can produce a safer serum with wider applications.\nDespite these advances we have encountered a minor setback. Indriks from the wild have displayed dramatic behavioral shifts after treatment, becoming abnormally aggressive. This makes them both unmanageable and incredibly dangerous. All but our most recent specimen have had to be put down and it won't be long before it will share the same fate.\nMy recommendation would be to see if a domesticated indrik poses the same risks.

I should find him and discover the reason for his urgent message.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing the quests \"&lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;March of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Descent\"&gt;The Final Descent&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Veleth\"&gt;Captain Veleth&lt;/a&gt; will ask that the Dragonborn speak with\u00a0Adril Arano, the Second Councilor of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found either walking around Raven Rock or in &lt;a href=\"Morvayn%20Manor%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Morvayn Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Arano is worried that members of the Ulen family are present in Raven Rock, seeking revenge for the execution of their ancestor by a member of the Morvayn Family, and suggests that the Dragonborn speak with Geldis Sadri at &lt;a href=\"the%20Retching%20Netch\"&gt;the Retching Netch&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaptain Veleth sent me. \"Thank you for coming. After everything you've already done for Raven Rock, I hate to ask for more of you but I can't risk Councilor Morvayn being killed.\"\nSadri suggests a plan to identify the member(s) of the Ulen family, telling the Dragonborn to hide within the Ulen ancestral tomb and wait for them.\nAdril Arano said you might be able to help me. \"Well, well. Adril's got himself a spy, does he? Azura knows he needs all the help he can get. He's been chasing down the Ulens for years now.\"\nAfter waiting in the tomb for a short period, &lt;a href=\"Tilisu%20Severin\"&gt;Tilisu Severin&lt;/a&gt; will enter the tomb. To make enough contact to advance the quest, the Dragonborn can either get close enough for her name to become visible (by &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;), wait on one side of the door, then stepping close behind her as she walks into the tomb, or interrogate her directly. Once she has been identified, the quest continues.\nHello. \"Oh, excuse me! I didn't realize there was anyone else here.\"\nUpon reporting back to Arano, he will request a search for evidence within the Severin's home, Severin Manor, which is the house closest to the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt;. In support of this, he will give the &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Manor%20Key\"&gt;Severin Manor Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nI suspect Tilisu Severin in the culprit. \"Tilisu? Are you sure?\"\nUpon entry to the manor, Tilisu and &lt;a href=\"Mirri%20Severin\"&gt;Mirri Severin&lt;/a&gt; will attack, unless the Dragonborn has a high enough sneak skill. They can either be killed and Mirri's corpse looted for the key to the Severin family safe, or the expert-level lock can be picked. The safe is located downstairs in the master bedroom at the end of the hallway on the left side of an empty bookcase. Inside will be a letter titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ulen%20Matter\"&gt;The Ulen Matter&lt;/a&gt;\". After the letter is obtained and brought back to Arano, he will send the Dragonborn to meet up with two Redoran guards at &lt;a href=\"Ashfallow%20Citadel\"&gt;Ashfallow Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, located northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Sun Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nI found evidence proving the Severins's guilt. \"Then we finally have them! All that remains now is chasing them down, And bringing them to justice.\"\nUpon arriving at the fort, there will be two &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20Assassin%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Morag Tong assassins&lt;/a&gt; outside, who have killed the guards and will attack the Dragonborn on sight. The fort itself contains large piles of ash. From the entry floor, a curved set of stairs leads down. From the bottom, against the southeast wall is a rough opening for a passage down to the right (south). At the bottom is a corridor blocked off with several sets of gates which are protected by Morag Tong assassins. These gates must be lifted with chains, which can be found in the following places:\nAt the end of the corridor is the final room, where &lt;a href=\"Vendil%20Severin\"&gt;Vendil Severin&lt;/a&gt; can be found with two Morag Tong assassins. If the Dragonborn chose not to kill Tilisu and Mirri earlier in the quest chain, they will also be in the room, but having changed out of their civilian clothes and equipped &lt;a href=\"Chitin%20Armor%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;chitin armor&lt;/a&gt; to join in attacking the Dragonborn with Vendil and the Morag Tong. After they are killed, the Dragonborn is to return to Arano who will speak to them.\nI'm back! \"Well, what happened? Were you able to track down Vendil? Out with it!\"\nArano will then bring the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Councilor\"&gt;Councilor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;. After speaking with Councilor Morvayn, the Dragonborn will receive Severin Manor and a large amount of gold.\nYou wanted to speak with me, councilor? \"What you've done for me... for all of Raven Rock... goes far beyond what I would have expected from a traveler to our town. For this, you have my deepest gratitude.\""}

The untapped power within these &lt;a href=\"Spiders%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; has finally gone to &lt;a href=\"Merilar%20Rendas\"&gt;Merilar's&lt;/a&gt; head. Who would have thought these tiny &lt;a href=\"Albino%20Spider\"&gt;albino creatures&lt;/a&gt; had the ability to harness such &lt;a href=\"Magic%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;?\nBeing locked in this cage is frustrating, of course, but it is keeping me even more focused on my work. What did she think I was going to do, anyway? As my sister, she must have known how devoted I am to this work. Although, I can't fault her for her actions right now. Who knows what kind of fumes these experiments have been giving off, or what effect they have on the human brain. At least I'm all right. Or maybe I'm not but I think I am? Could these experiments be having the same effect on me that they are on her?\nMagnificent! It seems as though you can combine any one of the base spiders with a modifier to tweak its behavior. For instance, just imbuing an Albino Pod with a &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; seems to create a spider that jumps at its victims and proceeds to explode. But, by simply adding a Salt Pile to the mix it creates the same manner of spider, but instead of jumping and exploding it emits flames from its body. I'd experiment with more of these behaviors, but it seems the bandits we tested the mind control spiders on are all still locked away, Merilar doesn't want me to let them out. Maybe there are too many in there for her to handle?\nI heard her muttering to herself earlier today. She was saying things like, \"The spiders are mine. They'll listen to me!\" What exactly is she planning? I hope she's not attempting to enter the blocked off room in the main chamber. She knows we specifically sealed it after hearing odd chanting coming from that direction. Then again, what she used to \"know\" may not matter right now, considering the state she's been in. I hope she'll be all right."}

Almost every craftsman takes an almost religious stance on this matter, believing his own approach, traditions, and products to be superior to all others, but I want to present both sides and some of their considerations in an unbiased manner to help inform your own opinion.\nThe best &lt;a href=\"Leather%20%28Online%29\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; comes form &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, courtesy of the native guar and netches. This is an indisputable fact, and no other leather produced in Tamriel comes close to their quality.\u00a0The naturally-exposed hides of these beasts and he ease of processing them, combined with ancient tanning techniques, produce a material that is more durable and tougher than &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;, or any of the hides commonly used outside Morrowind.\u00a0Though both are of very high quality, the debate rages on - which makes superior &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;?\n&lt;a href=\"Netch%20Leather\"&gt;Netch leather&lt;/a&gt; is thinner by quite a bit. It bends and flexes easily, and it is much more receptive to &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt;s than guar hide, and therefore more suitable for finer, more ornamental works.\u00a0It is likewise ideal for the combatant who prefers mobility, but it is much more readily punctured and torn, even when boiled to increase toughness. Another difficulty is that it requires a relatively high maintenance - to keep it in fighting shape, it must be oiled and treated with &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dreugh wax&lt;/a&gt; weekly. Netch leather is harder to harvest, as well, the beasts are quite dangerous when riled and have a nasty poison that even experienced netchimen fear.\n&lt;a href=\"Guar%20hide\"&gt;Guar hide&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is much thicker, resulting in heavier armors overall (though still not as heavy, obviously, as armors crafted from metal).\u00a0This makes it more difficult to work with, but the end product offers more protection and durability.\u00a0Staunch traditionalists frequently claim that guar hide has been used longer than netch leather, and that we honor our ancestors in favoring it, but I have been able to locate no proof of this point. If you're more interested in protection than mobility, guar hide armor is likely a better choice for you.\nEven though every craftsman seems to have an unwavering opinion on which leather results in superior armors, I am not swayed by either side.\u00a0It occurs to me that the choice is largely on the wearer, depending on his or her fighting stye (though armorers are never shy to offer recommendations in this regard, either).\u00a0Hopefully you are more informed now about your options, and whether you chose netch, guar, or an unorthodox combination of both, I wish you luck on the battlefield."}

{"id": "107775", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=107775", "title": "Seventh Legion", "text": "Seventh Legion is one of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s. It has been utilized multiple times by different &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;s in events often relating to invasions.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour years before the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; took place, the Seventh Legion occupied a large chunk &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and Hammerfell. Four years later, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Ambassador to High Rock, Jadier Plourde, petitioned the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; to pull these troops back. He is supported by Councilor Jirich, who makes a motion that the matter be raised during the next Legionary's Council. The Elder Council agrees, and General Nipia of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Legion\"&gt;Second Legion&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with delivering the news the next time the Legionary's Council meets. Before the matter could be raised the next year, however, the Soulburst took place and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; would become cut off from the rest of Cyrodiil, disabling the news to reach the Seventh Legion.\nAs such, the Seventh Legion continued to occupy parts of Bangkorai. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion had advanced their army, conquering &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Knights of Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt;. The Garrison was said to be a strong position of power, and the Knights stationed there were said to have numbered over two hundred. A handful of them escaped, their stories of how the Garrison fell to Imperial forces varied, some saying giant &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; scaled the walls, while others claimed the dead rose within the crypt of the Garrison.\nThe Legion also had an agreement with the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. Evermore's farms and towns were being raided, with the city itself being low on food and morale. As such, the Imperials attempted to take the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; through diplomacy, promising its Duke, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Renchant\"&gt;Duke Renchant&lt;/a&gt;, that after the city would accept Imperial rule, it would be safe from the Reachman horde and retain considerable autonomy. The Duke himself had allowed refugees from the Imperial-occupied areas into Evermore, but did order the arrest of those who spoke out against the Imperials, believing their unrest would cause terror. In order to gain support among the population of the city, &lt;a href=\"Marcius%20Cipius\"&gt;Captain Cipius&lt;/a&gt; of the Legion had sent in spies who spoke in favor of Imperial rule. The Imperials had also placed weapon crates near the city, which were meant to provide the spies and their new recruits with weapons and armor for taking over the city. People who remained loyal to the Covenant but surrendered were to be spared, but turned into slaves. These legion spies would eventually be killed, and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Arzhela\"&gt;Queen Arzhela&lt;/a&gt; would take the throne of Evermore from the Duke.\nSometime later, &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; would request a parley be held with Queen Arzhela. Queen Arzhela, being unaware that the Bangkorai Garrison had fallen, suspected the Imperial forces wanted a peace agreement. During the parley, Septima Tharn explained she was not planning on peace, instead demanding the unconditional surrender of Evermore. She also elaborated that her forces had conquered the Bangkorai Garrison. Following this news, Arzhela attempted to murder the General, only to realize she had used &lt;a href=\"illusion\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt; magic. Septima took this as a declaration of war, and ordered her Seventh Legion to attack the Queen, though their attempts would fail due to the aid Arzhela received from the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom this point onward, the Legion forces would continue to be pushed back. Where as originally they had been raiding the supply lines at &lt;a href=\"Martyr%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Martyr's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, they were stopped by the Knights of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt;, and their boats were burned. Following this, an assault on the Bangkorai Garrison itself took place. Its &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Attius\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; was ordered to use the captives as hostages if it were necessary, and he did. A Covenant troop was ordered through the sewers of the Garrison and open the main gates for the Covenant army. The Imperials tried their best to hold the Courtyard, fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; and other Covenant troops, with sorcerors attacking the Covenant forces with firebolts. They would eventually be pushed back and hold their last stand at the bridge leading to the crypt of the Garrison, where they had fallen to conscripting men and women for their cause. They had also started to make use of Daedra to protect the Garrison against the Covenant army, and the Garrison's Battlemage, &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20Papus\"&gt;Battlemage Papus&lt;/a&gt;, sacrificed a Legionnaire in order to allow a &lt;a href=\"Dolmen\"&gt;Dolmen&lt;/a&gt; to form in the Garrison. A &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; was then summoned by a &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Moath\"&gt;Moath&lt;/a&gt;. But the Anchor would be destroyed and the Imperial army at the Garrison was defeated. It was a victory in a crucial battle, and &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; decided to push on in order to liberate Southern Bangkorai.\nIn Southern Bangkorai, Legion forces raided refugees, and had also taken over &lt;a href=\"Old%20Tower\"&gt;Old Tower&lt;/a&gt; by order of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Helenus\"&gt;Captain Helenus&lt;/a&gt;. They conquered Old Tower relatively easily, as the forces who were guarding the location were on patrol when the tower was taken over, and the Imperial troops who conquered it were new and weak. The Covenant captain of the Tower, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Wardush\"&gt;Captain Wardush&lt;/a&gt;, tried to take back the tower, only to fail and end up mortally wounded. Other Imperial troops would end up being sent to find &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city, and find and capture anything within that could be of value to the Imperial war effort. Within Southern Bangkorai, other forces which were hostile to the Empire tried to combat it in other ways. &lt;a href=\"Mazrahil%20the%20Scarab\"&gt;Mazrahil the Scarab&lt;/a&gt; attempted to falsify Imperial orders in order to send them back to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Mazrahil had earned a great reputation during the conquests of &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt;, as Mazrahil worked against the Reachmen in effective ways. Since that time, however, he had become old, and was caught by the Imperials when trying to falsify their &lt;a href=\"Second%20Cohort%20Orders\"&gt;orders&lt;/a&gt;, and was wounded. He tasked a Covenant troop with dealing with causing a distraction and obtaining the orders. He then forged the orders in such a way that the troops were recalled to Cyrodiil. Other Imperial forces would also return to Cyrodiil, but for different reasons. The forces commanded by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Gemelle\"&gt;Captain Gemelle&lt;/a&gt; were originally tasked with taking out &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; insurgents, but were ambushed by spiders. By the time they had discovered what had occured, two-thirds of the Legion company was gone. As such, the Captain and her troops were tired of the campaign within Bangkorai, and enlisted the aid of a Covenant troop. Upon her company being rescued from the spiders, they made their way to Cyrodiil to fight in the war there.\nOther Imperial forces, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Panthius%20Varro\"&gt;Panthius Varro&lt;/a&gt;, had taken over &lt;a href=\"Onsi%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Onsi's Breath&lt;/a&gt;, the most prosperous mine within Bangkorai. The Imperials did not have enough of their own men to work the mines, and as such, conscripted travelers to mine for them. A Covenant soldier infiltrated the mining operation, however, and sabotaged it from within through collaboration with the &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Connor\"&gt;foreman&lt;/a&gt; of the mine, killing Commander Varro and enabling the miners to take up arms against the Imperials who captured them.\n&lt;a href=\"Razak%27s%20Wheel\"&gt;Razak's Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20ruin\"&gt;Dwemer ruin&lt;/a&gt;, was also hit by the Legion. Imperial Researchers had discovered of a Dwemer named &lt;a href=\"Razak\"&gt;Razak&lt;/a&gt;, who, before his death, had nearly completed his greatest work, a truly autonomous construct, with the capability to function of its own even outside of the city it was designed for. The Imperials aimed to discover such a machine, and create replicas of it in order to defeat their enemies. Their advances were halted by a vault door within Razak's Wheel, however, as the door required three keys in order to be opened, and would not open through other means. One of the researchers noted that the door resisted every kind of destruction or unlock spell available to them. The researcher also realized that the door was filled with pictograms which told a narrative, the classical Elven cosmogony. The Imperial tents located near Razak's Wheel were spotted by a &lt;a href=\"Damrina\"&gt;Covenant Scout&lt;/a&gt;, who chose to investigate. However, the scout was captured by the Imperial forces and her orders, which detailed every Covenant patrol route within the region, were stolen. She tasked a Covenant trooper with retrieving the orders and killing the high ranking Imperials who were in charge of the Imperial forces at the ruin, &lt;a href=\"Major%20Carina\"&gt;Major Carina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spymaster%20Geta\"&gt;Spymaster Geta&lt;/a&gt;. This troop would also discover that Razak's autonomous creation was a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Spider\"&gt;Dwemer Spider&lt;/a&gt; after successfully completing the steps portrayed within Razak's plans.\nHallin's Burden, a city in Hammerfell, was occupied by the Legion. The city had fallen to Imperial troops before the Redguards' own soldiers could arm themselves. As such, a traitor was suspected to have lived inside the walls. Attempts were made to sabotage the Legion's supply lines, by taking their weapons and providing them to the resistance inside the city. The guard captain of the city, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Dhakir%20at-Nimr\"&gt;Captain Dhakir at-Nimr&lt;/a&gt;, had lost his daughter to the Imperial forces, who kept her captive. An Imperial Officer, named &lt;a href=\"Quatrius%20Scipio\"&gt;Quatrius Scipio&lt;/a&gt;, held the Captain's daughter for his personal gain, until being forced to let go of her by a Covenant infiltrator. Because of this, Captain Dhakir's forces were willing to aid the soldier with finding the traitor. The traitor of the city would turn out to be &lt;a href=\"Maradem\"&gt;Maradem&lt;/a&gt;, and would be drugged in order to liberate the rightful ruler of the city, &lt;a href=\"Grandeya%20Nuwarrah\"&gt;Grandeya Nuwarrah&lt;/a&gt;, who had been put in the stocks at the palace grounds. After the Grandeya was liberated, the resistance took over the palace courtyard, and the Covenant troop entered the palace to take out &lt;a href=\"Sadas%20Secundus\"&gt;Sadas Secundus&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the local Legion force. The soldier was originally paralyzed, and when they recovered, Maradem had entered the palace in his Imperial armor, attempting to kill the soldier, but failed. Secundus was then killed by the troop, and Hallin's Stand was liberated.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperials had taken over &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;, a city on the border of Bangkorai. These Legionnaires were in league with the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, a cult dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperials had managed to conqeur the city through an old smuggling tunnel linking Bangkorai to Satakalaam. This tunnel ended up in the house of &lt;a href=\"Magnifico%20Khorshad\"&gt;Magnifico Khorshad&lt;/a&gt;, who had collaborated with the Imperials, as refusal to collaborate would have been to no avail. The Daggerfall Covenant had started a siege on the city, but did not dare to assault, as the Imperials had taken citizens captive. Because King &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; of Hammerfell did not want blood on his hands, these troops could not attack the city, as the Imperials would kill their captives if the army attempted to attack.&lt;ref name=\"DwThoda/\"&gt;Dialogue with &lt;a href=\"General%20Thoda\"&gt;General Thoda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An undercover Covenant troop entered the city and freed the hostages. After this, the soldier blew up the smuggling tunnel, and the Covenant army liberated the city.\nThe Imperials would make their last stand at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, where they had set up an active encamptment. Many soldiers entered and left the Hall, and the troops within the camp itself had been dug in for weeks. Imperial troops had largely been killed within the Hall while trying to enter its Chamber of Passage under the command of the Magus-General. When the army did breach the chamber, the Magus-General threatened her troops if they attempted to enter. When the forces under the command of High King Emeric wanted to liberate the Hall of Heroes, Septima Tharn appeared, and used &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the army and capture the High King. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, who had survived the assault, then spoke to scout Nadira, the scout who had located the camp. After explaining the situation, the scout returned to Evermore to obtain another army to save the High King. Within the Hall, the Imperial forces had summoned numerous Daedra, and had set up units to defend the location. Septima Tharn had taken High King Emeric to the Chamber of Passage, and killed him in order to take his soul to the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;. This would turn out to be a plot by Septima Tharn in order to kill the Vestige, as she knew the Vestige had held the Daggerfall Covenant together at every turn. Septima unleashed armies of spirit warriors, which she had learned to summon through the aid of one of her mages studying &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;'s notes. But the attacks were to no avail, as the Vestige killed them all. Septima then attempted to kill the Vestige herself, only to fail in the attempt. While Septima was being defeated, Queen Arzhela of Evermore had assembled another army of Lion Guard, and liberated the Hall of Heroes, effectively defeating the Seventh Legion.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Seventh Legion was known to have accompanied &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; on his &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Akavir\"&gt;ill-fated journey&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; in a conquest to annex it into the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Both the Seventh Legion and the Tenth Legion would end up being entirely destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; assault at the end of the invasion.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Seventh Legion, along with the &lt;a href=\"Fifteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Fifteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt; defended &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; came to sack it. Following the sacking of Orsinium, the two Legions put themselves in harms way to get the survivors to safety in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Vestige must enter the portals, find &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sigil Stones&lt;/a&gt; and destroy them. All three of them lead to the same place, called &lt;a href=\"The%20Refuge%20of%20Dread\"&gt;The Refuge of Dread&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first portal is just behind them, before the gates leading to Firsthold Courtyard. To get to the Sigil Stone, one has to light four braziers. The barrier keeping the Stone safe will dissolve.

One of them is on the eastern side, the other on western. No matter which is taken first, the Vestige will have to fight their way to them. On the eastern one, the Vestige will have to survive through fire traps and fight some &lt;a href=\"Mezelukhebruz\"&gt;Mezelukhebruz&lt;/a&gt; before they can get to the Sigil Stone. After the stone has been destroyed, the Vestige will once again, reappear in front of the portal. In the western portal, the Vestige will just have to fight Daedra to get to the Stone. This Stone will be guarded by a Daedra named &lt;a href=\"Marrow\"&gt;Marrow&lt;/a&gt; who has to be defeated in order to destroy the Sigil Stone. The Vestige will reappear in front of the portal once the Stone has been destroyed.\nNow, the Vestige must find Razum-dar. He can be found near Firsthold Castle's entrance.

Seyda Neen is built on a couple small islands and as a result, the town is made into a port under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The town square is a dirt path with surrounding houses and the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise%20Office\"&gt;Census and Excise Office&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Next to the office is the singular port. Behind some houses are some shacks for poorer citizens.

But when things went wrong, one of the adventurers fled to Seyda Neen. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; met up with them at Seyda Neen and is sent to the tomb to finish the job. Slavers began to operate out of the town around the time the Vestige arrived, and the lighthouse was mysteriously shutdown, by the order of the Deputy Governor. The Vestige investigated the &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually raided &lt;a href=\"Firemoth%20Island\"&gt;Firemoth&lt;/a&gt;, and cleared them out. It turned out &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Omellian\"&gt;Governor Omellian&lt;/a&gt; was promoting slavery, and was in league with the group.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Vvardenfell and Seyda Neen by order of &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; himself. After registering at the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise%20Office\"&gt;Census and Excise Office&lt;/a&gt;, they ventured to the city of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; to report to &lt;a href=\"Caius%20Cosades\"&gt;Caius Cosades&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, the Nerevarine took a boat from Seyda Neen to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Firemoth\"&gt;Fort Firemoth&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Firemoth\"&gt;Firemoth&lt;/a&gt; isles to recover a shield.\nAn expedition by &lt;a href=\"Rolard%20Nordssen\"&gt;Rolard Nordssen&lt;/a&gt; with assistance of his interpreter Tuen Panai and the Imperial garrison set out from here for their voyage to the Ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kemel-Ze\"&gt;Kemel-Ze&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeyda Neen, along with other major settlements in Vvardenfell were destroyed when &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted.

{"id": "1962", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1962", "title": "Seyda Neen (Morrowind)", "text": "Seyda Neen is a town in .\nDescription.\nIt is a small &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; port town in the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, on the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; region. It is considered the \"Gateway to Vvardenfell,\" because it is the closest settlement to the mainland of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and because it is the only location on Vvardenfell with a lighthouse. Although it is technically located on the Bitter Coast, it is close to the cosmopolitan area of the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Travel by &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; is available, and the roads lead east to &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nUnlike the other towns along the Bitter Coast, Seyda Neen has a large outlander population and a more \"continental\" style of architecture. The headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise%20Office%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Census and Excise Office&lt;/a&gt; in the Vvardenfell District is located here, to help with the monitoring of criminal activity along the \"Smuggler's Coast\" and recording of all people and merchandise that pass through the port. The overall quality of life appears to be lower than that in the Ascadian Isles region, but much better than other areas of the Bitter Coast. Many people, most often the outlanders, live in small, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;-style, houses. The other half of the town, chiefly &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, live in shacks.\nThe greater part of the town is located on a tiny island, connected by a short walking bridge to the mainland; the water separating the island is shallow and is easily waded across. The northern part of the island, which is raised just slightly above the level of the rest, features the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise%20Office%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Census and Excise Office&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrille%27s%20Tradehouse\"&gt;Arrille's Tradehouse&lt;/a&gt;, and Cyrodiil-style residences. A small spit of land, with a lower elevation, lies just west from this raised portion. It features a few huts grouped around some tall trees and a small, swampy pool.\nJutting out to the south is the \"wild\" portion of Seyda Neen, featuring the lighthouse and some otherwise undeveloped land around it. Muck pools, mushrooms, trees and rocks are here. &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Cliff Racers&lt;/a&gt; can be found here, occasionally.\nThe mainland area of Seyda Neen features only two homes and a roadsign that points to west to &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt;, and east to &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Just to the east of the town, still within its limits, is a huge rock with a platform that serves as the local &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; station.\nGeography.\nSeyda Neen is located on two islands both connected by a short bridge. Due to being surrounded by the sea, Seyda Neen also has some swamps just outside the town. One swamp is located just beyond the lighthouse. It contains &lt;a href=\"Slough%20Fern\"&gt;Slough Fern&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Luminous%20Russula%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Luminous Russula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Coprinus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Violet Coprinus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bungler%27s%20Bane%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bungler's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, trees with numerous vines hanging from them, rocks, mucky ponds with hollow tree stumps and &lt;a href=\"Draggle%20Tails\"&gt;Draggle Tails&lt;/a&gt;. The second island has a similar looking swamp, being much larger and home to more enemies."}

This is where the most talented mages of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; come to learn, share a common origin, and become leaders in the magical community. Your journey begins here.\nFor many, the journey to master magic is fraught with frustration and difficulty. The training provided here can lead to a life of service and rewarding work, thanks to the availability of the best teachers and teaching methods. The fact of the matter is, while everyone invited to the Academy is selected for their potential for greatness, not all of you will measure up to the task before you. For those unfortunate enough to fail, Shad Astula serves as a safety net, a place to refine one's meager skills without causing harm to oneself or to others.\nBut you will not fail. You are not one of the unfortunates. You will rise above. You will take your place as a leader in the Ebonheart Pact!\nYou have already realized that you are different from others who can wield the gift of magicka. Now, prepare to be introduced to a world of power. For you, Shad Astula serves as a place where you can spread your wings. With the help of our staff of master mages, you will not only learn to fly, you will soar!\nAs one of the chosen of the Academy, the usual restrictions and rules that govern the learning of magic do not apply to you. Those rules exist to ensure the safety of mages who may pose a danger to themselves or to others. We anticipate that the Academy's select students will excel, and we believe you're capable of learning your limits quickly. A few guidelines do apply, however:\n\u2014 Do not summon creatures from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion planes&lt;/a&gt;, except within designated summoning circles.\n\u2014 Magical experimentation on other Academy students is forbidden.\n\u2014 Magical experimentation on non-Academy members is discouraged, but use your best judgment.\n\u2014 Magical experimentation on staff is encouraged. Keep them on their guard, and they'll do the same for you.\n\u2014 Designation of assistants as \"minions\" is strictly prohibited, and cultist or cabalist behaviors or organizations will be dealt with swiftly and harshly. Save your megalomania for after graduation.\n\u2014 Students who have not passed the Emotional Control and Mental Stability Exam (ECMSE) are forbidden from sharing a room.\n\u2014 Magical dueling is strictly prohibited, except under a staff &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;'s supervision.\nYou will soon receive an appointment with the Headmaster, who will have more to say about Shad Astula and your status as a member of the Academy. In the meantime, feel free to explore the campus and introduce yourself to your fellow students. Some will become your peers, others your underlings, and a very select few your betters. Learn them well.\nWelcome to Shad Astula. Spread your wings and soar! We expect much of you. Do not disappoint us."}

Note that knife fighting and defense are not covered in this class.\n&lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;DESTRUCTION&lt;/a&gt; I: As a prelude to later studies, students learn the basics of the elemental manipulation of flame and frost.

Upon completion of an introductory class, the student is eligible to pursue a second introductory class, if instruction time and class size allows.\nThe study of the ARCANE ARTS awaits you!

It consists of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Battlemage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion Battlemages&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, every Legion cohort has a cadre of Imperial &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s. The cohort of Imperial Battlemages is commanded by a Battlemage Palatine. On occasions, Battlemages can also lead scouting patrols. The highest ranking Imperial Battlemages who still take to the field are known as Battlemage Tribunes.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance War, the Shadow Legion had affiliated itself with the various Imperial Legions across the crumbled Empire. Within Cyrodiil, its warmages and sorcerors set up encampments in the wilds to combat the forces of the three &lt;a href=\"Alliances\"&gt;Alliances&lt;/a&gt;. Other Imperial mages affiliated themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; and invaded &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. These wizards would use their magical powers to summon &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to take over the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, and were also involved in the capture of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onsi%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Onsi's Breath&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally, after conquering the Garrison, the leader of the assault, Magus-General Septima Tharn, had arranged plans with the duke of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Renchant\"&gt;Duke Renchant&lt;/a&gt;, to take over the city peacefully, though she did plan on enslaving the populace. Duke Renchant agreed to the plan, fearing a &lt;a href=\"Reachman\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; invasion, and being ignorant of the Imperial's plans to enslave the people. Upon discovering this plan, the Duke was removed from his position of power, and the original queen of the city, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Arzhela\"&gt;Queen Arzhela&lt;/a&gt;, took the throne. Later, in a supposed parley, Septima demanded the unconditional surrender of the city. Arzhela refused, and attempted to murder the general, only to discover Septima had used an &lt;a href=\"illusion\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt; to portray herself, rather than meeting the queen in person. Due to Arzhela's attempted assault, the general ordered her Seventh Legion to attack, the Imperial Battlemages ensuring their passage by creating portals.\nWhen the Imperials were being pushed back from the Bangkorai Garrison, the Imperial wizards did the best they could, originally slowing down the Covenant forces by casting firebolts at Covenant troops in the courtyard, until they were pushed back to the crypts in the garrison. The wizards held the bridge leading to the crypt, attacking Covenant forces with firebolts. Imperial &lt;a href=\"Battlemage%20Papus\"&gt;Battlemage Papus&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the local battlemages, unleashed a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; in a last attempt to stop the Covenant forces, only to be killed by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. The Anchor was destroyed and the Garrison liberated, with what remained of the Imperial forces being taken captive.\nWithin Hallin's Stand, the Imperial forces kept an eye on the local populace, as the Imperial invasion was generally frowned upon. Aside from this, the battlemages did not do a lot in the settlement. At Onsi's Breath, the Imperial sorcerors and soldiers were under the command of &lt;a href=\"Panthius%20Varro\"&gt;Panthius Varro&lt;/a&gt;, who himself was an Imperial Battlemage, too. These forces were tasked with conquering the wealthy mine, and using its resources for the arms and armor the Legion needed. Due to a lack of workers, the Imperials conscripted part of the populace to work in the mines. When the mining operation got sabotaged, Legion battlemages were present on the site to deal with the Vestige, who was responsible, though they were defeated. Shortly after, the commander of the Imperials got killed, and the miners entered an open revolt, attempting to rid themselves of Imperial rule.\nThe Magus-General of the Seventh Legion, &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; would eventually meet her end in the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; afterlife. She was hoping to raise a large army of the undead by entering the afterlife and binding the spirits to her. While she was doing so, part of the Legion and its battlemages had set up camp outside the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Hall of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; and secured the location as best they could, only to be defeated by a Covenant assault.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the late-Second Era, the Imperial Battlemages were located in the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where they defended the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s invading army. Despite their attempts, Septim's army proved too strong a force, and the Heartlands were conquered.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Torradan%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Torradan ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile most of the Legion was occupied fighting the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, a pirate gang known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;s started raiding the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the Usurper's defeat, a Commodore by the name of &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; turned his attention on the pirate gang. Umbranox was provided with many resources to end the pirates, despite the heavy cost of the war against the Usurper. The Commodore slowly started to take back the hundreds of islands occupied by the Red Sabres, executing and imprisoning pirates involved with the gang. After four years, the Commodore had found Captain ap Dugal, and a naval clash took place. After many ships were sunk, only the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt; and Umbranox's flagship remained intact. Umbranox had mages of the Legion on his ship, and used them during his attack on the pirates. The mages chanted a spell, and entombed the Black Flag in a cave of boulders of what had been a cliffside just a few moments before.\nInvasion of Akavir.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Akavir\"&gt;Invasion of Akavir&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Battlemages were also involved. Their first deeds during the war were to provide the invasion force with &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; reconnaissance, as the normal Legions lacked cavalry to scout the land. In the winter season of &lt;a href=\"3E%20288\"&gt;3E 288&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20289\"&gt;289&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Far%20East%20Fleet\"&gt;Far East Fleet&lt;/a&gt; was prevented from returning to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; due to the duration and severity of the season. The Battlemages reported this to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Matters would grow worse, as due to the severity of the winter the rations of the &lt;a href=\"Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; grew tight, and many of the foraging missions were cut down by &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; raiders. With many of the Imperial &lt;a href=\"forts\"&gt;forts&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Ionith\"&gt;Ionith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Septimia\"&gt;Septimia&lt;/a&gt; being captured by the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, communications between the two settlements had to be performed through magic, a continuing strain on the Battlemages. During &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; 3E 289, the Far East Fleet had been devastated by storms at sea. Due to this, the majority of the Imperial Battlemages were ordered to board the ships to combat the weather, at the order of the Emperor. With most of the Battlemages now on the fleet, communications between Tamriel and Akavir became limited, and what remained of the Battlemages had to use their powers to their limits in order to see to the needs of the Legions. At the same time the Battlemages on Akavir reported their magic being much weaker than usual. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"War%20College\"&gt;War College&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil reported communication problems, as the Battlemages in Cyrodiil had trouble linking with their compatriots on Akavir. Even communications between master and pupil of long training. As such, following the invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; urged the War College to make a study in regards to the arcane powers of the Tsaesci, should the Empire come in conflict with them again.\nMid-Sun's Height, after a successful ambush on Tsaesci forces by the Emperor, the Tsaesci counterattacked, resulting in many losses among the legions, and the settlements of Ionith and Septimia both being besieged. The power of the few remaining Battlemages was at this time focused solely on creating water to keep the army alive, a skill not normally emphasized at the War College. Good news did exist for the legions, as the Battlemages which had returned with the Far East Fleet had enabled it to return safely to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harbor\"&gt;Black Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, hope was raised as the Legion Battlemages came in contact with the Emperor's Battlemage, who reported the Emperor was still alive and held out. The army made plans to break out of Ionith and fall back on Septimia, where the Far East Fleet would carry the army back to Tamriel. When the fleet arrived, Septimia was under heavy assault by a large Tsaesci army. The battlemages on the fleet used their magic to fight off the Tsaesci long enough for what remained of the Legion to board the Fleet and sail away.\nLate-Third Era.\nLater in the Third Era, the Shadow Legion was recorded to have used the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;, a building connecting the planes of Oblivion, for training, prior to its destruction. The Legion is further located at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, where the Battlemages serve as guards, and were also said to have been housed in the Imperial Battle College, in &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. They also aided in finding out the people responsible for the murder of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome years before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Shadow Legion were attempting to uncover hidden power within an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; pillar. The pillar had great power, being able to strike a person dead on the spot, though it only worked outdoors. The Legion called in wizards from the Mages Guild, of which several were injured while trying to tune the stone, eventually successfully tuning it to shock magic. Through research they discovered that the only way to access the power was by having a &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;. If done correctly, the user would obtain a &lt;a href=\"Finger%20of%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;powerful spell&lt;/a&gt;. During the Oblivion Crisis, the Shadow Legion was called upon by &lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Lex\"&gt;Hieronymus Lex&lt;/a&gt;, a guard captain of the Imperial City, to search for the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Fox\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the Shadow Legion being charged with guard duty at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; used this opportunity to steal &lt;a href=\"Hrormir%27s%20Icestaff\"&gt;Hrormir's Icestaff&lt;/a&gt; from the Arch-Mage's quarters. Because of this, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; ordered Captain Lex to send the Battlemages back to the University to keep it safe.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;battlemages&lt;/a&gt; were used in locations such as &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, where they fought against &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. An ex-legion Battlemage, veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madena\"&gt;Madena&lt;/a&gt;, made her home in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of mages.\nThe Shadow Legion has various different kinds of mages, specializing in different tasks:\nWithin Cyrodiil, Imperial Necromancers are provided with the corpses of traitors and criminals, providing them with a fresh supply of corpses, most of which are young, strong, and intact. Imperial Battlemages, &lt;a href=\"spellsword\"&gt;spellsword&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nightblade\"&gt;nightblade&lt;/a&gt;s, and various other magical support troops are trained to use staves for combat. They are also trained in the usage of blunt &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;ry."}

It was powerful enough to rival even the legendary &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadow Magic could be used to create &lt;a href=\"Shadowgates\"&gt;Shadowgates&lt;/a&gt;, that could be opened using &lt;a href=\"Shadowkey\"&gt;Shadowkey&lt;/a&gt;s. Shadows could be absorbed to strengthen one's self, or could be molded in to physical forms, such as weapons. Shadow Magic could also be used to visit other realms, to assist alternative versions of yourself and request their aid.\nShadowmages are also capable of draining the lifeforce and health from their foes.\nShadowmages could, however, be twisted by the very nature of the Shadow Magic, and for that reason Shadowmages were largely distrusted.\nHistory.\nAfter the discovery of shadow properties, &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt; tried to merge all the possible worlds created by shadows in to one, so he would exist in all worlds. His ritual was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, who feared his power. Azra lost control of the magic, and it caused an explosion. A crater remained that could still be seen at &lt;a href=\"Azra%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Azra's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadow Magic also played an important role in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;, which created an entity known as Umbra' Keth, or the Shadow of Conflict. Multiple parties, such as &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; and Pergan Asuul, attempted to gain control of the shadow. But the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Azra%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Hero of Azra's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, being assisted by &lt;a href=\"Skelos%20Undriel\"&gt;Skelos Undriel&lt;/a&gt; and Azra Nightwielder, was able to collect the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt; and use them to destroy the Umbra' Keth and defeat Pergan Asuul.\nAt the trial of Vivec he used his shadow along with &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"neonymic\"&gt;neonymic&lt;/a&gt; to bind her."}

Get me another one!\"\nNecromancer 1: \"Remove the eyes, keep the sinews...\"\nNecromancer 2: \"That's not the right dagger...\"\nAdvancing further, the Hero encounters the Necromancers, who upon spotting the Hero state the following:\nNecromancer 2: \"See? I told you there was someone here! Augh! We don't have time for this! Stay and fight, I'll finish the ritual!\"\nNecromancer 1: \"But we said you would fight!\"\nNecromancer 2: \"This is too important!\"\nAfter the conversation, a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; is summoned, which the Hero has to defeat. Approaching the Necromancer results in him stating the following:\n\"\"You... you shouldn't be here!\nAdvancing further, the Hero encounters two more &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Guardian%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Skeleton Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, as well as three &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Ghost\"&gt;Manor Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, both of which are hostile. Advancing into the side passage, the Hero will find a silver chest, being protected by two Skeleton Guardians. Behind the closed door on the left is a weapon rack, activation of which will unlock the secret passage, where a golden chest is hidden. Advancing further along the main path, the Hero will come to an open space, where the second Necromancer is located, protected by two more Skeleton Guardians. Approaching the Necromancer triggers the following conversation:\n\"Damn it! Useless peassant! I have to do everything myself...\"\nUpon defeating the final Necromancer, the quest is completed."}

This must have amused the &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;trickster god&lt;/a&gt;, because he sent one of his seven shadows to brush the strings of the young man's &lt;a href=\"lyre\"&gt;lyre&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, such deals always come with a price. While the young man could inspire lustful passion, his songs stoked equally jealous fury in cuckolded rivals. For a time the young bard's luck held out and even provided him material for tales of challenges, duels, and midnight escapes.\nBut luck is a wheel that turns and it turned on him. He was killed and the lyre passed to another. Sooner or later another musician discovered how to activate its secret and met the same eventual fate. So the cycle repeated itself over the centuries.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; has thoroughly tested and warded the Shadow of Rahjin since acquiring it, those wishing to play the lyre do so at their own risk."}

He hid the artifact in &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; catacomb. To get to the Amulet of Kings, you must first acquire the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; at the tombs of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, and at the tombs of the &lt;a href=\"Remans\"&gt;Remans&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Location%29\"&gt;The Harborage&lt;/a&gt; is the same for all &lt;a href=\"alliances\"&gt;alliances&lt;/a&gt;. However, the closest city will change based on the chosen faction.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter receiving Varen's call, the Vestige is informed that it is finally time to recover the legendary and sacred Amulet of Kings, hidden with the efforts of Sai Sahan in the long forgotten Sancre Tor.\nVaren explains that the city was built by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Alessia\"&gt;Queen Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, and is located in &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, his homeland. Due to the harrowing experiences that aged and diminished him, he is not able to give much information about it. For that, Sai Sahan informs the Vestige that Sancre Tor was a long forgotten city where heroes were buried. The Amulet was protected with &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;'s ward, and only using his ring, acquired in the last encounter with the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt;, they could reach the sacred artifact.\nAfter entering the portal opened by Varen, the Vestige, &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; and Sai Sahan venture into Sancre Tor, an ancient forgotten catacomb adorned with several statues and graves of past heroes and emperors. Arriving in the large room, the very first one, the heroes encounter the vile &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; in a large and not proportional projection of himself.\nThe Worm Cult leader explains he has always been watching them after they left the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Valley of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and only for that they have escaped. Unleashing a powerful spell, Mannimarco subdues Sahan and questions him about the Amulet of Kings just like in those years of torture in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; resists, in response to the apparent loyalty of Mannimarco to the Lord of Schemes, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, Tharn provokes him to reveal his true colors.\nAfter agreeing with Sahan that they should find the Amulet before Mannimarco does, the group heads towards south to the Sancre Tor interior and the Inner Chamber.\nThe inner chamber.\nOnce again as a projection, The Worm King admits he wants the Amulet of Kings to overthrow Molag Bal, by capturing his soul into the Amulet of Kings, and succeed him as the new Lord of Schemes and Brutality, starting a new reign of terror over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, the very ward of Stendarr is the veil that impedes Molag Bal from interfering and even knowing what was happening.\nHere, the heroes face some Worm Cultists and a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bone Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, with usual skeletons. After defeating them, they continue to the Inner Chamber, where Sai Sahan asks for a break for him to rest. It's optional to talk to Titanborn, but if done so, she will mention not only a sentiment of revenge against Mannimarco but also that she and Sahan are stoical, and never talk about what they really feel, but maybe someday.\nAfter talking to Sai Sahan and pushing him forward, the group heads to the Dragonguard Tomb.\nEnter the Dragonguard Tomb.\nThe main objective of the chamber is to reach the brazier and perform the ritual do Stendarr. To do so, the group must pass a series of gates and defeat several undead warriors, former allies of Sai Sahan reanimated by Mannimarco. Heading in the very direction of the arrow gets the Vestige to the brazier location, where the ritual must be performed.\nThe Reman Vault puzzle.\nHeading back to the Inner Tomb, now making way to the Reman Vault. There a seemingly tricky puzzle awaits, one that holds the bridge high, and it needs to be put low. Four levers are activated, where one interferes into another. To solve the puzzle, activate the third lever, then the second, and finally the first. After lowering the bridge and lighting the brazier, ghosts will appear.\nContinue to the Vault Antechamber.\nHeading towards the Vault of Kings, the group faces more of Mannimarco's minions.\nEnter the Vault of Kings.\nAfter being informed with Sai Sahan about how to open the doors to the Vault of Kings, the Vestige uses the Ring of Stendarr to open them.\nEntering the sacred vault, the group is confronted one last time by Mannimarco, now in person. Mannimarco uses quick magical attacks from long range, and despite not being his toughest one, he charges a powerful blow that can repel the Vestige away from him in a long distance. Also, conjures a beacon of light that allows him to teleport and avoid damage, without forgetting his minions.\nMannimarco is killed, but his soul counts on the last laugh. Suddenly, a &lt;a href=\"dark%20anchor\"&gt;dark anchor&lt;/a&gt; appears atop of all present and the voice of Molag Bal condemns Mannimarco's plot to betray him. His huge demonic hand grasps into the Worm King and takes him into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige and the group are free to finally take the Amulet of Kings.\nTalk to Varen Aquilarios.\nReturning from the portal, the Vestige finishes the quest by talking to Varen, who almost pities Mannimarco's fate. He asks once more for a time of rest, for now they have the sacred amulet and can be more secure. Yet, the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; must be stopped once and for all."}

The zone is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to the west. The &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; is in control of Black Marsh, but there is a large presence of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in the region trying to take the province, and a powerful artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt;, for themselves.\nBackground.\nA fetid, rank, and treacherous mire, Shadowfen has a history of &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; occupation and the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; trade, and the region was often fought over between the two sides prior to the formation of the Ebonheart Pact. The Argonian &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;, administers Argonian affairs above the \"tribal level\" in Black Marsh, and is the keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Hatching%20Pools\"&gt;Hatching Pools&lt;/a&gt; in central Shadowfen. Although the Argonian slave trade was outlawed after the formation of the Ebonheart Pact, rogue Dunmeri slave traders, particularly from &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, can still be found roaming the marshes.\nThe ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; is located in Shadowfen, the source of the devastating &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. Shadowfen has a variety of indigenous species: &lt;a href=\"Wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wamasu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Snake%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Giant Snakes&lt;/a&gt;, the extinct &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fleshflies\"&gt;Fleshflies&lt;/a&gt;. Diseases such as &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Fever\"&gt;Swamp Fever&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Droops\"&gt;Droops&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Rot\"&gt;Blood Rot&lt;/a&gt; are common here, making Shadowfen one of the most dangerous regions in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Dank foliage, murky, winding channels, &lt;a href=\"Hist%20trees\"&gt;Hist trees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt; and ruined temples are abundant in Shadowfen.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s, Argonians born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shadow\"&gt;the Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes taken into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, can be found in this zone.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Shadowfen and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nShadowfen features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Ebonheart Pact's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Shadowfen. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Shadowfen totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Shadowfen and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

It can only be summoned in-game when the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; is used on a card. It has a 3%\u20133.33% chance occurrence rate, taken from a sample of 8 out 250 uses of the Wabbajack.\n&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Heroes of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the \"Heroes of Skyrim\" expansion, &lt;a href=\"Grisly%20Gourmet\"&gt;Grisly Gourmet&lt;/a&gt; can transform an enemy creature with 2 power or less into \"Sweet Roll.\"\nTechnical version.\nCards like &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Altar of Despair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chanter%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Chanter of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Genius%20Pathmage\"&gt;Genius Pathmage&lt;/a&gt; can create a Sweet Roll when there is no cards with proper cost. This versions have a different text on it: \"When a creature eats Sweet Roll, heal that creature. (There were no creatures to fetch, so we gave you this.)\".\nStrategy.\nThe Sweet Roll is not a card to often be expected, having a very low chance of being summoned. If the opponent has the Wabbajack, there is a good chance they will use it on a more powerful enemy, and should you be stuck with a Sweet Roll, it is best to make the most of the situation.\nThe Sweet Roll can be destroyed easily, and cards like &lt;a href=\"Skaven%20Pyromancer\"&gt;Skaven Pyromancer&lt;/a&gt; that deal weak but widespread damage can render it useless.\nTo use the Sweet Roll effectively, it is suggested to use it on a wounded creature with high stats. This is also the suggested route when dealing with opponents who have &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; decks, as a number of cards can instantly destroy wounded creatures. The Sweet Roll is also a reasonable card to sacrifice, usually with the cards &lt;a href=\"Cruel%20Firebloom%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Cruel Firebloom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Split\"&gt;Soul Split&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are pastries with a light brown sweetbread as the lower part, with icing covering the top. Sweetrolls are typically made from milk, flour, butter, eggs, and salt. In &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; they resemble a Gugelhopf cake.\nGames.\nArena.\nThe Sweetroll is a staple for many of &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda's&lt;/a&gt; games, and could be considered a running gag. The joke itself originated in where, at the beginning of the game, one of the &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;-determining questions is:\n\"While in town the baker gives you a sweetroll. Delighted you take it into an alleyway to enjoy, only to be intercepted by a gang of three kids your age. The leader demands the sweetroll, or else he and his friends will beat you and take it.\"\nDaggerfall and Morrowind.\nThe same question appears with slight variation in and to determine starting &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; levels. The following quote and three options appear:\n\"While in town the baker gives you a sweetroll. Delighted, you take it into an alley to enjoy, only to be intercepted by a gang of three kids your age. The leader demands the sweetroll, or else he and his friends will beat you and take it.\"\nOblivion.\nFor the first time in the series, sweetrolls have been implemented as an edible food item. Occasionally, in &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, if a character is asked about &lt;a href=\"rumors\"&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt;, they talk about &lt;a href=\"Salmo\"&gt;Salmo&lt;/a&gt;'s sweetrolls. Then they will say, \"One time I took a sweetroll into an alleyway to eat when three thugs jumped out at me. So I took the sweetroll and...\" in reference to its usage in previous titles. Salmo himself will also comment about the quality of his sweetrolls. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Fimmion\"&gt;Fimmion&lt;/a&gt; in has a notable obsession with the treat and will ask for one during related quests.\nSkyrim.\nThe sweetroll phenomenon also appears in . When the Dragonborn passes &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, on occasion they are known to make comical voices towards the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; while saying, \"Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll?,\" where the possible intention is to make fun of the Dragonborn by making them seem weak, or even more likely be a joke about the starting questions in \"Arena\" and \"Daggerfall\". &lt;a href=\"Dagny\"&gt;Dagny&lt;/a&gt; will regularly comment on the poor quality of the sweetrolls in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and children will occasionally chase one another around while saying, \"Give me back my sweetroll!\" &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; will also randomly comment, \"Cicero is hungry, need a sweetroll...or a carrot.\" In the DLC in &lt;a href=\"Glover%20Mallory\"&gt;Glover Mallory&lt;/a&gt;'s basement there are several sweetrolls beside the loot on the table. This is most likely a reference to the Hold Guard's remarks, as Glover was once a thief. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; has a chance of turning it's target into a sweetroll.\nOnline.\nSweetrolls can be crafted in with honey, flour, and other grains. Additionally, a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ennia\"&gt;Ennia&lt;/a&gt; will comment to the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, \"Let me guess. You're looking for some place to buy sweetrolls.\" as a parody of the Hold Guards' line in \"Skyrim\". Guards will also comment, \"I love to crush skulls and eat sweetrolls, and I've no more sweetrolls,\" in reference to ' and subsequently '.\nOther characters will comment about how desirable sweetrolls are in general; for example there is &lt;a href=\"Javierre%20Mathierry\"&gt;Javierre Mathierry&lt;/a&gt;, who calls them \"delicious,\" and &lt;a href=\"Harcourt%20Rernis\"&gt;Harcourt Rernis&lt;/a&gt;, who laments Javierre eating the last one. There is also a purchasable &lt;a href=\"Sorrel%20Horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; whose default name is \"Sweetroll.\"\nIn areas added with the DLC, sweetrolls can now be found as obtainable items without the need for crafting. Most of them are considered private property, meaning that if one takes them, it will be considered stealing. This is likely a reference to the quote \"Let me guess, someone stole your sweetroll?\". In the DLC, sweetrolls are involved in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Sweetroll%20Killer\"&gt;The Sweetroll Killer&lt;/a&gt;,\" where a serial killer has been planting sweetrolls at the sites of their latest murder victims.\nLegends.\nSweet Rolls have a small chance to be summoned in , when the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; is used on a creature. It turns into a weak token card with 0 attack and 1 defense points, with its only default use being to heal creatures that eat it. Its race is the humorous \"Pastry\" race, of which it is the only member. Loading Screens tease at the Wabbajack having a small chance to turn enemies into delicious food.\nAdditionally, they may be summoned when either &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Despair\"&gt;Altar of Despair&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Genius%20Pathmage\"&gt;Genius Pathmage&lt;/a&gt; are used to 'summon' a creature from the player's deck, when they have no properly-costed creature to match. Lastly, the card &lt;a href=\"Grisly%20Gourmet\"&gt;Grisly Gourmet&lt;/a&gt; will transform a creature with 2 or less attack into a sweetroll.\nBlades.\nSweetrolls are food items which may be found in various fort dungeons in .\nFallout.\nIn a cross-over reference, sweetrolls are present within the \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3AFallout%3AFallout%20series\"&gt;Fallout&lt;/a&gt;\" universe, another game series developed by Bethesda.\n&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%203\"&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%203\"&gt;Fallout 3&lt;/a&gt;\", there is a scene acted out for the phenomenon. At the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3ALone%20Wanderer\"&gt;player's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AGrowing%20Up%20Fast\"&gt;10th birthday party&lt;/a&gt;, a kind &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3ALucy%20Palmer\"&gt;old lady&lt;/a&gt; gives you a &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3ASweetroll\"&gt;sweetroll&lt;/a&gt;. When the birthday cake is ruined, the &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AButch%20DeLoria\"&gt;local bully&lt;/a&gt; attempts to coerce you into giving him the sweetroll. Most responses will result in him punching the player until security steps in.\n&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%20Shelter\"&gt;Fallout Shelter&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%20Shelter\"&gt;Fallout Shelter&lt;/a&gt;\", characters will sometimes comment, \"Someone stole my sweetroll!,\" and another will reply either, \"That's terrible! You just don't mess with a person's sweetroll...\" or, \"My goodness! Who could have done such a thing! *burp*.\"\n&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%204\"&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AFallout%204\"&gt;Fallout 4&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3ASweet%20roll\"&gt;sweetroll&lt;/a&gt;s can be found throughout the wasteland. A considerable number of them can be found inside &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AMean%20Pastries\"&gt;Mean Pastries&lt;/a&gt;, a pre-war bakery. A &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3AClassic%20sweetroll\"&gt;version&lt;/a&gt; similar to the Skyrim item was added as a consumable item in the \"Fallout 4\" &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3ACreation%20Club\"&gt;Creation Club&lt;/a&gt; content \"&lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Afallout%3ACoffee%20and%20Donuts%20Workshop%20Pack\"&gt;Coffee and Donuts Workshop Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Focus on it alone, and you will defeat every weapon\u2014you will outreach daggers, roll from under heavy hammer blows, and deflect the arrows of your foe. If you are distracted from the blade's way, you will only be confused and the path to mastery will disappear beneath your feet.\"\nAnother asked, \"Master, why must we do the same drills every day?\"\nThe Master replied, \"You still think like the thirsty jackal that runs toward a mirage. He collapses in the sands, though he would have found the hidden stream if only he searched the rocks he sprinted past! Focus on the task before you, and perfection follows. Do not think of what you might do tomorrow, but think only of perfecting each exercise as it is assigned. In this way, you will come to grow as one with your weapon.\"\nAnd so they continued, the Master sharing his wisdom of long years with the youths. After many questions, he noticed one student squirming uncomfortably. Irritated by the boy's divided attention, he asked, \"You, what is your question?\"\nThe boy looked up sheepishly as a low growl rumbled from his stomach. \"Master, isn't it time for lunch?\"\nSaikhalar let forth a rare and mirthful laugh. \"Hurry on to the kitchens, then! My wisdom may be great, but it cannot fill hungry bellies!\""}

It turns out that the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt; has begun, and Sheogorath vanishes.\nThe only hope is for someone like the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to become the Madgod and sit on the throne but first they have to reanimate the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Staff of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. For this to happen they need to get the eye of &lt;a href=\"Ciirta\"&gt;Ciirta&lt;/a&gt; and a branch from the Tree of Shades.\nWalkthrough.\nSheogorath's Palace.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Sheogorath's Palace&lt;/a&gt; to speak to Sheogorath. He is in very uncharacteristically poor spirits and says that \"our time has run out.\" His plan has failed, the Greymarch has begun and he is about to become &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe orders the Hero to leave since when he next sees them he will not recognize them and kill them. He answers protests saying that he intended to give them his staff but the life is gone from it. Then he vanishes, screaming in a choked voice \"The Realm is dead! Sheogorath is dead!\" He then reappears for a moment, only to grow many times in size and then vanishes for good.\nSpeak to &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt; and he will say that the only hope left is for someone besides Sheogorath to sit on the throne of the Madgod. If the throne is occupied when Jyggalag attacks, he may not prevail. Haskill says that the Hero is the only person who can become the new Madgod. In order for this to happen someone must reactivate and righteously possess the Staff of Sheogorath, the titular Symbol of Office.\nThe secret of the staff's construction has been lost, but Haskill tells them that by going to &lt;a href=\"Knifepoint%20Hollow\"&gt;Knifepoint Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient library, they may be able to reanimate the staff. He will also give them a crystal that is required to access the library.\nKnifepoint Hollow.\nTravel to Knifepoint Hollow - Haskill will add a map marker. Once inside, follow the marker to a standard door. Activating the door will remove the crystal and shatter the door. &lt;a href=\"Dyus\"&gt;Dyus&lt;/a&gt; is on the other side, seated on an ancient throne. Dyus was the keeper of the Great Library of Jyggalag.\nHe already knows what is happening and sends them to get two items necessary for the staff's recreation. The first is the Eye of Ciirta, which is literally her eye. Ciirta is in &lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Halls\"&gt;The Howling Halls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Heretic%27s%20Horn\"&gt;Heretic's Horn&lt;/a&gt;. The second item is a branch from the Tree of Shades, found inside the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Milchar\"&gt;Milchar&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;, just north of &lt;a href=\"Overlook%20Road\"&gt;Overlook Road&lt;/a&gt;. The items can be gathered in either order.\nHowling Halls.\nTravel to the Howling Halls, where Ciirta's &lt;a href=\"apostle\"&gt;apostle&lt;/a&gt;s await. They are similar to &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zealot\"&gt;zealot&lt;/a&gt;s but wearing their own kind of robes. Initially, they will leave the Hero alone. There are some robes on a table further in but one apostle will have to be fought or sneaked past before reaching it. There are two more apostles in the next room to deal with. There are &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; left on altars as offerings to pick up here.\nOnce reaching the Congregation Chambers, they will meet a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; apostle named &lt;a href=\"Ra%27kheran%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Ra'kheran&lt;/a&gt;. If spoken to he will first say to wear a robe if they already haven't put one on yet and then ask for their help. Regardless of how the conversation goes, Ra'kheran will say that he is part of a group of apostles that wish to overthrow Ciirta in a coup. If the Hero decides to help them, the apostles will take care of Ciirta for them. Like all good revolutionaries, Ra'kheran and his co-conspirators need weapons, specifically, three apostle daggers.\nIf helping them, Ra'kheran's allies must not be killed and the Hero must wear the apostle's robe at all times. If the previous apostles have been slain already, go back and get their two daggers from them. A third dagger can be found on a cupboard just east of the door to the antechamber. When wearing the robe, no one will attack. The &lt;a href=\"Pelvis%20of%20Pelagius\"&gt;Pelvis of Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Oddities\"&gt;oddity&lt;/a&gt;, is near the door to the antechamber.\nWith the three daggers in hand, return to Ra'kheran and he will sprint to his allies. After he arms them, the triumvirate of renegades will rush into the antechamber. If the Hero gets there first, (or if they have chosen to forge ahead without their help) they can have a brief conversation with Ciirta and learn a bit about her history, but will inevitably have to fight her. Her aide, the &lt;a href=\"Luminary%20Kaz\"&gt;Luminary Kaz&lt;/a&gt; will also fight.\nOnce Ciirta is dead, take her Eye and her &lt;a href=\"Ciirta%27s%20Robes\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;. There is loot in the rafters of Ciirta's chamber worth getting.\nMilchar.\nNext, travel to Milchar. Though Milchar is a fairly extensive ruin, skip most of it and head straight into the Grove of Reflection. The door to the Grove is on a wall of the rock/root formation at the center of the map, but may be difficult to see due to the darkness of the dungeon. Using an illumination spell or potion will solve this. The grove is a lush stand of vegetation surrounding a pool of water, with a standing stone in the center.\nGetting close to the stone will activate it. A shadowy doppelganger of the Hero will appear, with the same spells, items, scrolls and skills as they have, however they will also be armed with the mighty weapon &lt;a href=\"Shadowrend%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Shadowrend&lt;/a&gt;, which manifests itself as either a matte black Daedric battleaxe or a similarly colored claymore version of the Dragonsword of Lainlyn, depending on whether their blunt or blade skill is higher.\nAlthough killing the mirror-self does not seem to increase the bounty, it can attract the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnifepoint Hollow.\nOnce they have both items, travel back to Knifepoint Hollow and speak with Dyus. He will create the staff for them. He then tells them to travel to Tree of Madness in Sheogorath's throne room and tap the tree's power to begin the transformation.\nThis will end the current quest and begin the next, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Roots%20of%20Madness\"&gt;The Roots of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

He was of peasant descent, his mother being a peasant and there is no information on his father other than that he was a miner. His mother died during &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Barenziah's&lt;/a&gt; Rite of Naming, Symmachus being 30 at the time. He reportedly hired a priest to save her life, but when they returned she was dead. When the priest refused to hand back the money given to him, Symmachus threatened him, and as the priest was about to mutter a curse Symmachus struck and killed him, then fled the city, repeatedly muttering the name \"Barenziah.\" He joined the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; afterwards, becoming a General and advisor of Tiber Septim.\nHe met Barenziah during her stint in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, when she was caught while performing a heist at Symmachus' estate in &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, along with her &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; companion &lt;a href=\"Therris\"&gt;Therris&lt;/a&gt; who betrayed her by pushing her into the guards which resulted in her capture. However, despite this, Therris himself was still captured and then drawn and quartered as a way to punish him and to keep Barenziah's past a secret. With her scandalous past in and before the Thieves Guild kept secret, she was sent to meet Tiber Septim at the Imperial Palace by Symmachus, and to take her place as the Queen of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nSymmachus married Barenziah many years after she took her place as the rightful Queen of Mournhold.\u00a0She bore him two children, a boy\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and a girl\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, named after Symmachus' mother. He also rightfully suspected that Jagar Tharn was behind the disappearance of the Staff of Chaos, an event that Barenziah unwillingly had a hand in.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20391\"&gt;3E 391&lt;/a&gt;, Symmachus was killed during a rebellion in Mournhold, his remaining loyal troops suffering a decisive defeat.\nHis glass dagger, the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20of%20Symmachus\"&gt;Dagger of Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, is considered to be an artifact. Symmachus gave it to Helseth\u00a0who in turn gave the dagger to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;."}

After completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Fit%20for%20a%20Jarl\"&gt;Fit for a Jarl&lt;/a&gt;\" and investing in her shop, she becomes a candidate for &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; as well as the only Altmer candidate.\nPersonality.\nLike many Altmer, Taarie comes off as rude, impolite and a bit arrogant when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; talks to her, and often insults them. However, as is suggested through a speech dialogue, Taarie is not intentionally insulting, regarding herself as being honest and forthright. However, overheard conversations with Endarie indicate that she is somewhat more caring for her customers than her sister. If she is married, her dialogue becomes much friendlier though she will retain some haughty aspects.\nShould the Dragonborn kill Taarie, &lt;a href=\"hired%20thugs\"&gt;hired thugs&lt;/a&gt; bearing a contract from Endarie will attack claiming that the Dragonborn must pay for killing her sister.\nTaarie is also an Imperial loyalist and regards the Stormcloaks as traitors, a view she will express if talked to during Roggvir's execution. She will have very little sympathy for Roggvir, wanting to see him executed for treason and expressing a belief that his death should have been slower and more drawn out.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Fit%20for%20a%20Jarl\"&gt;Fit for a Jarl&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon his or her first visit to the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;, she may ask for the Dragonborn to wear an outfit tailored by her thus starting the radiant quest \"Fit for a Jarl.\" She rewards the Dragonborn with the tailored outfit, &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Raiment%20fine%20clothes\"&gt;Radiant Raiment fine clothes&lt;/a&gt; (which can be &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt;) and a leveled amount of gold.\nMarriage.\nUpon completing the \"Fit for a Jarl\" radiant quest and investing in her store, Taarie becomes a marriage option. When married, Taarie \"opens a shop,\" and gives the Dragonborn a profit of 100 each day; every day the profits are not collected, they accumulate. Her dialogue will become much more welcoming and she will no longer comment negatively on the Dragonborn's outfit.\nIf the Dragonborn marries Taarie and uses the Radiant Raiment as a home, her sister Endarie will still continue to suspiciously follow the Dragonborn everywhere in the store. After the marriage, everything in Radiant Raiment will be marked as owned by the Dragonborn and free to take. However, Endarie will still call the guards (who will show up for arrest) if the Dragonborn is seen picking the lock on the lockbox.\nTaarie and Endarie sleep together in a twin bed, despite having two other single beds available. This occurs even after marriage, requiring the Dragonborn to wake Endarie and quickly activate a sleep cycle (to gain Lover's Comfort from Taarie) before she lies down again.\nLike most spouses, she will comment on the city currently being lived in and how it is good for the children, if any. Taarie also has unique dialogue if asked for a Homecooked Meal.\nDialogue.\nIntroduction.\n\"If you ever want to replace those old rags, stop by Radiant Raiment.\"\nFit for a Jarl.\n\"If you're heading to the Blue Palace, you might want to rethink that outfit.\"\nConversations.\nEndarie.\nTaarie: \"Sister dear, could you try sewing those sleeves a little tighter? We can't have our customers looking sloppy because of your work.\"\nEndarie: \"Oh certainly, dear sister. We couldn't afford to have our customers look like the simple pigs they are, now could we?\"\nTaarie: \"Good. And while you're at it, perhaps you should sew your mouth shut when our fine customers are within earshot, hmm?\"\nRoggvir's execution.\nSvari: \"They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it.\"\nAldis: \"Positions.\"\nAddvar: \"Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes.\"\nAldis: \"Lock the city gate.\"\nVivienne: \"You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar.\"\nAddvar: \"You're all heart, Vivienne.\"\nAldis: \"Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg. By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude.\"\nBeirand: \"Traitor!\"\nSorex: \"He doesn't deserve to speak!\"\nRoggvir: \"There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat.\"\nTaarie: \"Liar!\"\nRoggvir: \"Such as our way! Such as the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!\"\nJala: \"Booooo.\"\nSorex: \"Booooo.\"\nVivienne: \"Cut 'em down!\"\nTaarie: \"Booooo.\"\nAldis: \"Guard. Prepare the prisoner.\"\nRoggvir: \"I don't need your help.\"\nAldis: \"Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head.\"\nRoggvir: \"On this day... I go to Sovngarde.\""}

{"id": "6746", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6746", "title": "Etiquette with Rulers", "text": "Etiquette with Rulers is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nBecause the rules are so complex and the stakes are so high, many people blanche at the thought of speaking with a noble with a title. For starters, it is important to address them correctly, for just as no one likes to be misnamed, no one likes to be mistitled. The problem is that in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, traditions of the peerage differ slightly from &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; to region. The base rules follow:\nThere are eight kingdoms in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the following regions: &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt;. If a woman is ruling one of these areas, she is called the Queen. The husband of a Queen and the wife of a King is not necessarily of equal rank -- they may not be Kings and Queens themselves. Their children are Princes and Princesses. Their grandchildren are also Princes and Princesses. If a male ruler dies, his wife takes the title Dowager Queen, providing there is not a Dowager Queen already. Like all rules, there are exceptions. One noted exception took place recently in Daggerfall, when King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; died. In most regions, his wife &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Mynisera&lt;/a&gt; would not have become Dowager Queen of Daggerfall, because Lysandus' mother, the widow &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, still lived. In Daggerfall, however, it is permissable for there to be two persons with the same title. Thus, both Nulfaga and Mynisera have the title Dowager Queen.\nIf a female ruler, who does not share rank with her husband, dies, there is no male equivalent to the word Dowager. Widowers of Queens usually take another title, either a lesser family title or one given by their children. There have been a few men in the history of High Rock who have fallen from being addressed as King to being addressed as Mister at the death of their wife.\nOther regions are ruled by Dukes and Duchesses, Marquises (or Marquesses) and Marquises (or Marchionesses), Counts and Countesses, Viscounts or Viscountesses, Barons or Baronesses, and Lords or Ladies. This list is theoretically listed from highest to lowest rank, but the ruler of a territory outranks all other nobles, regardless of title. &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is a Barony, and the Baron or Baroness of Dwynnen outrank any other noble in that territory, even Dukes and Counts.\nIn theory, (again, this may not be the case according to local custom) the eldest son or daughter of a noble takes their parents highest family title below their parents. Thus, the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Northmoor%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Northmoor&lt;/a&gt;, who is also the Marquis of &lt;a href=\"Calder%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Calder&lt;/a&gt;, had a daughter who became the Marchioness of Calder.\nKings and Queens are always addressed as \"Your Majesty\" in conversation; Dukes and Duchesses, \"Your Grace.\" All other rulers may be addressed with their title and name, or Lord or Lady and their name.\nA few hints may be needed to determine exactly who rules a territory. You may rely on people on the streets to make reference to their ruler, but that may not be enough. After all, if the gossip involved Lord &lt;a href=\"Bemmish\"&gt;Bemmish&lt;/a&gt; and Viscountess &lt;a href=\"Byrd\"&gt;Byrd&lt;/a&gt;, neither or both could be the ruler of the territory. I have found that a more predictable method is to pay some attention to the names of taverns and shops in a region. By tradition, many of these are called \"The Duke's Fox\" or \"The Lady's Provisions.\" This, more often than not, is the name of the ruler. If the shop's name is \"Lady Annisa's Provisions\" or \"Lord Boxworth's Fox,\" that is probably the name of a local titled merchant, not the ruler. A store with an unnamed ruler's title has probably been around for some time, and does not bother to change its name with the new name of the ruler.\nIn speaking with any person, a ruler or not, it is best to know what sort of a person they are first. Rulers tend to stand on ceremony, and prefer that people addressing them speak politely and deferentially. There are, of course, acceptions to this, particularly among younger rulers, or rulers new to their positions. They may prefer a bolder, slangy style. If you are unsure, or unsure of your ability to adopt the vocubulary of either an aristocrat or a criminal, choose to speak as plainly and directly as possible. You will seldom charm someone by plain talk, but you will also not alienate by mangled politesse or dated slang. Alienating a ruler, I need not tell you, can be the last mistake one can make."}

How briefly you blazed across our sky, like a skymetal shard shining out to light our way through the darkness!\nNoble Varen! Devout Varen! Varen Aquilarios! Son of a &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n duke, paragon of physical prowess, wily fox of strategic cunning, you sought to restore our Empire to the glory of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;Days&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Remans&lt;/a&gt;. You showed us the way. If only we, your subjects, had been worthy of the challenge you presented us!\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt; sat upon the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, you urged your fellow Colovians to be loyal to their Emperor, despite his eccentricities. It was only when Leovic, misled by wicked councilors, declared worship of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; legal and protected in the Empire, that you cried, \"Enough!\" and took up your righteous sword.\nAnd the Colovians rose behind you! After an initial defeat at the hands of the Emperor's troops at Fort Ash, you took command of the Legion of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and sent Leovic reeling back into the &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;. Word spread that &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; had a savior, and that Reman's true heir had come at last. The Colovian Estates rose as one under your dragon banner, and eastward you marched.\nThe war that followed was bitter and terrible, replete with stunning victories, desperate gambits, and reversals on both sides. The might of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legions&lt;/a&gt;, bolstered by &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; auxiliaries and Daedric magic, were almost impossible to overcome. But you, Varen, had the might of right on your side! Finally you fought your way to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and cut down Leovic in the Imperial Throne Room.\nBut alas, our Emperor Varen, you wore the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; for all too short a time. It is said that your ambition for restoring your people to greatness led you to plumb secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; best left untouched. Why did you leave us, O Varen, on that night of storms and trembling terrain, and where did you go? Surely you are dead, for you would not leave your people so bereft if yet you lived.\nWe remember you, Emperor Varen, and somehow strive to go on, trying to live up to your shining example. But we know we shall never see your like again."}

This resulted in the rise of &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; supporters. Euraxia was sent to northern Elsweyr for diplomatic purposes.\nDuring the ongoing chaos in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, Euraxia created a large &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; army, which marched into Elsweyr, proclaiming itself an envoy of the Empire. The King of Rimmen, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hemakar\"&gt;King Hemakar&lt;/a&gt;, gladly accepted their entry into his city. Shortly afterwards, Euraxia demanded the execution of the King and his royal family, after which she took over the city and declared herself Queen of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. Her armed forces, which were previously known as just mercenaries, now took the title of Euraxians on themselves. This event would be known as the Frostfall Coup.\nQueen Euraxia quickly worked to consolidate her power, taking over the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;, hiring additional mercenaries for her armed forces, and taking up necromancers. She also created a defensive perimeter of siege equipment to keep her land secure from would-be liberators. A number of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; formed a militia known as the Khajiiti Defense Force and started a rebellion against the Queen.\nFour years later, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was founded. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; promised she would come to the aid of the Khajiit after she established an alliance with them, but before this could be turned into a reality, the Three Banners War broke out. As such, Dominion support became limited to military advisors and shipments of gold. While the Dominion could not offer military aid in fighting the Euraxians, the Speaker of the Mane, known as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gharesh-ri\"&gt;Lord Gharesh-ri&lt;/a&gt;, came to Anequina and took command over the militia. Not long after, the rebels were making headway to liberating the town of &lt;a href=\"Riverhold\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; and pushing the Euraxians back from the territory beyond the walls of Rimmen. The city itself was a bastion for the Queen, however, as Euraxia threatened to use her siege equipment on the the city itself if her rule was challenged."}

In recent months, however, the number of necromancers supporting her forces have increased dramatically. It all comes back to one source\u2014the dark mage and Euraxia's chief necromancer, &lt;a href=\"Zumog%20Phoom%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zumog Phoom&lt;/a&gt;.\nZumog Phoom, the self-proclaimed \"lord of the dark arts,\" reportedly hails from the northernmost climes of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Maddeningly few facts concerning this &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; necromancer can be gleaned from his early life, though suppositions are plentiful. We know that the wilds of Wrothgar are unforgiving, and life among the Orc strongholds is often harsh, bleak, and brutal. Still, we know that those Orcs who not only survive but flourish resemble a well-made sword that has been forged, beaten, and sharpened to a razor's edge.\nThe first real evidence of his existence prior to &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; appears in intelligence reports investigating the activities of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; crisis. While details remain slim, Zumog Phoom's name appears as a ranking member of the cult and hints at a close connection to &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Order of the Black Worm. However, we know that he was active here in &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the Frostfall Coup, so he probably did not have a direct hand in the cult's activities during the Planemeld.\nEuraxia either specifically recruited Zumog Phoom or was approached by the Orc after she claimed the throne of Rimmen. He had a small group of followers at first, lesser necromancers that formed the basis of his personal dark cult. The Northern Elsweyr Defense Force occasionally faced a lone zombie or a small group of skeletons, but for the most part, the necromancers have served little more than a supporting role in Euraxia's army. I fear that may be about to change.\nSince the end of the Planemeld and the apparent disbanding of the Worm Cult, a great number of necromancers have flocked to the Usurper Queen's banner to learn from the cruel yet charismatic Zumog Phoom. The few sorcerers that we have captured demonstrate an almost manic reverence for their Orc leader, regaling us with tales of his dark powers and threats of what he and Euraxia will do once &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; is totally under their control. They revealed few actionable details while still providing hints about what Zumog Phoom is doing in his hidden lairs and \"undead forges\"\u2014their term, not mine.\nIf the rumors are to be believed, Zumog Phoom and his acolytes have established manufactories away from prying eyes where they can perform rituals, conduct experiments, and raise an army of undead soldiers to bolster Euraxia's mercenary forces. We have yet to see the products of these vile places, but we have discovered evidence of grave robbing throughout the region, especially around &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Scar\"&gt;Ashen Scar&lt;/a&gt; and other mass graves from the worst period of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten flu&lt;/a&gt; outbreak.\nSpeaker, we must find a means for dealing with Zumog Phoom and his followers before they provide Euraxia with an unlimited supply of soldiers. The Defense Force cannot repel an army that does not tire and can be ceaselessly replenished. Our best chance is to locate the undead forges and destroy them before they can be turned up to full capacity.\nAnd if we can kill Zumog Phoom, so much the better."}

He resembles a trapped &lt;a href=\"Kagouti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kagouti&lt;/a&gt; pacing its cage, but with no bars to restrain him I can only wonder how long his violent desires can be held in check. Truth told, I am not sure the order could construct a cage capable of confining the Saints' power.\nMy attempts to persuade Felms to relinquish his war axes have been fruitless. The mere suggestion that a warrior should surrender anything as much a part of himself as his weapons was enough to elicit a fiery contempt from him, though that may be regarded as an improvement.\nHis reaction of disdain was measured and reasoned, compared to other outbursts of frustration and anger. While his moods are fleeting, there are signs that Felms is still capable of rationality. Not entirely comforting, given his almost singular focus on martial affairs and conquest."}

In many cases he fails to acknowledge or recognize attempts to communicate. I believe that this behavior is not so much a form of catatonia as the manifestation of a crippling depression, a diagnosis supported by undirected utterances made by Llothis during brief periods of activity.\nThese episodes have become more frequent and increasingly distraught. It appears that he is lamenting the loss of a deep, spiritual connection. It is impossible for me to say whether this traumatic separation involved the literal severing of any divine bond with the Three, or is simply how Llothis processes the drifting away of his personal relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.

He truly believes that he's being tested or punished, and this persecution complex grows more intense with every moment he's forced to endure his suffering. He's even begun to mistrust me now.

Evermore is the center of trade of Bangkorai, where the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; meets the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. It was created by the river traders living in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nEvermore is a walled-off city-state located along the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;, on the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Evermore serves as a gateway to the Western Reach from central High Rock, eventually taking travelers to faraway &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. West of Evermore's Gates is the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Bridge\"&gt;Bjoulsae Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, towering over the Bjoulsae and connecting to the &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; region in &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;. On the northern outskirts of Evermore is the farming settlement of &lt;a href=\"Northglen\"&gt;Northglen&lt;/a&gt;, owned by the Bretons of &lt;a href=\"House%20Giraud\"&gt;House Giraud&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that is the endless wilderness of the &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Woods\"&gt;Viridian Woods&lt;/a&gt;, which takes a large portion of Southern Mournoth. The port yard is on the northern edge of Evermore, where the Bjoulsae leads into &lt;a href=\"Halcyon%20Lake\"&gt;Halcyon Lake&lt;/a&gt;. South of Evermore is the &lt;a href=\"Pelin%20Graveyard\"&gt;Pelin Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, which is Bangkorai's largest cemetery. Many nobles from Evermore are buried here, including &lt;a href=\"Adrien%20Guimard\"&gt;Adrien Guimard&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvermore city itself is walled-off, with three distinct districts. Lower Evermore is the center of commerce, with the town square in the middle of the area. The &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Gate\"&gt;Armor Gate&lt;/a&gt; leads to the Bjoulsae River, serving as the primary gate in Evermore. East of the town square is the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;hall, using the outside as a training ground. North of the town square is &lt;a href=\"St.%20Pelin%27s%20Chapel\"&gt;St. Pelin's Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, the local religious temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt;, a local legend in Bangkorai. Continuing the road north would lead to &lt;a href=\"Anchor%27s%20Point%20Inn\"&gt;Anchor's Point Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks the Bjoulsae River as ships come and go. Eventually, the road takes you to Northern Evermore, where &lt;a href=\"the%20Stalls\"&gt;the Stalls&lt;/a&gt; are located. The Stalls is the central market in Evermore, and it is situated in a very strategic spot in the city. Northwest of North Evermore is the harbor, and the Northeast is the Cemetery, which eventually leads to the outside. South of Lower Evermore is Upper Evermore, where the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;hall and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Evermore\"&gt;Castle Evermore&lt;/a&gt; are located. This area is built atop of a foundation, making it overlook the entire domain. &lt;a href=\"The%20Back%20Alley%20Market\"&gt;The Back Alley Market&lt;/a&gt; is the second-most used marketplace in Evermore, being located behind Castle Evermore. Southeast of the Mages Guild is the Eastern Gate.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Founding of Evermore &amp; House Guimard.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; ending in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; had opened up with the destruction of the city. In that area of High Rock lives the &lt;a href=\"River%20House%20Bretons\"&gt;River House Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, who are the indigenous Bretons that heavily depend on the Bjoulsae River. Three years later in &lt;a href=\"1E%20983\"&gt;1E 983&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Evermore was founded by the River House Bretons and the earliest ancestors of &lt;a href=\"House%20Guimard\"&gt;House Guimard&lt;/a&gt;. Years later in &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt; had created the &lt;a href=\"Decretal%20of%20Fiefdoms\"&gt;Decretal of Fiefdoms&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; had annexed the province of High Rock, ever since the fateful battle at the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. Disregarding Guimard records, this would have been the earliest record of Guimard's rule in Evermore, recognizing a certain \"\"Barron Guy Marde of ye Rivver Banke\".\" But regardless, House Guimard ruled over Evermore, with a lineage of heroes and leaders.\nThe Legacy of House Guimard &amp; Evermore's Ascension.\nThroughout the first era, House Guimard had begun to appear throughout the Annals of Evermore, taking part in important events of that time. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202260\"&gt;1E 2260&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; had formed the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;, gathering the leaders of Western Tamriel. This was to attack the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, who brought about the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; that wiped out a lot of the population. One of these leaders was &lt;a href=\"Baron-Captain%20Olsien%20Guy%20Mard\"&gt;Baron-Captain Olsien Guy Mard&lt;/a&gt;, an early patriarch of House Guimard. The conflict ended when most of Thras had sunken into the sea. Another Guimard named &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Falinne%20Guimard\"&gt;Baroness Falinne Guimard&lt;/a&gt; had fought alongside the Breton forces that defended the Bangkorai Garrison against the Alessian Order in &lt;a href=\"1E%202305\"&gt;1E 2305&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"2E%20341\"&gt;2E 341&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Fulvert%20Guimard\"&gt;Baron Fulvert Guimard&lt;/a&gt; had expanded his territory and took part in the second Siege of Orsinium. Because of his service, the Barony of Evermore was elevated to the Duchy of Evermore.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Conquest over Bangkorai &amp; the Daggerfall Covenant.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Heseph%20Moile\"&gt;Heseph Moile&lt;/a&gt; was killed amidst the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Black Drake's Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20over%20Bangkorai\"&gt;Conquest over Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. Moile died without an heir to the throne, and the city-state of Evermore was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later, Duke &lt;a href=\"Blaise%20Guimard\"&gt;Blaise Guimard&lt;/a&gt; led the offensive force consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Order of Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt; that retook Evermore. It was after that, Blaise Guimard became the new King of Evermore, joining the newly-founded &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, created by &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, who hails from &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. King Blaise fought alongside High King Emeric against &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. For his contribution to the conflict, he was rewarded with the hand in marriage of Emeric's niece, &lt;a href=\"Arzhela%20Cumberland\"&gt;Arzhela Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; to his son, &lt;a href=\"Eamond%20Guimard\"&gt;Eamond Guimard&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime later in &lt;a href=\"2E%20568\"&gt;2E 568&lt;/a&gt;, Blaise Guimard had passed away, leaving the throne to Eamond Guimard and Arzhela Cumberland. The couple would have two children, &lt;a href=\"Adrien%20Guimard\"&gt;Adrien Guimard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elara%20Guimard\"&gt;Elara Guimard&lt;/a&gt;. They would continue to rule for the next twenty-years.\nSeventh Legion's attack over Bangkorai; Widowed Queen Arzhela.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the region of Bangkorai was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. King Eamond Guimard led the defense against the Legion at Bangkorai Garrison, alongside Prince Adrien, the Order of Saint Pelin and the freeborn militia of both &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt;. Though in the end, Guimard's defense had failed, marking the second time the Bangkorai Garrison had failed to protect High Rock. Both Eamond and Adrien perished in battle. After the battle, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Witnesses\"&gt;Dark Witnesses&lt;/a&gt; of the Reach attacked Evermore, though the defense was able to hold them back, though Princess Elara was damaged and left for dead somewhere within the &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Woods\"&gt;Viridian Woods&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly, she was found by the &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Sentinel\"&gt;Viridian Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, though her fate is currently unknown.\nImperial Plot over Bangkorai &amp; the Covenant's Defense.\nIn the aftermath of the battle, Queen Arzhela mourned the loss of her family, but fortune would have it when the Daggerfall Covenant took the initiative, sending an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant to Evermore after the situation at the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Witnesses remained throughout the outskirts of Evermore as the Guard holds their position. &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Antieve\"&gt;Sergeant Antieve&lt;/a&gt; led the defense and tasked the Agent with assassinating &lt;a href=\"Strastnoc\"&gt;Strastnoc&lt;/a&gt;, and defending the city. In the end, Strastnoc was defeated, and the Reachmen were quelled. The Agent was able to uncover a plot where &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Renchant\"&gt;Duke Renchant&lt;/a&gt; was planning to hand over Evermore to the Imperials, but he was put to justice by Arzhela. The Queen would then task the Agent with eliminating Imperial Spies through the city. With that threat dealt with in the capital of Bangkorai, Evermore, along with the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Wyrd\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; of Mournoth continued their attack on the Dark Witnesses at &lt;a href=\"Jackdaw%20Cove\"&gt;Jackdaw Cove&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Arzhela continued the fight against Septima Tharn and rule over Evermore and by extension, Bangkorai.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvermore during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Evermore was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Tristynak\"&gt;King Tristynak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Northpoint &amp; Evermore Skirmishes.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, Evermore had partaken in several battles against the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, these battles are minor, not enough to evolve into a full-scale war and the leaders of these regions have sought diplomatic resolve. Unfortunately, Evermore and Northpoint were not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, but they took advantage of it, absorbing smaller nations in the aftermath of the warp. The scope of their territory is enough to avoid the Iliac Superpowers (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely that the two Kingdoms have continued their conflict, all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

You will find he has tied up Anais in the back room. Speak with him and he will tell you everything here will make sense in a moment. He will then talk to Anais and tell her no one is willing to pay her ransom. Speak with Walks-Softly again and he will tell you he is doing this to teach her a lesson about owning people as property, and that he did not actually send a ransom letter. In fact, he will ask you to plant forged letters in her mansion to explain her absence, so that no one will notice she is missing. \nHead north to the Mansion District and break into &lt;a href=\"Velmont%20Mansion\"&gt;Velmont Mansion&lt;/a&gt;.

Place the Letter to Percy Velmont on the table here, then sneak through the courtyard to your final destination, the suites. Once again your target is on the top floor; place the Orders from Lady Anais on the servant's desk. \nOnce all the forged letters are in place, leave the mansion and meet up with Walks in the Thieves Den. There, in the southern room, you will find an &lt;a href=\"Urgent%20Message%20from%20Walks-Softly\"&gt;Urgent Message from Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt; stating that Anais has been taken from him and abducted by pirates. The pirates are holed up in Shark's Teeth Grotto in southwestern Hew's Bane, so head over there. While you are there, you might want to do the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Shark%27s%20Teeth\"&gt;The Shark's Teeth&lt;/a&gt;\" if you have not already, as it takes place in the same area. Either way, proceed to the top floor and meet with Walks-Softly there. \nWalks-Softly has been unable to get through a door here, but the key can be found on the bodies of the pirates. Once you have the key, head through the door to find Anais. Walks-Softly and Anais will exchange some harsh words; speak with Walks-Softly thereafter and help him decide whether to help Anais get out of here or to leave her here so she learns how harsh it is to be a slave. Either way, Walks-Softly will head back to the Den; speak with him there to finish the quest."}

He also would like to have Cindanwe's diary, as to regain his thoughts.\nOtherwise, Cindanwe's house is located to the east. Break in when she is not at home during the day, and knock everything in her house off of the tables or shelves, making a mess. The journal will update when this is complete. Then, either pickpocket Cindanwe for her diary or get her disposition up to 70 through Speechcraft and she will just hand over the diary. Return it to Ranarr-Jo for the reward."}

He suggests that &lt;a href=\"Llethan%20Manor\"&gt;Llethan Manor&lt;/a&gt; be searched by the Nerevarine for suspicious material, having been the home of the former King. Delitian also advises that the Nerevarine use the guise of offering their condolences to widower &lt;a href=\"Ravani%20Llethan\"&gt;Ravani Llethan&lt;/a&gt; in order to avoid the attention the large number of guards under her control.\nThe Llethan Letters.\nLlethan Manor can be found to the North-West of &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt;, with few of the guards Delitian eludes to present. The &lt;a href=\"handwritten%20note\"&gt;handwritten note&lt;/a&gt;, however, is sat on a desk near to Ravani Llethan, meaning the Nerevarine must avoid being seen when taking the note. Once the note is in the Nerevarine's possession, they must return to Delitian and hand it to him.\nConspiracy Kills.\nNow back with Delitian in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace%20Throne%20Room\"&gt;Throne Room&lt;/a&gt; of the Royal Palace, the Nerevarine receives three &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Writ%20of%20Execution\"&gt;Royal Writs&lt;/a&gt; from Delitian after the note has been handed over. Delitian requests that the three conspirators, &lt;a href=\"Forven%20Berano\"&gt;Forven Berano&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hloggar%20the%20Bloody\"&gt;Hloggar the Bloody&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bedal%20Alen\"&gt;Bedal Alen&lt;/a&gt;, be killed, the writs giving the Nerevarine the legal right to do so. Delitian also offers some vague hints as to where they may be found, but advises that the &lt;a href=\"High%20Ordinators\"&gt;High Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; roaming around Mournhold may have better ideas.\nFinding Forven.\nThe Nerevarine is told by Delitian that Berano can often be found in the grounds around the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20Temple%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a statement proven as Berano wanders around the northern end of the area. Confronting Berano about the \"evidence of conspiracy\" gives the Nerevarine two choices: let him go or kill him. Once either choice is made, the Nerevarine may head off to the next target.\nHunting Hloggar.\nHloggar the Bloody's location is revealed to be in the Sewers under Mournhold by Delitian, although a High Ordinator may reveal that he was seen near the West Sewers most recently. The Nerevarine must enter the Residential Sewers in Godsreach, using a ladder within to enter the Western sewer system. The Nerevarine will then find Hloggar by following a cave path, before confronting him about the \"evidence of conspiracy.\" Once Hloggar has either been killed or escaped, the Nerevarine may track the next conspirator.\nAngling for Alen.\nDelitian admits to knowing little of Alen's movements, although a High Ordinator will suggest that Alen may be found in one of Mournhold's bookshops. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bazaar\"&gt;Great Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; in Mournhold has two floors to be explored, with Alen found upstairs among the books. Challenging him with the \"evidence of conspiracy\" will allow him to be killed or given a chance to go into hiding, with the Nerevarine now needing to return to Delitian.\nUpon returning to Delitian, the Nerevarine may be thanked for their work, and rewarded with a sum of 3,000 , provided that all three conspirators are killed. Delitian will then ask the Nerevarine to deal with another problem he has in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind's&lt;/a&gt; capital."}

One such council member, &lt;a href=\"Garisa%20Llethri\"&gt;Garisa Llethri&lt;/a&gt;, has reason to believe that &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; have been corrupt in their actions at &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mine\"&gt;Caldera Mine&lt;/a&gt;.

Either method is fine, although the Nerevarine must not be spotted opening the chest or Helvi and the guards will attack. Having taken the Secret Caldera Ledger the Nerevarine must give it to Llethri in Ald'ruhn whom will devise a plan to turn the corruption on Hlaalu."}

Valdar will instruct the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to collect three vessels in the cave and bring them back to him.\nThe first vessel can be found in the Valthume area inside the room with the &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr deathlord&lt;/a&gt; that has two holes in the ceiling to the sky (requires activating a handle across an apparent dead end from an iron gate that causes a hidden door to open as well as the gate). It is visually very similar to an empty wine bottle, but is instead labeled \"opaque vessel.\" The map arrow will show the location and there will be an arrow shown in the room. Even at a level below 20, the draugr defending the vessel will always be a deathlord armed with an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20War%20Axe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony war axe&lt;/a&gt;, making it a very dangerous foe.\nThe second vessel is located in the catacombs where the three flamethrower pillars are. The room, which can be unlocked by pulling upon a chain, contains a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"giant%20frostbite%20spider\"&gt;giant frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt; with one to three smaller Frostbite Spiders. Three flame enchanted soul gems can be retrieved to clear the way to the third vessel, and expect the second vessel to be guarded by another draugr deathlord armed with an ebony war axe, or at a lower level, a draugr scourge.\nThe third vessel can be obtained in the room behind the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Claws%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon claw&lt;/a&gt; combination lock door,\u00a0setting the correct combination on the rotating kiosks: dragon, hawk, wolf, and using the Iron Dragon Claw on the lock will open the door, though the claw is on a pressure plate that will set off four flamethrowers in a crossfire around the pedestal, and there are three frostbite spiders guarding the claw as well. There is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; behind the third vessel that gives a word of the &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt; shout alongside the boss chest. Expect the third and final vessel to be guarded by at least one draugr deathlord armed with an ebony weapon and three other leveled draugr, including at least one draugr scourge.\nThe Ritual.\nUpon returning to Valdar, he will say that by pouring out the contents of the vessels, the lich entombed in the caves will be deprived from regaining its full power. After the Dragonborn pours the vessel contents into the sconce and sits in the throne, Valdar will reanimate &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak\"&gt;Hevnoraak&lt;/a&gt;, who will still be formidable. (It should be noted that after sitting on the throne, the Dragonborn can immediately exit the throne and find a hiding spot before Hevnoraak appears. This can give stealthy characters a better chance to sneak attack him with a bow.) Valdar then awakens the dragon priest Hevnoraak, who bursts from his coffin with an inhuman screech and taunts Valdar over thinking he could keep him imprisoned forever.\nDefeating Hevronaak.\nHevnoraak casts powerful lightning spells at the Dragonborn and summons &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;storm atronachs&lt;/a&gt; alongside his lightning cloak and &lt;a href=\"Ebonyflesh\"&gt;Ebonyflesh&lt;/a&gt; spell to mitigate physical damage. Beware of the lightning that Hevnoraak casts on the ground, as it is debilitating to health and magicka.\nIf the Dragonborn is leveled sufficiently and in possession of a strong bow such as a Daedric Bow and Glass or better arrows, Hevnoraak can be quickly taken down with a few well placed shots. Be sure to search the remains once he is defeated.\nWhen defeated, Hevnoraak will drop &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;his mask&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0which grants its wearer immunity to both disease and poison, along with &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak%27s%20Staff\"&gt;his staff&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak to Valdar afterwards to finish the quest."}

Vonos in his infinite wisdom continues to work day and night to find a way to break it.\nIt may be a singular getaway, but Valkyn Gatanas and Methas await us on the other side, preparing to march for our Lord.\nI will keep the faith, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt;.\n10th Sun's Height, 4E 201\nVonos has been studying all known information about the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, consulting with Dagon's &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, and experimenting tirelessly, but is still unable to open the gate.\nHowever, he believes that an object may exist which could be strong enough to hold the portal open. What kind of artifact could hold such power? Even a thousand &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt; would likely dissolve in the presence of a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe must redouble our efforts. I have sent additional scouts to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and Cyrodiil to learn anything they can.\n20th Sun's Height, 4E 201\nOne of my scouts has returned from &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; with promising information. The ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s are well known for their &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt;, rare aetherial fragments comprised of powerful meteoric glass. A &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful of these stones, was typically held within the heart of each &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid city&lt;/a&gt;, but these stones have long since been plundered or lost to time.\nResearchers have speculated for centuries that more Great Welkynd Stones may exist, but none have ever been found. The last Great Welkynd Stone seen on record was in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;; when it was &lt;a href=\"Miscarcand%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;snatched&lt;/a&gt; and used to bring down our Lord.\nThen, it was ultimately Mehrunes' undoing, but irony may be smiling upon us. Something of such power could be exactly what we need to bring the gate to full power.\nOne researcher has set their sights on the ancient Ayleid ruin of Rielle as such a place where a Great Welkynd Stone may exist. Many have explored its depths through the years, though none have ever found a trace of such a thing.\nCould a Great Welkynd Stone truly be hidden deep within Rielle? I've told my scouts to capture this researcher and bring him to me. We must learn all we can.\n2nd Last Seed, 4E 201\nMy scouts captured the researcher from Bruma, but upon returning, the &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigil of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; were seen guarding the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. My scouts had to detour through the wilderness of the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to avoid them. Could the Vigil be aware of our movements? Is there a traitor among us? We cannot risk any sort of confrontation with the Vigil until we have the full might of Dagon behind us. There is too much at stake.\nWhile interrogating the researcher I learned that Rielle is structurally weak, making entry difficult. With the Vigil blocking the Pale Pass, this greatly inhibits our expedition. He also spoke of other dangers, but I dare not repeat them, lest I give substance to his ravings.\nWe must find a way into Rielle. Vonos and I have agreed that we have no time to waste. I have selected only our most trusted disciples to set up a base camp in the mountains west of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;. We will operate under the darkness of night to excavate our own pathway through the Jerall Mountains and into Rielle. It will take time, but it is the only way.\n14th Last Seed, 4E 201\nAfter much blood and sweat, we finally breached Rielle through its northwest corner, but the challenges within have proven to be quite deadly. The only man who escaped alive claimed he barely escaped the clutches of an undead monster. Several have gone inside only to never return, and I am unsure how many more souls I can spare.\nAll this and yet no signs of a secret chamber or a Welkynd Stone.\nThere are legible portions of untranslated words on the pages retrieved from the researcher in Bruma. I've summoned one of my best scholars, Janus, to assist me in my Ayleid studies. Perhaps there is something we are missing.\n15th Last Seed, 4E 201\nAccording to the books &lt;a href=\"Magic%20from%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Magic from the Sky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Glories%20and%20Laments\"&gt;Glories and Laments&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient Ayleids believed that Nirn was composed of four basic elements-- Earth, Water, Air, and Light. Janus and I feel this is extremely important, may be the key to obtaining the stone. The incomplete texts recovered from the researcher in Bruma make mention of previously unseen Elemental Shards. But what are they? Where are they? We will prepare another team to descend upon Rielle with this information.\nWe're running low on supplies and may need to delay the search if we lose any more men.\n17th Last Seed, 4E 201\nVonos has sent an urgent communication. The Vigilants of Stendarr have increased their presence and have been seen questioning townsfolk. Acolyte Skorvild and Priestess Enakain have gone missing, whereabouts unknown.\nIt is best for us to assume the Vigil knows of our plans. There is no time left to delay. Janus must join one last expedition team to locate the Great Welkynd Stone. I will send the last of my guards along with him as protection.\nThis is our last chance. Dagon, give us strength."}

These will reveal &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Shinji&lt;/a&gt;'s Truth, and from there we arrive at the treasure vaults.\nBypassing Tu'wacca's Pillars is the first matter. Why else would there be a lock with the adornments of &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; generals plastered into the walls? If my knowledge is correct, and thus far it has been, then the lock makes reference to the stories based on the siblings &lt;a href=\"Narimaya\"&gt;Narimaya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tunaska\"&gt;Tunaska&lt;/a&gt;. I'll need to seek out the texts and see if anything will help me.\nI've found an excerpt from an old text that may relate to the vaults. I'm jotting this down for future reference:\n\"And so each of the siblings stood upon the battlefield, facing each other in the calm of the night as the bodies of their armies lay at their feet. The flames flickered and burned all around them casting a soft golden hue on the battlefield. Tunaska stood to the north, surrounded by his generals, &lt;a href=\"Akishu\"&gt;Akishu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buhliz\"&gt;Buhliz&lt;/a&gt;. To the south, Narimaya faced back, her two trusted advisors surrounding her; &lt;a href=\"Nishka\"&gt;Nishka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Puntru\"&gt;Puntru&lt;/a&gt;. They both knew, this would be their final battle. This would be the fight that would open the gates of life or death for both of them.\"\nClearly this means that each of the generals stood in the center of their advisors. A possible clue for the vault? Now I just need to get into that room and see if I can decipher the order of the generals. And the mention of flames? Directions? All of this may be vital.\nI should keep my eyes open for anything that would indicate an order when paired with this phrase of text. Something in the room must hint at this. An order or a number? Something. I feel good about this. That treasure will be ours soon!"}

It exists only in partial manuscript form, a single copy of which resides in the library of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. (Or at least it did, though since the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; was blamed for the disappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Emperor Varen&lt;/a&gt; and driven out of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, I don't know what has become of their once-admirable library.)\nFortunately, I was granted an opportunity to study the noted Tract in detail while the Guild was still in possession of it, and made a personal copy for myself so I could continue to unravel its mysteries once I'd returned to Elinhir.\nThe problem of understanding the Tract of Merid-Nunda is twofold: First, the extant document is clearly part of a larger work, drawn from seemingly somewhere in the middle, and without the preceding and following portions of the work we have little context for the part that remains. Second, the Tract is written in a peculiar argot that employs Ayleid phrases in a late &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; syntax, including many words of unknown origin that don't appear in any other source.\nHowever, working outward from fragments previously translated by Wenegrus Monhana and &lt;a href=\"Herminia%20Cinna\"&gt;Herminia Cinna&lt;/a&gt;, I believe I can shed some new light on certain key passages in this mysterious manuscript. Our format shall be to provide the translation of each passage, followed by my interpretation of its meaning.\n\"\u2026 were known as the Nine Coruscations, who followed the parabolas that led away from &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Merid-Nunda was of these Sisters, as was Mnemo-Li, as was Xero-Lyg, as was \u2026.\"\nThis appears to identify the \"&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; with the so-called Star-Orphans, those &lt;a href=\"Anuic\"&gt;Anuic&lt;/a&gt; ur-entities that separated from Magnus when that Divine withdrew from the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;. The best-known of these Star-Orphans is probably &lt;a href=\"Mnemoli\"&gt;Mnemoli&lt;/a&gt; the Blue Star, who is associated with un-time events, and was said to be visible even in the daytime sky at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"\u2026 thus we call upon Cenedelin to bind the earth, as we speak to Merid-Nunda regarding the light, for she is the scintilla that fears not darkness, and swims the waves of pull and spin \u2026.\"\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, of course, Light was one of the four elements of creation, and this passage seems to confirm that Meridia was the personification of Light to the Wild Elves. Though I am certain of this passage's translation, I confess the meaning of the final phrases eludes me.\nThe next passage was quite difficult, but its translation adds an entirely new episode to our accounts of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"The Lords of the Chaos-Realms chided Merid-Nunda for her trespass and bade her return to Aurbis, claiming all existing spheres as their own. But Merid-Nunda formed of her substance a great drag-lens, and the light of Magnus was bent thereby. The rays [carved? focused?] a new sphere from the chaos, which Merid-Nunda, [laughing? sparkling?], did claim for her own.\"\nThis appears to recount the origin of the &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, as Meridia's &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion realm&lt;/a&gt; is known, seemingly formed directly out of the stuff of chaos by an act of divine will.\nAnd finally:\n\"\u2026 thus does Merid-Nunda [ride? slide?] across the rainbow road from end to end, at one end stretching the dragon, at the other end compressing him \u2026.\"\nA curious passage indeed. The \"dragon,\" of course, traditionally refers to the Divine we know as &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Time. This seems to suggest that by traveling the \"rainbow road\" (a reference to the prismatic refraction of light?), Meridia can in some sense alter the rate at which time flows forward.\nAltering the \"speed\" of time? Is this merely an absurd conceit of the late Ayleid sorcerer-priests, or a genuine insight into the nature of one of the least-understood Daedric Princes?\nWho can say?"}

There was no water, but I did find something grand in a large open cavern deep under the stables.\nIn the center were great stones with strange, alien words carved on them. I felt like I could hear them calling to me. I reached out and touched the stone. It was then that a hand covered my mouth, muffling my scream and cutting off my breath until I passed out.\nI woke up hours later to my Father's face, his eyes drained of their usual joy.\n\"Daughter, we must leave this place. More will come.\" Father never told me what befell my attackers. From the stains on his clothes, I would guess that it was a grim fate.\n'\"But Father, what of these stones? These symbols?\"\n\"This is a place of blasphemy, beset by demon-worshipers. See here. This word is in the dark speech of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.

Ask him if he needs any help:\nDo you need help with your research? \"I suppose that depends. Are you willing to be an experimental subject?\"\nAfter agreeing to help him, Neloth begins casting the experimental spell and remarks: \"You won't feel a thing. But if you do, try not to scream too loudly. My ears are sensitive.\"\nOnce it takes effect, the \"&lt;a href=\"Neloth%27s%20Health%20Boost\"&gt;Neloth's Health Boost&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Dragonborn%29%23Abilities\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt; will be added, which increases health by 25 points. He then parts with: \"Off you go. If you discover any side effects, come back and tell me straight away.\"\nSide effects.\nThe side effect for this spell is activated with water. Swimming in water or getting wet from rain will change the effects of the spell. Rather than a boost, it reduces health permanently by 25 points. Once this occurs, return to Neloth and inform him of the side effects:\nYour spell made me weaker once I got wet! \"Wet, you say? I suppose... yes, I can see how that would have inverted the tether. Unfortunate. Couldn't you simply avoid water? No, no, that won't do. Can't have you forgo bathing... The ashlands can leave one a bit pungent and it's, eh, obvious you've been through them. Here, I'll just remove it. Here's a bit of coin. Should help mitigate your inconvenience.\"\nOnce he reverses the effects, he grants a sum of 250 as a reward and this completes the quest."}

He mentions that he needs a test subject for another spell:\n\"Well, I believe I've discovered a new form of silence. Some philosophers postulate seven orders of silence, but I believe there's an eighth. If you allow me, I'd like to envelop you in the eighth form, to study the mental effects. What do you say?\"\nAllowing him to proceed will result in him casting a spell that temporarily blinds the Dragonborn, causing the screen to fade out. He realizes the error and comments that writhing tentacles have appeared where the eyes once were. &lt;a href=\"Talvas%20Fathryon\"&gt;Talvas Fathryon&lt;/a&gt;, shocked by the results, vomits.\nNeloth: \"Well, that's unexpected. I presume you are blind, given the state of your eyes.\"\nTalvas: \"Master Neloth! What have you done to him/her? What are those things growing out of his/her eyes?\"\nNeloth: \"It's nothing that can't be fixed. The spell, that is. I... think I can fix the spell. It should only take a couple more years. But first, I need some data. Try... wiggling them. No, don't shake your fists! Wiggle the tentacle things where your eyes used to be.\"\nTalvas: \"\"I think I'm going to be sick.\" [vomits]\nNeloth: \"Hmm. From the way they are waving about, I'm assuming they aren't under your control. [Talvas vomits again] And I see now that your tongue is also... Well, it's probably best if I don't say. Uh, don't bother trying to scream though. It looks like it's beginning to wear off.\"\nTalvas: \"Is it over yet? Does he/she have eyes again?\"\nTalvas: \"I... think I'm going to pretend that never happened.\"\nNeloth: \"Hmm. Your eyes appear to be completely back to normal. Interesting.\"\nEventually, the spell wears off and sight is restored. Asking about some form of compensation (\"I think you owe me\"), Neloth replies: \"I suppose I do. It's too bad it wore off so quickly though. Unfortunately you don't appear to be suffering from any side effects. Anyway, take this for your time.\" The Dragonborn is rewarded with a sum of 250 ."}

In fact, this is where the staff is first spawned at the start of the quest; only when Nahkriin is approached does he pull the staff out to battle the player (the staff cannot otherwise be interacted with), which thereby causes the open portal to close. In the usual course of things the player must defeat and loot Nahkriin to obtain the staff, then place the staff back in the receptacle in order to open the portal again. Once the staff is returned to the receptacle, it cannot be retrieved any more.\nHowever, because the portal takes some time to close when Nahkriin first pulls the staff out, it is possible - if the Dragonborn is quick enough - to still make it into Sovngarde while retaining the staff instead of placing it back in the receptacle. The following steps outline how to achieve this: \nIt is recommended you save before you climb the steps to where he is, just in case you are unable to pull it off the first time.\nIf done correctly, you should be just next to the portal when looting Nahkriin's corpse and the entrance to Sovngarde should still be partially open.\nThe staff can also be obtained on the PC by entering the console command codice_1."}

Thousands of years ago, these priests ruled over &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of their &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; overlords. In their service, many of these dragon priests were granted extraordinary powers and knowledge in &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;arcana&lt;/a&gt;, and some of them even managed to reach &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;dom to evade their own demise, thus becoming immortal. They are typically buried in one of the many ancient tombs and temples dotted all across Skyrim, awaiting the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; the \"World-Eater.\"\nHistory.\nRule of dragons.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; ruled much of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. They believed that as they were the children of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, they were naturally superior to both &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of their core beliefs was that power equaled truth. The fact that they held immense power over mortals led them to the conclusion that this itself was the ultimate truth. This gave them the justification in their minds that their rule over mortals was only natural.\nDragon Cult.\nThe dragon priests themselves can be traced back to Atmora, where they were the ruling body during the Merethic Era. Known as the \"&lt;a href=\"dragon%20cult\"&gt;dragon cult&lt;/a&gt;,\" they worshipped many animals as &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;avatars of the gods&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon being chief among them.\nDragons embraced their role as god-kings over men, but rather than deal with the actual ruling itself, they granted small amounts of power to dragon priests in exchange for absolute obedience. In turn, the priests ruled men as equals to the kings. The priests set down laws and codes of living that kept peace between Dragons and men, but to do so they demanded tribute.\nWhen the Atmorans began to migrate to Tamriel over the next several centuries, the dragon priests and cultists were some of the first men to arrive. The system of rule in Tamriel, however, was quite different from Atmora. It is unclear why this was the case, but the priests began to rule with an iron fist, making slaves of the rest of the population.\nAt the height of the dragon cult's influence, the capital of Skyrim was considered to be the city of &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;, located in what is now &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; hold. It was here the highest ranking priests met within the temple of &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; to confer about matters of ruling. It was also during this time that the highest-ranking dragon priests were granted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks\"&gt;magical masks&lt;/a&gt; that defied the laws of time, and bore powerful enchantments. It is unknown if masks were named after the priests who wore them, or if the priest took on the name of the mask that was granted to them.\nRebellion.\nEventually, men rebelled against the cruelty of the cult in what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. After Alduin was banished from &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, a large number of the cultists were killed and the surviving dragon priests were overthrown.\nThe survivors adapted and went into hiding all across Skyrim. They entombed the remains of the dragons that died during the war within &lt;a href=\"dragon%20mounds\"&gt;dragon mounds&lt;/a&gt;, with the belief that Alduin would one day return and resurrect the faithful. However, other sects within the cult believed only those who ascended to the priesthood would be granted a second life.\nResurrection.\nUpon death, the dragon priests insisted that their followers be buried with them in the various Dragon temples and tombs across Skyrim. This act served a specific purpose, rather than a vain display of power. Because the concept of resurrection upon the return of Alduin was a core belief of the dragon cult, the priests required their followers to perform a daily ritual to facilitate this.\nEvery day, a group of followers that were entombed with the priest would awaken and gather around the sarcophagus of their respective priest. Here, they would prostrate themselves before it for several hours. During this time, an exchange of life force took place between the followers and the priest. This exchange sustained the dormant priest until it was time for his resurrection. Once the ritual was complete, the followers meticulously cleaned the area and would return to their burial chambers. While resting, the drained life force would magically restore itself, ready for the next day.\nIt is believed that the followers who were doomed to perform this ritual were initially buried as grown men and women, but over thousands of years they deteriorated into the draugr that now pledge to guard the ancient Nordic tombs with their lives.\nLast remnants.\nThe last known remnants of the dragon cult remained up until &lt;a href=\"1E%20140\"&gt;1E 140&lt;/a&gt;, when a legion of &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;King Harald's&lt;/a&gt; soldiers discovered a hidden stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cultist\"&gt;cultists&lt;/a&gt; in the secluded monastery, &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt;, high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. They shortly laid siege to it. &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, a renegade dragon priest, was able to survive until &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; in the daedric realm of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; before he was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;."}

Using his power, he managed to build up an army of enthralled disciples. Before his death, Hevnoraak planned his resurrection obsessively. He drained his own blood from his body and planned to transfer his power back into himself after death, thus becoming a powerful Lich.

His sarcophagus is located directly in front of a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Morokei%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorokei was a powerful priest who was entombed in the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;, specifically within Labyrinthian. At some unknown point, he came into the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, an immensely powerful artifact.\nIn the early Fourth Era an ill-fated group of &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;, including a young &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, encountered Morokei within Labyrinthian. The trip resulted in their deaths, with the exception of Savos. In an attempt to seal away Morokei permanently, Savos bound two of the surviving mages to be magically &lt;a href=\"Enthralled%20Wizard\"&gt;enthralled&lt;/a&gt; and permanently forced to maintain a barrier around Morokei.\n&lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;.\nNahkriin was a priest who was buried in the secluded Nordic Temple of &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;, high in the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, he was found in the service of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, and presided over a portal that lead to the Nordic afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Otar%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Otar the Mad&lt;/a&gt;.\nOtar the Mad was originally an ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic chieftain who ruled over the city of &lt;a href=\"Ragnvald\"&gt;Ragnvald&lt;/a&gt; in the Merethic Era. Initially, he was believed to have been a benevolent ruler and successful in battle, but his mind was subsequently corrupted by unknown forces that drove him to insanity. Otar became a Dragon Priest and subjected his people to unspeakable cruelty until two Nordic heroes named &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Saerek\"&gt;Saerek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Torsten\"&gt;Torsten&lt;/a&gt; were sent to stop his tyranny.\nBoth heroes were unable to defeat Otar, so instead they sealed him in a large sarcophagus in Ragnvald and locked it with two skull keys that each of them kept. They pledged to guard the keys so that Otar may never escape his imprisonment. The city of Ragnvald was eventually abandoned, but Saerek and Torsten remained as his guardians.\n&lt;a href=\"Rahgot\"&gt;Rahgot&lt;/a&gt;.\nRahgot is believed to be one of the Dragon Priests to survive the Dragon War. In the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, he led a small cult in the secluded monastery of Forelhost high in the Jerall Mountains. A legion of King Harald's soldiers, commanded by &lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider\"&gt;Skorm Snow-Strider&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the hidden stronghold of dragon cultists and laid siege to it for several weeks. In a desperate act, Rahgot ordered the entire cult to commit mass suicide, while Rahgot himself was entombed within the temple.\n&lt;a href=\"Vokun\"&gt;Vokun&lt;/a&gt;.\nVokun was a priest who was buried in the Nordic tomb of &lt;a href=\"High%20Gate%20Ruins\"&gt;High Gate Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. He was the bearer of the &lt;a href=\"Vokun%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Vokun mask&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Volsung\"&gt;Volsung&lt;/a&gt;.\nVolsung was a priest who was buried in the Nordic tomb of &lt;a href=\"Volskygge\"&gt;Volskygge&lt;/a&gt;. He was the bearer of the &lt;a href=\"Volsung%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Volsung mask&lt;/a&gt;, and like Krosis, guarded a word wall.\nDragon Priests in Solstheim.\n&lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the period of time when dragons ruled over mortals, Miraak served as a dragon priest on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. He came into possession of a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn lead to him to servitude under &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Knowledge and Fate, who taught him a means to &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;great power&lt;/a&gt;. With this forbidden knowledge in his possession, Miraak turned on his dragon masters, using his power to devour their souls to become ever more powerful. Because of his betrayal, the dragons razed his &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; on Solstheim.\nHis rebellion was unsuccessful, and was defeated by another Dragon Priest named &lt;a href=\"Vahlok\"&gt;Vahlok&lt;/a&gt; who was then made his jailor, restraining him to Solstheim. Other accounts mention that just as Vahlok was about to kill Miraak, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; saved him by transporting him to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons then appointed Vahlok as ruler of the island, but not before he was compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for Miraak's return, earning him the title \"The Jailer.\"\nMiraak stayed in the realm of Hermaeus Mora until he could amass enough power and influence to return to Solstheim, which he was able to do in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, although he was eventually defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;Vahlok the Jailor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; folklore, Vahlok served as a dragon priest during the rule of dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. One of his contemporaries, a priest named Miraak, was seduced with promises of power and forbidden knowledge by the Daedric Prince of Knowledge and Fate, Hermaeus Mora. Miraak began to conspire in secret against his dragon overlords. However, Vahlok discovered his plans and accosted him. The two fought a lengthy battle that was said to have lasted for days, and was so destructive that Solstheim was torn apart from the mainland of Skyrim.\nVahlok was victorious and gained much glory. He was appointed by his dragon masters as ruler of the island, but in return he was compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for Miraak's return.\n&lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAhzidal was the first great Nord enchanter, and the first human to master elven methods of arcane magic. In his lust for knowledge and power, Ahzidal had become corrupted, eventually falling mad with his obsession. Not satisfied with the mere knowledge of man and mer alone, he sought out the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon-runes&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually led him to join the ranks of the dragon priests. Even this was not enough, though, and eventually Ahzidal turned his focus to the &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn his lust for power and knowledge, Ahzidal finally lost himself, falling victim to his own pursuit of perfection. Eventually, he fled to Solstheim, and was sealed in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Kolbjorn%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Kolbjorn Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, together with the last of &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Armor\"&gt;his relics&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dukaan\"&gt;Dukaan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDukaan was a priest, and buried in the Nordic tomb of &lt;a href=\"White%20Ridge%20Barrow\"&gt;White Ridge Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. He was the bearer of the &lt;a href=\"Dukaan%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Dukaan mask&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt;.\nZahkriisos was a priest buried in the Nordic tomb of &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Bloodskal Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. He was the bearer of the &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Zahkriisos mask&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nIn the base game, eight named dragon priests can be encountered at their place of burial throughout Skyrim. Often they are found in the company of several draugr, while some priests can be found guarding word walls. In addition, unnamed dragon priests can be encountered at various locations at higher &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the addition of , four additional priests can be encountered in Nordic ruins throughout Solstheim. Three of these priests each guard one of Hermaeus Mora's Black Books.\nDragon Priest Masks.\nHigh ranking priests were known to wear &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priest masks&lt;/a&gt; that each bore a unique and distinct enchantment, or a series of enchantments. These masks can be obtained by killing the priest. &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Bromjunaar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, within Labyrinthian, is the location of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar%20Sanctuary%23Gallery\"&gt;dragon priest shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The shrine displays the busts of the eight high ranking dragon priests found throughout Skyrim.\nMasks that have been obtained from defeated dragon priests can be displayed on their respective bust on the shrine. Once the eight masks are in place, the final mask, &lt;a href=\"Konahrik\"&gt;Konahrik&lt;/a&gt;, is revealed. The other masks may be taken from the shrine once Konahrik is obtained. Any improvements made to a mask or masks will revert to normal when the item is recovered from the shrine. (For example, if Morokei is made a Legendary item through smithing before being placed on the shrine, it will lose its bonuses should it be placed on the structure and then recovered).\nVariants.\nDragon priests in the base game are generally identical in both appearance and attributes. They share many of the same spells and resistances. These include the ability to use &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ward\"&gt;Wards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;Mage Armor&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Command%20Daedra\"&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt; Daedra. They are also immune to &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only difference between them is the type of elemental magic they're attached to. Most named dragon priests dabble in &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; magic, and will only use the corresponding spells during combat, such as &lt;a href=\"Thunderbolt\"&gt;Thunderbolt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Other priests are &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; based, and will only use &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Incinerate\"&gt;Incinerate&lt;/a&gt; as part of their core arsenal. One exception to this rule is the priest &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;, who, although being mainly primarily shock based, also uses fire and frost spells during combat. Some priests even wield a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29%23Destruction\"&gt;destruction based staff&lt;/a&gt;, which usually takes precedence over their own spells.\nDragon Priests encountered in the base game are fixed at level 50. In , Ahzidal and &lt;a href=\"Dukaan\"&gt;Dukaan&lt;/a&gt; are fixed at level 60, and &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt;, placing him between level 25 and 60, depending on character level. These priests have knowledge of similar spells as the original eight priests, but also possess a powerful elemental spell that is unique to them. Ahzidal uses &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Stream\"&gt;Fire Stream&lt;/a&gt;, Dukaan uses &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Stream\"&gt;Frost Stream&lt;/a&gt;, and Zahkriisos uses a one-handed variant of &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Vahlok has no unique spells and, like his counterparts in Skyrim, is fixed at level 50.\nAll dragon priests are highly adept in the arcane arts, and boast a level 100 skill in &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nCombat with dragon priests is usually initiated when approaching their sarcophagus. The cover is flung to one side, and the dormant priest will awaken with a high pitched shriek.\nAs combat begins, priests typically activate &lt;a href=\"Ebonyflesh\"&gt;Ebonyflesh&lt;/a&gt; for added protection against melee attacks and their specific elemental cloak. They may also summon their elemental-based &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt; to aid them.\nOwing to their lack of melee attack, they are forced to exclusively fight with their elemental magic spells, but this may be overridden if they wield a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29%23Destruction\"&gt;destruction-based staff&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, they will use a Greater Ward to protect against both melee and magical attacks. Upon death, their bodies will disintegrate into an ash pile, while their armor and items will remain intact.\nIt is possible to make dragon priests very easy to kill by using the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt; to bestow one with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Atronach Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Apprentice Stone&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt; perk and &lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Robes\"&gt;Miraak's Robes&lt;/a&gt;, worn with another item of the Miraak set to set spell absorption to 100%. Items with a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell absorption&lt;/a&gt; enchantment will also prove useful. It is also possible to siphon their magicka with &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shock Damage&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, simultaneously depleting their magicka. As dragon priests lack a non-magical attack, the only threat to the Dragonborn would be their &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; creatures.\nNotable items.\nAll named dragon priests (excluding Vahlok the Jailor) drop an aforementioned dragon priest mask, a &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; amount of gold and, occasionally, a leveled staff. On rare occasions, they may drop &lt;a href=\"Kahvozein%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Kahvozein's Fang&lt;/a&gt;, a unique &lt;a href=\"dragon%20priest%20dagger\"&gt;dragon priest dagger&lt;/a&gt; used in the \"&lt;a href=\"Alteration%20Ritual%20Spell\"&gt;Alteration Ritual Spell&lt;/a&gt;\" quest."}

All three words of the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout are required in order for it to work.\nUsage.\nAfter the\u00a0Bend Will shout is directed at a dragon, it will land and allow the Dragonborn to mount it. As soon as the dragon has been mounted, it will take to the skies. Most story-based named dragons, such as &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; will resist the shout.

Rather, the dragon will follow certain instructions or orders given to it. If no orders are given, the dragon will simply circle the area.\nA bug may occur where you mount the dragon, but you do not actually sit on the dragon's neck. Instead the Dragonborn stands on it.\u00a0\nTravel.\nAs travel in any one direction is not possible, dragons cannot be used in place of a traditional mount, such as a horse. It is possible to fast travel while mounted on a dragon, however travel between &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; is not possible. Fast travel can also be initiated during combat or while near enemies. It is also not possible to travel to any of the walled cities, such as &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, as these locations are absent from the map.\nCombat.\nWhile mounted on a dragon, it is possible to scan the area below for any enemies. If an enemy is found and locked on to, their health bar will be marked on screen, indicating that they are viable targets. Ordering the dragon to attack a target will result in three possible forms of attack. It will either:\nIf directed to attack another dragon, the two will engage in\u00a0aerial combat, continually circling each other.\nIn addition to ordering the dragon to attack, it is also possible to use &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magic spells&lt;/a&gt; and shouts while mounted. Once an enemy is locked on to, any spells that are cast will fly in their direction. Area-of-effect spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be cast however. It is also not possible to use other forms of combat while mounted.\nTo order a dragon to attack, use these commands:\nDismounting.\nOrdering a dragon to land will result in an automatic dismount once it lands. Upon landing, the dragon will fly off, unless there are enemies in the immediate area (which it may attack). If the Bend\u00a0Will shout is used shortly after dismounting,\u00a0the\u00a0dragon\u00a0may become hostile and attack.\nIf the dragon dies during combat, the Dragonborn will be dismounted, much in the same manner as on horseback.\nTo land, use these controls:"}

Jarl Balgruuf has sent me along with his housecarl Irileth with reinforcements.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; has reemerged in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, laying waste to &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; and spreading fear throughout the land.

After being sent to &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt;, they return to Whiterun to report to &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to them all, Alduin has made his next move, sending the dragon &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nAs the Dragonborn enters &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, they shortly find Farengar Secret-Fire speaking to a mysterious woman named &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; about the book, \"&lt;a href=\"Holdings%20of%20Jarl%20Gjalund\"&gt;Holdings of Jarl Gjalund&lt;/a&gt;\". However, this dialogue can be bypassed if the Dragonstone was recovered before starting \"&lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;\", such as while doing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Claw%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Golden Claw&lt;/a&gt;\" while \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" was still active.\nFarengar: \"You see? The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text. Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts.\"\nDelphine: \"Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.\"\nFarengar: \"Oh, have no fear. The Jarl himself has finally taken an interest, so I'm now able to devote most of my time to this research.\"\nDelphine: \"Time is running, Farengar, don't forget. This isn't some theoretical question. Dragons have come back.\"\nFarengar: \"Yes, yes. Don't worry. Although the chance to see a living dragon up close would be tremendously valuable... Now, let me show you something else I found... very intriguing... I think your employers may be interested as well...\"\nDelphine \"You have a visitor.\"\"\nFarengar: \"Hmm? Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems. Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way. My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.\"\nFarengar: \"So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.\"\nDelphine: \" went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work. Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.\"\nShortly after returning the Dragonstone to Farengar, Irileth will suddenly approach, informing him that there has been a dragon sighted at Whiterun's western watchtower. Irileth will then ask Farengar and the Dragonborn to meet with Jarl Balgruuf. Following them up the stairs to the second floor of Dragonsreach, a guard will join the group and begin recounting how he saw a dragon flying over the watchtower. \nIrileth: \"Farengar! Farengar, you need to come at once. A dragon's been sighted nearby. should come, too.\"\nFarengar: \"A dragon! How exciting! Where was it seen? What was it doing?\"\nIrileth: \"I'd take this a bit more seriously if I were you. If a dragon decides to attack Whiterun, I don't know if we can stop it. Let's go.\"\nBalgruuf: \"So, Irileth tells me you came from the western watchtower?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Yes, my lord.\"\nIrileth: \"Tell him what you told me. About the dragon.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Uh... that's right. We saw it coming from the south. It was fast... faster than anything I've ever seen.\"\nBalgruuf: \"What did it do? Is it attacking the watchtower?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"No, my lord. It was just circling overhead when I left. I never ran so fast in my life... I thought it would come after me for sure.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Good work, son. We'll take it from here. Head down to the barracks for some food and rest. You've earned it. Irileth, you'd better gather some guardsmen and get down there.\"\nIrileth: \"I've already ordered my men to muster near the main gate.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Good. Don't fail me.\"\nBalgruuf now turns to the Dragonborn, noting that they may be of use once again. \n\"There's no time to stand on ceremony, my friend. I need your help again. I want you to go with Irileth and help her fight this dragon. You survived Helgen, so you have more experience with dragons than anyone else here. But I haven't forgotten the service you did for me in retrieving the Dragonstone for Farengar. As a token of my esteem, I instructed Avenicci that you are now permitted to purchase property in the city. And please accept this gift from my personal armory.\"\nThe conversation then continues: \nFarengar: \"I should come along. I would very much like to see this dragon.\"\nBalgruuf: \"No. I can't afford to risk both of you. I need you here working on ways to defend the city against these dragons.\"\nFarengar: \"As you command.\"\nBalgruuf: \"One last thing, Irileth. This isn't a death or glory mission. I need to know what we're dealing with.\"\nIrileth: \"Don't worry, my lord. I'm the very soul of caution.\"\nInvestigating the watchtower.\nBalgruuf now sends both the Dragonborn and Irileth to investigate. Follow Irileth to the guard barracks just inside the city gates, where a group of four &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Whiterun guards&lt;/a&gt; have gathered, including the one who reported the dragon sighting. She will begin the following speech when the Dragonborn arrives: \nIrileth: \"Here's the situation. A dragon is attacking the Western Watchtower.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"A dragon?\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"Now we're in for it.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"What?\"\nIrileth: \"You heard right! I said a dragon! I don't much care where it came from or who sent it. What I do know is that it's made the mistake of attacking Whiterun!\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"But Housecarl... how can we fight a dragon?\"\nIrileth: \"That's a fair question. None of us have ever seen a dragon before, or expected to see one in battle. But we are honorbound to fight it, even if we fail. This dragon is threatening our homes... our families. Could you call yourselves Nords if you ran from this monster? Are you going to let me face this thing alone?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"No, Housecarl!\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"We're so dead...\"\nIrileth: \"But it's more than our honor at stake here. Think of it - the first dragon seen in Skyrim since the last age. The glory of killing it is ours, if you're with me! Now what do you say? Shall we go kill us a dragon?\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Yeah!\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"Damn right!\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"Yeah!\"\nIrileth: \"Let's move out.\"\nWith this, the soldiers rally and follow Irileth out of the city. Joining them, the Dragonborn and the group take the road west towards the watchtower, muttering both worries and battlecries as the group makes it toward the fortification. Arriving, the party finds the watchtower in flames, although there is no sign of the dragon at the moment. Irileth nestles into an outcropping overlooking the scene and converses with the group.\nIrileth: \"No signs of any dragon right now, but it sure looks like he's been here. I know it looks bad, but we've got to figure out what happened. And if that dragon is still skulking around somewhere. Spread out and look for survivors. We need to know what we're dealing with.\"\nWith that, drawing their weapons in preparation, the group begins looking around the scene, attempting to find out what happened. Suddenly, a guard from inside the tower will shout at the group as he comes out to warn them:\nWhiterun Guard: \"No! Get back! It's still here somewhere! Hroki and Tor just got grabbed when they tried to make a run for it!\"\nIrileth: \"Guardsman! What happened here? Where's this dragon? Quickly now!\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"I don't know! Kynareth save us, here he comes again...\"\nIrileth: \"Here he comes! Find cover and make every arrow count!\"\nFighting Mirmulnir.\nFrom the south approaches Mirmulnir, the dragon that destroyed the watchtower, appearing from behind the mountaintops. He will shortly circle overhear, letting out a unique howl before beginning to attack the party. At this point, one of the guards will pull out a &lt;a href=\"Torygg%27s%20War%20Horn\"&gt;War Horn&lt;/a&gt; to signal the attack before opening fire himself.\nMirmulnir will shortly lay waste to the entire party with both &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; shouts. Initially, the dragon will fly as opposed to landing, making melee combat difficult and forcing one to use ranged attacks for much of the fight. Once his health drops to below half, he will be forced to land, now allowing for a more even fight. If much of the group is still alive at this point, Irileth and the guards may be able to distract Mirmulnir long enough for a melee-oriented Dragonborn to attack from the flank or behind. Mirmulnir's melee attacks consist of biting and tail swiping, which can sometimes immediately kill the Dragonborn if they are not careful.\nAftermath.\nAs the final hit is landed, Mirmulnir will yell, \"Dovahkiin? No!!\" before breathing his last breath. After Mirmulnir is defeated, Irileth and the guardsmen will begin panicking as the corpse glows and poises to explode; however, instead, wind will suddenly envelope the Dragonborn as they absorb his soul, as Mirmulnir's flesh and scales burn away, leaving only his smoldering skeleton, unlocking the ability to shout. A guard will shortly run up to them and begin speaking.\n\"I can't believe it! You're... Dragonborn...\"\nSeeing now the sight in front of them, the soldiers observing this proclaim that the hero in front of them must be a legendary \"Dragonborn.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"Dragonborn? What are you talking about?\"\nWhiterun Guard 2: \"That's right! My grandfather used to tell stories about the Dragonborn. Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself.\"\nWhiterun Guard: \"I never heard of Tiber Septim killing any dragons.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"There weren't any dragons then, idiot. They're just coming back now for the first time in... forever. But the old tales tell of the Dragonborn who could kill dragons and steal their power. must be one!\"\nWhiterun Guard 4: \"What do you say Irileth? You're being awfully quiet.\"\nWhiterun Guard 5: \"Come on, Irileth, tell us, do you believe in this Dragonborn business?\"\nIrileth: \"Hmph. Some of you would be better off keeping quiet than flapping your gums on matters you don't know anything about. Here's a dead dragon, and that's something I definitely understand. Now we know we can kill them. But I don't need some mythical Dragonborn. Someone who can put down a dragon is more than enough for me.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"You wouldn't understand, Housecarl. You ain't a Nord.\"\nIrileth: \"I've been all across Tamriel. I've seen plenty of things just as outlandish as this. I'd advise you all to trust in the strength of your sword arm over tales and legends.\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"If really are Dragonborn, like the old tales, you aught to be able to Shout. Can you? Have you tried?\"\nWhiterun Guard 3: \"That was Shouting, what you just did! Must be. You really are dragonborn, then...\"\nShouting when the guards ask is optional, and regardless, Irileth will then speak with the Dragonborn.\n\"That was the hairiest fight I've ever been in, and I've been in more than a few. I don't know about this Dragonborn business, but I'm sure glad you're with us. You better get back to Whiterun right away. Jarl Balgruuf will want to know what happened here. I'm taking command here for the moment. You head back to Whiterun and let the Jarl know what happened.\"\nOn the way back to Whiterun, the Dragonborn will hear a loud voice calling out \"Dovahkiin\" as the sound of a full-powered shout echoes down from the mountains. Entering the city will trigger two &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Warrior\"&gt;Alik'r Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s to begin arguing with a Whiterun guard, although they have no direct impact on the quest and only serve to begin \"&lt;a href=\"In%20My%20Time%20of%20Need\"&gt;In My Time of Need&lt;/a&gt;.\" \nReturning to Dragonsreach, the Jarl and his council awaits.\nProventus: \"Good. You're finally here. The Jarl's been waiting for you.\"\nBalgruuf: \"You heard the summons. What else could it mean? The Greybeards...\"\nHrongar: \"We were just talking about you. My brother needs a word with you.\"\nBalgruuf explains the shouting from before to be the Greybeards calling them to High Hrothgar to teach to them what it means to be a Dragonborn.\n\"So what happened at the watchtower? Was the dragon there?\"\nThe aforementioned dialogue begins \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;The Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;.\" Balgruuf, &lt;a href=\"Proventus%20Avenicci\"&gt;Proventus Avenicci&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hrongar\"&gt;Hrongar&lt;/a&gt; will then begin conversing again in regards to what has happened.\nHrongar: \"Didn't you hear the thundering sound as you returned to Whiterun? That was the voice of the Greybeards, summoning you to High Hrothgar! This hasn't happened in ... centuries, at least. Not since Tiber Septim himself was summoned when he was still Talos of Atmora!\"\nProventus: \"\"Hrongar, calm yourself. What does any of this Nord nonsense have to do with our friend here? Capable as may be, I don't see any signs of being this, what, \"Dragonborn.\"\"\"\nHrongar: \"Nord nonsense?! Why you puffed-up ignorant... these are our sacred traditions that go back to the founding of the First Empire!\"\nBalgruuf: \"Hrongar. Don't be so hard on Avenicci.\"\nProventus: \"I meant no disrespect, of course. It's just that... what do these Greybeards want with ?\"\nBalgruuf: \"That's the Greybeards' business, not ours. Whatever happened when killed that dragon, it revealed something in you, and the Greybeards heard it. If they think you're Dragonborn, who are we to argue? You'd better get up to High Hrothgar immediately. There's no refusing the summons of the Greybeards, it's a tremendous honor. I envy you, you know. To climb the 7,000 Steps again... I made the pilgrimage once, did you know that? High Hrothgar is a very peaceful place. Very... disconnected from the troubles of this world. I wonder that the Greybeards even notice what's going on down here. They haven't seemed to care before. No matter. Go to High Hrothgar. Learn what the Greybeards can teach you.\"\nBalgruuf will then once again speak to the Dragonborn:\n\"You've done a great deed for me and my city, Dragonborn. By my right as Jarl, I name you Thane of Whiterun. It's the greatest honor that's within my power to grant. I assign you Lydia as a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office. I'll also notify my guards of your new title. Wouldn't want them to think you're part of the common rabble, now would we? We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn.\"\nBalgruuf: \"Back to business, Proventus. We still have a city to defend.\"\nProventus: \"\"Yes, my lord.\nThe quest then concludes, with the Dragonborn now needing to make the pilgrimage to High Hrothgar and speak to the Greybeards. \nUpon completion of this quest, dragons will begin attacking the Dragonborn at random and will take up residence at the various &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Lairs\"&gt;Dragon Lairs&lt;/a&gt; around Skyrim, in place of whatever enemies or objects originally resided there if the lairs were visited beforehand, and guard the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Walls&lt;/a&gt; at those locations. The mechanism in which these attacks are delayed until the completion of this quest is similar to the mechanism that delays the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gates%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion gates&lt;/a&gt; in \"\" until the completion of the \"&lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Heir\"&gt;Find the Heir&lt;/a&gt;\" quest.\nRewards.\nJarl Balgruuf promotes the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, gives them the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Whiterun\"&gt;Axe of Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and assigns &lt;a href=\"Lydia%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt; as their housecarl."}

{"id": "5864", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5864", "title": "Dragon Shouts", "text": "Dragon Shouts (), also referred to as Shouts or Thu'um in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20language\"&gt;Dragon language&lt;/a&gt;, are an ancient form of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; prominently used in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; during the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, but it has gradually become obscured. Shouts use the vocalization of specific \"Words of Power\" to create powerful magical effects, usually for offensive purposes. Each Shout is made up of three words. However, one or two words of a given Shout may be used, but the effect is correspondingly less powerful compared to the full force of the whole shout.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; are able to master and use their Thu'um at will, as this sacred language is their natural language, inborn into their souls from the moment of their creation (when dragons shout, breathing fire or frost at each other with the Thu'um, they are actually having a deadly verbal debate). Mortals are only able to learn and use the Thu'um through a long process of meditation and the practice of the words. There are exceptions to this: rare individuals who are known as &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, exist with the bodies of mortals but the souls of dragons. The Dragonborn is able to intuitively learn Shouts, using the absorbed &lt;a href=\"Souls\"&gt;Souls&lt;/a&gt; of dragons to gain the dragons' understanding of the words. As shown during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;The Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;,\" they can also absorb knowledge from other individuals who have mastered specific words.\nThe events of follow the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; as they learn to use the language of the dragons to its full potential .\nA minority of other characters also have the ability to use Dragon Shouts, such as a small group of monks known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, who live in seclusion inside of the fortress of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. This fortress is located near the top of the mountain known as the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, which is said to be the highest peak in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Greybeards use their Thu'um to meditate, as well as praise and worship &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. However, their beliefs differ from the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, who believe that the Thu'um should be used as a weapon in the battle against &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are twenty Shouts in , the expansion adds three new Shouts, and the expansion adds four more. The Dragonborn learns the shouts which are inscribed on &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Walls&lt;/a&gt; found in ancient Nordic ruins, and are unlocked with &lt;a href=\"dragon%20souls\"&gt;dragon souls&lt;/a&gt;. There are a select few, however, that are given by the Greybeards as a reward for completing quests for the Greybeards along the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn is also freely given the second word of the Bend Will shout by &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;. Dragon souls are gained by slaying dragons and absorbing their &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;. Each word of power requires one dragon soul to be unlocked. Because each shout contains three words of power, it requires three Dragon Souls to be completely unlocked, thus enabling its full power.\nThese Shouts have powerful effects and provide the user with a variety of abilities. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one shout&lt;/a&gt; sends foes hurling away, &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;another shout&lt;/a&gt; allows for traveling a relatively long distance almost instantly. Others also project spells of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;ice&lt;/a&gt;, inflicting heavy damage to opponents. The Dragonborn can use a partially unlocked Shout (only one or two words unlocked). The more words used in a shout, the longer it will take for the shout ability to recharge (the recharge time is displayed by the blinking outline of the compass) with a few exceptions.\nLocating Shouts.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Word%20of%20Power\"&gt;Find the Word of Power&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finishing &lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt; can be asked, \"Have you located any Words of Power?\" The location will be added to the map and a miscellaneous quest will be added to the journal. It is to be noted that if Paarthurnax is killed, then Arngeir will no longer give out the locations of the words of power.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Source%20of%20Power\"&gt;Find the Source of Power&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter shouting in a specific area, a courier may deliver a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20a%20Friend\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, which reveals the location of a nearby Word Wall, although it may be a location that has already been visited.\nLearning Shouts.\nOnce a new shout has been discovered, a dragon soul is required to unlock it. Access the shouts sub-menu from the magic menu. Locked shouts are grayed out. In the bottom right corner of the menu is the number of dragon souls available to use. These accumulate as dragons are killed.\nAccording to the Greybeards, a Dragonborn absorbs the knowledge of the words from the dragon's soul. Fully unlocking a shout requires the use of one dragon soul for each word of power learned, with each shout being composed of three words.\nUnlocking shouts.\nTo unlock a shout, select it and press the corresponding button.\nReducing the time between shouts.\nThe recharge time between shouts can be reduced with the following methods:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Morokei%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Morokei mask&lt;/a&gt; was also supposed to grant a 20% reduction in addition to a 100% faster magicka regeneration, but the reduction in shout recharge time does not actually work due to a bug. Fortify shout is unfortunately not available as an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical effect&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "112841", "revid": "26893431", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=112841", "title": "Dragon War", "text": "The Dragon War was a war fought in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his followers settled in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, they brought the religion of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; with them. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;, the followers of this religion worshipped numerous animal totems, namely the hawk, wolf, snake, moth, owl, whale, bear, fox and, most importantly, the Dragon, as avatars of the gods. It is believed these totems were in fact early Atmoran interpretations of &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Atmorans regarded the Dragon as head of their pantheon, and considering Dragons existed in vast numbers across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and Atmora, it would eventually change into outright worship of living Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; being chief among them.\nThe Dragons themselves were only too happy to encourage this practice. They believed that as children of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, they were naturally superior to both man and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that they held immense power over mortals led them to the conclusion that power equals truth. This gave them the justification that their rule over mortals was only natural.\nDragons embraced their role as god-kings over men, but rather than deal with the actual ruling itself, they granted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;small amounts of power&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for absolute obedience. In turn, the priests ruled men as equals to kings. The priests set down laws and codes of living that kept peace between Dragons and men, but to do so they demanded tribute. Their system of rule was corrupted, however, and the priests began to rule with an iron fist, making slaves of the rest of the population.\nHistory.\nAlduin's peers considered him the most acclaimed creation of Akatosh. Alduin basked in arrogance at these accolades. In favor of conquering &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; for himself and his fellow Dragons, he forsook his \"proper role\" as World-Eater.\nEventually, man rebelled against the great cruelty of Alduin and the Dragons and the Dragon War began. At first, mankind was woefully outmatched, and was easily defeated by the Dragons and their &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt;.\nDivine intervention.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; intervened and sent &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; to assist mankind. Paarthurnax, originally the first lieutenant and brother of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed his kin and taught the power of the Voice to mankind, creating the first &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;. Several other Dragons sided with Paarthurnax.\nDragonrend.\nMankind created a &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;, built on the hatred of the Dragons' tyranny and oppression. It forces the concept of mortality onto the Dragon, something that is impossible for it to understand, and temporarily forces it to land.\nThe war reached its climax when the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; heroes, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, fought Alduin at a battle at the summit of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. After Gormlaith was killed and Hakon severely wounded, Felldir used an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to banish Alduin from the flow of Time, creating the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt;. This victory, however, was only temporary, as Alduin would re-emerge in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; and begin the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nThe surviving Dragon Priests were overthrown, and the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0scattered and hid in various places throughout Skyrim. They entombed the remains of the Dragons that died during the war within &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20mounds\"&gt;Dragon mounds&lt;/a&gt;, with the belief that Alduin would one day return and resurrect the faithful. However, other sects within the cult believed only those who ascended to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt; would be granted a second life.\nOne of the last remnants of the Dragon Cult, lead by &lt;a href=\"Rahgot\"&gt;Rahgot&lt;/a&gt;, was found by &lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider\"&gt;Skorm Snow-Strider&lt;/a&gt; in the secluded monastery of &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt; high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt;. After weeks of battle, the fort was breached, but Skorm and his fellow soldiers found all of the cultists within dead from mass suicide."}

Some believe that Dragonborn appear on the world in times of great need by the command of the Gods.\nCultural beliefs.\nBy Nord tradition, a Dragonborn represents what a Nord should strive to be. The Nords believe Dragonborn represent the end of all of Skyrim's foes. Nord tales likewise tell of Dragonborn of old who were great and powerful Dragonslayers, a belief which the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; of the Fourth Era also believe to be the reason why the old Akaviri Dragonguard came to serve the Dragonborn.\nIt is unknown as to how a Dragonborn is chosen. The various dynasties of Dragonborn Emperors led to a common belief that the Dragon blood is hereditary, though since it is a blessing of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; himself it cannot be known how or why it is bestowed. It is unknown if the Dragonborn Emperors were Dragonborn, and thus able to wear the Amulet of Kings and light the Dragonfires, or if these acts were the sign of Akatosh's blessings for these individuals Dragonborn.\nThe Greybeards.\nAfter slaying a Dragon, and learning the meaning of a Word of Power, the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; are able to sense this and summon the Dragonborn. Should a Dragonborn choose to answer the summons of the Greybeards, they are first tested to see if they truly possess the Thu'um. A Dragonborn has the inborn ability to both learn and master a new Word of Power far quicker than a normal mortal can, as regular mortals usually need years of training to learn a word of power. Due to the inborn ability of Dragonborn to use the Thu'um, the Greybeards seek to guide them in the proper usage of their power.\nIn order to truly show a Dragonborn's abilities, the Greybeards send them off to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of the Greybeards. Upon retrieving the Horn and returning it, the Greybeards formally name the Dragonborn \"Ysmir\", the \"Dragon of the North\", to declare the Dragonborn has accepted their guidance.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, who lived during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; of the Merethic Era, became known as the First Dragonborn. The three tongues, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, who led the charge against &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; had asked Miraak for his aid, though Miraak denied, having other plans. Miraak would eventually be defeated in combat by &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;Vahlok the Jailor&lt;/a&gt;, though saved by &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the First Era, the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; slave rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s would take place, being led by Slave Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. Alessia, being a Dragonborn, was gifted the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, which would be used to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and keep the armies of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; at bay. Alessia's line would continue with more Dragonborn Emperors and Empresses, until their deaths.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; attempted an invasion of Tamriel, which would eventually be foiled by the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The exact nature of the defeat of the Akaviri is unknown, though it is known that they were not seeking for combat with Reman, but were instead searching for him, as he was Dragonborn. Under Reman Cyrodiil, the Dragon blood officially became part of becoming a legitimate Emperor, as he included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, and the lighting of the Dragonfires, in the rites of becoming an Emperor. &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;His dynasty&lt;/a&gt; would continue until the death of &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Juilek Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt;, it had been years since the last Dragonborn Emperor had ruled. Following his successful rebellion against the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; aimed to legitimize his rule through lighting the Dragonfires. Varen was not a Dragonborn, and was convinced by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; to participate in a ritual, which would end up being a trick. Instead of becoming a Dragonborn, Varen and his companions were forced to the ground, while Mannimarco corrupted the power of the Amulet of Kings to trigger the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, until it was stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; and his kin were freed from the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, one such &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Sahrotnax\"&gt;Sahrotnax&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Hollowfang%20Clan\"&gt;Hollowfang Clan&lt;/a&gt; of vampires with the assistance of the rogue &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grundwulf\"&gt;Grundwulf&lt;/a&gt;, who then proceeded to drink his blood believing it would make him Dragonborn and with that power unite the fractured Empire once more. Though the ritual granted him extraordinary abilities, he was slain shortly afterward.\nYears later, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20828\"&gt;2E 828&lt;/a&gt;, another Dragonborn would be placed on the world. There are rumors about a Dragonborn who will defeat the Elves and restore the Empire. These rumors and the Greybeards' rumblings prompt &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, and he believes he is the Dragonborn of prophecy. Therefore he travels to High Hrothgar to meet with the Greybeards, but is blasted to ash as they speak. After his encounter with the Greybeards Wulfharth goes to find the Dragonborn, a warrior from High Rock named &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;, who would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim would learn the Thu'um from Wulfharth, and meet the Greybeards shortly after, who told him he was destined to unite Tamriel. During his campaigns in Cyrodiil, he would find the Amulet of Kings during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; against the Nord-Breton Alliance. After having become Emperor, Tiber Septim declared the start of the Third Era. \n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiber Septim's &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;dynasty&lt;/a&gt; of Dragonborn Emperors would continue to rule the Third Empire until the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Under the reign of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; attempted to slay the Dragonborn Emperors and thus provide &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; with the means to cross over into Tamriel. Uriel Septim and his three sons were assassinated, with only his illegitimate son, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; having survived. The leader of the Mythic Dawn cult, &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, was likewise a Dragonborn, able to speak fire and wear the Amulet of Kings. Mankar would eventually be slain in his &lt;a href=\"Paradise\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, whereas Martin Septim would meet his end after he destroyed the Amulet of Kings in order to banish Mehrunes Dagon.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; would come to pass. Alduin, who had been banished from Tamriel since the Merethic Era by an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, returned to the land, indirectly helping the Last Dragonborn to escape an Imperial execution at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; by destroying the town. The Last Dragonborn would learn of their nature while aiding the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; by slaying the Dragon &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun. Upon defeating the Dragon, the Dragonborn gained its soul, and through the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word of Power&lt;/a&gt; that the Dragonborn had learned previously in a mission of the court wizard, was able to use the Thu'um.\nAfter learning &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn was able to face off against Alduin atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, winning a minor victory against the World-Eater, though Alduin did escape to Sovngarde. The Dragonborn would give chase, and through the help of &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt;, they would gain access to &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; and its portal to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. In Sovngarde, the Last Dragonborn would meet up with the three Nord Tongues of old, Gormlaith, Hakon, and Felldir, and together they faced off against Alduin, defeating him in combat. It is unknown if Alduin was truly slain, as in contrast to regular Dragons, his soul was not absorbed. The leader of the Greybeards, Arngeir, believed that it may have been possible that he could return to fulfill his true destiny, though that was for the gods to decide.\nThe First Dragonborn, Miraak, had also gained more power since his defeat by Vahlok. Upon learning of the Last Dragonborn, he had sent out cultists with the orders to defeat the Dragonborn. The Last Dragonborn would travel to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, where the cultists had originated, in order to find the origin of the cultists. Here, they would discover that Miraak had corrupted the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt; in order to increase his power for his planned return. During their quest to stop Miraak, Miraak held the power to transport to the Last Dragonborn every time they slew a Dragon, and steal the Dragon's soul before the Last Dragonborn could absorb it. With the aid of Hermaeus Mora, the Last Dragonborn would learn the necessary powers required to defeat Miraak, primarily the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; Shout. The Last Dragonborn would travel to &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; one last time to face Miraak in combat. After a long battle, Hermaeus Mora ended the conflict by slaying Miraak for his treachery, and naming the Last Dragonborn his champion. This was because Hermaeus Mora did not desire Miraak to be set free from his direct control, and instead wanted a more loyal servant."}

I need to find out why they're trying to kill me, and so I should look for the boat in Windhelm they used to travel from Solstheim.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTo start the Dragonborn questline, the Dragonborn must have at least started the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;\" from the original &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt;. Once this quest is completed, the next time they visit a city in a major Skyrim hold during daytime (whether or not they have visited &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; before this point) two Cultists will stop the Dragonborn and engage in a brief discussion, asking whether they are &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and then telling them that the first Dragonborn, &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, will soon be returning. They will then attempt to kill the \"false\" Dragonborn for speaking heresy and blasphemy in saying they are Dragonborn as they believe Miraak is the true Dragonborn. After killing them, the \"&lt;a href=\"Cultists%27%20Orders\"&gt;Cultists' Orders&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found on one of them, triggering a new objective to visit &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;'s Docks in order to travel to Solstheim.\nThe cultists use primarily magical attacks; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Conjure Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt; are common spells. Since they engage the Dragonborn while in town, it is advantageous to lure them out of town to avoid unnecessary collateral damage to the townspeople.\nSolstheim.\nThe quest continues by finding &lt;a href=\"Gjalund%20Salt-Sage\"&gt;Gjalund Salt-Sage&lt;/a&gt; at the Windhelm docks and talking to him aboard his ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Northern%20Maiden\"&gt;Northern Maiden&lt;/a&gt;\". In a brief conversation, he reveals that one minute he was in Solstheim, and the next\u2014after the cultists boarded his ship\u2014he was in Windhelm. The Dragonborn will then have to pass a persuasion check with three options\u2014pay him double his normal fare, persuade him or intimidate him. After passing this check, Salt-Sage will grant passage to Solstheim.\nOutlander.\nUpon arrival, &lt;a href=\"Adril%20Arano\"&gt;Adril Arano&lt;/a&gt;, second councilor of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, will engage in a discussion where he will ask what business the Dragonborn has in Raven Rock:\n\"I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven Rock, outlander. State your intentions.\"\nI'm looking for Miraak. Do you know him? \"Miraak... I... I'm... I'm not sure that I do.\"\nJust looking for work. \"You've picked one of the worst places in Morrowind to do that, but suit yourself.\"\nNone of your business. \"That's the kind of attitude that'll land you in prison. But I'll let it go for now.\"\n\"Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This is Morrowind, not Skyrim. While you're here you will be expected to abide by our laws.\"\nNext, it's possible to ask him again about Miraak and he will mention the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt;. This will trigger the next quest marker.\nDo you know who Miraak is? \"I... I'm unsure. I swear I know the name, but I cannot place it.\"\nCan you tell me anything about him? \"I don't think so. I'm not... The name has something to do with the Earth Stone, I think. But I'm not sure what.\"\nAfter the Dragonborn's conversation is finished, Adril will turn to Gjalund, and they will have a conversation about supplies Gjalund brought. Gjalund will tell Adril that the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; raised their prices and that he will need more from Adril.\nAlternatively, one can talk directly to &lt;a href=\"Mogrul\"&gt;Mogrul&lt;/a&gt;, who stands out as the only &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; in Raven Rock. He will direct the Dragonborn directly to the temple, skipping the Earth Stone entirely.\nThe Earth Stone.\nThe quest continues at the Earth Stone, which is in a shrine being built by several residents of Raven Rock that appear to be mind-controlled. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; wizard named &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; will approach and begin a conversation:\n\"You there... You don't quite seem to be in the same state as the others. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?\"\nI'm looking for someone named Miraak \"Miraak...Miraak... It sounds familiar but I cant quite place... Oh. Wait. I recall. But that makes very little sense. Miraak's been dead for thousands of years.\"\nIt's possible to ask him some &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29%23Earth%20Stone\"&gt;other questions&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29%23Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind's history&lt;/a&gt;, but they have no bearing on the main questline. Should the Dragonborn attempt to activate the Earth Stone, they will be mind-controlled as well, leading to Neloth commenting on it as he watches, before when the Dragonborn breaks free, Neloth will be impressed by their resistance to Miraak's influence.\nIf the Dragonborn visited Solstheim before completion of \"The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller,\" they will still need to revisit Windhelm and talk to Gjalund Salt-Sage.\nThe Temple of Miraak.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt; is northeast from Raven Rock, in the center of the island. Arriving here completes the Dragonborn quest and begins the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;The Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The Dragonfires themselves are the ward against the &lt;a href=\"planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;; though it has been suggested several times in the Main Quest that it protects against all immortal realms. While they are lit, Daedra cannot exist permanently in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and portals to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; are not possible.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonfires went out at the Emperor's death and were relit for a few seconds at the end of a (where &lt;a href=\"Martin\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; destroys the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to relight them and thus turns into the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Avatar of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;). After the Main Quest has run its course, the Dragonfires have been replaced by a statue of the Avatar, possibly symbolizing the supported idea that Oblivion could never again reopen in the mortal world.\nThe Amulet of Kings and the Dragonfires seem to be parts of a whole - the Amulet of Kings was formed from the \"tangled skeins of Oblivion\" and the sinews of Akatosh's own heart. The Amulet of Kings must be available to light the Dragonfires, and it appears that the Dragonfires cannot burn if the Amulet is destroyed.\nUntil the records so far, the unlit Dragonfires have been the center of two major plots that eventually led to worldwide crisis, almost capable of shaking the very fabric of reality beyond repair. The oldest, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, followed the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, a lapse of time with no Emperor on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, assumed the role of Emperor only to be deceived by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, who used the Dragonfires and the Amulet of Kings to shatter the last barriers between &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and Oblivion, allowing &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;drag the planet into Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. The latest, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, when the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; eventually led the Dragonfires to be unlit, but differently from the Planemeld, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; actually tried to step physically into &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, only being stopped by the ultimate sacrifice of Martin Septim."}

They are the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; who invaded &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and would later form the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nConflict with Dragons.\nThe Dragonguard is recorded to have slain a number of Dragons when they arrived on Tamriel, following their success on Akavir. This event would be known by the Dragonguard as \"the Crusade\". By &lt;a href=\"1E%202809\"&gt;1E 2809&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard had become feared by the remaining &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel, who fled at the approach of the Dragonguard.\nAt least fourteen Dragons are recorded to have been slain, twelve of which are unnamed. The named ones being &lt;a href=\"Grahkrindrog\"&gt;Grahkrindrog&lt;/a&gt;, which was slain in &lt;a href=\"2E%20184\"&gt;2E 184&lt;/a&gt; following a great slaughter in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Krahjotdaan\"&gt;Krahjotdaan&lt;/a&gt;, which was slain in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202871\"&gt;1E 2871&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome other Dragons were also known by the Dragonguard to have survived during their Crusade. &lt;a href=\"Ahbiilok\"&gt;Ahbiilok&lt;/a&gt;, who was sighted in the early years of the Dragonguard, and is believed to have fled to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;, who was last sighted in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20212\"&gt;2E 212&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nahfahlaar\"&gt;Nahfahlaar&lt;/a&gt;, who had survived due to a number of alliances with protectors, the last of which was king &lt;a href=\"Casimir%20II\"&gt;Casimir II&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed by the Dragonguard in &lt;a href=\"2E%20369\"&gt;2E 369&lt;/a&gt;, though the Dragon escaped.\nThe most notable of the surviving dragons is &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, who was a lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonguard were aware of his presence atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his protection by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the policy of the Dragonguard forbidding them from direct confrontations with the Greybeards, the Dragonguard had to wait for an opportunity to exact justice upon him.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202700\"&gt;1E 2700&lt;/a&gt;, the Akaviri Tsaesci invaded Tamriel. Looking for the Dragons which had fled &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, they invaded and conqeured large portions of Skyrim, until they fought against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. After a short battle, the Akaviri surrendered and announced that they had been searching for Reman. The combined forces of Akaviri and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; would go on to take over most of Tamriel, with Reman Cyrodiil becoming Emperor and founding the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. With the completion of their war against the Dragons, those Akaviri who were the best and wisest became the Dragonguard, who answered solely to Reman Cyrodiil and his descendants.\nDuring the reign of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Kastav\"&gt;Kastav&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202801\"&gt;1E 2801&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard was in a turbulent time. Kastav ordered the seizing of hostages from the holds of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; which had not met their conscription quotas. The Master of the Dragonguard was ignored in this regard. Three years later, Winterhold would enter a rebellion against the Empire, and once again the Emperor and Dragonguard had different motives. The Dragonguard refused to fight against the rebellion, and as such, the Emperor ordered their supplies to be cut off. Local allegiances with the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, however, enabled the Dragonguard to survive without Imperial supplies. The Grandmaster of the Dragonguard at the time supported this behavior, as Kastav had violated the Oath of Allegiance. Only a year later &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; would be besieged due to an Akaviri unrelated to the Dragonguard sacking the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Salvation would come at the rise of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202806\"&gt;1E 2806&lt;/a&gt;, however, as he lifted the siege on the Temple. The Dragonguard of Sky Haven Temple would serve as his honor guard in a means of returning prestige to the Temple.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1E%202812\"&gt;1E 2812&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard of Sky Haven Temple had officially been granted permission to begin construction on &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the Dragonguard were summoned from across the entire Empire to work on the project. Some who came from the Temples of western Tamriel would be dismissed a year later, which delayed the work. Alduin's Wall was considered a gift to those who would come after the Dragonguard. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202815\"&gt;1E 2815&lt;/a&gt; the Wall was viewed by the Grandmaster of the order, who was so impressed that the Master of Sky Haven Temple was provided with a Writ or Requisition, sealed with the Emperor's seal. Three years later, the Wall was finished, and Reman Cyrodiil II came to view the work. The Blood Seal was created at Sky Haven Temple, and all of Skyrim's Dragonguard were present. It was a rare craft of which only a few Temple could boast.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard was officially disbanded. Some of these former Dragonguard went on to join &lt;a href=\"Dinieras-Ves\"&gt;Dinieras-Ves&lt;/a&gt; when he founded the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, while others became adventurers. One of these former Dragonguard would go out to teach the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonknight\"&gt;Dragonknight&lt;/a&gt; to those who he believed would teach it on to others. With the rise of &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, however, the organization was unofficially reformed, being more focused as an intelligence service rather than a bodyguard.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the rule of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard was commanded by &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;. Sahan trained many of the Dragonguard captains himself, teaching them the arts of swordplay, leadership, and tactics. The Dragonguard at this time was diverse, consisting of many races of Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance War, one member of the Dragonguard, known as the &lt;a href=\"Drake%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Drake of Blades&lt;/a&gt; was involved with the ending of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s influence in the Imperial City. At this time, Empress-Regent &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had forced the Dragonguard to go into hiding. The Drake of Blades would work alongside the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; in liberating the Imperial City from the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. First they would save &lt;a href=\"Father%20Egnatius\"&gt;Father Egnatius&lt;/a&gt;, a priest of the Temple District, and use his wisdom to advance their own goals. Not long after, they began looking for a specific book the Daedra kept. It would turn out this book spoke of &lt;a href=\"The%20Sublime%20Brazier\"&gt;the Sublime Brazier&lt;/a&gt;, which was previously unknown to the Dragonguard, and related to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, they would discover that the &lt;a href=\"Worm%20Cult\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; was using their undead to find the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfire%20Cathedral\"&gt;Dragonfire Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. Though this place was presumed to be a myth, the work of the Worm Cult was sabotaged by the Vestige through the blowing up of the digging process. Through research in the old archives of the Dragonguard, however, the Drake of Blades would discover that the Dragonfire Cathedral did exist. The Drake of Blades, the Vestige, and a unit of &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Zero\"&gt;Legion Zero&lt;/a&gt; would eventually make their way to the Dragonfire Cathedral, where the Drake of Blades would take on the role of defending the Sublime Brazier. Through doing this, she was bound to the Dragonfire Cathedral, and imbued with incredible power which enabled her to defeat an attacking army of &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;.\nReforming in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn unknown period of time afterwards, the Dragonguard would disband, and form into a new organization, known as the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;."}

First, in regards to &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Euraxia Tharn's&lt;/a&gt; interest, contacts in &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; inform us that she has ordered a thorough search of the royal archives to turn up every scrap of information the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; have gathered on the subject. It seems that the legends pertaining to the order's ancient origins as &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; hunters of renown has caught her imagination. Whether this is because the Dragons are also interested in the matter, we have yet to ascertain.\nConsulting with moon-singers has turned up contradictory information. One keeper of stories claims that an entire Dragonguard legion has been hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Scar\"&gt;Scar&lt;/a&gt; since the Dragons disappeared in the ancient past. Another tells me that a single caretaker remains, guarding the secrets of the ancient order in a hidden sanctuary.\nContacts in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; confirm that records kept by the magisters acknowledge that the Dragonguard do trace their practices to those of the Akaviri Dragon hunters of old. And while most the of order gave up those traditions after the Dragons disappeared to become guardians of the Emperors, some documents claim that a small number continued to train in the old ways to keep the knowledge of Dragon fighting alive in the event of their return.\nHere's a promising lead. A contact at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt; claims to have visited a hidden Akaviri shrine deep in the western Scar. Stories told over drinks claim the place is haunted and studded with deadly traps. Some also indicate that a single Dragonguard\u2014the last surviving member of the order, they claim\u2014maintains the shrine and waits for the day when the order will once more be needed."}

Surrendering in service to Emperor Reman, the elite Akaviri under his command eventually became the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, acting as the personal honor guard of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. While protecting the Remans, the Dragonguard were said to have been using powers and magic learned directly from the &lt;a href=\"Dragons\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, native arts in their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. After the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Dragonguard was officially disbanded out of shame until &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt; reinstated them, this time serving as secret intelligence rather than an honor guard directly, losing their capacity for Dragon magic. Even so, a former Grandmaster of the Dragonguard made sure that this martial art survived into the Second Era, and instructed his disciples to teach this art and spread it themselves. The disciples came to be known as the Dragonknights, masters of magic mirroring that of Dragons.\nSkill Lines.\nThe Dragonknight, like all classes, has three unique &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; lines only available for Dragonknights: &lt;a href=\"Ardent%20Flame\"&gt;Ardent Flame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draconic%20Power\"&gt;Draconic Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Heart\"&gt;Earthen Heart&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these skills are more suited to specific roles. For example, Draconic Power is more suited towards survivability, while Ardent Flame is more suited towards dealing damage. The arrows are used to signify a skill's &lt;a href=\"morph\"&gt;morph&lt;/a&gt; choices, e.g. one morph choice for &lt;a href=\"Fiery%20Grip\"&gt;Fiery Grip&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Empowering%20Chains\"&gt;Empowering Chains&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial Builds.\nThese are the builds officially recommended by Online's Skill Advisor.\nArdent Flame.\nActive Skills:\nPassive Skills:\nDraconic Power.\nActive Skills:\nPassive Skills:\nEarthen Heart.\nActive Skills:\nPassive Skills:"}

However, the chest piece and shield require Dragon Bones to be upgraded, while the boots, gauntlets, and helmet require Dragon Scales.\nComparisons.\nDaedric Armor.\nDaedric armor has a higher armor rating than Dragonplate armor at its base value and retains its higher rating, even when both armors have been upgraded to Legendary status. However, with its lower weight, Dragonplate Armor is the more suitable choice when lacking proper Heavy Armor perks. Another consideration is that the relative frequency of dragon attacks as compared to Daedra encounters means that it is usually much easier to obtain the raw materials for Dragonplate armor (bone and scales) versus the Daedric armor (&lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra Hearts&lt;/a&gt;). Note also that the higher rating for Daedric armor will not make a difference if either set is taken above the armor cap of 567 through perks and tempering.\nDragonscale Armor.\nWhile Dragonplate armor has a higher base armor, it also has a much heavier weight compared to Dragonscale. Dragon Scales are also lighter than dragon bones, making it easier to transport the material for the armor. Dragonscale is a light armor, which can make it better for a stealth-based player character or if they have a higher light armor skill. However, if weight is not an issue and all &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; abilities are unlocked, Dragonplate is a more beneficial choice."}

{"id": "64264", "revid": "44917185", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=64264", "title": "Dragonrend", "text": "Dragonrend is a dragon shout in . The shout forces a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; to land and experience the concept of mortality. Once obtained, it can make all dragon fights significantly easier without waiting for the dragon to reach 50% &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; before automatically landing. All three words of the shout are obtained during &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Alduin's Bane&lt;/a&gt;: however, it is not required to use all three words of the shout in order to force a dragon to land. The addition of words makes the effect of the shout last for a longer period of time.\nBackground.\nDragonrend is the first shout ever created solely by mortals. It was created as a weapon against dragons, and cannot be known to them as their minds cannot comprehend its concepts. The shout forces a dragon to experience mortality, an incomprehensible idea to a dragon. It is also capable of weakening Alduin and make him vulnerable to attacks, and therefore was crucial to his defeat both by the ancient Nords during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dragonborn during the events of .\nDuring the great &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; in ages past, the Dragonrend shout was crafted by the first mortal &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, who had learned the usage of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; to be used as a powerful weapon against dragons. Atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, these Tongues used the shout on &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the World-Eater to land and confront them. The ensuing battle allowed the heroes to use an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to cast Alduin adrift on the tides of time in the hopes that he would be forever banished. Sending Alduin through time resulted in a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt; being created.\nThis event is viewed by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; upon reading the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; in the time wound. The words of Dragonrend are learned and unlocked when the heroes use the shout on Alduin.\nUsage.\nDragonrend forces a dragon that was hit by it to land and remain grounded temporarily, the more words of power were used the longer the dragon will remain grounded. Repeated use of the Shout can keep a dragon grounded throughout the entire battle. The dragon will need a large enough flat area to land on or else it will either leave the vicinity in search of a place to land or keep on flying. Additionally, whenever the Shout is used on a dragon it will be staggerred by it. This can be used to stop a dragon from attacking before or while the attack takes place. The Shout is crucial when fighting Alduin, since he is immune to any harmful effect as long as he is not affected by Dragonrend.\nWhen used on objects such as bowls and plates, it functions like a weaker version of &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;, scattering the objects. When used on non-dragon characters or creatures, a message will appear by the top left corner of the screen saying the target resisted the Shout. Using the Shout on non-dragon targets will not trigger any response from it and it will not turn hostile."}

They were once widespread in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and ruled over &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; during the Late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; up until the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Their spoken language&lt;/a&gt; can be articulated to cast powerful magic known as &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt;, originated from the power known as the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt;, inherent to all dragons and their kin, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Such power was also bestowed upon mortals by the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, rendering Men (and especially &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;) capable of shouting, with enough training.\nAfter the Dragon War, dragons no longer ruled over Men, and they began to decline in numbers, being hunted by groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. Dragons were widely believed to be nothing but a legend for much of the late history of Men, until &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when they resurfaced in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; with the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe precise origin of the dragons is unknown. They are believed to be the children of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, or of &lt;a href=\"Akha\"&gt;Akha&lt;/a&gt;, and as such are especially attuned to the flow of time itself. Alduin, the self-proclaimed \"Firstborn of Akatosh,\" is believed to be the first dragon. While both Akatosh and Alduin are represented as dragons, many scholars believe the two are separate entities, which the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20pantheon\"&gt;Nordic pantheon&lt;/a&gt; seems to reflect.\nThe &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; has questioned several &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, who claim dragons simply \"were, and are\": eternal, immortal, unchanging, and unyielding. In this respect, the dragons are closer to the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; than to animals and the mortal races; they are ageless and immortal, with their souls enduring beyond physical death, and they do not mate or breed as animals do. As such, there are no known examples of dragon eggs or &lt;a href=\"dragonling\"&gt;dragonling&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; area has stories of such things, but so far all have proven false. The alleged eggs turned out to be the eggs of reptiles, and the supposed small dragons turned out to be oversized lizards, with no relation to true dragons.\nDragons in Akavir.\nDragons were indigenous to the continent of Akavir, and the continent's name even means \"Dragon Land.\" After the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; \"ate\" the Men on the continent, they next turned toward the Dragons. Red Dragons were shortly enslaved, though Black Dragons were able to escape to Po Tun, known later as &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Ka Po' Tun&lt;/a&gt;. A massive war errupted on Akavir involving the Tsaesci and the Po Tun, resulting in mass casualties on both sides and the death of Dragons in Akavir. It is believed that the Dragons in Akavir were primarily eliminated by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, though some dragons would escape and flee to Tamriel. Following this, The surviving cat-folk of Ka Po' Tun wished to \"become\" dragons (the word \"Ka\" meaning dragon); their leader, &lt;a href=\"Tosh%20Raka\"&gt;Tosh Raka&lt;/a&gt;, was the first to successfully transform into a dragon and eventually became the \"largest dragon in the world.\" The cat-folk of Ka Po' Tun would later be referred to as \"tiger dragons,\" suggesting that others may have also transformed as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; and dragon worship in Tamriel.\nThough dragons in Akavir would become extinct, those that escaped to Tamriel would survive this onslaught and interact with other races, particularly Men. When &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, his people brought with them a faith that worshiped animal gods. Foremost among all animals was the dragon, or \"drah-gkon\" in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic tongue. Occasionally the term \"dov-rha\" is used, derived from \"dovah\", the dragons' name for themselves. Using either name was forbidden to all except the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the temples built to honor the dragons survive today as ancient ruins, haunted by &lt;a href=\"draugr\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and undead dragon priests.\nDragons embraced their role as man's god-kings. In their eyes, they were clearly superior to the tiny, frail, and short-lived beings that worshiped them. To dragons, power is equal to truth, and their power over Men was indisputable evidence of their superiority. In exchange for the obedience of their priests, the dragons granted small amounts of power to them, bestowing magical masks upon their most favored priests. In turn, the dragon priests ruled over Men, wielding authority equal to the kings.\nThe Dragon War.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, where Ysgramor and his people came from, the dragon priests demanded tribute and created laws which kept the peace between dragon and man. In Tamriel, their rule was quite different. It is unclear if this was due to an ambitious dragon priest, or a particular dragon, or a series of weak kings. Whatever the cause, the dragon priests began to rule with an iron fist, making virtual slaves of the rest of the population.\nWhen the populace rebelled, the dragon priests retaliated. The dragon priests failed to collect the tribute and their control over the masses began to slip. The dragons' response was swift and brutal. This began the Dragon War. At first, Men died by the thousands.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; intervened, and instructed &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; to assist mankind. Paarthurnax, originally the first lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, had become disillusioned with Alduin when the latter proclaimed himself a god. As a result, Paarthurnax betrayed his former master and taught the power of the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt; to mankind.\nWith the rebellion against the dragon priests, dragons were slaughtered in large numbers. The dragons that survived chose to live in remote places away from Men. Alduin himself was banished by a group of Nord heroes on the peak of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, where they used an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to send him into another time. While the Nord warriors hoped that Alduin would be lost in time forever, he would eventually return to terrorize Skyrim again in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Cult itself, however, survived. They built &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;Dragon Burial Mounds&lt;/a&gt;, entombing the remains of dragons that fell in the war, believing that one day the dragons would rise again and reward the faithful.\nDisappearance.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, dragons had waned thanks to the Dragon War, though they would face an additional calamity. The Tsaesci invasion from Akavir would bring the Dragonguard to Tamriel, resulting in a renewed genocide by the Tsaesci. The Dragonguard would begin conquering Tamriel, killing dragons along the way until very few remained. The invading Tsaesci, though massively successful at first, would eventually encounter &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and were repelled at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining Dragonguard were said to have heard Reman's voice and ceased fighting; due to the dragons being all but killed off, and also possibly because of Reman's status as a Dragonborn, the Dragonguard swore loyalty to him. Despite their new oath to protect the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard would continue their conquest of the dragons, serving as both a monument to their genocide and as a warning for Alduin's future return. Late into the First Era, the Dragonguard would construct &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; in order to preserve their history of dragonlore. The dragons would be all but wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, causing the Dragonguard to devote themselves fully to the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and become the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome dragons survived this purge, though their numbers were few. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; made a pact with the few remaining dragons, swearing to protect them if they would serve him; among them was the dragon &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his promise, however, dragons were still hunted and slain. It is unknown if the last of these dragons fled Tamriel or were completely exterminated.\nWhile the last recorded sighting of a dragon in Tamriel was in the time of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, as late as &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt; dragons were kept in sacred groves by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;, and another was kept during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon &lt;a href=\"Skakmat\"&gt;Skakmat&lt;/a&gt; was also known to have reported to the court of Daggerfall shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragon Crisis.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, no dragons were known to exist, and they were said to have been extinct for centuries; additionally, Alduin's Wall had been forgotten by Tamriel, and thus the Prophecy of the Dragonborn fell into antiquity. However, in 4E 201, Alduin emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt;, assaulted &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; and razed it to the ground, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, Alduin began to resurrect other dragons from their burial mounds. After an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; by the dragon &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;, which was eventually defeated by a contingent of forces led by &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt; at the Western Watchtower, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was revealed, absorbing the soul of Mirmulnir. \nWith little concern about the Last Dragonborn's emergence, Alduin continued to resurrect dragons, eventually resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;. The Last Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last members of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; fought and killed Sahloknir, though Alduin left as soon as Sahloknir began his attack at the former's command. Due to the loss of Alduin's Wall, many were unsure of why Alduin had returned; Delphine initially suspected the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; were behind the return of the dragons, and other individuals believed that the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; were responsible. To learn how to defeat Alduin, the Last Dragonborn ventured with Delphine and another Blade, &lt;a href=\"Esbern\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where they found Alduin's Wall and learn of the Prophecy of the Dragonborn. From this, they determined that Alduin could be defeated with the help of a &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, though they didn't know what shout.\nThe Last Dragonborn learned from Arngeir that the shout's name is &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; and met the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, the dragon &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;. Paarthurnax assisted the Last Dragonborn in finding the Elder Scroll that was used by the ancient Nords to banish Alduin, in the hopes that returning it to the Time Wound would allow the Dragonborn to see a vision of its creation, from which the Dragonborn would learn Dragonrend from its creators. Paarthurnax's hypothesis was right, and after learning the ancient Dragonrend shout from the vision, Alduin confronted the Dragonborn and Paarthurnax atop the Throat of the World and a battle ensued. After the Dragonborn defeated him, Alduin fled to &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; to enter &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; in order to devour souls which allowed him to regain his power. The Dragon Crisis continued to lay waste to Skyrim, enough that the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; was temporarily halted due to fears from both sides. The Last Dragonborn took advantage of this ceasefire to capture the dragon &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, who carried the Dragonborn to Skuldafn, as the location was only known to the resurrected dragons under Alduin's command and accessible only by flight. Odahviing's defection ensured that the Last Dragonborn could enter Sovngarde through Alduin's portal at Skuldafn, which leads to Sovngarde. In Sovngarde, the Last Dragonborn gained entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, where the ancient Nords who banished Alduin in the past joined the Dragonborn in another battle against Alduin, in which the Last Dragonborn slew Alduin and put an end to his threat.\nFollowing Alduin's defeat, Odahviing swore loyalty to the Last Dragonborn, and Paarthurnax decided to attempt to convince the remaining dragons to embrace the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;. However, dragons would remain hostile, continuing to terrorize the province of Skyrim and attack the Last Dragonborn.\nNotable dragons.\nAlduin.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater, is the Nordic god of time whose banishment and subsequential return to Tamriel were a result of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. He was first banished from Tamriel through the last resort of the ancient Nord heroes who used an Elder Scroll to force Alduin to become &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;lost in time&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that he would never return. However, he was sent forward in time thousands of years into the future, to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. Alduin resurrected his fallen dragon allies and attempted to reestablish his rule over the world\nDurnehviir.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt; lived amongst his kin in the skies above Tamriel. While his brethren used more traditional forms of combat, Durnehviir pursued an interest in &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; that eventually led him to the &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis wish was to raise armies of undead for his own ends, so he made a pact with the Ideal Masters to gain access to their realm's undead. The pact specified that Durnehviir was to serve as the keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;, and guard a powerful necromancer named &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt; until her eventual death - terms to which Durnehviir, being an immortal dragon, agreed. The Ideal Masters deceived Durnehviir, as Valerica was a vampire, and thus also immortal. As a result, Durnehviir was doomed to guard the Soul Cairn for eternity.\nGrahkrindrog.\nA dragon who went on a slaughter of Winterhold and Eastmarch in 2E 184.

He was the second-in-command of Kaalgrontiid with whom he was imprisoned inside the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt; and later escaped with when &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; accidentally broke the seal keeping the dragons imprisoned.\nAfter escaping he assisted Kaalgrontiid in the destruction of Elsweyr by attacking the &lt;a href=\"Khajiiti%20Defense%20Force\"&gt;Khajiiti Defense Force&lt;/a&gt;.\nNahfahlaar.\n&lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nahfahlaar&lt;/a&gt; was a dragon known for making repeated alliances with mortals for protection, which saved him from elimination by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. One of his former protectors was king &lt;a href=\"Casimir%20II\"&gt;Casimir II&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Around &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; Nahfahlaar had made an alliance with the Dragonguard and helped the organization put an end to the dragon threat in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. He was employed by Tiber Septim during his conquest of Tamriel in the Second Era, and served as a powerful ally to the would-be &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;, who guaranteed victory for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; in many battles. By then Nahfahlaar referred to himself as Nafaalilargus. It was also Nafaalilargus that killed &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of a rebellion against Septim and his forces during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nNafaalilargus was then trusted with guarding the &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; which held the soul of A'Tor and keeping it from anyone who sought it. However, the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; pirate &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; confronted Nafaalilargus and managed to slay the dragon, claiming A'Tor's soul.\nSince Cyrus was not a Dragonborn, Nafaalilargus' soul was not absorbed and could have been revived by Alduin.\nNuminex.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; subdued the great dragon &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; in a legendary duel of Thu'ums, and brought him back to the fledgling town of Whiterun as a captive. It was then that the magnificent keep of Dragonsreach was rebuilt and renamed to serve as a cage for Numinex, whose skull still adorns the Great Hall. Paarthurnax notes that Numinex went mad due to his captivity and forgot his own name.\nOdahviing.\n&lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; was an ally of Alduin during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn summons him to &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main storyline of \"Skyrim\"&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that the dragon would reveal the whereabouts of Alduin. The dragon helped the Last Dragonborn reach kuldafn and gain entry into &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Alduin's defeat Odahviing became a loyal ally to the Dragonborn and would come to assist them whenever he was called upon.\nPaarthurnax.\n&lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; who lives atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. He served as Alduin's lieutenant during the Dragon War in the Merethic Era, during which he was said to have committed terrible atrocities against mankind.\nDuring the Fourth Era he assisted the Dragonborn in defeating Alduin after the latter's returned to Tamriel.\nShulkunaak.\n&lt;a href=\"Shulkunaak\"&gt;Shulkunaak&lt;/a&gt; is a dragon found in the main questline of from whom the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; requests assistance in defeating the &lt;a href=\"Celemaril%20Light-Bringer\"&gt;Sorcerer-King&lt;/a&gt; at the suggestion of &lt;a href=\"Saashi\"&gt;Saashi&lt;/a&gt;. He is the last of his breed.\nAfter giving the Fugitive the information they need, he recognized them as a member of the Blades and challenged them to a battle, ultimately being defeated at their hands. Since Shulkunaak had no intention of killing the Fugitive, his challenge served only to demonstrate the Fugitive's ability to defeat the Litch King. He was left alive to mend his wounds despite threatening to kill the Fugitive if they lost.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Azzin\"&gt;Azzin&lt;/a&gt; attempted to slay Shulkunaak, but because the dragon did not share his species' propensity for domination, the Fugitive prevented him from doing so. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Saashi\"&gt;Saashi&lt;/a&gt;, a Khajiit scholar, warned Shulkunaak of the Blade, allowing him to escape.\nSkakmat.\n&lt;a href=\"Skakmat\"&gt;Skakmat&lt;/a&gt; was the dragon familiar of &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful female Breton wizard and necromancer. At the Battle of Cryngaine Field, Skakmat produced a mystic fog (under Nulfaga's orders) in an attempt to halt the battle in which &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; was to be slain.\nPlaces of worship.\nWhen the Dragons ruled Nirn with an iron fist, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt; carried out the orders of the Dragons, there were temples and tombs that the people of Nirn built to worship the Dragon Priests and the Dragons. Most of these locations were also cities where people lived.\nTypes of dragons.\nJills.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt;, a former writer at Bethesda, \"Jills\" or \"minute-menders\" are the female variant of dragons, who serve to mend &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; attributed them to fixing the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;. Their male counterparts, the \"Drakes,\" are said to be less powerful than them."}

Thus, fast traveling to an outdoor location is a reliable way to trigger a random Dragon encounter.\nThere are, however, certain locations where Dragons are scripted to appear. These locations are called &lt;a href=\"dragon%20lair\"&gt;dragon lair&lt;/a&gt;s that can be found all over Skyrim. In these locations Dragons are typically perched atop &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt;s that they are guarding.\nThe following is a list of dragon lairs:\nThese locations are not dragon lairs, but a dragon is guaranteed to be present.\nVariants.\nNamed dragons.\nThese are dragons encountered throughout Skyrim.

This is a record of my experiences with these beasts\u2014from afar, of course. I'm no Dragon hunter!\nWhile traveling near &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, I met my first witness to a Dragon. They described a great &lt;a href=\"Nahfahlaar\"&gt;red beast&lt;/a&gt; as it swooped across the sky. Before the Dragon could attack, the witness fled. I do not judge those who choose the wiser course of action, but I am not one to run away. Instead, I seek to categorize and record.\nI ventured to where the witness last saw this red Dragon. Luckily, it lingered in the area, so I was able to approach and observe it for a time. I noticed a strangeness in the horn formation\u2014was it missing part of a horn? After a while, the Dragon flew off. It never harmed a thing. I know not its purpose in that area, but was intrigued that it caused neither chaos nor damage. Very much unlike what has been reported in the north. Is it possible this Dragon was benign? Alas, I have an absence of evidence to quantify such a claim.\nShortly thereafter, a different red Dragon appeared in a burned-out area near Senchal, clearly intent on hunting. A group of Dragon hunters also came through, and a great battle ensued. I watched, hoping to learn the Dragon's name as it shouted and roared. After it fell to the hunters but before it died, I approached the Dragon and asked, \"Please share your name so that I may record it.\"\n\"You are not worthy of my name, mortal,\" It said. Then it expired. A shame. Perhaps the next Dragon will prove to be more cooperative. For posterity, you understand. I placed both of these red Dragons under \"Unnamed Dragons,\" as &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Mathnan\"&gt;Brother Mathnan&lt;/a&gt; did in his &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20of%20Dragons\"&gt;Atlas of Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2E%20373\"&gt;2E 373&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext, I heard that a black Dragon was spotted near a quarry to the south. I headed there quickly on my faithful steed, hoping to see this one in action. Luck was with me yet again. The Dragon perched on a rock overlooking the quarry, speaking to figures I could not quite see.\n\"I am &lt;a href=\"Laatvulon\"&gt;Laatvulon&lt;/a&gt;, your master, and you will do as I say,\" it roared.\nHow fortunate I was to hear the Dragon speak its own name! I wrote it down and departed as quickly as I could, realizing I was just a little too close to a Dragon and its minions for my own comfort, scholarly pursuits be damned.\nI returned to Senchal, where I overheard some refugees talking about a new &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. Could such an ancient order actually return to help us against the Dragons? I should seek them out. For my research, you understand.\nI wonder who I know who might help with the introductions?"}

In &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, Alduin has ensnared the land with an evil mist and consumes the souls of the lost to gather his power. With the assistance of the original &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; heroes who banished him, the Dragonborn must ensure that Alduin is destroyed and can no longer threaten the world. It is the final quest in the main story of \"Skyrim.\"\nBackground.\n\"Gormlaith Golden-Hilt, Hakon One-Eye, and Felldir the Old have come to help me try to defeat Alduin. Together we may be strong enough to dispel the evil mist in which he hides. Once that is gone, he will have no choice but to face us in open battle.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon leaving the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; and crossing the whalebone bridge, the next objective is to dispel the mist in the valley. The &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Skies\"&gt;Clear Skies&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Shout will need to be used three times, as Alduin will re-summon the mist twice.\nFelldir: \"We cannot fight the foe in this mist!\"\nGormlaith: \"Clear Skies - combine our Shouts!\"\n&lt;shout&gt;\nAlduin: \"\"\nGormlaith: \"Again!\"\nFelldir: \"We can shatter his power if we Shout together!\"\n&lt;shout&gt;\nAlduin: \"Ven Mul Riik!\"\nHakon: \"Does his strength have no end? Is our struggle in vain?\"\nGormlaith: \"Stand fast! His strength is failing! Once more, and his might will be broken!\"\nFelldir: \"His power crumbles - do not pause for breath!\"\n&lt;shout&gt;\nThe three heroes will use the Shout as well. After Alduin summons the mist again, the heroes eventually say to use it again. Alduin will now summon the mist for the last time. After a small dialogue, using the Shout for the third time will get rid of the mist and Alduin will appear to deal with the Dragonborn and the three heroes personally.\nAlduin's Fall.\nNow that Alduin has appeared, he must be killed. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Shout can be used on him as soon as possible to get him on the ground, where he can be attacked. This Shout can be used repeatedly to stun him and keep the other heroes alive. If he cannot be killed before he defeats the other three heroes, plenty of &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Restore%20Health\"&gt;Healing Potions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to stay alive, as his fire breath attack is quite strong.\nA simple tactic to defeat him is to use the same tactic used in the fight at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. A shield bash/stun will stop him from using his fire breath, along with using the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Shout. One can also attack him in between shield stuns as well.\nThere are also several unorthodox strategies to defeating Alduin. The Dragonborn can wait on the sidelines using Dragonrend from a distance; as the heroes are essential and powerful, they can defeat Alduin after only a few minutes. However, once defeated, the Dragonborn must deliver the final blow themselves. Alduin will be unable to attack, and will not resist the final attack.\nBaiting &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt; into the fight is also useful. Stand behind him and wait; a meteor will eventually strike him and he will become enraged and join the battle. He is essential and will only fight for a short time before returning to his post. There's also a chance that other spirits, like &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; will join in to help as well if they died during their respective quests.\nThe first two strategies are recommended to use on higher difficulty settings.\nTsun: \"That was a mighty deed! The doom of Alduin encompassed at last, and cleansed is Sovngarde of his evil snare. They will sing of this battle in Shor's hall forever. But your fate lies elsewhere. When you have completed your count of days, I may welcome you again, with glad friendship, and bid you join the blessed feasting.\"\nAll: \"All hail the Dragonborn! Hail him/her with great praise!\"\nTsun: \"Return now to Nirn, with this rich boon from Shor, my lord: a Shout to bring a hero from Sovngarde in your hour of need. \""}

It was constructed in the ornate wooden style of the great &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; longhouses of ancient days. Visually and politically, it is very much the focal point of the entire city itself and perhaps even Skyrim as a whole. As is true of the keeps in other cities, Dragonsreach serves many important functions.\nBackground.\nAs the seat of government in Whiterun, &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; resides here as its ruler. Dragonsreach is situated in the \"Cloud District\" of Whiterun and, as the name suggests, it is elevated from the rest of the city. According to the Jarl's steward, &lt;a href=\"Proventus%20Avenicci\"&gt;Proventus Avenicci&lt;/a&gt;, the building gained its name after a battle with a dragon that left the victorious party as \"rulers of the clouds.\"\nHistory.\nAccording to legend, the palace today known as \"Dragonsreach\" was originally a smaller building. However, with the intent of creating a prison for the dragon &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; after its defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, the people of Whiterun added a stone prison to the keep and renamed it Dragonsreach. Though accounts vary on Olaf's position, the dragon's disposition, and the manner in which the dragon was captured, there seems to be little doubt about the history and purpose of the building.\nCharacters.\nThe following arrive if the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; take over &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;:\nInterior.\nThe Great Hall.\nThe Great Hall is the main chamber of the keep and is where the Jarl holds court on his throne beyond the long tables and central fire pit. Check the shelves to the sides for all manner of books. There are balconies on the upper floor, accessed via the War Room, from which you can peer down. The head of Numinex adorns the great hall above the Jarl's throne. If you tell Lydia that you no longer require her services then she will return here and be sitting at one of the two large tables. Once &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt; is purchased however, she will go there instead.\nKitchens.\nTwo large tables and an even bigger fireplace are where the Jarl\u2019s servants prepare the feasts of the long table.\nServant's Bedroom and Storage (Lower).\nA rough-hewn, rock-walled chamber where the servant sleeps. There is a storage room behind the door.\nFarengar's Quarters.\nIn this laboratory, the Court Wizard &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar&lt;/a&gt; mixes concoctions and conducts research into the mysteries of the dragons' return. His bedroom and a small library are behind his main study. An &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; are available in here.\nWar Room.\nThis is where the Jarl and his advisors discuss matters of state, poring over the Civil War map near the book-lined shelves. When needed, an Imperial Legate also plans from this location.\nGreat Porch.\nExit onto the Great Porch if you want an impressive view to the north. According to legend, the dragon Numinex was trapped here. The old trap itself will prove itself useful once more when capturing Odahviing as part of the Main Questline.\nJarl's Quarters.\nThis is the private quarters of the Jarl, and entering here without invitation results in you being removed, facing a fine, or worse. However, an &lt;a href=\"Unusual%20Gem\"&gt;Unusual Gem&lt;/a&gt; can be found here that pertains to Side Quest: \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Stone%20Unturned%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;No Stone Unturned&lt;/a&gt;.\" The book \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Legends\"&gt;Lost Legends&lt;/a&gt;\" is on a bookshelf in one of he side rooms off the dining room \u2013 this grants the \"&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;\" main quest. In the same room on the table is the book \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Ages%20of%20Man\"&gt;Before the Ages of Man&lt;/a&gt;\" \u2013 when read, this improves &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nProventus Avenicci's Chambers.\nNote the display case; it usually has something valuable inside.\nServant's Quarters.\n&lt;a href=\"Fianna\"&gt;Fianna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gerda\"&gt;Gerda&lt;/a&gt; usually rest here, in the tiny alcove bedrooms off the main food storage and wine vat area.\nChildren's Bedroom.\nThe Jarl\u2019s three children, &lt;a href=\"Nelkir\"&gt;Nelkir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagny\"&gt;Dagny&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frothar\"&gt;Frothar&lt;/a&gt;, sleep here.\nHrongar's Bedroom.\nThe Jarl\u2019s brother, &lt;a href=\"Hrongar\"&gt;Hrongar&lt;/a&gt; sleeps here. The study desk has shelves with books on them.\nJarl's Bedchamber.\nThere are three connected chambers here: a dining area, bedroom, and book-filled study.\nFacilities.\nDragonsreach houses a &lt;a href=\"cooking%20pot\"&gt;cooking pot&lt;/a&gt;, used for creating health and stamina recovery &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt;. As with most places in the game, after missions are completed that help the occupants, most of the food, cutlery, and books in Dragonsreach can be taken freely without worry of stealing.\nDragonsreach's Wizard, Farengar Secret-Fire, has an Alchemy Lab and Arcane Enchanter available for constant use with &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;creating potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting items&lt;/a&gt;. Farengar sells all manner of valuable &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spell Tomes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mage Robes&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is possible for the Dragonborn to retrieve their possessions while still in the dungeon by activating the Prisoner Belongings and Evidence chests, which can be seen through a grate in the underground passage. If caught escaping, the guard will battle the Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt; (an essential character) often joins the fight.\nThe guards will not try to arrest the Dragonborn again, but all possessions will still be in the prison. The door can also be lockpicked, but is a harder lock.

Dragonstar is a mining town, being the home of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Caravan%20Company\"&gt;Dragonstar Caravan Company&lt;/a&gt;. It has been disputed territory between Skyrim and Hammerfell ever since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nDragonstar is located in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Craglorn\"&gt;Upper Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, and this region has been disputed by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim and the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell. Dragonstar is also located in &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; territory, which consists of much of northern Hammerfell. One may consider the region a part of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; since it is located in the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and just south of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Reach\"&gt;Eastern Reach&lt;/a&gt; and its capital, &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. Dragonstar's origins date back to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; where many Nord miners settled in the area to mine a rare material known as &lt;a href=\"Nirncrux\"&gt;Nirncrux&lt;/a&gt;. Dragonstar grew to a small mining village that offered work to incoming passerby. As time went one, Dragonstar grew prosperous to the point where it became a large city that rivaled the likes of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonstar became a large city with strong walls to support it. It was divided into two districts, &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20West\"&gt;Dragonstar West&lt;/a&gt; is located towards Hammerfell while &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20East\"&gt;Dragonstar East&lt;/a&gt; is based towards Skyrim. Dragonstar West became the center of commerce and economics in Dragonstar city. Places such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Fountain\"&gt;Dragon Fountain&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the middle of Dragonstar West; the Bazaar is located south of the Fountain. The city gate leads to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfields\"&gt;Dragonfields&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of Hammerfell. Dragonstar East is where many warriors gather as well as those seeking divine aid. The Dragonstar Arena Pit as well as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; are located here. The local temple is also here.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonstar Caravan Company &amp; the Covenant.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, Dragonstar was a relatively new settlement that was owned by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Caravan%20Company\"&gt;Dragonstar Caravan Company&lt;/a&gt;, a trading company that rivaled the infamous &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, alliances from all corners of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; fought each other for the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Seat of Sundered Kings&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; was an alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the Redguards of Hammerfell, and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Craglorn at the time was not under a centralized authority and because of it, the cities of Dragonstar, &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt;, and Elinhir were not a part of the Covenant and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. These settlements other than Elinhir were formed by criminals trying to start an empire and escape the Imperial laws from the east. Dragonstar was cleaner than the town of Belkarth. The Dragonstar Caravan Company later moved their headquarters to the city of &lt;a href=\"Ska%27vyn\"&gt;Ska'vyn&lt;/a&gt; since there is more traction in the Kingdom of Ska'vyn then in uncharted Dragonstar territory.\nOperation Mantikora and the Iron Orcs.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Dragonstar's miners were contracted by &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Cassipia\"&gt;Regent Cassipia&lt;/a&gt; to mine &lt;a href=\"Nirncrux\"&gt;Nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; from the Upper Craglorn mountains. Cassipia learned that the Nirncrux element had a significant connection to the &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s and that she could utilize the Nirncrux to enhance the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt;' armor in her favor. Cassipia was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;, a group that worship the &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. After she had learned about the power of Nirncrux, she sought to become as powerful as a Celestial and to replace the Serpent as the leader of the Scaled Court. She manipulated a traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; by slaying a creature referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Mantikora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mantikora&lt;/a&gt; and defeating &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Braadoth\"&gt;Exarch Braadoth&lt;/a&gt; of the Iron Orcs. She was defeated in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Reinhold%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Reinhold's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; by the Vestige and other warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shadow of Conflict; War of Bend'r-Mahk.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, the Nords of Skyrim crossed the Reach and invaded the neighboring nations of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt; in a war known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Dragonstar was heavily affected by the war, and as a result, the city changed drastically from before the war. The Skyrim invaders led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Duvais\"&gt;General Duvais&lt;/a&gt; took the eastern district of Dragonstar and used it as a base while the Hammerfell defenders led by &lt;a href=\"Meya%20Violet\"&gt;Meya Violet&lt;/a&gt; kept the western district under Crowns control. Many of Dragonstar's citizens were affected in the battle and were left homeless in its wake. &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt; used the war to nurture a creature made of pure &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt;, or the Shadow of Conflict. A hero known as the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Soul of Conflict&lt;/a&gt; used an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Asuul and the Umbra' Keth at the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict in Dragonstar ended, and the people began to rebuild from the destruction. Dragonstar however, remained divided for quite some time.\nDragonstar during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nThroughout the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Dragonstar in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Dragonstar was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ohatan\"&gt;King Ohatan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWaning years of the Oblivion Crisis.\nSometime around the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the territories of the Western Reach were still being fought over between the Nords and the Bretons and Redguards. The cities of Elinhir and Jehanna continued to fight while the town of Dragonstar continued to be divided into West and East. Frequent terrorist attacks from both sides and vicious street battles continued to plague Dragonstar well after the war had ended. This situation persisted well into the late Third Era, with no resolution in sight."}

Upon completion of \"Dragon Rising,\" the game world irrevocably changes and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is thereafter subject to random dragon attacks, which not only makes travelling around Skyrim hazardous (especially for low-level players), it occasionally results in the death of non-essential NPCs who may still have quests to be completed."}
