Vanus theorises that disrupting the energy source used to power the device will destroy it and thus save Nirn from certain destruction. \nFollow Vanus across the bridge. He will then use his magic to unseal the entrance to the great shackle, so that you can proceed inside. Head inside and down the stairs, then proceed ahead through the corridor. You will be facing many dremora along the way. Head around the corner and north into the power chamber. There, Vanus will rush towards a pedestal that seems similar to the things that trapped him in the black forge. Examine it and you will accidentally reverse the energy flow, drawing power away from the shackle. \nVanus will then tell you to go and do this to the other conduits powering the device. Head through the passage up north. Once you enter this passage, you will hear the voice of &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Tirora\"&gt;Sage Tirora&lt;/a&gt; begging for help. Proceed on, but watch out for the steam traps. Tirora will be in a cage in the room up north; freeing her is optional. The room to the south also holds a prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Treva\"&gt;Treva&lt;/a&gt;. Freeing him is also optional. either way, continue through the passageway and fight your way through many daedra. You will eventually have circled around to the central room and can now enter from the east to reach the top floor. Head up the stairs and activate all the magicka conduits to reverse the flow of energy, then head west. You will have to jump down a ledge here; use the pipes to break your fall. \nAt the end of the hallway, you will find Vanus, Cadwell and the people you saved. Head through the door to the Mooring, where the Great Shackle itself is located. Vanus will start a spell to destroy the shackle; defend him from the hordes of daedra while he is doing this. Cadwell and the people you saved will help you with this. After the Shackle is destroyed, Vanus will think victory over Molag Bal has been achieved, but Cadwell will inform him of the &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Vortex\"&gt;Planar Vortex&lt;/a&gt; caused by the Great Shackle, which is gradually sucking Nirn into Coldharbour. Vanus will then create a portal back to the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;; head through and speak to him to finish the quest. "}

The Hero learns that the few remaining guards are still fighting near the city gate. Head up the path to eventually reach three guards and their captain, &lt;a href=\"Savlian%20Matius\"&gt;Savlian Matius&lt;/a&gt;. He will say that Martin, the heir the Hero is looking for, is trapped inside the city, but he can't come out until the Oblivion Gate has been shut and the courtyard cleared of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion Gate.\nEnter the Kvatch Gate to a &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;hellish world&lt;/a&gt; filled by lava. At this point, two or three other level-dependent &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; will start attacking, but you may get some assistance from &lt;a href=\"Ilend%20Vonius\"&gt;Ilend Vonius&lt;/a&gt;, one of the surviving guards, who went in before if he has not already died. He can be told to stay or leave the choice is entirely optional, at lower levels he will provide some help, but at higher levels (10+) he will die quite quickly.\nStart out by following the path west. The objective will be the large tower in the middle. Like most gate planes, the Hero can choose to wander around and thoroughly explore the plane or simply take the shortest route to the main tower, ignoring most of the rest of the area. Along the way several more level-dependent monsters will be encountered. Watch out for the red &lt;a href=\"Harrada\"&gt;Harrada&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s and other small flora on the ground as these are capable of attacking and hurting the Hero or Ilend, if they chose to bring him.\nOnce inside the Blood Feast tower, kill the monsters and head upstairs. In the room with a spike trap on left side of the wall, take the west door. This will bring them to a walkway that leads to a second tower, Reapers Sprawl. Once inside, move upstairs and kill the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;. They will see another survivor named &lt;a href=\"Menien%20Goneld\"&gt;Menien Goneld&lt;/a&gt; in a cage. He will explain how to shut the gate. He explains that the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Keeper%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Keeper&lt;/a&gt; has a key to open the door to the &lt;a href=\"Sigilium%20Sanguis\"&gt;Sigilium Sanguis&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Sigil Stone resides that keeps the gate open.\u00a0If the Sigil Stone is removed, then the gate will close.\nHead back into the first tower and go through the door to left by using the key. Head up the ramp and enter the door guarded by the Dremora.\u00a0From here on, it is simply a matter of fighting upwards through the Daedra and &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt; in the way. At the top of the tower, take the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; to close the first Oblivion gate. Once done, the building will start to collapse, but the Hero will be safely teleported outside the now-ruined gate.\nBack at Kvatch.\nThe Hero must go back to the Captain and speak to him. He will congratulate them and then ask them to enter the burned-out city on a rescue mission. There will be a few more Daedra in the square beyond the gates which the Hero and their companions must kill. Once all enemies are slain, enter the church where the captain will evacuate the survivors. Note that if the Hero is quick, they can engage Martin in conversation as he is being evacuated. He will agree to follow the Hero, ostensibly to Weynon Priory. The advantage of this is that the Hero gains an essential companion for the rest of the effort to retake the castle.\nNext step.\nAt this point, the Hero can continue with the main quest by taking Martin to &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt; if they have not already done so, or continue with the optional second part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Castle%20Kvatch\"&gt;The Battle for Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;\" by speaking to the Captain."}

In , he had no such anonymity. There, they knew him to be a smuggler, but here, he could be anyone. A lower-class peddler perhaps. A student even. Some people even pushed against him as he walked past as if to say, \"We would not dream of being so rude as to acknowledge that you don't belong here.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Seryne%20Relas\"&gt;Seryne Relas&lt;/a&gt; was not in any of the &lt;a href=\"tavern\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;s, but he knew she was somewhere, perhaps behind a tenement window or poking around in a dunghill for an exotic ingredient for some &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; or another. Of the ways of &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;sorceresses&lt;/a&gt;, he knew only that they were always doing something eccentric. Because of this prejudice, he nearly passed by the old &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman having a drink from a well. It was too prosaic, but he knew from the look of her that she was Seryne Relas, the great sorceress.\n\"I have &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for you,\" he said to her back. \"If you will teach me the secret of breathing water.\"\nShe turned around, a wide wet grin stretched across her weathered features. \"I ain't breathing it, boy. I'm just having a drink.\"\n\"Don't mock me,\" he said, stiffly. \"Either you're Seryne Relas and you will teach me the spell of breathing water, or you aren't. Those are the only possibilities.\"\n\"If you're going to learn to breathe water, you're going to have to learn there are more possibilities than that, boy. The School of Alteration is all about possibilities, changing patterns, making things be what they could be. Maybe I ain't Seryne Relas, but I can teach you how to breathe water,\" she wiped her mouth dry. \"Or maybe I am Seryne Relas and I won't. Or maybe I can teach you to breathe water, but you can't learn.\"\n\"I'll learn,\" he said, simply.\n\"Why don't you just buy yourself a spell of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; over at the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;?\" she asked. \"That's how it's generally done.\"\n\"They're not powerful enough,\" he said. \"I need to be underwater for a long time. I'm willing to pay whatever you ask, but I don't want any questions. I was told you could teach me.\"\n\"What's your name, boy?\"\n\"That's a question,\" he replied. His name was Tharien Winloth, but in , they called him the Tollman. His job, such as it was, was collecting a percentage of the loot from the smugglers when they came into harbor to bring to his boss in the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;. From that percentage, he earned a smaller percentage. In the end it was very small indeed. He had scarcely any gold of his own, and what he had, he gave to Seryne Relas.\nThe lessons began that very day. The sorceress brought her pupil out to a low sandbank along the sea.\n\"I will teach you a powerful spell for breathing water, boy,\" she said. \"But you must become a master of it. As with all spells and all skills, the more you practice, the better you get. Even that ain't enough. To achieve true mastery, you must understand what it is you're doing. It ain't simply enough to perform a perfect thrust of a blade -- you must also know what you are doing and why.\"\n\"That's common sense,\" said Tharien.\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Seryne, closing her eyes. \"But the spells of Alteration are all about uncommon sense. The infinite possibilities, breaking the sky, swallowing space, dancing with time, setting ice on fire, believing the unreal may become real. You must learn the rules of the cosmos and break them.\"\n\"That sounds ... very difficult,\" replied Tharien, trying to keep a straight face.\nSeryne pointed to the small silver fish darting along the water's edge: \"They don't find it so. They breathe water just fine.\"\n\"But that's not magic.\"\n\"What I'm saying to you, boy, is that it is.\"\nFor several weeks, Seryne drilled her student, and the more he understood about what he was doing and the more he practiced, the longer he could breathe underwater. When he found that he could cast the spell for as long as he needed, he thanked the sorceress and bade her farewell.\n\"There is one last lesson I have to teach you,\" she said. \"You must learn that desire is not enough. The world will end your spell no matter how good you are, and no matter how much you want it.\"\n\"That's a lesson I'm happy not to learn,\" he said, and left at once for the short journey .\nThe wharfs (sic) were much the same, with all the same smells, the same sounds, and the same characters. He learned from his mates that the Boss found a new Tollman. They were still looking out for the smuggler ship Morodrung, but they had given up hope of ever seeing it. Tharien knew they would not. He saw it sink in the bay weeks ago. On a moonless night, he cast his spell and dove into the thrashing purple waves. He kept his mind on the world of possibilities, that books could sing, that green was blue, that that water was air, that every stroke and kick brought him closer to a sunken ship filled with treasure. He felt &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; surge all around him as he pushed his way deeper down. Ahead he saw a ghostly shadow of the Morodrung, its mast billowing in a wind of deep-water currents. He also felt his spell begin to fade. He could break reality long enough to breathe water all the way back up to the surface, but not enough to reach the ship.\nThe next night, he dove again, and this time, the spell was stronger. He could see the vessel in detail, clouded over and dusted in sediment. He saw the wound in its hull where it struck the rocks. A glint of gold beckoned from within. But he felt reality closing in, and he had to surface.\nThe third night, he made it into the steerage, past the bloated corpses of the sailors, nibbled and picked apart by fish. Their glassy eyes bulging, their mouths stretched open. Had they only known the spell, he thought briefly, but his mind was more occupied by the gold scattered along the floor that spilled from broken chests and sacks. He considered scooping as much he could carry into his pockets, but a sturdy iron box seemed to bespeak more treasures.\nOn the wall was a row of keys. He took each down and tried it on the locked box, but none opened it. One key, however, was missing. Tharien looked around the room. Where could it be? His eyes went to the corpse of one of the sailors, floating in a dance of death not far from the box, his hands tightly clutching something. It was a key. When the ship had begun to sink, this sailor had evidently gone for the iron box. Whatever was in it had to be very valuable.\nTharien took the sailor's key and opened the box. It was filled with broken glass. He rummaged around until he felt something solid, and pulled out two flasks of some kind of wine. He smiled as he considered the foolishness of the poor alcoholic. This was what was important to the sailor, out of all the treasure in the Morodrung.\nThen, suddenly, Tharien Winloth felt reality.\nHe had not been paying attention to the grim, tireless advance of the world on his spell. It was fading away, his ability to breathe water. There was no time to surface. There was no time to do anything. As he sucked in, his lungs filled with cold, briney water.\nA few days later, the smugglers working on the wharf came upon the drowned body of the former Tollman. Finding a body in the water in was not in itself noteworthy, but the subject that they discussed over many bottles of &lt;a href=\"Flin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;flin&lt;/a&gt; was how it could happen that he drowned with two potions of water breathing in his hands?"}

After she became a Herald, she was met with political opposition from one such Housecarl Mudgeon, saying that \"the engagement of so much effort and expense for so much frivolity and hedonistic behavior in a time of such great peril is an affront to the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;.\" This opposition was not supported, and the New Life Festival continued being held.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20New%20Life%20Festival%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The New Life Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nA scroll has made its way to the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and they must travel to &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; to meet the New Life Herald, Breda.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20Charm%20Challenge\"&gt;Castle Charm Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; and perform at three sections of the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Fish%20Boon%20Feast\"&gt;Fish Boon Feast&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Hissmir\"&gt;Hissmir&lt;/a&gt; and catch three special fish, retrieving them for &lt;a href=\"Gentle-Heart\"&gt;Gentle-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, feeding the residents.\n&lt;a href=\"Lava%20Foot%20Stomp\"&gt;Lava Foot Stomp&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to four taverns in &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and dance in each one while wearing a special pin.\n&lt;a href=\"Mud%20Ball%20Merriment\"&gt;Mud Ball Merriment&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; and throw mud balls at participants or citizens, and finally the three visiting faction ambassadors.\n&lt;a href=\"Signal%20Fire%20Sprint\"&gt;Signal Fire Sprint&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Bergama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt;, speak to &lt;a href=\"Aubatha\"&gt;Aubatha&lt;/a&gt; and light four braziers within the allotted time limit.\n&lt;a href=\"Snow%20Bear%20Plunge\"&gt;Snow Bear Plunge&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to three points within Eastmarch and jump into the freezing waters of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stonetooth%20Bash\"&gt;Stonetooth Bash&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stonetooth%20Fortress\"&gt;Stonetooth Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, speak with &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Borbuga\"&gt;Matron Borbuga&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve supplies for the concurring feast.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Trial%20of%20Five-Clawed%20Guile\"&gt;The Trial of Five-Clawed Guile&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rawl'kha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt; and participate in the Trial of Five-Clawed Guile, opening three chests containing three tokens, and give them to the Rawl'kha Festival Chief, &lt;a href=\"Tumira\"&gt;Tumira&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"War%20Orphan%27s%20Sojourn\"&gt;War Orphan's Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel to &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Eight\"&gt;Temple of the Eight&lt;/a&gt; and donate to &lt;a href=\"Ormurrel\"&gt;Ormurrel&lt;/a&gt;, either by &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or by slaying encroaching &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wildlife&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\n\"You're here for the New Life Festival?

She is involved in two of the first quests for the college. Brelyna becomes a candidate for &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; and a possible &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; assists her with an &lt;a href=\"Brelyna%27s%20Practice\"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;. She resides in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt;, where she has her quarters.\nPersonality.\nBrelyna is a somewhat introverted yet diligent student of the mage arts. Though not as skilled as &lt;a href=\"J%27zargo%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;J'zargo&lt;/a&gt;, she is more than capable and is touted as having natural talent, even though she is a bit clumsy with her spells. Having come from a place where expectations were very high for her as a descendant of a line of powerful &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; mages, Brelyna enjoys the lack of expectations or peer pressure and gladly focuses on studying at the College at a pace that she is comfortable with.\nWhen first spoken to, Brelyna may come across as brusque and unsociable due to her disdain with constant questioning, assuming that the Dragonborn will do the same. She will however quickly apologize and politely introduce herself when they prove otherwise. Afterward, she is often polite when spoken to, if a bit shy.\nBrelyna is not fond of talking about herself, particularly her race, but if inquired about the Dunmer's history to &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; she will explain that many elves visited the College over the years.\nShe also seems to have an innate fondness for reading books, and can often be found doing so wherever she may be.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Lessons\"&gt;First Lessons&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrelyna participates in the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ward&lt;/a&gt; lessons at the college. Along with &lt;a href=\"J%27zargo%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;J'zargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onmund\"&gt;Onmund&lt;/a&gt;, she underestimates the necessity of practicing caution when casting spells. Depending on the Dragonborn's reply to Tolfdir when asked, either her, Onmund, or J'zargo will respond accordingly.\n&lt;a href=\"Under%20Saarthal\"&gt;Under Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn's first lessons at the college, Brelyna accompanies the group to &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt; conducts research regarding several relics found there. &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; assigns her with the task of detecting magical wards.\n&lt;a href=\"Brelyna%27s%20Practice\"&gt;Brelyna's Practice&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrelyna requires assistance with practicing a new spell. The Dragonborn can agree to be the target of her spell. When cast, the first spell turns their vision green. Brelyna then comments that they look \"a little green.\" &lt;a href=\"Wait\"&gt;Wait&lt;/a&gt; for five hours, &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, or finish other &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; until the effect wears off, then return to Brelyna. Attempts with the second spell turn the Dragonborn into several animals. Once Brelyna manages to restore her subject's usual form, she will speak to the player and the quest will complete, unlocking her ability as a follower.\nMarriage.\nAfter the Dragonborn completes the quest Brelyna's Practice, Brelyna becomes a marriage prospect and will offer that option during a conversation if the Dragonborn is wearing the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollower.\nIf the Dragonborn helps Brelyna experiment with her spells, she agrees to become a follower. She can be inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; after arriving at &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat behavior.\nBrelyna is able to deal a significant amount of damage with spells. Brelyna opens every fight with &lt;a href=\"Oakflesh\"&gt;Oakflesh&lt;/a&gt; and uses &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; offensively. She also often &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; to aid her in battles. Due to her low &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; pool, she cannot endure many attacks. Unable to be killed by opponents, she can be killed by the Dragonborn.\nStealth.\nAs with most followers, when &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; she waits for a cue to engage in combat, even refusing to attack an enemy that has engaged her specifically until the Dragonborn breaks stealth.\nAs with all mages, her pathing can sometimes cause her to attack targets which have not been revealed yet. Also, her spells make noise when cast, rendering sneaking somewhat difficult with her along. This can be offset by giving her sneaking-enchanted gear and by choosing battles carefully. She can be instructed to wait if a delicate situation arises.\nEquipment.\nAlthough she equips any &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; given to her, she seldom uses them above &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorality.\nBrelyna disapproves of &lt;a href=\"theft\"&gt;theft&lt;/a&gt; and becomes hostile toward the Dragonborn for doing so. She may also send &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Thug\"&gt;hired thugs&lt;/a&gt; to punish the Dragonborn if they steal from her. However, as a follower, she completely ignores any crimes committed by Dragonborn outside of the College.\nDialogue.\n\"Before you even ask, yes I have an ancestry steeped in magic, and no I don't want to talk about it. Yes, I know Winterhold used to be full of my kind, and no I don't care they're all gone now. Does that cover everything?\"\n\"This is better than sitting around talking about magic, don't you think?\"\nConversations.\nTolfdir: \"Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen. So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous. Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.\"\nBrelyna: \"Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!\"\nTolfdir: \"Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned. What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.\"\nJ'zargo: \"Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!\"\nTolfdir: \"Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.\"\nOnmund: \"But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give use a chance to show you what we can do?\"\nAfter speaking with Tolfdir, and not making a decision:\nOnmund: \"We're all pretty new to this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continueing with out theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can succesfully use it to block spells, all right?\"\nAfter speaking with Tolfdir, and choosing something practical:\nBrelyna: \"See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continueing with out theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can succesfully use it to block spells, all right?\"\nAfter speaking with Tolfdir, and choosing safety first:\nJ'zargo: \"Oh, don't listen to him. We can do it, just give us a chance!\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continueing with out theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic.

I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please. I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history. The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity. I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.\""}

He was tasked to gather data from &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; before it could be a threat for the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor awarded him a high military rank despite not being a warrior, days before he left the Imperial City.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrennus and other sorcerers were escorted by imperial soldiers to gather data from Umbriel. As Brennus made his measurements, they were attacked by a party of zombies. They didn't know the undead could walk away so far from Umbriel. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Falcus\"&gt;Captain Falcus&lt;/a&gt; ordered his men to retreat south.\nIn their retreat, they came across &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Watch\"&gt;Mountain Watch&lt;/a&gt;. They evacuated the villagers and they marched to &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. Brennus wasn't used to keeping pace of the march. A girl named &lt;a href=\"Lorcette\"&gt;Lorcette&lt;/a&gt; offered Brennus her sit in a wagon. When they were about half a mile away from the city walls, the undead approached them. The villagers had to abandon everything and run. Once inside the city, Brennus went to the highest spire of the chapel of Arkay to make some measurements.\nThe imperial legionaries and the Cheydinhal guard broke the line of the wormies so that the citizens could scape from the siege. They hold the line for hours before Falcus gave the order to regroup on the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;. Brennus and Mazgar broke away from the group. They headed to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but they were spotted by a zombie scout party. They run away from them,\nbut Brennus began to falter.\nThey came across a farmstead, they barricaded the door and they prepared to hold the ground. When the zombies managed to take down the door, Brennus casted a spell that desintegrated three zombies. They were rescued by &lt;a href=\"Ilver%20Indarys\"&gt;Ilver Indarys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Thorn\"&gt;Knights of the Thorn&lt;/a&gt;. They talked about the evacuation of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; to the knights, who offered them horses to travel to the Blue Road.\nMazgar and Brennus met with the refugees in the Blue Road. Mazgar was given a field promotion to captain by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Prossos\"&gt;Commander Prossos&lt;/a&gt;. She was sent to explore a hill and make sure it was free of the enemy. Brennus accompanied her during her task. The battle went wrong for the imperial army, so General Takar retreated to the Imperial City. Prossos left Mazgar in charge of the refugees, but she requested him to allow her go to defend the Imperial City. Brennus told Prossos that Mazgar had to escort him. Mazgar thought that Brennus wanted to retreat back to Cheydinhal, but he demanded to come along with her to defend the Imperial City.\nThey crossed &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; by boat. They were attacked by zombies which emerged from the lake. They landed as soon as they could, the surviving soldiers formed a defence line in the shore. Brennus helped as he could. He fell in with Mazgar to rest while they could.\nThey met up with what was left of the Twelfth Legion. They cleared the gate and set up positions to defend it from another siege. Mazgar and Brennus found themselves on the western flank of the action, where little or no fighting was going on. Yet, Umbriel approached the city from that direction, followed by thousands of zombies. Some zombies poured through the gaps that dead soldiers left. Brennus was severely wounded, so Mazgar and him retreated back until their spine was against the wall. Brennus made a semicircle of blue flame around them. Mazgar told him that he would survive, so Brennus told her to do what she had to do. Just when she was going to end with Brennus' life, &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;, and all the wormies became lifeless. Mazgar turned around to ask Brennus what had happened, but Brennus was already dead."}

High Rock and the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; are the only &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel that do not share a land-border with &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. This region is known for its many small villages and towns and for the many grim fortifications that dot the hills and crags around them. These castles are historically the domains of many petty kings and lords that ruled the massive patchwork of small nations that made up High Rock for much of its history.\nPhysiology.\nBretons are the result of interbreeding between the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Dynasty\"&gt;Direnni Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; who settled in High Rock and the local &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt; population. The half-elven population was only permitted to marry humans in the region. This has resulted in a race of men that have a strong affinity for magic, and some retain a haughtiness of manner that is attributed by some to their merish ancestry.\nHistory, culture, and talents.\nBretons share similar culture and language, but are divided politically. According to some accounts they are descendents of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20Galen\"&gt;Druids of Galen&lt;/a&gt;. They became a distinct culture following the decline of the Direnni elves, which also created their fractured political structure.\nThey are highly intelligent, willful, and have an outgoing personality. It is said that Bretons are weaned on magic, for it seems to infuse their very being. Intermingling with &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; blood has given Bretons an affinity for magic, though hardiness is also part of their heritage. Breton culture operates under the feudal system, inherited from their previous Direnni overlords.\nReligion.\nThe main religion in High Rock follows similar lines to that of &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;-worshipping, along with three Elven deities, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sheor\"&gt;Sheor&lt;/a&gt;, who is unique to the Bretons, although most scholars agree that he is an offshoot of the Nordic deity &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;. However, their faith is often loosely held, and their religious moderation roused them to war against the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; in the First Era."}

They are considered an intelligent race in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, known for a proficiency in abstract thinking.\nHistory.\nThe Bretons, like much of the humans, originated from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike said humans, however, the Breton bloodline has some elven ancestry. When &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his sons came to Tamriel, they founded the great city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. On the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of the Tears&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(who previously had an alliance with the new Nords/Humans) sacked and burned the great city. During the attack, the elves took many &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;; some took them west to\u00a0High Rock and others took them south. Eventually, the humans bred with elves, and this is what created the race of Bretons.\u00a0\nPhysiology and culture.\nAncestry.\nBretons are the elven hybrids of &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i ancestry. Because of this, Bretons physiologically appear similar to human races. Their magical talents find explanation in their mer blood.\nProfessions.\nExcelling magically, Bretons make excellent mages and easily escalate through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the guild's highest ranks, including &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master-Wizard\"&gt;Master-Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt; are held, mostly, by Bretons. Eloquent and linguistic by nature, Bretons also make excellent &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;, using their magical expertise to open shops that sell magical wares. &lt;a href=\"The%20Gilded%20Carafe\"&gt;The Gilded Carafe&lt;/a&gt;, run by &lt;a href=\"Claudette%20Perrick\"&gt;Claudette Perrick&lt;/a&gt;, is an example of this.\nUsage.\nBretons are a fairly balanced race. Their lowered &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat compensated by their resistance to magic, although the female lowered strength is somewhat fatal. The magicka boost and skill bonuses make for a powerful mage. &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; is supported by the magicka boost to balance out a Breton into a good &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt;. The Breton strategy in battle is simple: Use destruction spells at the beginning to devastate the opponent until you run out of magicka, then take out a blade and finish them off, using restoration to heal off whatever willpower gives back.\nNames.\nBecause Bretons are based on the ethnic group, their names mirror the French names of these Breton. Although not as common, they use many British and Anglo-Saxon names also. Examples include:"}

Some, however, do take to city life and are a minority in settlements.\nThe Reachmen.\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; reside a group of Bretons, known as the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, historically regarded as a barbaric race involved in dark and extreme practices. Twenty years before the events of \"Skyrim\", the Reachmen were involved in an armed uprising against the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; that ruled &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. They took the city by force, due to a belief that it belonged to the native population. They were soon driven out by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, prior to his own conflict with the Empire.\nThe remaining insurrectionists were later known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is able to assist the Forsworn during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\" This results in the normally hostile Forsworn settlement of &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Druadach Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; to become friendly.\nProfessions.\nBeyond this, Bretons often take the role of &lt;a href=\"court%20wizard\"&gt;court wizard&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, or study as scholars at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.

The same is true for Briarhearts resurrected with the help of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nBriarhearts can be found in the following locations:\nUpon returning to Neloth, he remarks:\nI examined the Briarheart warrior. \"Oh have you? Well, let me just extract those memories and I'll see if you found anything useful. I promise that any unrelated memories I run across will be kept in the strictest of confidences. Here, you deserve a bit of reward for your efforts... that was a lengthy trip for you, I'm sure!\"\nOnce the reward is given, the quest is completed. If later asked about what he has learned from the Briar Heart, he explains:\nWhat did you learn from the Briarheart? \"The connecting soul thread is knotted three times, once for the heart, once for the spirit, and once for the body. The knot gives the connection a strength that may be the key that I've been looking for.\""}

The poet Tracizis called that period of continuous unrest \"days and nights of blood and venom.\" The kings were a petty lot of grasping tyrants, who fought Tiber's attempts to bring order to the land. But they were as disorganized as they were dissolute, and the strong hand of Septim brought peace forcibly to Tamriel. The year was &lt;a href=\"2E%20896\"&gt;2E 896&lt;/a&gt;. The following year, the Emperor declared the beginning of a new Era-thus began the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Year Aught.\nFor thirty-eight years, the Emperor Tiber reigned supreme. It was a lawful, pious, and glorious age, when justice was known to one and all, from serf to sovereign. On Tiber's death, it rained for an entire fortnight as if the land of Tamriel itself was weeping.\nThe Emperor's grandson, Pelagius, came to the throne. Though his reign was short, he was as strong and resolute as his father had been, and Tamriel could have enjoyed a continuation of the Golden Age. Alas, an unknown enemy of the Septim Family hired that accursed organization of cutthroats, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, to kill the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Emperor Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt; as he knelt at prayer at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius Septim's reign lasted less than three years.\nPelagius had no living children, so the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Crown passed to his first cousin, the daughter of Tiber's brother &lt;a href=\"Agnorith\"&gt;Agnorith&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt;, former Queen of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, assumed the throne as Kintyra I. Her reign was blessed with prosperity and good harvests, and she herself was an avid patroness of art, music, and dance.\nKintyra's son was crowned after her death, the first Emperor of Tamriel to use the imperial name Uriel. &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20I\"&gt;Uriel I&lt;/a&gt; was the great lawmaker of the Septim Dynasty, and a promoter of independent organizations and guilds. Under his kind but firm hand, the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; increased in prominence throughout Tamriel. His son and successor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20II\"&gt;Uriel II&lt;/a&gt; reigned for eighteen years, from the death of Uriel I in 3E64 to Pelagius Septim's accession in 3E82. Tragically, the rule of Uriel II was cursed with blights, plagues, and insurrections. The tenderness he inherited from his father did not serve Tamriel well, and little justice was done.\nPelagius II inherited not only the throne from his father, but the debt from the latter's poor financial and judicial management. Pelagius dismissed all of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, and allowed only those willing to pay great sums to resume their seats. He encouraged similar acts among his vassals, the kings of Tamriel, and by the end of his seventeen year reign, Tamriel had returned to prosperity. His critics, however, have suggested that any advisor possessed of wisdom but not of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; had been summarily ousted by Pelagius. This may have led to some of the troubles his son Antiochus faced when he in turn became Emperor.\n&lt;a href=\"Antiochus\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt; was certainly one of the more flamboyant members of the usually austere Septim Family. He had numerous mistresses and nearly as many wives, and was renowned for the grandeur of his dress and his high good humor. Unfortunately, his reign was rife with civil war, surpassing even that of his grandfather Uriel II. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E110&lt;/a&gt;, twelve years after Antiochus assumed the throne, nearly took the province of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt; away from Tamriel. The united alliance of the kings of Summurset and Antiochus only managed to defeat &lt;a href=\"King%20Orghum\"&gt;King Orghum&lt;/a&gt; of the island-kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; due to a freak storm. Legend credits the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; with the sorcery behind the tempest.\nThe story of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt;, heiress to her father Antiochus' throne, is certainly one of the saddest tales in imperial history. Her first cousin Uriel, son of Queen &lt;a href=\"Potema\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, accused Kintyra of being a bastard, alluding to the infamous decadence of the Imperial City during her father's reign. When this accusation failed to stop her coronation, Uriel bought the support of several disgruntled kings of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and with Queen Potema's assistance, he coordinated three attacks on the Septim Empire.\nThe first attack occurred in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region, which separates High Rock and Hammerfell. Kintyra's entourage was massacred and the Empress taken captive. For two years, Kintyra II languished in an Imperial prison believed to be somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril\"&gt;Glenmoril&lt;/a&gt; before she was slain in her cell under mysterious circumstances. The second attack was on a series of Imperial garrisons along the coastal Morrowind islands. The Empress' consort &lt;a href=\"Kontin%20Arynx\"&gt;Kontin Arynx&lt;/a&gt; fell defending the forts. The third and final attack was a siege of the Imperial City itself, occurring after the Elder Council had split up the army to attack western High Rock and eastern Morrowind. The weakened government had little defense against Uriel's determined aggression, and capitulated after only a fortnight of resistance. Uriel took the throne that same evening and proclaimed himself &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor of Tamriel. The year was &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, described in &lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire%2C%20v%202\"&gt;Volume II of this series&lt;/a&gt;."}

Kintyra's murder in &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; while in captivity is considered by some to be the end of the pure strain of Septim blood in the imperial family. Certainly it marks the end of something significant.\n&lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt; not only proclaimed himself Emperor of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but also Uriel Septim III, taking the eminent surname as a title. In truth, his surname was Mantiarco from his father's line. In time, Uriel III was deposed and his crimes reviled, but the tradition of taking the name Septim as a title for the Emperor of Tamriel did not die with him.\nFor six years, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; (which takes its name from the Septim Family's famous badge) tore the Empire apart. The combatants were the three surviving children of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;-and their various offspring. Potema, of course, supported her son Uriel III, and had the combined support of all of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. With the efforts of Cephorus and Magnus, however, the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; turned coat. The provinces of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summurset%20Isle\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; were divided in their loyalty, but most kings supported Cephorus and Magnus.\nIn 3E127, Uriel III was captured at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell. En route to his trial in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, a mob overtook his prisoner's carriage and burned him alive within it. His captor and uncle continued on to the Imperial City, and by common acclaim was proclaimed Cephorus I, Emperor of Tamriel.\nCephorus' reign was marked by nothing but war. By all accounts, he was a kind and intelligent man, but what Tamriel needed was a great warrior -- and he, fortunately, was that. It took an additional ten years of constant warfare for him to defeat his sister Potema. The so-called Wolf Queen of Solitude who died in the siege of her city-state in the year 137. Cephorus survived his sister by only three years. He never had time during the war years to marry, so it was his brother, the fourth child of Pelagius Septim II, who assumed the throne.\nThe Emperor Magnus was already elderly when he took up the imperial diadem, and the business of punishing the traitorous kings of the War of the Red Diamond drained much of his remaining strength. Legend accuses Magnus' son and heir &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; of patricide, but that seems highly unlikely-for no other reason than that Pelagius was King of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; following the death of Potema, and seldom visited the Imperial City.\nPelagius Septim III, sometimes called Pelagius the Mad, was proclaimed Emperor in the 145th year of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Almost from the start, his eccentricities of behaviour were noted at court. He embarrassed dignitaries, offended his vassal kings, and on one occasion marked the end of an imperial grand ball by attempting to hang himself. His long-suffering wife was finally awarded the Regency of Tamriel, and Pelagius Septim III was sent to a series of healing institutions and asylums until his death in 3E153 at the age of thirty-four.\nThe Empress Regent of Tamriel was proclaimed Empress &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20I\"&gt;Katariah I&lt;/a&gt; upon the death of her husband. Some who do not mark the end of the Septim bloodline with the death of Kintyra II consider the ascendancy of this &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; woman the true mark of its decline. Her defenders, on the other hand, assert that though Katariah was not descended from Tiber, the son she had with Pelagius was, so the imperial chain did continue. Despite racist assertions to the contrary, Katariah's forty-six-year reign was one of the most celebrated in Tamriel's history. Uncomfortable in the Imperial City, Katariah traveled extensively throughout the Empire such as no Emperor ever had since Tiber's day. She repaired much of the damage that previous emperor's broken alliances and bungled diplomacy created. The people of Tamriel came to love their Empress far more than the &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt; did. Katariah's death in a minor skirmish in Black Marsh is a favorite subject of conspiracy minded historians. The Sage Montalius' discovery, for instance, of a disenfranchised branch of the Septim Family and their involvement with the skirmish was a revelation indeed.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Cassynder\"&gt;Cassynder&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne upon the death of his mother, he was already middle-aged. Only half Elven, he aged like a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, he had left the rule of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; to his half-brother Uriel due to poor health. Nevertheless, as the only true blood relation of Pelagius and thus Tiber, he was pressed into accepting the throne. To no one's surprise, the Emperor Cassynder's reign did not last long. In two years he joined his predecessors in eternal slumber.\n&lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Lariat\"&gt;Uriel Lariat&lt;/a&gt;, Cassynder's half-brother, and the child of Katariah I and her Imperial consort &lt;a href=\"Gallivere%20Lariat\"&gt;Gallivere Lariat&lt;/a&gt; (after the death of Pelagius Septim III), left the kingdom of Wayrest to reign as Uriel IV. Legally, Uriel IV was a Septim: Cassynder had adopted him into the royal family when he had become King of Wayrest. Nevertheless, to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt; and the people of Tamriel, he was a bastard child of Katariah. Uriel did not possess the dynamism of his mother, and his long forty-three-year reign was a hotbed of sedition.\nUriel IV's story is told in the &lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire%2C%20Book%20III\"&gt;third volume of this series&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire%2C%20v%202\"&gt;second volume&lt;/a&gt; described the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and the six Emperors that followed its aftermath, from &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cassynder\"&gt;Cassynder&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of that volume, it was described how the Emperor Cassynder's half-brother &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel IV&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne of the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt will be recalled that Uriel IV was not a Septim by birth. His mother, though she reigned as Empress for many years, was a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; married to a true Septim Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;'s father was actually &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah's&lt;/a&gt; consort after Pelagius' death, a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; nobleman named &lt;a href=\"Gallivere%20Lariat\"&gt;Gallivere Lariat&lt;/a&gt;. Before taking the throne of Empire, Cassynder had ruled the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, but poor health had forced him to retire. Cassynder had no children, so he legally adopted his half-brother Uriel and abdicated the kingdom. Seven years later, Cassynder inherited the Empire at the death of his mother. Three years after that, Uriel once again found himself the recipient of Cassynder's inheritance.\nUriel IV's reign was a long and difficult one. Despite being a legally adopted member of the Septim Family, and despite the Lariat Family's high position -- indeed, they were distant cousins of the Septims -- few of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; could be persuaded to accept him fully as a blood descendant of Tiber. The Council had assumed much responsibility during Katariah's long reign and Cassynder's short one, and a strong-willed \"alien\" monarch like Uriel IV found it impossible to command their unswerving fealty. Time and again the Council and Emperor were at odds, and time and again the Council won the battles. Since the days of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, the Elder Council had consisted of the wealthiest men and women in the Empire, and the power they wielded was conclusive.\nThe Council's last victory over Uriel IV was posthumous. &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel IV's son, was disinherited by vote of Council, and a cousin more closely related to the original Septim line was proclaimed &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20II\"&gt;Cephorus II&lt;/a&gt; in 3E247. For the first nine years of Cephorus II's reign, those loyal to Andorak Septim battled the Imperial forces. In an act that the Sage Eraintine called \"Tiber Septim's heart beating no more,\" the Council granted Andorak Septim the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; to end the war, and Andorak Septim's descendants still rule there.\nBy and large, Cephorus II had foes that demanded more of his attention than Andorak. \"From out of a cimmerian nightmare,\" in the words of Eraintine, a man who called himself the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; led an army of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and undead warriors on a rampage through &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, conquering kingdom after kingdom. Few could resist his onslaughts, and as month turned to bloody month in the year 3E249, even fewer tried. Cephorus II sent more and more mercenaries into &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to stop the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Usurper's&lt;/a&gt; northward march, but they were bribed or slaughtered and raised as undead.\nThe story of the Camoran Usurper deserves a book of its own. (It is recommended that the reader find &lt;a href=\"Palaux%20Illthre\"&gt;Palaux Illthre's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20the%20Usurper\"&gt;The Fall of the Usurper&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.) In short, however, the destruction of the forces of the Usurper had little do with the efforts of the Emperor. The result was a great regional victory and an increase in hostility toward the seemingly inefficacious Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt;, Cephorus II's son and successor, swiveled opinion back toward the latent power of the Empire. Turning the attention of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; away from internal strife, Uriel V embarked on a series of invasions beginning almost from the moment he took the throne in 3E 268. Uriel V conquered &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt; in 271, &lt;a href=\"Cathnoquey\"&gt;Cathnoquey&lt;/a&gt; in 276, &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt; in 279, and &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt; in 284. In 3E 288, he embarked on his most ambitious enterprise, the invasion of the continent kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. This ultimately proved a failure, for two years later Uriel V was killed in Akavir on the battlefield of . Nevertheless, Uriel V holds a reputation second only to Tiber as one of the two great Warrior Emperors of Tamriel.\nThe last four Emperors, beginning with Uriel V's infant son, are described in the &lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire%2C%20v%204\"&gt;fourth and final volume&lt;/a&gt; of this series."}

The &lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire%2C%20Book%20II\"&gt;second volume&lt;/a&gt; described the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; and the six Emperors who followed. The &lt;a href=\"Brief%20History%20of%20the%20Empire%2C%20Book%20III\"&gt;third volume&lt;/a&gt; described the troubles of the next three Emperors-the frustrated &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20IV\"&gt;Uriel IV&lt;/a&gt;, the ineffectual &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20II\"&gt;Cephorus II&lt;/a&gt;, and the heroic &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Uriel V's death across the sea in distant, hostile &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20VI\"&gt;Uriel VI&lt;/a&gt; was but five years old. In fact, Uriel VI was born only shortly before his father left for Akavir. Uriel V's only other progeny, by a morganatic alliance, were the twins &lt;a href=\"Morihatha\"&gt;Morihatha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eloisa\"&gt;Eloisa&lt;/a&gt;, who had been born a month after Uriel V left. Uriel VI was crowned in the 290th year of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial Consort &lt;a href=\"Thonica\"&gt;Thonica&lt;/a&gt;, as the boy's mother, was given a restricted Regency until Uriel VI reached his majority. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; retained the real power, as they had ever since the days of &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Council so enjoyed its unlimited and unrestricted freedom to promulgate laws (and generate profits) that Uriel VI was not given full license to rule until 307, when he was already 22 years old. He had been slowly assuming positions of responsibility for years, but both the Council and his mother, who enjoyed even her limited Regency, were loath to hand over the reins. By the time he came to the throne, the mechanisms of government gave him little power except for that of the imperial veto.\nThis power, however, he regularly and vigorously exercised. By 313, Uriel VI could boast with conviction that he truly did rule &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. He utilized defunct spy networks and guard units to bully and coerce the difficult members of the Elder Council. His half-sister Morihatha Septim was (not surprisingly) his staunchest ally, especially after her marriage to Baron &lt;a href=\"Ulfe%20Gersen\"&gt;Ulfe Gersen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; brought her considerable wealth and influence. As the Sage &lt;a href=\"Ugaridge\"&gt;Ugaridge&lt;/a&gt; said, \"Uriel V conquered &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt;, but Uriel VI conquered the Elder Council.\"\nWhen Uriel VI fell off a horse and could not be resuscitated by the finest Imperial healers, his beloved sister Morihatha took up the imperial tiara. At 25 years of age, she had been described by (admittedly self-serving) diplomats as the most beautiful creature in all of Tamriel. She was certainly well-learned, vivacious, athletic, and a well-practiced politician. She brought the &lt;a href=\"Archmagister\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and created the second &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; since the days of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorihatha finished the job her brother had begun, and made the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; a true government under the Empress (and later, the Emperor). Outside the Cyrodiil, however, the Empire had been slowly disintegrating. Open revolutions and civil wars had raged unchallenged since the days of her grandfather &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20II\"&gt;Cephorus II&lt;/a&gt;. Carefully coordinating her counterattacks, Morihatha Septim slowly claimed back her rebellious vassals, always avoiding overextending herself.\nThough Morihatha's military campaigns were remarkably successful, her deliberate pace often frustrated the Council. One Councilman, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; who took the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; name of &lt;a href=\"Thoricles%20Romus\"&gt;Thoricles Romus&lt;/a&gt;, furious at her refusal to send troops to his troubled &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, is commonly believed to have hired the assassins who claimed her life in 3E 339. Romus was summarily tried and executed, though he protested his innocence to the last.\nMorihatha had no surviving children, and Eloisa had died of a fever four years before. Eloisa's 25-year-old son &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; was thus crowned Pelagius Septim IV. Pelagius Septim IV continued his aunt's work, slowly bringing back under his wing the radical and refractory kingdoms, duchies, and baronies of the Empire. He exercised Morihatha's poise and circumspect pace in his endeavours-but alas, he did not attain her success. The kingdoms had been free of constraint for so long that even a benign Imperial presence was considered odious. Nevertheless, when Pelagius died after a notably stable and prosperous twenty-nine-year reign, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was closer to unity than it had been since the days of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20I\"&gt;Uriel I&lt;/a&gt;.\nOur current Emperor, His Awesome and Terrible Majesty, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, son of Pelagius, has the diligence of his great-aunt Morihatha, the political skill of his great-uncle Uriel VI, and the military prowess of his great grand-uncle Uriel V. For twenty-one years he reigned and brought justice and order to Tamriel. In the year 3E389, however, his Imperial Battlemage, &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed him.\nUriel VII was imprisoned in a dimension of Tharn's creation, and Tharn used his sorcery of illusion to assume the Emperor's aspect. For the next ten years, Tharn abused imperial privilege but did not continue Uriel VII's schedule of reconquest. It is not yet entirely known what Tharn's goals and personal accomplishments were during the ten years he masqueraded as his liege lord. In 3E399, an enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; defeated the Battlemage in the dungeons of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed Uriel VII from his other-dimensional jail.\nSince his emancipation, Uriel Septim VII has worked diligently to renew the battles that would reunite Tamriel. Tharn's interference broke the momentum, it is true -- but the years since then have proven that there is hope of the Golden Age of Tiber Septim's rule glorifying Tamriel once again."}

Deeper in, the Relic Vault can be &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lockpicked&lt;/a&gt;\u2014doing so gives experience and access to additional gear.\nHead into the Tomb of the Grand Adepts.

Go into Star Haven Grounds, fighting or avoiding the &lt;a href=\"Euraxian%20Legion\"&gt;Euraxian soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, and go up the ladder. Blowing the horn will destroy it, but not before grounding the dragon.\nHead back down and into the Adeptorium. Here, the dragon (&lt;a href=\"Bahlokdaan\"&gt;Bahlokdaan&lt;/a&gt;) must be fought, with the Grand Adept healing the Vestige and Zamarak attacking with a bow. The dragon has a great deal amount of health, but will only need to be fought for some time before &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; calls him away.\nHead past where the dragon fled and into the courtyard.

{"id": "875872", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=875872", "title": "Arenthia", "text": "Arenthia is one of the eight major cities in the province of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, being the largest settlement of the western side of &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;. Arenthia is the center of disputed territory, on the lower edge of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;. Much of Arenthia is inspired by the Colovians and the Khajiits, rather than the Wood Elves in the land.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nAs mentioned earlier, Arenthia is a disputed territory. Historically, the city-state of Arenthia is located in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, which expands all throughout Western Cyrodiil, and areas beyond those borders, (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arenthia%20Vale\"&gt;Arenthia Vale&lt;/a&gt;). While currently, Arenthia is located in the Valenwood side of Reaper's March, the border region shared with Elsweyr. Arenthia is a bustling port, not only is it a large settlement in Reaper's March, but it is located where the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; meets the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20River\"&gt;Crescent River&lt;/a&gt;, to which it later goes towards the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of the mainland, Arenthia has roads towards Reaper's March, but also towards the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt; and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, which is across the Strid River. Since the Crescent River serves as a border between Valenwood and Elsweyr, one would assume that Arenthia was located in the east, but that portion of land is occupied by the Wood Elves.\nArenthia city is separated into four to five separate districts. The Main District is the center of commerce in the city, housing the town square and the various merchants and guilds that operate in the region. The main road runs through the district, and it goes towards the bridge across the Strid. Diverging east with lead to the Arenthian Harbor, with several warehouses and port on the Strid. To the south is the Tower District, which contains various homes and a watchtower that serves as a bulwark for Arenthia. To the east of that is the Temple District, which contains the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Arenthia%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the Temple was abandoned and used by the &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; Kingpins of Reaper's March as their base of operations. To the north is the Residential District, which contains various homes and a &lt;a href=\"The%20Pious%20Arenthi-Inn\"&gt;The Pious Arenthi-Inn&lt;/a&gt;, the largest inn on this side of the Crescent.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ancient Wood Elves &amp; the Rise of Arenthia.\nLike many other sects of &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, the Bosmer left the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; due to the High Elves and their superiority complex. The modern-day Wood Elves traveled into the forests of Valenwood, spreading out into different clans, long before the monarchy of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the first wood elf to establish leadership in Ancient Valenwood was &lt;a href=\"King%20Arenthia\"&gt;King Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, whose reign is largely unknown. As time went on, King Arenthia passed away, and the modern-day settlement of Arenthia was named after him, honoring his memory throughout the eras. Eventually, the original Wood Elf settlement was defuncted and a new &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; settlement was built atop of it, bringing about the modern-day Arenthia.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Looter's Paradise; the Vinedusk &amp; Dakarn.\nDuring the waning years of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Border Scouts of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt; had overlooked Reaper's March, specifically in the plains of &lt;a href=\"Dawnmead\"&gt;Dawnmead&lt;/a&gt;, governing the land from large bandit groups such as the early &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Tribe\"&gt;Vinedusk Tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dakarn%20Clan\"&gt;Dakarn Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Border Scouts had disappeared, and both factions constantly took control over the fortress. Sphinxmoth had earned the nickname, a \"Looter's Paradise\" because of how valued it is to Reaper's March. Eventually, both factions grew to phenomenal heights that threaten the entire region. The Vinedusk had overreached and planned a raid on Arenthia, while the Dakarn established organized crime from the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thizzrini%20Arena\"&gt;Thizzrini Arena&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, people from both sides of the border began to band together and revolt against the Vinedusk and Dakarn, which had succeeded in their favor. The Vinedusk had become the Vinedusk Rangers, which became a militia group dedicated to Valenwood's safety and the King's word, while the Dakarn became the &lt;a href=\"Duneguard%20Outwalkers\"&gt;Duneguard Outwalkers&lt;/a&gt;. Peace in Reaper's March returned.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Colovian Occupation &amp; the Dark Mane.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Arenthia was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20the%20West%20Weald\"&gt;Legion of the West Weald&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Lavinia%20Axius\"&gt;General Lavinia Axius&lt;/a&gt;. The combined forces of the Court of Skingrad and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; had given the Legion, the honor of forcefully annexing the Arenthian Vale. And so, General Axius captured Arenthia and moved southwards to the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Village\"&gt;Vinedusk Village&lt;/a&gt;. All the while, &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;House Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had worked alongside the West Weald Legion, spreading his influence throughout Reaper's March. The citizens of Arenthia had become restless due to their unwarranted control, and so they decided to fight back. Clanmother &lt;a href=\"Kazirra\"&gt;Kazirra&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"Arenthian%20Resistance\"&gt;Arenthian Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and worked together with the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; to usurp the Legion and retake Arenthia. With the help of an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion, General Lavinia was killed, but Javad's &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Cult\"&gt;Stonefire Cult&lt;/a&gt; had built a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the Temple District. The Agent fought through the catacombs and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mane\"&gt;Dark Mane&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupted form of the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt;. With the Colovian's occupation of Arenthia over, Akkhuz-ri stepped down as Mane and left the position to his &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Champions\"&gt;Lunar Champions&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Javad escaped Arenthia and continued throughout Reaper's March. Clanmother Kazirra ruled over Arenthia in the name of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camoran Usurper; the Rise and Fall.\nSometime around &lt;a href=\"3E%20249\"&gt;3E 249&lt;/a&gt;, two brothers of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Kaltos\"&gt;Camoran Kaltos&lt;/a&gt; were both vying for the throne at &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;. Haymon was rather adamant with taking the throne and had usurped the throne by force and sought conquest all over Valenwood and the entirety of West Tamriel. The Camoran Usurper had amassed an army from the city-state of Arenthia, supposedly consisting of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and other malicious creatures. In reality, the Usurper had started a collective of Redguard and Bosmer mercenaries that swept a storm from the Strid River, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Camoran Usurper's Invasion&lt;/a&gt; came to a halt at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt;, by the combined forces led by the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the Hart-King was defeated, and Kaltos Camoran ruled the Camoran Dynasty.\nArenthia during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Arenthia in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Arenthia was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Coman\"&gt;King Coman&lt;/a&gt;."}

No one is forcing us to stay, but we don't know how they would react if we told them that we are leaving. We don't wish to swear allegiance to any of the warring factions. We just want to live our lives in peace, and as far away from the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; slavers as possible.\nI haven't had a chance to write, we've been constantly on the move for so long now. It feels like months but I know it's only been a few weeks. We attempted to establish a town on edge of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; but we were chased out by a group of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Scouts - apparently some large battle was about to take place. My feet are sore but we must keep walking if we wish to find a new home.\nWe've made our way to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, to an area called &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; seem friendly here. We heard there was trouble in the north, but we've seen none of it.\nI can't believe this is happening! We've been given a piece of land by the Wood Elves. In return, we will give some of the fish we catch to them. Finally, a home where we can live in peace.\n&lt;a href=\"Forest-Child\"&gt;Forest-Child&lt;/a&gt; has taken an interest in me lately and I must say, it's most welcome. I didn't have time to think about love, romance or the future while we were traveling but now that we have a new home I want more than my bed mat and roof over my head, I want someone to share it with.\nI heard rumors of a great battle to the north. The Wood Elves were fighting each other, but now they aren't. The &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; sailed here in great ships and stopped the fighting. Now they are meeting in &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;. None of this has changed life in the Gray Mire.\nSoldiers from this new \"&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;\" arrived recently. We thought they were just passing through, but it looks like they are setting up camp outside our town. We can't get anything out of them. Whenever anyone asks what they are doing they reply it's none of our business. But they're leaving us alone, so we continue to fish.\nThe soldiers put up gates and tall walls around our town this morning. It's starting to feel like Black Marsh all over again. We refused to join the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; because we would have had to live side-by-side with the Dunmeri slavers that took away so many years of our lives. And now, when we thought we finally found a new home among the Wood Elves, the high and mighty &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; deem us unworthy. I thought that &lt;a href=\"Slim-Jah\"&gt;Slim-Jah&lt;/a&gt; was overreacting. She said the Dominion's arrival would mean our destruction. I'm starting to believe she is right."}

{"id": "96174", "revid": "3257405", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=96174", "title": "Argonians", "text": "Argonians or Saxhleel are an oviparous race of reptilian people native to the large and marshy province of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. They can be found in smaller numbers throughout the continent. Argonians are one of the few races completely unrelated to men and mer, who think of themselves as coming from, and ultimately returning to, the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnigmatic and intelligent, the Argonians are experts of guerrilla tactics, and their natural abilities suit their swampy homeland. They have developed immunities to diseases that have plagued many would-be explorers in the region, and they are capable of easily exploring underwater locations due to their ability to &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;breathe water&lt;/a&gt;. Argonians also have some resistance to poison.\nBlack Marsh.\nBlack Marsh, (also known as \"Argonia\"), is one of the nine Provinces of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and the homeland of the Argonians. The Argonians are perfectly adapted to these swampland rainforests. The province is filled with \"great inland waterways and impenetrable swamps.\" The dense forests, swampy inland rivers, and mangrove thickets make it nearly impossible to reach the interior of Black Marsh, unless one is an Argonian. Explorers who are not Argonian usually end up dead, killed by the native fauna of Black Marsh, disease, or the Argonians. Because of this, only the native Argonians can successfully travel the province.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of neighboring &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; have made a practice of raiding the region for slaves, and this is particularly practiced by members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nArgonians start out in life as eggs; when a clutch of Argonian eggs is laid, they are placed near Hist trees in areas known as hatching pools. When the eggs hatch, they form a connection to the Hist. If, for whatever reason, this connection to the Hist is not present or is severed, the unborn within the eggs die. This was used to terrible effect during the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, when an Altmer alchemist named Ruuvitar nearly succeeded in wiping out an entire generation of unborn Argonians using a relic called the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was thwarted by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, though not before most of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt; eggs were destroyed. In extreme circumstances however, the Argonians, or rather \"The Hist\" can adapt to climates that are too cold for eggs, which allow a female Argonian to bear a child. This same rule applies to small nomadic tribes of Argonians.\nAfter being born, Argonian hatchlings drink the sap of the Hist and continue doing this through their infancy. According to them, the sap of the hist tree, when drank, gives a hatchling its soul. When that Argonian dies, his soul travels back to its Hist tree and is stored until another hatchling drinks that Hist. Thus, the Hist is giving it a soul, and so the cycle repeats. It is unknown if a hatchling would really have a soul of its own without receiving one from the Hist.\nBecause of the birthing rituals in Black Marsh and the hatchlings' dependency on the Hist, it is considered rare for a hatchling to be born out of the province and away from the connection of the trees: but it is possible. One Argonian, named Ja-Reet, was born into slavery in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and was deprived of the Hist as a hatchling, but eventually returned to Black Marsh with a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman that he had married. Although able to function in other societies, he was described as \"disadvantaged,\" or maladjusted, in Argonian society and unable to understand Argonian social cues and body language; this of course was blamed on his lack of connection to the Hist.\nHow Argonians go through maturity is rather debated and poorly understood; sometimes it is stated that when an Argonian grows through infancy the Hist sap that it licks from the tree determines its gender and appearance. Ja-Reet's case somewhat renders this moot: as he was born away from the trees and matured without the sap, becoming an adult male without the influence of the Hist. In addition, Argonians can change their genders throughout their lives through the hist. The &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, allow Argonians to change many aspects of theirselves, gender being only one of them. Something deep within these individuals calls for them to undergo this change. It is not known if it is the Hist's will, or simply their own. The Tree-Minder of the tribe aids to prepare the ceremony. The Hist and spirit of the Argonian combine. Once the ceremony is finished, the newly transformed soul is introduced to the tribe, followed by a great celebration.\nArgonians have gills on their necks and are covered in scales. This gives Argonians the ability to breathe underwater, which has proven to be an advantage in combat with other races, especially in the swamps of Black Marsh. Argonians are trained in guerilla warfare and drown their enemies by dragging them to the water and holding them under. Soldiers walking alongside rivers, travelling on ships in the ocean or barges along the rivers have been attacked by Argonians that ambushed them from the water where they lay in wait. They then either kill them or they are forced to flee back into the water and vanish into the depths. Either way it is an effective strategy as they cannot be followed into the deeper oceans and rivers.\nDuring their war with the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, some Argonians built headquarters and camps on the bottom of lakes and rivers to guarantee safety. Even if they could be reached, the Argonian gills, fins, propelling tails, sharp teeth, claws, and underwater sight mean that fighting one in the water would be nothing short of suicide.\nArgonians have very sharp reptilian teeth lining their mouths, which, if they are unarmed, can be used as an effective weapon. If an Argonian becomes a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, it appears to age tenfold and its eyes turn light red and nearly blank, though their pupils are still clearly visible. Argonians are the only playable race aside from the Khajiit to have tails. When swimming, they use their tails to propel themselves as they glide through the water. An Argonian's tail is also used for balance which gives them an extra advantage in certain situations. This is one of the many reasons Argonians are effective as thieves and assassins. Despite female Argonians are also portrayed to have breasts, they might just be big bumps on their chests.\nArgonians have a wide variety of cranial features such as fins, feathers, ridges, spines, spikes, or horns.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; were a breed of Argonian who resembled puff adders with legs and arms and whose height ranged from seven to eight feet tall. They had black scales, black eyes, and large mouths full of fangs. They generally lived in the inner swamps of Black Marsh and had very little contact with the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and other races that were not native to Black Marsh.\nWhen an Argonian dies, their soul travels into the Hist trees, thus they pass on their memories to each new generation. However, it was shown that the memories can be lost in the \"river's current,\" the passage of time, but if the knowledge is vital it will be recovered by the Hist. This is shown when the Hissmir Hist shows the inhabitants how to use Hist Amber to power the city's defenses against a Dominion attack. However, it is unknown what happens if an Argonian dies not in proximity to a Hist, if they still travel to the closest Hist, or if they simply cease to be, their memories lost forever.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome Argonians say that the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; created the Argonians to see for them the world where they cannot walk.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known of the ancient history of the Argonians during this Era, following the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. Largely removed from Tamriel's history during the Merethic Era, Argonian society was supposedly at its height during this time period; having an advanced civilization that built the great &lt;a href=\"Xanmeer\"&gt;Xanmeer&lt;/a&gt; pyramids of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Mysteriously, sometime near the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Xanmeer society was wiped out from unknown causes. Possible blame for this may rest with the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleids'&lt;/a&gt; incursion into the region, or the catastrophic events of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; war, but no one really knows.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known about what occurred in Argonia or Argonians in general during much of the First Era, as the few Argonians that left the province were very rare and they themselves did not talk about their history, preferring to integrate themselves into the larger Tamrielic cultures. The region and, by extension Argonians themselves, stayed independent of the Tamrielic Empire until the twenty-ninth century of the First Era.\nIt is known that there was a very successful enterprise of bandits and thieves that had long been exploiting the swampland of southeastern Tamriel, which was lead by most infamous of the brigadiers, \"Red\" &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bramman\"&gt;Bramman&lt;/a&gt;. The coastline along the east of Topal Bay had become notorious for acts of piracy because of these Bandits and thieves, and in 1E 1033, the Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; demanded the head of Bramman.\nAfter many an unsuccessful battle in the Bay, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; discovered the pirate-king's means of escaping capture: a narrow, winding river which emptied into the Bay near Soulrest, its mouth was screened by dense thickets of mangroves. The Imperial Fleet followed the course deeper into the heart of Black Marsh than any non-Argonian had ever been before. They eventually caught Bramman in his bandit kingdom not far from what is now called &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt;, and took his head for the Empress.\nThe Argonians were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. Following this defeat, the Argonians retreated to &lt;a href=\"Helstrom\"&gt;Helstrom&lt;/a&gt;, where the Imperials would not follow them. Slave traders exploited the Argonians, and \"entire tribes of Argonians were dragged in chains\" to the Dunmer land. Warlord dynasties were formed by former Imperial officers, who \"earned a reputation for tyranny even in those dark times.\"\nThe land that had once been a haven for Tamriel's criminals became its greatest prison state. Anyone considered too dangerous to hold in \"civilized\" dungeons in other provinces was sent to Black Marsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven less is known about Argonian history in the Second Era. The only known recorded event occurred in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, when the Argonians responded against their tyrannical oppressors with the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;. Whether the terrible Khahaten Flu arose from natural causes, or was created by an Argonian shaman in retaliation for his people's oppression is still a matter of debate, but its result is clear. The plague began in &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly spread to every corner of Black Marsh, killing all those not of reptilian stock. For over forty years, it held the province in its grip, destroying entire cultures, (notably, the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;), and driving outsiders from the land.\nEven when the land became habitable again, fear of the disease kept most outsiders away. &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind continued to send slavers into the north, but few others saw any reason to trouble themselves with the land. Even &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, it was said, thought twice before conquering Black Marsh for his new Empire. The borders of the province fell easily to his forces, but he wisely decided to avoid strategically unimportant inner swamps, and thus met with little resistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the Third Era most of Argonia had been assimilated into the empire with the exception of Helstrom. Helstrom is in the center of \"Murkwood,\" an area of marsh in the center of Argonia where it is almost impossible for non-Argonians to travel, so is the center of non-Imperial Black Marsh. This is also where the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt; uprising, (which took place during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;), saw the Argonians exact revenge for the slavery that they suffered from &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn approximately &lt;a href=\"3E%20200\"&gt;3E 200&lt;/a&gt;, during the reign of Katariah, there was a massacre at the village of &lt;a href=\"Armanias\"&gt;Armanias&lt;/a&gt; due to a lack of sufficient armor.\nIt is believed that the Hist were able to prophesy the coming of the Oblivion crisis and were able to call the \"people\" back to Black Marsh. Furthermore, they were able to coordinate the defense of Black Marsh and defeated the forces of Mehrunes Dagon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, a faction known as the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; (an Argonian political faction comprised of several powerful clans, including the Scale-Song) rallied the Argonians against the Daedra after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Battle of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. When the Oblivion Gates opened in Black Marsh, the Daedra did not so much flood into Argonia as the Argonians did into Oblivion. The natives fought and defeated the Daedra on their own turf, doing so with such success that the Dremora lieutenants actually closed their Gates themselves to prevent being overrun, an occurrence unheard of in the other provinces. Thus, the An-Xileel held Black Marsh until &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; ended the Oblivion Crisis and closed the Gates forever.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Argonia seceded from the Empire, making Black Marsh into an independent province. In the aftermath of the Red Year (4E 6), the Argonians invaded Morrowind, in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt;. The war was used by the Argonians both to exact revenge on the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; for their past enslavement of Argonians, and to conquer territories lost in the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;. The Argonians were able to conquer most of southern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, but were eventually repelled in a counter-offensive led by &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. They appear to be neutral to the ongoing hostilities between the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nVery little is known about the Argonian culture as of the Fourth Era. The difficult terrain within the Black Marsh, coupled with the apparent isolationist policies of the Argonians, renders this largely a mystery. It is known that great emphasis is placed upon the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, the strange trees that are abundant in the Marsh. Even what little is known about the Hist is the subject of much rumor and speculation. It is believed that the Argonians are somehow co-dependent upon the trees, and that the Hist forms some sort of hive-mind.\n&lt;a href=\"Marriage\"&gt;Marital&lt;/a&gt; customs among the Argonians is one of the few widely-known aspects of Argonian life. Unlike the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, who prefer to marry using an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, some Argonians adhere to their native marriage traditions. In &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, it is customary to present a lover with an Argonian Wedding Band, which is crafted by the courting member. Each ring is unique and has personal meaning to the creator and the recipient. The actual ceremony of marriage is very long and complex, and involves unique rituals, spoken in the native language of the Argonians.\nHowever the part of their culture which is fully known to any outsider of Black Marsh, is the Argonian's expertise in guerrilla warfare. Centuries of cruel Dunmer slavery has caused the Argonians to rebel many times. Though Argonia as a whole throughout most of its history could never enter a full war with the Dark Elves, they have mastered the way of ambushes and hit and run tactics to achieve their political aims.\nArgonian culture in Black Marsh is not fully understood. Some evidence suggests that, like the Khajiit, the Argonian lifestyle is tribal. However, considering references to the Royal Court of Argonia and the existence of the Shadowscales, the presence of some form of organized Argonian government is very likely. In the past, the Argonians had a large and powerful enough civilization to build large, intricate pyramid structures called &lt;a href=\"xanmeer\"&gt;xanmeer&lt;/a&gt;s. Yet because of the enslavement of most of their peoples by the Dunmer, they came to building small villages with mud huts. The xanmeers are left as uninhabited ruins scattered throughout Black Marsh.\nThe Argonians are a very insular people. This is due to the nature of their homeland, but also because men and mer typically view them as little more than beasts. Their long history of being captured as slaves has made Argonians very distrustful of strangers, but when an Argonian has made a friend, they will fight to the death to defend that friend.\nThe Argonians have no true allies among the other races of Tamriel. Most relations are neutral, with Argonians not really caring about the affairs of other races or nations. The only clear relations they have are negative, falling on the Dunmer and the Khajiit. The long history of being forced into slavery by the Dunmer and lives spent in harsh treatment on their plantations in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; have left most Argonians with a deep cultural hatred of the Dark Elves\u2014a hatred which later led them to attack and occupy the weakened Morrowind during the Fourth Era.\nAn uneducated person would expect that the Argonians and the Khajiit would be the closest of allies, given their unique status as &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; and their similar histories of being used as slaves. However, the Argonians despise the cat-men of Elsweyr, just as the Khajiit, in turn, hate the Argonians. The roots of this animosity can be traced to the Khajiit belief that an Argonian shaman was responsible for creating the Knahaten Flu which plagued the species and its infrastructure. Each race sees the other as vastly inferior to themselves, and if it were not for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; ruled &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; separating the two provinces, it is likely that they would have gone to war long ago.\nLanguage.\nThe native language of the Argonians is called &lt;a href=\"Jel\"&gt;Jel&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike other Tamrielic &lt;a href=\"languages\"&gt;languages&lt;/a&gt;, it is not derived from the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Argonians do not have the concept of \"time,\" so their language does not have a word for it. Because of this, for some Argonians the hardest part of learning the language of the Imperials is that they make their verbs different to indicate when something happened.\nWhen Argonian names are translated from Jel, they tend to follow either a \"adjective-noun\" (ex. &lt;a href=\"Big%20Head\"&gt;Big Head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grey-Throat\"&gt;Grey-Throat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nine-Toes\"&gt;Nine-Toes&lt;/a&gt;) or a \"verb-adverb(s)-noun\" structure (ex. &lt;a href=\"Hides%20His%20Eyes\"&gt;Hides His Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Travelling-New-Woman\"&gt;Travelling-New-Woman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scouts-Many-Marshes\"&gt;Scouts-Many-Marshes&lt;/a&gt;). Traditionally, names are given after their &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap\"&gt;Hist-sap&lt;/a&gt; licking ceremony called \"Naming Day.\"\nTo the most traditional Argonians, birth and death is the same moment. All of life all of history is one moment, and only by ignoring most of its content can one create the illusion of linear progression.\nReligion.\nNot much specific information is known about the Argonian religion. However some knowledge about these unique beliefs are known to non-Argonians. The most important thing to understand about their religion is the close bond between the odd &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; tree and the Argonians. The Hist is a unique type of tree that grows all around Black Marsh and is looked highly upon by the inhabitants. This tree, according to the Argonians, is intelligent and fully conscious. It produces a special sap that gives Argonians visions and enlightenment to their souls. In fact, Argonian hatchlings drink the sap of the Hist at birth and infancy. According to them, the sap of the hist tree, when drank, gives a hatchling its soul. When that Argonian dies, his soul travels back to its Hist tree and is stored until another hatchling drinks that Hist. Thus, the Hist is giving it a soul, and so the cycle repeats. The Hist tree can telepathically talk to the Argonian that has drunk the sap.\nIt also should be noted that the Hist, and therefore Argonians, acknowledge the existence of the deity &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. Some Argonians born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; are given to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; at birth and trained in the art of stealth and assassination. Those Argonians can become &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s, who serve &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; as spies and assassins.\nSome Argonians may break away somewhat from their common beliefs and worship the Divines as evident by &lt;a href=\"Talen-Jei\"&gt;Talen-Jei&lt;/a&gt; planning a marriage with &lt;a href=\"Keerava\"&gt;Keerava&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Maramal\"&gt;Maramal&lt;/a&gt; (a Priest of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;). Another example would be &lt;a href=\"Shahvee\"&gt;Shahvee&lt;/a&gt;, who worships &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "1425", "revid": "26968877", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1425", "title": "Argonians (Oblivion)", "text": "The Argonians are the reptiloid natives of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; of southern &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Their amphibious physique suits them for aquatic and terrestrial habitation. Years of living in dangerous bogs and swamps has bolstered their immunity to the &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; found there. Behind expressionless faces, Argonians possess a quiet intellect, and because of this, many are talented &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally agile, Argonians also make keen &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nArgonians, like &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, were oppressed and &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; by rich families and primary industries in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, the last province to abolish slavery. Though slavery is now illegal in Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; still practices it. This was the main reason for the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Argonian invasion of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the near total destruction of Morrowind. Argonians are also frequently the victims of racial prejudices, as are all of the beast-races.\nCulture and origins.\nArgonians are, in general, a reserved people, slow to trust and hard to know. Yet, they are fiercely loyal, and will fight to the death for those they have named as friend. Argonians are descended from the intelligent Hist trees of Black Marsh. Most of the Argonians are immigrants from Black Marsh, and all are highly skilled in the art of combat. The band of mercenaries known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;\" is made up of mainly Argonian and Khajiit warriors commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. The Blackwood Company serves as a sort of competitor of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and are a point in the last few Fighters Guild quests. The guild hall in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; is where they have their hist tree, imported from Black Marsh. Hist is what all soldiers of the company drink before doing a contract. Argonians are the only race not to suffer negative effects from drinking the &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt;.\nOppression.\nDespite both being seen as beast-races, and a sharing a history of oppression from the &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; races there is strong racial dislike between both the Argonians and the Khajiit. Members of both races commonly see the other as vastly inferior to themselves. If it were not for the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;-held &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; that separates the lands of Black Marsh and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, it is very likely that both races would have gone to war with each other long ago.\nShadowscales.\nBorn under the constellation of &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, certain Argonians are trained at early ages to become &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and are given the title \"&lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;.\" Two members of the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Cheydinhal Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; bore this title: &lt;a href=\"Ocheeva\"&gt;Ocheeva&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Teinaava\"&gt;Teinaava&lt;/a&gt;. Their rival, &lt;a href=\"Scar-Tail\"&gt;Scar-Tail&lt;/a&gt;, was also a Shadowscale. Meanwhile, few Shadowscales existed in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nArgonians have gills on their necks and are covered in scales. This gives Argonians the unique ability to breathe underwater, which has proven to be an advantage in combat with other races, especially in the swamps of Black Marsh. Argonians are trained in guerrilla warfare to drown their enemies by dragging them to the water and holding them under.\nArgonians have very sharp reptilian teeth lining their mouths, which, if they are unarmed, can be used as an effective weapon. If an Argonian becomes a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, they appear to age tenfold and their eyes turn light red and nearly blank, though their pupils are still visible. Argonians possess tails, the only race besides the Khajiit to do so. When swimming they use their tails to propel themselves as they glide through the water like a fish (this does not however equate into an actual speed bonus in-game when swimming as an Argonian, the &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; attribute still determines that). An Argonian's tail is also used for balance giving them an extra advantage in certain situations. This is one of the many reasons Argonians are effective as thieves and assassins.\nArgonians have a wide variety of cranial features such as fins, ridges, spines, spikes or horns. Female Argonians tend to pierce their cranial features.\nUsage.\nArgonians are best suited to the role of a close quarters Assassin. This is because &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; are all valued skills for an assassin. An Argonian's natural availability of immunities and resist effect can be further augmented by selecting &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt; birthsign. The single drawback to having this birthsign can easily be negated by having a single &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt; and at least two identical &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt; weighing 0.1 pounds in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; at all times. Whenever &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; gets too low, simply scroll duplicate the Welkynd Stone and use one of the two (or more) that will result.\nBenefits.\nTo fully negate the attribute penalties associated with male Argonians, &lt;a href=\"Porphyric%20Hemophilia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Porphyric Hemophilia&lt;/a&gt; needs to be contracted, becoming a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;. This lessens the number of items required to achieve the same results as a non-vampire.\nDrawbacks.\nArgonians have several drawbacks. Bow and arrow attacks are much more useful for an assassin than a close-quarters sneak attack; however, this is completely unimportant if the Argonian chooses not to play as an assassin or assassin-like class. Because of their reptilian appearance, Argonians are disliked by &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore have a harder time &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;persuading others&lt;/a&gt;, though, as mentioned, this will not matter if &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; spells are used. Additionally, their health will always be slightly lower than other races, due to their decreased &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;.\nNames.\nArgonians have a complex language, known as Jel, that few men and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; try to learn, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; slavers. As such, many Argonians go by their translated names."}

There is an Argonian political faction called the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;, but there is little information about them, except they are composed of mostly, if not all, Argonians, and that they pushed back &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s forces during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in Black Marsh, and were also the faction responsible for orchestrating the conquest of Morrowind.\nRace relations.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, Argonians are sequestered from the predominantly &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; population, and are forced to live at the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Assemblage\"&gt;Argonian Assemblage&lt;/a&gt;, located at the city docks. After the mass exodus of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and Argonian peoples to Windhelm, the citizens became suspicious, worrying that the immigrants would influence or otherwise dilute their culture, and so forced them into segregation. Largely, this extreme behavior was inspired by the political confrontation between the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and the rulers of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. However, this eventually just turned into blatant racism.\nDespite the estrangement between the Nords and the Argonians, they are more respected and tolerated in Skyrim than other foreign immigrants due to their beneficial contributions to Nord industries. This beneficial assimilation to Skyrim's economy has helped some Argonians\u2014such as those found in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;\u2014ingratiate themselves to Skyrim's aloof society.\nMarriage.\nUnlike the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, who prefer to &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marry&lt;/a&gt; using an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, some Argonians adhere to their native marriage traditions. In &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, it is customary to present a lover with an Argonian Wedding Band, which is crafted by the courting member. Each ring is unique and has personal meaning to the creator and the recipient.\u00a0\n\"In Black Marsh, tradition dictates we present a potential mate a unique wedding ring to represent our future bond.\"\n\"\"Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design. Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife. The amethyst in the center represents &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;The Hist&lt;/a&gt;, the entity that all Argonians consider a sacred part of our lives.\"\"\u00a0\u2013 &lt;a href=\"Talen-Jei\"&gt;Talen-Jei&lt;/a&gt;\nPopular usage and unique gameplay.\nThe Argonians' stealth and &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; make them brilliant assassins, &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt;, scouts, and ambushers. Their lack of combat bonuses in archery and one-handed weapons can be overcome by natural skill leveling and play. Argonians can be used fairly well as &lt;a href=\"Spellsword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spellswords&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt; training may be necessary. They can also be useful mage-thieves due to their skills in both magic and stealth, though one may want some illusion training. Their Resist Disease ability allows them to become somewhat immune to biological agents without requiring any enchanted apparel with the effect.\nArgonians have unique advantages due to their natural &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;waterbreathing&lt;/a&gt; ability. This gives them an all-terrain versatility in an area that other races need magic, potions, or enchanted gear (such as &lt;a href=\"Volsung%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Volsung&lt;/a&gt;'s mask) to fill. Argonians are able to make ample use of Skyrim's waterways as a means of quick travel, free from ambush and interference (for example, traveling from &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; by river can be quite expedient and avoids roadside hazards including\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, and assassins) and also a quick means of escape should they find themselves in a dangerous situation that they cannot handle. River travel has its own share of hazards, however, such as waterfalls, rapids, and hostile animals such as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Nonetheless, the Argonians can also be quite a \"tank\" in battle because of their Histskin ability that multiplies their health regeneration ten times.\nNotable Argonians.\nThe following is a list of some of the more notable Argonians that can be found in Skyrim:"}
{"id": "618010", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=618010", "title": "Argonians Among Us", "text": "Argonians Among Us is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\n&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; are scaled and of limited intelligence, and they are part of our everyday lives. In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding regions, they're seen in every city and every town. They bring us our meals, they dress our children \u2026 but who are they, really?\nArgonians originate from the region known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. A water-soaked and depressing land, it reeks of swamp gas and teems with insects. In their native land, the Argonians squat in fetid pools and worship primitive tribal gods. Their folk magics and simple tribal armies have never proven an adequate defense against men or mer of stout heart.\nThe swamp was first pacified by the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; army in &lt;a href=\"1E%202811\"&gt;1E 2811&lt;/a&gt;. Those cruel and capricious men only entered the region to end the rule of a human bandit king. After the gauntleted hand of civilization came to the Argonians, their home served primarily as a prison state. The unthinking brutes of Cyrodiil callously released their most violent and unhinged criminals into the marsh.\nAlmost six hundred years ago, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; entered the lives of this scaly servant race. As the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; dawned, we began working with the Argonians in earnest. Whole tribes were evacuated to the safety and dry climates of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;. We offered them appropriate foodstuffs and taught them the ways of civilized culture. We fashioned garments to hide their more shameful features and sent them into the world, so they could learn and serve in new environs. In return for the Dark Elves' generosity, we've asked so little of the Argonians in return! And yet, not all denizens of that fetid place feel true appreciation.\nIndeed, our time of close collaboration came to an end just a few years ago. A horrific disease known as the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;, brewed in the steamy depths of the marsh, spread across the region. Rumored to be the product of an Argonian tribal shaman, the plague struck all without reptilian ancestry, slaying uncounted numbers. Most tragically, other races began to fear the Argonians as spreaders of the plague. Our efforts to send Argonians on journeys of discovery were rebuffed at every turn.\nToday, of course, Argonians stand side-by-side with us in the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Once they were merely our servants, but now, we have elevated this simple reptilian stock. They are strong, proud contributors to our military alliance and cared-for members of our households.\nThe Argonians among us enrich our lives."}

Once you have all four of them, head to the center of the ruins and place two of the stones on the sconces next to where Arithiel is standing. Talk to Arithiel hereafter and she will tell you to use the remaining two welkynd stones inside the ruins to gain entrance to the inner sanctum. \nHead inside. In the circular room to the east, you will find an Ayleid Sarcofagus which will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Soul%20Trap\"&gt;The Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt;\"; that quest takes place in the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously. Either way, fight your way through the ruins and place the welkynd stones on the sconces in the square rooms to the north and south Each time you place one, you will hear the voice of the &lt;a href=\"Exile%20of%20Mauloch\"&gt;Exile of Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; taunt you. Once they are in place, try to head through the now-unsealed door in the west of the central room; you will be blown back by some sort of force-field. Talk to Arithiel about this and she will tell you to look for a power source for this force-field; you will find it on the pedestal behind you. Examine the Amicus Geode here and the voice of Boethiah will speak through it. She will tell you that in order to dispel the barrier, you need to destroy the Amicus Geode by feeding it the soul of Arithiel; she was once a member of the Worm Cult and thus deserves to die. \nSpeak with Arithiel about the matter. She will accept her death as atonement for the sins of her past; you can choose to kill her or to use the soul of a Worm Cultist instead. If you kill her, . If you opt to kill a cultist instead, speak with Arithiel afterward and she will promise to summon a flame atronach to help in your battle inside the sanctum. Head through the doors now and through the passage ahead and slay the worm priests performing the ritual. This will cause their leader &lt;a href=\"Cassia%20Varo\"&gt;Cassia Varo&lt;/a&gt; to appear, along with her per &lt;a href=\"Ogrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ogrim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Igozai\"&gt;Igozai&lt;/a&gt;. Slay both of them, then head on out of the ruins and speak with Arithiel to finish the quest; she will be by the &lt;a href=\"Abamath%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Abamath Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;."}

To indulge his hobby he became an avid collector of &lt;a href=\"books\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; on almost any subject he could find in print.\nOne day he stumbled across a tome which purported to tell the secrets of life, death, and the purpose of existence. After months of studying the convoluted logic, written in opaque language, he thought that he was finally beginning to understand what the author was saying.\nDuring this time he became so intent on understanding the book that he ignored everything else: his business started to slide towards bankruptcy, his few friends stopped visiting him, he ignored the plague which was ravaging the town, and his family were ready to leave him.\nJust as he felt that the book was opening visions of new worlds, the plague brought him low. His family tended his illness out of a sense of duty, but he slowly sank towards death. So, as a last resort, he prayed to &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; the mother-goddess to allow him enough time to complete his studies of the book.\n\"Why should I make an exception for you, Ark`ay?\" asked Mara.\n\"Mother Mara, I am finally beginning to understand this book and the meaning of life and death\" he answered, \"and with a little more time to study and think, I should be able to teach others\".\n\"Hmmm, it sounds to me like that `teaching others' is an afterthought to appeal to me\", she replied. \"What is the reason for death and birth?\"\n\"There are far more &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Universe&lt;/a&gt; than there is room for in the physical world. But it is in the physical world that a soul has an opportunity to learn and progress. Without birth, souls would not be able to acquire that experience, and without death there would be no room for birth.\"\n\"Not a very good explanation, but it does have elements of truth. Maybe with more study you could improve it,\" she mused. \"I cannot give you 'a little more time.' I can only condemn you to Eternal labor in the field you have chosen. How say you to that?\"\n\"I do not understand, mother,\" said Ark'ay.\n\"Your choice is to either accept the death that is so close or to become a god with us. But a god is not an easy nor pleasant thing to be. As the god of death and birth you will spend eternity making sure that deaths and births stay in proper balance in the physical world. And, in spite of what you believe you understand, you will always agonize over whether your decisions are truly correct. How do you decide?\"\nArk'ay spent what seemed to him as an eternity in thought before answering. \"Mother, if my studies are not completely wrong, my only choice is to accept the burden and try to transmit the reasons for death and birth to humanity.\"\n\"So be it, Arkay, God of Birth and Death.\""}

Some sources state that Arkay's life began as a mortal, who joined the ranks of the gods.\nWorship.\nArkay's followers regard him as the god of the cycle of life and death, and as such his priests are staunch opponents of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and all forms of the undead. \nHe is known to have had a religious order, who see it as their duty to protect the souls of others through three consecrations, given at birth, death and after to protect souls from manipulation.\nVerse.\n\"Come to me, Arkay, for without you, there is neither breath nor beginning, nor can any man live, love, or learn without the spark of your spirit.\"\nOrigins.\nArkay has had several diverse origins attributed to him at different times. Some say he is the son of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, who did not exist before &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; was created. It is said by some, including Arkay's priesthood, that Arkay was a mortal man whose &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;apotheosis&lt;/a&gt; was granted by Mara. Another source suggests that Arkay is one of the original spirits that crystallized after time began, meaning he was always a deity. Still others say that Arkay is a syncretic god, created from a fusion of &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, and is possibly also the same deity as the Yokudan &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapels.\nHis main &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; was located in the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;ic city of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, and he was one of the more prominent of the gods represented at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. At his chapels, Arkay saw fit to bless parishioners with increased health. Arkay was honored in the form of statues that could be found in the Arboretum in the Imperial City. The priests of Arkay, along with his temples, were protected by a knightly order known as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Circle\"&gt;Knights of the Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his chapels and statues, the God of the Cycle of Birth and Death also had various wayshrines devoted to him scattered across Cyrodiil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, every city has a &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to Arkay, and he is especially prominent in the city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. There are also shrines in his honor scattered across the landscape.\nArtifacts.\nArkay's only known artifact is the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Sword of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. This sword was Arkay's gift to &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; in his quest to help &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; defeat the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. Centuries later, it was found by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; during their search for the crusader's relics. It was used by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Berich%20Vlindrel\"&gt;Sir Berich Vlindrel&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Greaves%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Greaves of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. Sir Berich took both of these relics with him when he went to fight in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, it ended up in &lt;a href=\"Underpall%20Cave%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Underpall Cave&lt;/a&gt; in a cursed state, being wielded by the ghost of lore Vlindrel himself. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; retrieved it from here and sanctified it in the chapel of Arkay in &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt; located deep within the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nShortly after entering the ruins, one hears the voice of the deceased explorer &lt;a href=\"Katria\"&gt;Katria&lt;/a&gt; telling the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to turn back. As they cross a gap on the side of a fallen pillar, Katria appears and explains that she had been pursuing a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt; that was capable of making such powerful weapons that it drove the Dwemer into civil war.\nKatria tells of how she died while attempting to find the lost forge. The Dragonborn can opt to enlist Katria's help while delving through the ruins, which experience periodical earthquakes causing bits of the ruins to fall apart, while plenty of Falmer jump out of their holes in the canyon walls.\nKatria will remark that a there is a chest behind a sealed gate. From the gate, go west and jump down the series of ledges until arriving at a stream. Going upstream eventually leads to the chest and a lever that opens the gate. Along the main path, there is a larger stream. All the way upstream, there is a large pool of water, by the waterfalls. Dive about halfway down to find a cave. Follow this underwater cave to the end to find a chest, weapon, and shield.\nAs they make it near the bottom of the ruins, Katria points out her lost bow (&lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;, which has 30% faster shooting speed), which will be needed to complete the puzzle later on if one does not have a bow on hand. Finally reaching the bottom, one finds a set of three locked doors with a large Dwemer head and five &lt;a href=\"tonal%20resonator\"&gt;tonal resonator&lt;/a&gt;s above the three doors. There are five tonal resonators which must be hit in the correct order in order to open the doors. If hit in the improper sequence, traps will trigger which include explosive arrows, Dwarven spheres, Dwarven spiders, as well as a centurion. The resonators are arranged in two rows; three on bottom, two on top. The correct order is bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right, bottom middle. After the doors open, the player can enter the treasure room that contains the first of four &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt; keys used to activate the lost Dwemer forge.\nThe location of the other three Aetherium pieces are clearly marked in Katria's notebook, which can be found on her body at the entrance of Arkngthamz where she first appears.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20to%20the%20Ages\"&gt;Lost to the Ages&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn embarks on an investigation with Katria to learn of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; secret and to search for four pieces of solid Aetherium. Arkngthamz is the first of four ruins that contain an &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Shard\"&gt;Aetherium Shard&lt;/a&gt;, which is needed to gain access to the Aetherium Forge, and to craft one of three unique Aetherium items."}

The element most engrained into its mythos, the almost singular thing it's known for, is its demise. Very little is remembered about what it was or how it came to be. Even its name has been obscured by the colorful moniker \"Fang Lair,\" a truncated adulteration of the original \"Phng\" paired with a suitably sinister descriptor for the home of its most infamous resident. You've undoubtedly heard some derivation of a legend retold over thousands of years, so it should suffice to say that the story of a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; taking roost in this formerly Dwarven city has sadly overshadowed the fascinating history that came before.\nThankfully, through my research, some aspects of this buried history can now be brought to light. My findings suggest that in the decades following the establishment of peace between the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and Dwemer, Dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Kragen\"&gt;Clan Kragen&lt;/a&gt; began to seek new holdings beyond &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Following the path laid out by the exiled &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Rourken\"&gt;Clan Rourken&lt;/a&gt; during their exodus, the Dwarves of Kragen reached what we now consider &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and first established their presence in the region with the founding of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's unclear precisely what appealed so much to the Kragen explorers that it was worth settling among the hostile &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, but in spite of regular attacks by the warlike Men, their city flourished. So much so that it encouraged other clans to expand their own holdings to the west. This loose alliance of clans effectively established a pocket empire of four city-states that were considered unassailable. Not that the Nords stopped trying.\nPerhaps it was this success, or the presence of so many nearby clans, that drove Clan Kragen to press on with their expansion west through the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but I believe they sought to bridge their new empire with their estranged cousins in &lt;a href=\"Volenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever the case, they broke stone for a sister city on the border of modern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;: Arkngthamz-Phng.\nDespite the inhospitable terrain, there is some evidence to suggest that the Dwarves aggressively carved out this burgeoning settlement, which soon supplanted its predecessor as the seat of Clan Kragen's power. Though greatly devastated, the expansive vaults of Arkngthamz-Phng's main hall are still majestic in their scale. It's easy to see how such a vast, secluded space, rich with resources and life, would be an attractive home for a Dragon seeking more well-appointed accommodations than those chiseled out by Nords in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon Priesthood&lt;/a&gt;.\nSadly, my first expedition met unexpected resistance, forcing me to abandon the site before more significant revelations could be unearthed; however, I have no doubts that the interest garnered by this publication will see a second, more ambitious expedition come to fruition."}

The caverns are accessed by any of the two &lt;a href=\"great%20lift\"&gt;great lift&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nArkthzand Cavern is a smaller section of Blackreach than the ajoining &lt;a href=\"Greymoor%20Caverns\"&gt;Greymoor Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, and constitutes the subterranean area of Skyrim's Reach. Since their arrival in Skyrim and settlement of the lands around the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; have claimed the caverns as their sacred land, despite the dangers left behind following the &lt;a href=\"Disappearance%20of%20the%20Dwarves\"&gt;dissapearance&lt;/a&gt; of the cavern's original inhabitant's, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Arkthzand Cavern and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Arkthzand Cavern shares its story quests with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;. The zone story quests tie into the Dark Heart of Skyrim's overarching storyline, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for other zones prior to those in the Reach and Arkthzand Cavern. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Note that the Epilogue for the Dark Heart of Skyrim requires the zone quests of both Western Skyrim (including in Greymoor Caverns) and the Reach (including in Arkthzand Cavern) to have been completed before it can be started.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nTwo Skyshards can be found in Arkthzand Cavern providing two of the three Skyshards necessary to earn a skill point. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. These require the use of &lt;a href=\"Void%20Portals\"&gt;Void Portals&lt;/a&gt; that can be used without owning the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Shard\"&gt;Void Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Arkthzand Cavern and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

There are 70 full &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Sets%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sets of armor&lt;/a&gt; and 100 custom pieces.\nArmor rating affects the percent of damage one takes from physical attacks. For example, with an armor rating of 20, one would take 80% damage from physical attacks. The max armor rating one can get is 85, even if their armor or any shield effects adds up to more. Wearing any kind of armor will lower one's spell effectiveness, which is determined by the number of armor pieces they wear and their skill level in it. At Journeyman level in the armor skills, wearing any armor piece will put the spell effectiveness at 95% which cannot be increased further.\nAt Master mastery level, with the combined perks of their respective skills, the best types of Light and Heavy armor offer the same overall level of protection, both with no movement penalties and no weight for armor one is wearing, so they are essentially the same at end-game\u2014unless they would want to carry multiple sets of &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted armor&lt;/a&gt; for different situations, in which case Light armor is superior. Also, unlike , the enchanting capacity of all items in \"Oblivion\" are the same, so there is no enchanting advantage to selecting heavy armor. However, Light armor requires that all equipped pieces of armor be Light, so they cannot make use of certain powerful pieces of Heavy armor like the &lt;a href=\"Escutcheon%20of%20Chorrol\"&gt;Escutcheon of Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. \nEnchanted armor.\nEnchanted armor is armor that can bestow attribute or skill boosts or abilities to the wearer. Armor is enchanted through the use of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. They can be more useful than &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; because they are in effect at all times. However, enchanted armor can only be repaired by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; with a level of 50 in &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt;.

When crafting, using more materials to create the piece will increase the level requirement and therefore armor rating.\nThe racial style gives the armor a unique aesthetic appearance. There are racial styles for the 10 playable races, as well as Ancient Elf, Barbarian, Daedric, and Primal, which are unique styles that are unlocked by finding style books in the world. Within each of the 10 racial styles there are different aesthetics determined by the material the piece is crafted from\u2014for heavy armor, iron and steel have a basic look, orichalcum has a more detailed appearance, and any higher level materials are very ornate\u2014and the quality of the item.\nArmor can have &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, which provide special magical effects, and &lt;a href=\"traits\"&gt;traits&lt;/a&gt;, which are inherent properties of the piece that cannot be altered. Enchantments come from &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;s created at an enchanting table, while traits are crafted into the piece with the appropriate additional material.\nThere are also unique crafting stations throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; which will allow a player to create armor that has a special set bonus when crafted at that location. When wearing the required number of items to earn the bonus, the armor provides an additional effect. For example, if wearing three pieces of armor of the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Grip\"&gt;Ashen Grip&lt;/a&gt; set, the player has a chance to breathe fire when attacking to do additional damage to enemies.\nArmor durability, and therefore its armor rating, deteriorates with wear and if the player dies. Damaged armor can be repaired at a &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; or by using a &lt;a href=\"Repair%20Kit\"&gt;Repair Kit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are 7 armor pieces that can be worn: headgear, shoulder armor, chest pieces, waist pieces, gloves, legwear, and boots.

Armor Rating has no effect on elemental damage.\"\"\nArmor.\nThe higher the armor rating is, the more effective it is at all times, unlike shields which only confer resistance when blocking. Armor rating and block rating can be combined with great effectiveness. Some light armors are more effective at resisting specific kinds of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; a the cost of a lower armor rating. These resistances can include elemental or physical damage."}

It can be difficult to separate mythical exaggeration from actual, recoverable relics, but it is my duty as a historian and scholar to preserve any details of such items, even those that may prove untrue. I have recorded here what I have read regarding a few powerful legendary armors. As far as I am aware, none of these have been located, but how exciting it is to consider that they may yet exist!\n&lt;a href=\"Lapidary%27s%20Slab\"&gt;Lapidary's Slab&lt;/a&gt;\nCommissioned by an unknown &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elven&lt;/a&gt; general, this &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; chestplate was engraved with the names of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Dunmer saints&lt;/a&gt; and their teachings. According to the tales, the artisan tried to explain to the general that etching the names and stories into the plate would weaken its integrity, but to no avail. The general demanded completion of the piece. Three costly cuirasses shattered or cracked as the crafter attempted the feat, attempting to configure the names and parables in an arrangement that would hold. He consulted with priests and enchanters, and by his fourth attempt, the plate was complete. It is said that nothing short of a Daedric Prince itself could damage the finished product.\n&lt;a href=\"Skinmail\"&gt;Skinmail&lt;/a&gt;\nReferences to this incredible work are few. I have seen a few texts mentioning a vial of liquid that, if applied to the skin, can harden it and produce plate-like coverings whenever the wearer wills. It is said to be the crowning achievement of a powerful &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; Alchemist\u00a0who stopped at nothing, including horrific experimentation on live subjects, to reach the result. Only a very few vials are thought to exist, as the process for creation was not only costly, but lengthy, requiring decades of attention and enchantment to produce.\n&lt;a href=\"Widowill\"&gt;Widowill&lt;/a&gt;\nIn a small, impoverished Imperial village lived a soldier's widow. She and the other villagers led quiet lives until necromancers began operating nearby, robbing graves and stealing people away in the night. There were no fighters or mercenaries among them, and they were so poor that sending for help seemed impossible, so she donned her husband's old armor, though it did not fit well, and hefted his sword, determined to drive the necromancers away. &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; took notice of this selfless, if foolish, act, and imbued the armor with holy protections so powerful that the necromancers who attacked her were reduced to dust."}

Use of this skill determines how effective armor repairs are for the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. The Armorer skill is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmorer is an essential skill for any close combat class. Each successful repair will progress the skill increase a percentage. When the progression of the current skill level reaches 100%, the skill level increases by 1.\nRepairing an item.\nIn order to repair a weapon or piece of armor, it is necessary to use various tools available. Select an armorer's hammer in from inventory and drop it on the character portrait. Once it has been selected, all of the weapons and armor in the inventory will be displayed, with their condition next to them. Select an item to repair, and a repair will be attempted. The higher the armorer skill and strength, the better the chance of repair. Every tool has a limited number of uses, and the higher the grade of the tool, the better the amount of repair possible. Also, the higher the skill, the greater the repair will be, should it be successful.\nThe formula.\nThe quality of the tools, the Nerevarine's skill level, their &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;luck&lt;/a&gt; affect the chance of performing a successful repair as well as the amount of damage repaired on success. \nSpecifically, the chance to repair is:\n X = (Skill level + STR*0.2 + LUC*0.1) * Quality of hammer * Fatigue Mult) \nThen if a d100 roll is less than X, the amount repaired is: \n (X - roll) * fRepairAmountMult\nwhere fRepairAmountMult is set to three in the unmodded base game."}

Especially for long combat runs, like when closing Oblivion gates, armor and weapons will fall apart quickly. Also, repair hammers are heavy (they weigh a pound each), and the lower the\u00a0armorer skill, the more hammers will be\u00a0needed to carry during each raid (because they break more often for low-level armorers).\nLeveling text.\nApprentice.\n\"Long days and nights at the forge make you strong and tough.

A Master Armorer does not wear out repair hammers while repairing weapons and armor. One repair hammer lasts you a lifetime.\u00a0\"\nNPC dialogue.\nOnce one's Armorer skill level reaches 70 or higher, NPCs will say: \"You've got the hands of a smith. Must have spent some time repairing your gear.\"\nUsefulness.\nArmorer helps raise Endurance which in turn raises maximum health. Without this skill, armor will often be completely worn down by the time a dungeon is completed. As long as no enemies are in range, armor repair can be done underwater."}

Whether the terrible Knahaten Flu arose from natural causes, or was created by an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; shaman in retaliation for his people's oppression, is still a matter of debate. The plague began in &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly spread to every corner of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, killing all those not of reptilian stock. For over forty years, it held the province in its grip, decimating entire cultures (notably, the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;) and driving outsiders from the land. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt; it reached &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, and\u00a0it also destroyed significant sections of Argonia, however, the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; proved immune to it.\nThe Knahaten Flu also helped Argonia temporarily cede from the Empire during the Second Era, as the plague made the land habitable only by Argonians.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, on the 20th of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, citizens commemorate the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Shame\"&gt;Day of Shame&lt;/a&gt;, a day in which the passengers of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ship\"&gt;Crimson Ship&lt;/a&gt;, loaded with victims of this sickness, were denied entry into Hammerfell. Even though the action stopped the plague from reaching Hammerfell, it is still remembered as a horrible day in their history.\nThe Knahaten Flu also created tensions in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, too. It was later revealed to have been a hoax, sparked by Argonians wishing revenge on the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; expansionists.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; is said by the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; to have helped to restore order after the outbreak.

He has served as a sentinel and Knight-Paladin at the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years.\nBackground.\nGelebor's exact age cannot be determined, but he is believed to have been present before the &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;Atmoran conquest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the Snow Elf civilization was a wealthy and prosperous society.\nDuring this time, he served as a &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20Paladin%20Order\"&gt;Knight-Paladin&lt;/a&gt; for the Chantry of Auri-El, the epicenter of worship in the Snow Elf faith, and a retreat for those who wished to become enlightened. He is responsible for protecting the Chantry, and everything in it, until he dies.\nWar.\nFollowing the war with the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, most of his race was either wiped out or forced into hiding. Eventually, many of his kin took refuge with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, a subterranean race of &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. The Chantry itself was quite isolated, so much of the worldly affairs occurring in Skyrim passed them by. Only about a hundred or so Snow Elves remained within the Chantry, by the time the Snow Elves of Skyrim and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; were hunted to extinction, but the Chantry managed to remain a secret to both the Dwemer and the Atmorans for many years.\nIronically, their downfall came from &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;; the twisted race into which their fellow Snow Elves, those who had taken refuge with the Dwemer, had devolved. The Falmer eventually discovered Gelebor and the remaining followers of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, and swarmed the Chantry in vast numbers until they were completely overrun. Gelebor led a small group of paladins, but they were no match for the Falmers' sheer numbers. The Falmer even found a way to breach the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, where Gelebor's brother, the Arch-Curate, resided. In the end, Gelebor and his brother were the only two Snow Elves who survived.\nSentinel.\nIn the centuries since the disappearance of his race, Gelebor has stayed true to his oath as a Knight Paladin and continued to tend to the Chantry. He became estranged from his brother Vyrthur, who remained at the Inner Sanctum, and has long believed the Falmer corrupted him when the Chantry was attacked. Gelebor has never been able to confront Vyrthur, however, as he believes leaving the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; within the Chantry unguarded would be violating his sacred duty.\nOver the years, countless travellers and adventurers have discovered the Chantry while searching for &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;. Gelebor proposed the same arrangement to each of them \u2014 the death of his brother in return for the bow. None have ever been successful,\u00a0until around the time of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0successfully obtained the bow.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;.\nGelebor is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfall Cave&lt;/a&gt; at the shrine of Auriel when searching for Auriel's Bow, and will ask the Dragonborn to kill his brother, who he believes has become corrupted by the Falmer.\nUpon completion of the quest, he will offer to make &lt;a href=\"Sunhallowed%20Elven%20Arrow\"&gt;Sunhallowed Elven Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s from normal Elven arrows. Gelebor can create stacks of 20 at a time, or can create them individually or in small groups.\nConversations.\nSerana.\nGelebor: \"Come forward. You have nothing to fear here.\"\nSerana: \"\"What's that? I can feel some kind of power from it...\"\n[After talking to Gelebor]\nSerana: \"So this is snow elf magic. Incredible.\"\nGelebor: \"This structure is known as a wayshrine. They were used for meditation and for transport when the Chantry was a place of enlightenment. Prelates of these shrines were charged with teaching the mantras of Auri-El to our Initiates.\"\nSerana: \"What's that basin in the center signify?\"\nGelebor: \"Once the Initiate completed his mantras, he'd dip a ceremonial ewer in the basin at the wayshrine's center and proceed to the next wayshrine.\"\nSerana: \"So these Initiates had to lug around a heavy pitcher of water. Marvelous. How long would they have to do that?\"\nGelebor: \"Well, once the Initiate's enlightenment was complete, he'd bring the ewer to the Chantry's Inner Sanctum. Pouring the contents of the ewer into the sacred basin of the Sanctum would allow him to enter for an audience with the Arch-Curate himself.\"\nSerana: \"All that just to end up dumping it out? Makes no sense to me.\"\nGelebor: \"It's symbolic. I don't expect you to understand.\"\nSerana: \"So let's get this straight. We need to do all that nonsense to get into the temple, so we can kill your brother and claim Auriel's Bow?\"\nGelebor: \"I know how it all sounds, but if there was another way I'd have done it long ago. The only way to get to my brother is by following in the Initiates' footsteps and traveling from wayshrine to wayshrine just as they did. The first lay at the end of Darkfall Passage, a cavern that represents the absence of enlightenment.\"\nItems.\nThe following are the items in the possession of Gelebor. However, only &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained during the quest \"Touching the Sky.\""}

{"id": "18165", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18165", "title": "Knight (Oblivion)", "text": "Knights fight for personal glory and honor, usually in service to a lord. They are equally skilled in all three melee &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; styles and are capable of shrugging off blows with their &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;. Their noble nature endears them to others, even if it is only an &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Knight is a premade &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription and use.\nThe Knight is a very basic class, with easy tactics, good stat balances and multiple strategies which he can perform.\nWeapons.\nMelee is a knight's specialty. He has Block to reduce damage from heavy attacks against stronger and more powerful creatures. Depending on the skill level, the knight can use their Block to ensure counterattacks and turn the tables on their enemies, provided they are using a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Blunt/Blade are selected for obvious reasons. Whilst the knight has both weapon skills, it's best that they choose one over the other, to ensure the growth of one of their melee abilities. If he should choose &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt;, he'll gain a great advantage in strength, heading with the 'one who hits the most' strategy wins, also he'll gain the advantage of acquiring the most powerful weapons in the game. If they should choose &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;, they'll attain great advantages in speed, balanced attacks, and a variety of long and short blades. However, choosing which blade may be a problem.\nDaggers.\n&lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt; are not a good selection for a knight. Due to their short range and weak priority of damage, the knight will probably end up getting killed first due to his lack of Endurance, and the advantage of speed the dagger permits would be greatly reduced due to the heavy armor the knight wears.\nShortswords.\n&lt;a href=\"Shortswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shortswords&lt;/a&gt; aren't recommended, but can still be used. They have better range and damage than a dagger, and still hold similar speed traits. But as before, heavy armor would waste the resource the short-swords give.\nLongswords.\n&lt;a href=\"Longswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Longswords&lt;/a&gt; are a much better choice. Average damage, good range, average speed. It's a well balanced weapon for a well balanced class. Yet, it lacks the massive damage a claymore can allow, but in contrast, allows a shield, which is essential for a knight to survive.\nClaymores have excellent range, excellent damage, but below average speed. Its range and damage are perfect for those who want to deal with big foes and powerful enemies from a safe distance, but comes with the risk of not being able to wield a shield. Hence weakening the knight.\nArmor.\n&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; is the knight life. Without heavy armor, the knight has to rely on his health, which isn't very high until later levels. The heavy amour ensures the safety of the knight, lowering the risk of dying due to low health. At most, the knight should wear heavy armor during all of his battles, as he has no other safety apart from the potions he buys and finds.\nMagic.\n&lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; is a strange choice for a melee class, but can work. If the knight chooses to focus on illusion for quite some time, he may find that it can be a great advantage in combat. Paralyzing spells will allow a load of free hits, time to heal, or a chance to escape. Night-eye can help in dark battles (although that isn't really necessary) and help see through murky seas. Light spells can draw enemies to him, and separate them to make combating large groups easier. Fear spells can temporarily disable enemies, ensuring escape, easy killing or free hits or to rally his comrades in battles and provoke the enemy to a frenzy. Finally, the knight can easily persuade people with the help of Illusion and his &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt; attribute, as well as &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\nConclusion.\nIn conclusion, the Knight is for those who favor using the most popular and flashy class of the &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; side, they specialize heavily in heavy armor and favor using a blade or blunt weapon. Knights are fun, easy and safe to use throughout the game."}

Twenty-seven families, their bellies sunken and empty, turned to their lordship who had been so fair to them in hard times before. The man ruled not with an iron gauntlet, but with the soft touch of silken kindness: my lord, Garridan Stalrous, Knight-Errant of Farmantle Glens.\nI watched sadly as my lord Garridan looked out at the withered fields before him from his meager stone keep and cursed the luck that tainted the skies and stopped the rain from falling. The families in his charge would not last the winter, which was always bitter and cold in the northern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerals&lt;/a&gt;. His own supply of grain was already picked clean; there was barely enough to sustain him for the months ahead. I know if my lord had the food there, he would have shared it gladly, allowing his charges to pay him back in whatever time or manner they could afford... and in some cases, to those in dire need, give it to them without costs. Something had to be done; and it had to be done soon.\nSparing not a drake, Garridan paid for the best sages he could find and used the rest to buy as much surplus grain as he could wrest from the neighboring domains. A month passed, and nothing surfaced. Winter's icy tendrils would soon creep across Farmantle Glens, causing the green to disappear from the landscape. Families would have to huddle close to their hearths, keeping warm and rationing the bits of food Garridan had given them. I could see Garridan's patience, which was immense mind you, wearing thin. He told me he'd considered selling his keep... his belongings... anything to keep his people alive. If only the harvest would yield more, they'd be saved.\nThen, as if Mara herself had answered his prayers, a sage entered Garridan's keep with the answer. Legend told of a vessel of sorts from which water would pour endlessly known as the &lt;a href=\"Everflow%20Ewer\"&gt;Everflow Ewer&lt;/a&gt;. Some said the Divines themselves created it; others thought perhaps a powerful sorcerer enchanted it. Wherever it was from, Garridan knew this could be his chance. Following the directions from the sage, my lord and I set out to recover the Ewer and rid Farmantle Glens of the drought.\nIt took days to reach the entrance to the place. After we passed through a winding passage, we finally came to an odd door covered in mystical symbols. As the sage instructed, my lord touched some &lt;a href=\"Refined%20Frost%20Salts\"&gt;Refined Frost Salts&lt;/a&gt; to the door. The ancient stone door opened, and we proceeded into the glade. A cave cut into a hillside led into a small glade of trees. In the center of the glade, flanked by two standing stones, was a stone altar. On the altar, seemingly glowing with inner light was the Ewer. Cut from crystal, the vessel was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. Water filled it to the very top, and as legends held, would never diminish as the liquid decanted from it. Eager to return to his domain, Garridan grasped the Ewer in hand.\nSuddenly, the ground trembled as though the mountains themselves were angered. The sky changed from sunlit blue to dreary grey. Even the ring of trees forming the glade seemed to bend away slightly from the altar, as if fearing what was to come. Then, with no warning, one of the standing stones cracked and exploded! My gaze froze and my heart fell as I looked upon the guardian of the glade. A huge creature seemingly cut from the very same crystal as the Ewer stepped forth and growled menacingly at my master. The air around it became very cold, as if it was born from the glaciers of the northern mountains. This was a being of ice... living breathing ice!\nGarridan shouted at me to run as he drew his blade. Still clutching the Ewer in one hand, he gave a mighty swing at the ice creature. When the forged steel struck home, it gave a resounding ring and merely chipped the beast as a spike would when driven against the hardest of rocks. Never showing fear, my lord swung again and again, each blow being harmlessly deflected away. Then, a single and mighty blow from the ice creature knocked my lord down. His blade slid away, and he lay on the forest floor looking up into the crystalline eyes of his death. The ice creature raised its arm again for the fatal blow, and brought it down hard at Garridan's prone form.\nI don't know why he did it. Perhaps it was instinct, perhaps a moment's lapse in judgment. But my lord lifted the Everflow Ewer defensively as he got up to a kneeling position. The blow from the creature connected with the vessel, creating an ear-splitting crash. There was the sound of water splashing and a horrible cracking noise as the sundered pitcher sent waves of freezing water in all directions. Even as I watched, the liquid covered the ice creature and my poor master. They seemed suspended in place as if frozen solid. At the time, I didn't know how true my thoughts had become. As I watched in horror, they were encased in a tomb of pure ice. I could see Garridan's face as the ice overtook him, and I could swear he was crying. A few of his &lt;a href=\"Garridan%27s%20Tear\"&gt;tears&lt;/a&gt; froze and fell to the ground at his feet like beautiful blue crystals. He knew he'd failed his mission. His people would starve, and he was responsible. Frost and ice covered everything in the glade now... the trees, the rocks, the soil... everything.\nIt was then I became aware that the very air around me began to freeze. It was like a cold winter's night at first, and then it rapidly became worse. The cold was so bad, it turned into a sort of frozen heat... it began to burn. My throat became tight and breathing became difficult. I began to lose feeling in my arms and legs, and my vision was beginning to blur. I had to escape this icy glade and tell Garridan's story. It was the least I could do for such a noble man. With every bit of strength I could muster, I ran from the frostfire and back through the cave. I barely escaped with my life.\nMy journey back to the domain of Garridan was a sad one. My heart was heavy, my mind clouded with misery. He was a good man, the greatest I'd ever known. To die like that was no way for such an honorable knight to end his life. When I finally reached the outskirts of Farmantle Glen, the farmers were waiting for me. I was ready to tell them the sad news, but they raised a cheer of great joy! They told me that only a week ago, a strange, bluish glowing rain fell on their fields and that the next day the crops began to grow as if there had never been a drought. A week ago was exactly when my master was frozen in that horrible glade... and his tears froze like bluish raindrops frozen in time! I looked up at the heavens and the twinkling lights suddenly gave me great comfort. I thanked &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, and headed home."}

Pelin did various petty tasks for the Chapel of Stendarr such as tending to the spiritual need of soldiers, or providing the sentries with water during hot days.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt;, Pelin worked at the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, a large fortress seperating Hammerfell from High Rock. A large army of vampires, wolves, and \"faceless shadows,\" known as the Gray Host attacked the Garrison from &lt;a href=\"Verkarth\"&gt;Verkarth&lt;/a&gt;. killing hundreds of soldiers of the Garrison, draining the blood of the men before killing again. Saint Pelin, noticing that only blood would keep the vampires at bay, gave his own life for the people in the Garrison. Pelin was said to have prayed to Stendarr to provide him with an endless supply of blood, Stendarr answered, and filled Saint Pelin with an endless supply of blood, so the vampires drank, and drank, but could not suck him dry. With the attacking army distracted, the soldiers of the Garrison took their chances, and dropped a battlement atop the enemy forces, killing them.\nThe Knights.\nWhen exactly the Knights of Saint Pelin were formed is unknown. Records of their deeds, however, exist during the Second Era. During the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of Saint Pelin charged the city of Evermore under the command of Duke Blaise Guimard, liberating it from the &lt;a href=\"Reachman\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; occupation.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights saw further action.\nAt some time, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; conqeured the Bangkorai Garrison from the Knights of Saint Pelin. While more than two hundred Knights were present in the fortress, the Legion proved too strong a force. How the Garrison fell is not known, the few Knights who survived the attack stating different reports. One of the knights reported that the Magus-General of the Legion, &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated the Garrison posing as a Redguard refugee, and unleashed Oblivion the next night. Other knights reported giant Daedra scaling the walls, and the dead rising from the crypt of the Garrison.\nThe Knights had also set up camp at &lt;a href=\"Martyr%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Martyr's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, which originally only consisted of a two-man outpost. This increase of a garrison at the camp also forced the Bangkorai Garrison to give up some of its troops, partially leading to its capture by the Legion. This outpost was being raided constantly with Legion soldiers, until they were defeated by a combined force of the Knights of Saint Pelin, a group of Baandari traders, and a Covenant trooper.\nThe Knights had also been tasked with recovering the Memory Stone of Makela Leki from the Crypt of Exiles, but due to the heavy action the knights saw in Bangkorai, a Covenant troop had to perform this task."}

They have defended the royal families of Daggerfall for generations from the terrors of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Dragon served under &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Orsinium\"&gt;First Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, the Knights were under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;, who was well-known acquaintance with &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;. Both respected each other in combat and understood the rules of combat. The Daggerfall-Sentinel Joint Army had battled with the Orsimer on the outskirts of Orsinium against &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Sons\"&gt;Savage Sons&lt;/a&gt;. In one way or the other, Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk dueled each other; the battle focused on two legends at the heat of the moment. Lord Trystan decided not to intervene, allowing the two to battle it out. King Joile had brought in the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;. Not honor-bound, Mercedene ordered her Reachmen Archers to attack the two warriors, prompting both sides to continue to attack each other. Lord Trystan, filled with anger, had ordered an attack on Mercedene, who had fled the scene. She was killed by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt;, left for dead in the area. Baloth Bloodtusk and Gaiden Shinji were buried at the battleground; the temple erected there would be called &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Honor's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Daggerfall was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. But despite their battle prowess, &lt;a href=\"King%20Casimir\"&gt;King Casimir&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall had the Knights of the Dragon become a separate entity to the Covenant, serving the Kingdom of Daggerfall exclusively. But regardless, the Knights have involved themselves in matters along with the Covenant, mainly in the region of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, where Daggerfall is situated. When the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; had invaded, the Knights of the Dragon, along with the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; were among the forefront against these barbaric invaders. The Knights were positioned at the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard%20Redoubt\"&gt;Lion Guard Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; in the region of &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, when the Covenant attacked the Bloodthorn Cult at the crypts of &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Knights was a part of the attack on Cath Bedraud, entering the inner sanctum and battling with &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt; with the Covenant and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, an Agent of the Covenant. Angof was ultimately defeated, and Glenumbra was saved. The Knights continued to serve the Kingdom of Daggerfall and King Casimir Deleyn.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20402\"&gt;3E 402&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20404\"&gt;3E 404&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Dragon under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bridwell\"&gt;Lord Bridwell&lt;/a&gt;. The Knights were at the forefront of the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; for ownership over the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate%20of%20Betony\"&gt;Protectorate of Betony&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Bridwell was a war-hero for the Kingdom of Daggerfall, winning countless battles throughout the conflict, ranging from the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Craghold\"&gt;Siege of Craghold&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bluffs\"&gt;Battle of the Bluffs&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which had left &lt;a href=\"Lord%20K%27avar\"&gt;Lord K'avar&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel with a permanent scar from an encounter with Lord Bridwell. Lord Bridwell was one of the men, including &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Gothryd\"&gt;Prince Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; to win the War of Betony at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;, which took place in the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Lord Bridwell and his Knights of the Dragon returned to the Kingdom of Daggerfall as war heroes. Years later, Lord Bridwell continued to serve under King Gothryd and his growing kingdom, having the Knights take refuge throughout the Kingdom, in places such as &lt;a href=\"Knightstown\"&gt;Knightstown&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Singmoth\"&gt;Singmoth&lt;/a&gt;."}

She gathered members of the Flame to her side to foil the Covenant. Falhut planned Lakana's assassination but failed when Sir Hughes and a traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; uncovered her plan and killed her in her private home.

However, Umaril's spirit survived and was bound to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Pelinal was killed by the remaining Ayleid kings. Before he died, he spoke to &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; the winged-bull, Alessia's lover, warning of Umaril's survival and his imminent return.

After &lt;a href=\"Berich%20Vlindrel\"&gt;Berich Vlindrel&lt;/a&gt;, a man descended of one of the noble Colovian families, joined them, the order gained even more renown. Three more Relics were recovered around the same time. After Sir Amiel began to wear the Cuirass into battle, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Casimir\"&gt;Sir Casimir&lt;/a&gt; favored the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Gauntlets of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; as his own, taking responsibility as the one to recover it, and so did Sir Berich with the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greaves%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Greaves&lt;/a&gt;.\nTen years later, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; began. Because the Knights had come from notable families across the Empire, they left to fight on either side of the war. Sir Berich was first to leave, claiming the Sword and Greaves as his own to take into battle. Sir Amiel tried to stop him, but Berich left for the war and never returned to the order. \nAfter the war, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Berich\"&gt;Sir Berich&lt;/a&gt; slew &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Caius\"&gt;Sir Caius&lt;/a&gt;. He would later turn to evil, causing his wraith to haunt his tomb in &lt;a href=\"Underpall%20Cave%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Underpall Cave&lt;/a&gt;, slaying any unwanted visitors seeking the Relics, with the same Sword that became corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Berich%20Vlindrel\"&gt;Lord Berich Vlindrel&lt;/a&gt;'s curse. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Henrik\"&gt;Sir Henrik&lt;/a&gt; took the &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Shield of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Bulwark\"&gt;Fort Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, a massive fort made especially to protect the Shield from those who would misuse it. He died protecting it from invaders. The &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Mace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Boots&lt;/a&gt;, however, were never recovered by the Knights. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Ralvas\"&gt;Sir Ralvas&lt;/a&gt; constantly tried to obtain the Mace, but he could not without being able to \"walk in the faith.\" He tried many times, never able to cross the chasm that separated him and the Mace. He went for days, refusing all food and drink, and died soon after. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Juncan\"&gt;Sir Juncan&lt;/a&gt; looked to recover the Boots, but died before he could reach them. &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Casimir\"&gt;Sir Casimir&lt;/a&gt; also fell from on high; when he slew a beggar in the Chapel of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; in cold blood. The &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Gauntlets of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; he wielded fell from his hands; heavy with the sin he had committed. Then he was blasted with a curse that affected him and all his lineage with the loss of &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, a curse still affecting his &lt;a href=\"Kellen%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;bloodline&lt;/a&gt; generations later. The rest of the Knights, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Gregory%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Sir Gregory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Torolf\"&gt;Sir Torolf&lt;/a&gt;, went into war, only to die there.\nThe war ended in 3E 127. Four years later, the Knights of the Nine was officially disbanded by Imperial decree. Sir Berich had fought for &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who had defeated &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. He may have been the one behind the decree, though Sir Amiel did not blame him. The knightly order had been fracturing since the beginning of the War of the Red Diamond.\nSir Amiel, in all of this, was the last one to fall. He tried to keep the Knights together. He and Sir Casimir were the ones to return the bodies to the &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in one last attempt to try to obtain the last Relic that they had not attempted to recover, he set off.

This message will display:\nTo regain the privilege to wear the armor,\u00a0one must walk the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrimage%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Pilgrim's Way&lt;/a&gt; again.

The local guards complain that anytime something happens the Knights of the Thorn are nowhere to be found, or how they must put up with their boasts and insults since Farwil Indarys is the Count's son.\nHistory.\nThough the Knights boast of many battles and victories, prior to entering the Cheydinhal Oblivion Gate they had little to no fighting experience.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; opened outside the doors of their Lodge, Farwil seized the opportunity to prove to the city guards that his knights were brave and courageous. So the Knights rushed into the gate without asking for help from the city guards. When they entered they quickly decided to launch a direct assault. This proved disastrous as most of the knights were slain by the first wave of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and more dying in the second. Only Farwil Indarys and &lt;a href=\"Bremman%20Senyan\"&gt;Bremman Senyan&lt;/a&gt; were able to survive the attacks, but could not escape due to the numbers and the injuries they had.\nWhile traveling to gather &lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; came to Cheydinnhal. The Count's son, along with his Knights of the Thorn, had been inside for several days and nobody had seen or heard from them. It had gotten to the point that the count had offered a reward for the rescue or confirmation of the death of his son. The Hero entered the gate to close it and to discover the fate of the missing knights. Farwil and Bremman were still alive when the Hero reached them. Farwil, now believing the numbers to be more in their favor will state they can only go forward and continue the battle to reach the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; and close the gate. Having no other way to go Bremman and the Hero must follow.\nIf Farwil dies his father will be crushed but grateful to at least know his son's fate. If Farwil makes it out alive the Count will reward the Hero with a &lt;a href=\"Thornblade\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Indarys\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround twenty Knights of the Thorn aided &lt;a href=\"Mazgar\"&gt;Mazgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bennus\"&gt;Bennus&lt;/a&gt; when they were about to be attacked by a party of zombies. The Knights of the Thorn had gone to &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; to defend the city from the siege, but when they arrived everyone had left. In their way back they had seen Mazgar and Brennus escape from the zombies from a hilltop.\nAfter offering two mounts to Mazgar and Brennus, the knights headed to the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt; to aid the refugees that had abandoned Cheydinhal.\nJoining.\nIf Farwil survives the Oblivion gate, talk to him to become an honorary member of the Knights.

They have no permanent home now and are not taking any more knights, though they are happy to employ mercenaries.

The leader of the rebel knights was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kain\"&gt;Lord Kain&lt;/a&gt;, the younger brother of Baron Shrike, who believed themselves to be the rightful bearers of the horn; and whose rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful.\nLord Kain's retainers went into exile and crossed over the border to the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil to regroup there, and began to await the arrival of Lord Kain and reinforcements. The knights under Lord Jaren began the construction of &lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle&lt;/a&gt; as a refuge, at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black Road&lt;/a&gt; close to the border. Peace was eventually restored to Lainlyn when &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; removed Baron Shrike from power, although Lord Kain had seemingly disappeared, and his knights-in-exile at Battlehorn had not heard from him.\nAround the same time as the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the faction had fallen on hard times and had dwindled to a handful of men, and a group of &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;marauders&lt;/a&gt; took the opportunity to attack Battleborn Castle, now under the leadership of the late Lord Jaren's son, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kelvyn\"&gt;Lord Kelvyn&lt;/a&gt;. Kelvyn managed to get a message out for help to relieve the siege, which was answered by none other than the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; himself. However, although the siege was lifted, Lord Kelvyn fell in the battle, leaving the castle to the Hero of Kvatch in his &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kelvyn%27s%20Last%20Will%20and%20Testament\"&gt;last will and testament&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero of Kvatch saw to it that Battlehorn Castle was restaffed and restored to its former glory, but not before discovering &lt;a href=\"Arielle%20Jurard%20%28Lich%29\"&gt;a necromancer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kain\"&gt;undead Lord Kain&lt;/a&gt; sealed up in the grotto beneath the castle (as sealed there by Lord Jaren), and putting them to final rest."}

Each of them ascends to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, until we come to &lt;a href=\"Terrfyg\"&gt;Terrfyg&lt;/a&gt;, who first turned us to the ways of the beast. He tries to enter Sovngarde, but before he can even approach &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, he is set upon by a great wolf, who pulls him into the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; laughs with welcoming arms.\nTerrfyg seems regretful, but also eager to join Hircine after a lifetime of service as a beast.\nThen I see every next &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; turn away from Sovngarde and enter the Hunting Grounds of their own accord. Until it comes to me, and I see great Tsun on the misty horizon, beckoning me. It appears I have a choice. And then, at my side, a stranger I had not seen before. As I look into [his/her] eyes, we turn to see the same wolf who dragged away Terrfyg, and [he/she] and I draw weapons together.\nI realize this is only a dream, but a strong enough dream to inspire a man like me to take to writing, so it must be of some importance.\nI've spoken of my thoughts to &lt;a href=\"the%20Circle\"&gt;the Circle&lt;/a&gt;, withholding the part about the stranger lest &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt; worry I will no longer seek his counsel, and I was not surprised to see them torn by it. Skjor and &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela&lt;/a&gt; are strong in the ways of the beast, and even seemed to suggest that the Hunting Grounds would be their choice of afterlife, if it were truly a choice. &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; seemed most troubled. The boy is as fierce as a &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sabre cat&lt;/a&gt; in battle, but his heart's fire burns too brightly at times. He felt deceived, and I don't blame him. &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt; didn't know what to think, but I believe he will come around with me and his brother eventually. He usually does. I don't know what to do about Skjor and Aela. I know they respect &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt;, and me, but they take to the blood more deeply than the rest of us.\nFortune smiles upon us yesterday, Vilkas was telling me how difficult it had been for him to give up his transformations. Until we can pursue a true cure, the twins and I have chosen not to give in to the beastblood. For me, it's provided a clearer head, but Vilkas seems to be suffering a bit for it. Farkas seems completely untroubled. That boy continues to amaze with his fortitude.\nWhile Vilkas was confiding, through the shadows of Jorrvaskr, I saw a newcomer approach, who wished to join our numbers. It was the stranger from my dream, the one who would stand with me against the beast. Vilkas began speaking obliquely, not wishing to air our problems in front of our guest, and I had to be doubly cautious to not reveal anything of our secrets to the newcomer while also not revealing the details of my dream to Vilkas. I don't know how the politicians deal with these sorts of machinations daily.\nIn any case, I've sent Vilkas to test the newcomer. We'll see if [he/she] is truly the great warrior I dreamt of.\nThis newcomer, it seems, is made of decent stock. [He/She] calls [himself/herself] [Playername], and has already impressed some of the Circle with [his/her] mettle. I still keep my own counsel on [his/her] place in my dream, for now. Let us see what kind of destiny [he/she] is carving before hitching to [him/her].\nIn the meanwhile, I look for ways of cleansing my blood. The writings and legends on the subject are sparse and contradictory. I don't wish to engage any wizadry on this matter, but I fear they may be the only ones who best know how to navigate these worlds of knowledge.\nIt's apparent to me now that Terrfyg's choice to turn us was indeed a mistake. Magics and their ilk are not in keeping with the spirit of the Companions. We face our problems directly, without the need of such trickery. I can only hope to guide us back to the true path of Ysgramor before the rot takes me.\n[Playername] continues to impress. I don't know where [he/she] will stand on the question of the blood, but the question has not been presented yet. [He/She] does know that we carry the beastblood, and appears curious about it. Soon enough, I can explain our troubles, and hopefully see what role [he/she] will play.\nI'm amazed that Aela thinks she can keep a secret among this drunken rabble. Especially with the loss of Skjor (my heart aches), emotions are fraying, and the walls of discretion are the first to fall.\nApparently she and [Playername] are waging their own separate war against the Silver Hand, in retaliation for Skjor's death. Their hearts are noble, but the course of vengeance is running hot, and I fear the counterstroke that may come if they do not rein in their fury.\n[Playername] shows valor, though even in this more underhanded time. We have not had cause to speak, much and that is something I deeply regret. I have high hopes for [his/her] destiny, as I realized that [his/her] appearance in my dream may indeed mark [him/her] as the Harbinger to succeed me.\nI have received few dreams over the course of my life, but when they come, I have learned to trust them. I have also learned to trust the instincts of my heart, which tells me that [Playername] can carry the Companions legacy as truly as any residing in Jorrvaskr, especially with the loss of Skjor. Aela is too solitary, Vilkas too fiery, and Farkas too kind-hearted. Only [Playername] stands as a true warrior who can keep a still mind amidst these burning hearts.\nI will not speak to [him/her] of any of this, though. It is too much to burden another with. My hope is that [he/she] and I can keep counsel over the coming years, that I can impart the wisdom of the Harbingers. All things in time.

{"id": "62498", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=62498", "title": "Kodlak Whitemane", "text": "Kodlak Whitemane is the &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; in who resides in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. As Harbinger, he does not give orders, but his word is highly respected in &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; and across all nine &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Kodlak is also a member of &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt;, though he wishes to be rid of his &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, since upon death, a werewolf's soul goes to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s hunting grounds. Kodlak does not wish for this to be his fate and instead wants his soul to go to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; afterlife. \nIf the Companions questline is completed, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; becomes Harbinger and cleanses Kodlak of his Lycanthropy. He can later be seen in Sovngarde among the other lost spirits that are trapped in the mist formed by &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; to prevent them from reaching the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nKodlak was found by the previous Harbinger, &lt;a href=\"Askar\"&gt;Askar&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime after this, Kodlak succeeded Askar as Harbinger. Kodlak has commanded the Companions for twenty years, balancing his tactical skill, ferocity in combat, and commanding presence. However, those days are drawing to a close. One year before the return of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, Kodlak contracted the rot, despite werewolves having a 100% disease immunity. His condition has reached its final stages of deterioration, making him weak in body. In frustration, he has taken to locking himself behind closed doors and poring over old documents, desperate to cure himself of lycanthropy before the rot ends his life.\nJust before the arrival of the Dragonborn, a dream came to Kodlak. As he describes in &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%27s%20Journal\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt;, he dreamed of &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt; denying the former Harbingers access to &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Shor's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, where honored heroes gather. One by one, their wolf spirit drags them to Hircine, to hunt with him forever. Kodlak helplessly watches as his turn comes and his beast attacks him. However, a stranger arrives to protect him. This person drives back the beast and saves his soul. After seeing the Dragonborn for the first time, Kodlak recognizes them as that person and thus allows the Dragonborn to become a Companion.\nPersonality.\nKodlak Whitemane proves to be a benign and wise individual for such a rowdy group. As Harbinger, he is the one that helps channel the Companions' skills in a way that can benefit Skyrim's people, rather than leaving them to brawl and drink all day long. His wisdom is respected throughout the nine holds, as well. When the Dragonborn first meets Kodlak, he is in his twilight years. He has lost his will to win glory in battle, partially because his body cannot allow it. He hints annoyance at this limitation, but he never openly complains.\nKodlak proves to be very wise and perceptive. He could see the Dragonborn's potential instantly, aside from the fact he had seen them in a dream. His awareness is also apparent when he discovers the secret campaign to avenge Skjor. He informs the Dragonborn that the circle of retribution will turn on them and that they have taken more blood than honor demands. Kodlak's foresight is proven correct by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on Jorrvaskr. His observation on honor is very definitive as well; while he grieves at &lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt;'s loss, he does not condone unnecessary bloodshed, as it is dishonorable. He explains how wrong it can be to react in fury and grief, and he follows this statement. Even with his stern disapproval, Kodlak is not angry with the Dragonborn's actions and gives the Dragonborn a chance for redemption.\nStoic in disposition, Kodlak can be very withdrawn at times. During the storyline, the Dragonborn learns that he is haunted by the thought of joining Hircine in the afterlife. As a true Nord, he wishes to go to Sovngarde, and he persistently devotes his time to trying to find a cure.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Dragonborn enters &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, they can ask one of the Companions on how to join. Every one of them will say that they need to speak with Kodlak, the Harbinger. Should the Dragonborn decide to find him, he will first be seen talking with &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; about his lycanthropy at the end of the living quarters downstairs. If the Dragonborn asks him about joining the Companions, he will immediately accept them, deeming them worthy. Vilkas, however, disagrees and is surprised at Kodlak's decision. Kodlak will then tell Vilkas to spar with the Dragonborn out in the courtyard to test their strength.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%27s%20Honor\"&gt;Blood's Honor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this quest, Kodlak tells the Dragonborn to kill the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witches\"&gt;Glenmoril Witches&lt;/a&gt; and take one of &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witch%20Head\"&gt;their heads&lt;/a&gt;, so that Kodlak can cure himself of lycanthropy and get into &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. While returning to Jorrvaskr after slaying the Glenmoril Witches, the Dragonborn finds out that the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; attacked the mead hall. Upon entering Jorrvaskr, Kodlak is found dead, and the pieces of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; stolen. Vilkas then claims his death will be avenged, and he and the Dragonborn set out to recover the stolen pieces of Wuuthrad.\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must attend Kodlak's funeral at the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, joined by many residents of Whiterun. Afterwards, the Circle's members gather in &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt;, to discuss on curing Kodlak's spirit of lycanthropy. They set out to &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, where the ritual can be performed. After throwing a Glenmoril Witch Head at the fire in the depths of the tomb, Kodlak's wolf spirit appears. Defeating it will cure Kodlak's lycanthropy, granting him access to the Nordic afterlife, Sovngarde. Kodlak's spirit then briefly reappears to grant the Dragonborn the title of &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; succeeding Kodlak as the new leader of the Companions.\nDialogue.\n\"A stranger comes to our hall.\"\nConversations.\nLycanthropy.\n&lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt;: \"But I still hear the call of the blood.\"\nKodlak: \"We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.\"\nVilkas: \"You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily.\"\nKodlak: \"Leave that to me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilkas: \"Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?\"\nKodlak: \"I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts.\"\nVilkas: \"Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.\"\nKodlak: \"Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference. What matters is their heart.\"\nVilkas: \"\"And their arm.\"\n[After speaking to Kodlak]\nKodlak: \"Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do.\"\nVilkas: \"Aye.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Proving%20Honor\"&gt;Proving Honor&lt;/a&gt;.\nKodlak: \"Brothers and sisters of the Circle, today we welcome a new soul into our mortal fold. This man has endured, has challenged, and has shown his valor. Who will speak for him?\"\nFarkas: \"I stand witness to the courage of the soul before us.\"\nKodlak: \"Would you raise your shield in his defense?\"\nFarkas: \"I would stand at his back, that the world might never overtake us.\"\nKodlak: \"And would you raise your sword in his honor?\"\nFarkas: \"It stands ready to meet the blood of his foes.\"\nKodlak: \"And would you raise a mug in his name?\"\nFarkas: \"I would lead the song of triumph as our mead hall reveled in his stories.\"\nKodlak: \"Then the judgement of this Circle is complete. His heart beats with fury and courage that have united the Companions since the days of the distant green summers. Let it beat with ours, that the mountains may echo and our enemies may tremble at the call.\"\nAela: \"It shall be so.\"\nSkjor: \"It shall be so.\"\nVilkas: \"It shall be so.\"\nTaking the mantle.\nKodlak: \"Tradition is very important to me, son.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Skjor\"&gt;Skjor&lt;/a&gt;: \"To me as well. I think we don't see the same tradition at play here.\"\nKodlak: \"If you want to lead this pack when I'm gone, you have to see farther. Look closer.\"\nSkjor: \"Well which is it? Look farther or closer?\"\nKodlak: \"Come on now, boy, you know what I meant...\"\nSkjor: \"You speak in riddles sometimes.\"\nKodlak: \"I don't mean to confuse you.\"\nSkjor: \"It's not confusing... just frustrating.\"\nKodlak: \"You're a strong warrior, Skjor. Your heart is fiery and that serves you well in battle.\"\nSkjor: \"Thank you, Harbinger.\"\nKodlak: \"But even the bravest of men consider their actions. I want you to survive long enough to take the mantle.\"\nSkjor: \"Don't worry about me.\"\nAela's leisure time.\n&lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela&lt;/a&gt;: \"You wanted to see me?\"\nKodlak: \"I worry that you've been spending too many nights out.\"\nAela: \"Where I go is my business. If you have a concern about my honor, bring it before the Circle.\"\nKodlak: \"You forget yourself, young one.\"\nAela: \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. Just... these hunters. We're all on edge.\"\nKodlak: \"That's why it's best to not mistake foolhardiness for bravery.\"\nGlorious hunt.\nKodlak: \"How goes the hunt?\"\nAela: \"Skjor's heard rumors of a bear the size of a mammoth in Hammerfell. We're going to seek it out.\"\nKodlak: \"What glorious prey. Come back alive, and with stories to tell!\"\nAela: \"Always.\"\nYoung Ones.\nKodlak: \"How are the young ones coming along?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt;: \"Some are too happy to fight. Blood runs hot.\"\nKodlak: \"I remember when you were the same way. The more they train, the more they'll cool down.\"\nFarkas: \"I hope so.\"\nKodlak: \"Just have them focus on the calm in the battle. Control the rage, don't let it control you.\"\nFavored Weapons.\nFarkas: \"What weapon do you like, Harbinger?\"\nKodlak: \"When I was young, I favored huge swords, much like you. Hard to lift these days, but I still enjoy the heft of a good hammer.\"\nFarkas: \"Big swords should always beat little swords.\"\nKodlak: \"Brave hearts beat lesser ones. That's the decider.\"\nThose in Charge.\n&lt;a href=\"Torvar\"&gt;Torvar&lt;/a&gt;: \"Master, I...\"\nKodlak: \"\"My title is &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt;, child. I am no man's master.\"\"\nTorvar: \"Forgive me. You're just the one in charge, and it's what I'm used to.\"\nKodlak: \"No one is in charge here. Each Shield-Brother is his own man, each Shield-Sister her own woman.\"\nTorvar: \"Well why do I have to listen to Skjor, then?\"\nKodlak: \"Skjor has been a warrior for a long time. You would be wise to listen to him. Any warrior that gets to be old is either fearsome or a coward. I'll let you find out which Skjor is.\"\nMoving Up.\nTorvar: \"Do you think I could be a member of the Circle? Some day? If I work hard?\"\nKodlak: \"Don't worry about such things. Just focus on your own honor. Bring glory to the Companions, and that glory will return upon you.\"\nTorvar: \"I just want to make sure I'm moving up.\"\nKodlak: \"This isn't the military, son. There are no ranks.\"\nTorvar: \"But aren't the Circle in charge? And don't you lead them?\"\nKodlak: \"I guide the Companions. The Circle advises me. But we are all free warriors. Only our honor binds us together.\""}

To collect this mask, entry into &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Bromjunaar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; is required, which can be found within the central barrow in &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;. There lies a &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Mask\"&gt;Wooden Mask&lt;/a&gt; that sends its wearer back to a time before the destruction of Bromjunaar Sanctuary. The central focus of the sanctuary is the dragon priest shrine. Once the eight masks are placed in each respective slot on the shrine, the final mask Konahrik is revealed. The other masks may be taken from the shrine once Konahrik is obtained.\nEnchantment.\nKonahrik bears a unique enchantment called \"Konahrik's Privilege\". This translates into the following abilities:\nHealing.\nWhenever the wearer is struck while below 15% health, there is a 15% chance that the mask will heal the wearer and any nearby allies with the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Healing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Grand Healing&lt;/a&gt; spell, and grant a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Cloak\"&gt;Flame Cloak&lt;/a&gt; for 10 seconds. The healing benefit will raise the Restoration skill, and the flame cloak will similarly increase the Destruction skill. A similar healing effect can be achieved with the perk &lt;a href=\"Avoid%20Death\"&gt;Avoid Death&lt;/a&gt;, which activates when health reaches a critical low with no random variables. However, this benefit is strictly limited to one activation per day, while the mask's effect is constant. When combined with high health and damage resistance, the mask's constant effect can make you nigh-immortal as the amount of hits you can take below 15% health increases to the point where it is almost guaranteed to heal you before you perish.\nSpectral ally.\nWhenever the wearer is struck while below 15% health, there is a 3% chance that the mask will not only restore the user's health, but also &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Spectral Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ally&lt;/a&gt;. The said character may use &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reanimate%20Corpse\"&gt;Reanimate Corpse&lt;/a&gt;. Should corpses be absent, the Dragon Priest will instead summon a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmithing.\nIt can be upgraded with a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;, and also benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Smithing\"&gt;Daedric Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk, which doubles the improvement. Placing the mask on the Dragon Priest shrine will remove any improvement done via smithing."}

Atak put its roots through Kota's eyes, but since Kota had fangs, it bit Atak. Atak learned hunger from this, and bit Kota back. Many things came to be from this struggle. It lasted for so long that eventually they forgot that they were fighting, so they shed their skin and severed their roots and became Atakota.\nEventually, as the spirits tore at Atakota's skin and drank its blood, Atakota broke back into Atak and Kota, and the conflict between the two began anew, though they had now learned about death, so there was a lot of violence. From Atak's sap then came the stones, and Kota's blood made up the oceans. &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; of Atakota awakened, and since it was bigger than Atak or Kota individually, it decided to eat them both."}

The demonym is seen as both \"Kothri\" and \"Kothringi\". They are noted for being fierce; and having silver skin and \"reflective faces\"\nHistory.\nBefore the Cyrodilic human slave uprising against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0in 1E 242,\u00a0the Kothringi were among the many tribes of men that the Ayleids used as slaves. There are indications that they made their way to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; by boat, although the purpose of these voyages is unknown.\nThe Kothringi were eventually wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; that started in 2E 560. By 13th of Sun's Dawn, 2E 561, the Flu had already started affecting even the most remote of Kothri settlements, such as &lt;a href=\"Stillrise%20Village\"&gt;Stillrise Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;. In that case, the Flu had apparently been brought into the settlement from &lt;a href=\"Mud%20Tree%20Village\"&gt;Mud Tree Village&lt;/a&gt;, by two trader apprentices named Abaaleb and Sana. Still in 2E 561, &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20Chirah\"&gt;Shaman Chirah&lt;/a&gt; of Stillrise (under &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Suhlak\"&gt;Chieftain Suhlak&lt;/a&gt;'s orders) prayed to &lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt; for a cure for the deadly disease, but had no answer. That led him to appeal to &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, wishing for his village to not die from the disease. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; then turned all of the villagers into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThe Kothringi generally preferred to go naked, although a few wore clothes when outside their native land. Their garb appears to be simple leather with animal bones stitched in, although some wore metal suspended from rope around themselves. They lived in round stone huts with chimneys, topped with domed thatched roofs. The\u00a0\u00a0is seen etched into rocks around their villages.\nThey appear to have had a shamanic society and worshiped a &lt;a href=\"Kothri%20Pantheon\"&gt;pantheon of their own&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt; was apparently the main god, worshipped when they travelled to Valenwood. with &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibe&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kin&lt;/a&gt; (the \"mothers of the Around-us\") as blessing-givers. In &lt;a href=\"Stillrise%20Village\"&gt;Stillrise Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; was worshiped as a last resort against the deadly Flu.\nNotable Kothringi.\nThe most well known member of the Kothringi Tribe is\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt;, who served as a knight of &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress Tavia&lt;/a&gt;. By the second era, a Kothringi village Zuuk\u00a0located on top of an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; ruin was named after him.\nThe last living member of the Kothringi was &lt;a href=\"Drillk\"&gt;Drillk&lt;/a&gt;, a madman who believed himself royalty. In , the Vestige has the choice to either let him live on as the last member of his people, or end his life for the sake of absorbing a keystone to further the cause of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; in Shadowfen.\nThere is also an immortal village of Kothringi in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Stillrise%20Village\"&gt;Stillrise Village&lt;/a&gt;. They have been turned into skeletons in exchange for immortality by &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;."}

The new kingdom extends as far as the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Barony of Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Mournoth\"&gt;Fiefdom of Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nKozanset city is relatively close to the base of the Dragontail Mountains, somewhat close to the city of &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;. The town itself is somewhat spread out, making it more valued as a trading post, rather than a fully-fledged city-state with walls. Eastern Kozanset is a row of buildings housing the local &lt;a href=\"Kozanset%20Town%20Hall\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt; and the variety of inns such as &lt;a href=\"the%20Slaking%20Chalice\"&gt;the Slaking Chalice&lt;/a&gt;. Western Kozanset is more open, with a single watchtower overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Wastes\"&gt;Hollow Wastes&lt;/a&gt; and the Barony of Kozanset. The &lt;a href=\"Kozanset%20Smithy\"&gt;Kozanset Smithy&lt;/a&gt; is just west of the building row, the area in between is considered the town square. North of the smithy is several warehouses and an open space that occasionally hosts &lt;a href=\"Baandari%20Caravan\"&gt;Baandari Caravan&lt;/a&gt;s. East of Kozanset is a large ravine with thin bridges connecting Kozanset to the rest of Tigonus.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Kozanset was having a serious &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;Harpy&lt;/a&gt; infestation that had started to annoy the people of the city. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Andrin%20at-Lehiel\"&gt;Magistrate Andrin at-Lehiel&lt;/a&gt; had hired the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Gold Coast Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the Harpies, but the mercenaries had caused trouble throughout the township, and a resolution was needed. The daughter of the Magistrate, &lt;a href=\"Leja%20at-Lehiel\"&gt;Leja at-Lehiel&lt;/a&gt; was sympathetic with the Harpies and did some detective work to learn why the Harpies were outraged. Around the same time, a traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Kozanset and helped Lehiel in her quest. The Vestige gathered the Harpy eggs hidden around Kozanset and brought it to Leja at her estate, where she eventually brought them back to the Harpy nest east of the town. Leja tasked the Vestige to expose the mercenaries and learn of their plan. They had stolen the Harpy matriarch for monetary value, but it caused the Harpies to attack. With this news, the town rallied against the mercenaries and forced them out. Afterward, the Harpy situation was solved, and Kozanset was freed from torment.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the Barony of Kozanset was under the reign of an unknown baron, whose name was not recorded in the history books. Kozanset existed among the forty-four other nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Kozanset, itself is in a mainland march that is next to the Kingdom of Sentinel, one of the three great kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the same year, the Warp in the West resulted in the Kingdoms expanding their territories, absorbing the smaller nations. The Barony of Kozanset was annexed into the Kingdom of Sentinel along with other regions on the southern coast of the Iliac. Kozanset has been a part of the Crowns ever since its inception, but with the absorption into Sentinel, it was forced to bow to their adversaries."}

They left the province to build their own empire in modern-day Hammerfell. The Kragen Clan soon followed, settling in Skyrim. They built their stronghold in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, which became the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;. They would also build &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel&lt;/a&gt;, which the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; was built around of.\nArkngthamz became the center of Aetherium manufacture.

They eventually came to build the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt;, crafting powerful artifacts with strong enchantments. However, this alliance soon fell apart as each of the cities attempted to lay claim on the Forge. As a result, the Kragen Clan left Skyrim and moved further west into the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt; where they built Arkngthamz-Phng, which would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;."}

Kragenmoor has been a powerful place in the Dunmeri economy being occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; throughout the eras. It is a farming city that feeds the greater Stonefalls region and their illustrious cities.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nKragenmoor is situated in the western mountains of Morrowind, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; that border the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The land that Kragenmoor inhabits is where the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; population of Stonefalls lives primarily; notable groups include the &lt;a href=\"Ulath%20Tribe\"&gt;Ulath Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Kagesh%20Tribe\"&gt;Kagesh Tribe&lt;/a&gt; are known to have settlements throughout Varanis. The Varanis Valley is fertile with the ash-ridden land, several plantations and farms are known to operate around the city of Kragenmoor, selling their produce at Kragenmoor's markets. The city is well-known throughout the land as a farming settlement, feeding the Dark Elves from the faraway cities of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. East of Kragenmoor is one of the twin volcanoes of Stonefalls, the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks the Western portion of Stonefalls and houses &lt;a href=\"Sadal\"&gt;Sadal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Brothers of Strife. The leader of Kragenmoor is the only person with access to the Tormented Spire, making the volcano rather inaccessible.\nKragenmoor itself is one of the smaller cities in Morrowind, but it is a trading hub first, before a city. The city-state of Kragenmoor is built atop the hills of Varanis, just before the lush grazelands of the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plains\"&gt;Deshaan Plains&lt;/a&gt;. Upper Kragenmoor is a circular steppe made atop of Dunmeri-style stonework with bridges connecting to neighboring hills divided by a sunken lane that represents Lower Kragenmoor. The hills would house the local guilds among other things like &lt;a href=\"the%20Hissing%20Guar\"&gt;the Hissing Guar&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent tavern in Kragenmoor and the House Barracks. Most of the bridges had stairs that lead to Upper Kragenmoor. In the central square is the &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Grandmaster's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, where the leader of the city resides, overlooking the grazelands and the town. The bridge west of the town square leads to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20Crypts\"&gt;House Dres Crypts&lt;/a&gt;, which are somewhat expansive, almost as significant as the city-state itself. Lower Kragenmoor is a sunken lane, where the slaves of House Dres and the overall poor are known to stay, whenever they are not working. The main road through Varanis connects to Lower Kragenmoor, and another route extends pass the Hissing Guar, leading to the hills and ancient ruin.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nYoriss Ra'athim &amp; the Nordic Conquest.\nThe Great Dunmeri House of &lt;a href=\"Ra%27athim\"&gt;Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; has been a prominent power throughout the first era of Morrowind, specifically, in the Stonefalls region through their ancestral home, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. House Ra'athim extended their reach beyond Ebonheart, into other cities in the land, including Kragenmoor. &lt;a href=\"Yoriss%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Yoriss Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; was the Queen of Kragenmoor during Morrowind's trying times. She was one of the few Dark Elven rulers still around when the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic forces of Skyrim expanded their Empire, conquering the province of Morrowind, even capturing Ebonheart from House Ra'athim. Yoriss' reign over Kragenmoor was still around during the Nordic occupation of Morrowind, continued afterward when &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;, his brothers, and father had driven out the Nords of Ebonheart. The Nords were completely driven out of Morrowind in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; ended. It is unknown how long Yoriss' reign had lasted, but it was able to manage through hard times.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTanval's Endeavor; Trouble at Kragenmoor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Kragenmoor was under the occupation of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, through the control of &lt;a href=\"Omin%20Dres\"&gt;Omin Dres&lt;/a&gt;, the Grandmaster of House Dres. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the region of Stonefalls, leading to several casualties like &lt;a href=\"Garyn%20Indoril\"&gt;Garyn Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. Garyn was the son of &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, an Indoril War-Hero during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. With the death of his son, Tanval gathered his Vanguard and left for Kragenmoor, to release &lt;a href=\"Sadal\"&gt;Sadal&lt;/a&gt; of the Brothers of Strife onto the Covenant Armada, in revenge for his son. Tanval traveled to Kragenmoor to force Omin Dres for the key to the Tormented Spire. To get what he wants, Tanval ordered his Vanguard to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Sen%20Dres\"&gt;Sen Dres&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20Crypts\"&gt;House Dres Crypts&lt;/a&gt;, so that Omin would be forced to give them the passage. When Tanval was given the key, he left Sen Dres in his prison and headed for the Tormented Spire. The &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; had followed Tanval to Kragenmoor and received the news about both Sen Dres and Tanval Indoril. An Agent of the Pact known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was able to uncover Sen's whereabouts in the Ancient Dres Crypts, through investigative sleuthing. Sen Dres would later be rescued. In gratitude, Omin Dres gave the key to the Tormented Spire, to stop Tanval Indoril once and for all.\nThe Talosian Conquest &amp; the Treaty of the Armistice.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20of%20Hammerfell\"&gt;Conquest of Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; coming to an end, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was guided by &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; to invade the province of Morrowind. Wulfharth was blinded by vengeance towards the Dark Elves of Morrowind after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; had the Nords fall in defeat by the Elves. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Septim Army&lt;/a&gt; had advanced across the &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, attacking the Dunmeri settlements along the western border. Minor townships including &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cormaris%20View\"&gt;Cormaris View&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by the Septim Army. Eventually, the city-states of Kragenmoor and &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; were attacked during the conflict. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; were involved, but as time went on, they began to withdraw, accepting the invader's rule over the province. &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; was the last standing defense against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; but the conflict had ended when &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; himself had appeared before his people at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; to tell them that a negotiation would be created between the two factions. What came out of the negotiation was the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt;, which had not only brought Morrowind to the Septim Empire, but it had closed off the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, deeming it a &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; protected area, this was among other requests made by the government of Morrowind.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nKragenmoor during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Kragenmoor in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Kragenmoor was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Shalpar\"&gt;King Shalpar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrathen Drothan and his plot against the Empire.\nThe Septim Empire's incorporation into Morrowind has left people divided, calling &lt;a href=\"King%20Helseth\"&gt;King Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Great Houses, the lapdogs to the Empire of Cyrodiil. There have been very few revolts throughout the Empire that intend to attack the Empire itself, including the rise of &lt;a href=\"Calaxes%20Septim\"&gt;Calaxes Septim&lt;/a&gt;. There was one rebellion that started in Morrowind called the &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Army\"&gt;Drothmeri Army&lt;/a&gt;, which was created by &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Frathen Drothan&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. Drothan had planned to topple the Septim Empire with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifact\"&gt;Daedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;. The Drothmeri Army had grown to a threaten size by the time Frathen Drothan had reached the city-state of Kragenmoor. But by the 17th of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, it became difficult to find mercenaries, but the Army continued across the Valus Mountains and entering the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;, where Mehrunes' Razor would be buried within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Sundercliff%20Watch\"&gt;Sundercliff Watch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis in Kragenmoor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Morrowind was heavily affected by the Daedric invasion, though the city-state of Kragenmoor was oddly unaffected. At the time, &lt;a href=\"Caius%20Cosades\"&gt;Caius Cosades&lt;/a&gt;, a Spymaster of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; was stationed in Kragenmoor, where he witnessed the large increase in worship for &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, ever since the events in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Every skeptic, back-slider, and Tribunal guards would feverishly worship the local shrine of Akatosh. Usually, the Elves of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; were lukewarm guests of feast dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, but after the Crisis, the people of House Hlaalu have sought out divine counsel and faith for the divines."}

I have been a hunter in these parts for the last six years. Once a week, I travel to &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; to sell meat and skins.\nOn one such trip, I spotted a collapsed figure by the roadside, slumped up against a log. I quickly realized that this was Enthiris, a kind soul I would trade and travel with each winter.\nHis skin was as white as a sheet. His sunken face and bite marks on his neck made it clear that this was the work of vampires. Enthiris never deserved such a fate.\nI carried him to Solitude to raise the city guard. When I arrived, they acted with indifference as cold as the corpse I laid before them. They had seen this before, they said. They offered to bury him, but their interest of the matter ended there. It was then I decided, at night, I would begin to hunt more dangerous game.\nI have slain over a dozen of the fanged wretches in the months since. In fact, I'd become quite proficient at the task.\nUntil one night, I found a lone vampire prowling the woods. He stopped to rest, seemingly unable to catch his breath. Whether it was from thirst or exhaustion, I couldn't be sure. Still, such monsters deserve no pity. So I hid in the brush nearby, drew my crossbow, and lined up the killing shot.\nSuddenly, two of the devils pounced from both sides, clawing and biting. I had been led into a trap.\nI managed to escape, but my wounds were grave. Worse, I knew from the burning in my veins that I now had the illness that would soon consume me, turn me into one of them.\nSo now, on what would be my final day as a mortal, I pen this letter, and walk to my favorite overlook south of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt; and watch the morning sunrise one last time.\nI now pass the torch to you, dear reader. Seek out my remains. Among my effects, you should find a key. Open my &lt;a href=\"Ironback%20Hideout\"&gt;cellar&lt;/a&gt; and take up arms I have stored there. Use them to keep travelers safe from the vampire menace as I once did."}

The school is known to be the center of &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; study in Skyrim and it was created by &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose only.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe College of Winterhold is located atop of a tall ice formation that is not connected to the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to reach the school is an ancient bridge that connects from the mainland, on the western end of town. The College is centered around a square with a pool of Magicka streaming out into a pillar and large statue of a young Shalidor. The main hall is called the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, where many students practice their skills whether it is a &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; spell or a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Ward\"&gt;Lesser Ward&lt;/a&gt; spell. Above the Hall is &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt;, a vast collection of books that date back to the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; and have information on the mystical &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Countenance\"&gt;Hall of Countenance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt; are where the students and teachers live respectively. Underneath the College is &lt;a href=\"the%20Midden\"&gt;the Midden&lt;/a&gt;, a dungeon where many members go to perform experiments.\nHistory.\nPapers kept in the College's library reportedly date back to the late &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; in the add-on corroborates this date, recalling that the College existed when she was entombed between the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt; empires. Additionally, documents from as early as &lt;a href=\"2E%20373\"&gt;2E 373&lt;/a&gt; suggest academic collaboration between the Reman Empire and the College. However, &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; states in her tour of the grounds that the College has been a \"fixture\" of Skyrim for thousands of years, its inception being credited to Arch-Mage Shalidor in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was flourishing with a new renaissance of power and wealth. Several refugees from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; travel to Winterhold and bring their culture into the city as well as their old mercantile spirit. Scholars from all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; went to the College of Winterhold to bring books since the &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Collective\"&gt;Ysmir Collective&lt;/a&gt; was established in the College. It became the academic cornerstone in Northern Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20122\"&gt;4E 122&lt;/a&gt;, much of the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; collapsed into the sea in an event known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;The Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;, although the College of Winterhold was left unharmed by the cataclysm. This prompted suspicion among many citizens of Winterhold, who believed that the institution may have had a hand in the collapse. Although the College denied any involvement in the event, suggesting that the College was unharmed because of \"protective magicks\" placed around it many years previously, the populace of Winterhold continued to harbor great distrust for the mages at the College.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the Arch-Mage of the College was &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, and the Master Wizard was &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the College led by &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; to study the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; architecture. Deep within Saarthal was a device called the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, it had the ability to disperse large quantities of &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and was considered very powerful and dangerous. To quell the dangers it poses, an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;aspiring student&lt;/a&gt; of the College traveled to the vast ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; after an adventure in &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ancano\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; was tampering with the Eye of Magnus and caused a magical explosion on the campus, including the ruined city of Winterhold. After dealing with the threat in the city, the student used the Staff of Magnus and weakened Ancano. They eventually defeated him and saved the college. That student was then promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; and Tolfdir was made the new Master Wizard of Winterhold."}

When the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; appears, the current &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; serving as the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Wizard\"&gt;Master Wizard&lt;/a&gt;. During the faction's main quest, &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; replaces her as Master Wizard. The College is located in the northern section of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%23Hold%20capital%20cities\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, in northern Skyrim. Instructors of each magical discipline reside within, offering &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;various magical wares&lt;/a&gt; to members.\nAdmittance.\nUpon visiting the College, it can be joined by passing a test of merit which requires the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;casting of a spell&lt;/a&gt;. The College must be joined during \"&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;\" in order to progress the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;. However, this can be avoided if the Dragonborn travels directly to &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27%20Outpost\"&gt;Septimus Signus' Outpost&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the next part of the quest there.\nBefore entering the College, the gatekeeper, &lt;a href=\"Faralda%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Faralda&lt;/a&gt;, will wish to see a demonstration of the Dragonborn's magical powers. She requests to see a spell appropriate for the Dragonborn's level before gaining passage. These spells include:\nSeveral of the spells require more than the starting 100 Magicka so perks, leveling, or enchanted equipment may be necessary. Although she does not state it explicitly, some spells (e.g. Fear) must be cast at the emblem on the ground or she will ignore it. If the spell she requests has not yet been learned, she offers to sell it for 30 . The gate beyond the bridge does not open until the proper spell has been demonstrated for Faralda.\nBypassing.\nA high-level &lt;a href=\"speech\"&gt;persuasion&lt;/a&gt; check bypasses this test. Additionally, revealing one's identity as the Dragonborn causes Faralda to ask for a demonstration of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. Successfully using it bypasses the spell-casting test. This option can only be used during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nRules and expulsion.\nKilling a student causes other College members to refuse to speak with the killer, starting the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rejoining%20the%20College\"&gt;Rejoining the College&lt;/a&gt;.\" &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;Stealing&lt;/a&gt; items from college members is also considered a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; if caught.\nArchitectural design.\nThe College of Winterhold is located just north of Winterhold, on a large cliff. A narrow bridge in a state of disrepair connects the city to the College.\nThe central courtyard is dominated by a statue of the first Arch-Mage of the College, &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, who is also the supposed founder of the city; this is the hub of the facility, offering access back out to the bridge and into the three Halls. The exterior windows offer exceptional views of the coastline.\nThe courtyard branches off to the three halls of the College. The &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt;, the living quarters for mage apprentices, is off to the left upon entering the College, while the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Countenance\"&gt;Hall of Countenance&lt;/a&gt;, the living quarters for more advanced mages, is off to the right. Straight ahead lies the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, the lecture hall of the College.\nFrom the Hall of the Elements, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt; branches off on the left while &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt;, the College's library, branches off on the right.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Midden\"&gt;The Midden&lt;/a&gt;, a prison or storage area beneath the College, houses the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20Dunlain\"&gt;Augur of Dunlain&lt;/a&gt;, and a Daedric Relic encountered in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Names\"&gt;Forgotten Names&lt;/a&gt;.\" &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; inhabit the halls of The Midden. A tunnel here leads to the Skyrim overworld just outside of the College.\nHistory.\nWinterhold was once a great, powerful and wealthy hold, and its relationship with the College of Winterhold was good.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20122\"&gt;4E 122&lt;/a&gt;, an unprecedented, cataclysmic event struck Winterhold and most of the areas along the coastline. A massive storm came in from the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, which brought huge waves which crashed into Winterhold. Most of the city fell into the sea, leaving the city in ruins both physically in terms of the destruction of the city itself, and the emotional and psychological damage to Winterhold's people. This event would eventually be referred to as \"The Great Collapse.\" The disaster left Winterhold in ruins, and some had said that things would never be the same again, including Winterhold's relationship with the College. The people of Winterhold would eventually begin to blame the College for causing the Great Collapse. Winterhold has yet to recover from the Great Collapse.\nHistorical documents.\nPapers kept in the College's library reportedly date back to the late Second Era. &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; in the add-on corroborates this date, recalling that the College existed when she was entombed between the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; empires. However, &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; states in her tour of the grounds that the College has been a \"fixture\" of Skyrim for thousands of years.\nWritten evidence of the College's existence is found in the \"\" from &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, which describes the growth of the city of Winterhold after the College obtained a group of documents known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Collective\"&gt;Ysmir Collective&lt;/a&gt;\", and the \"&lt;a href=\"Atlas%20of%20Dragons\"&gt;Atlas of Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\" from &lt;a href=\"2E%20373\"&gt;2E 373&lt;/a&gt;, which documents dragons slain throughout history.\nRelation to the Mages Guild.\nAs the College was independent from the Mages Guild, &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; was never made illegal by the College, unlike the Mages Guild in Cyrodiil. For the College of Winterhold, the practice was generally regarded as a tool, not a weapon, although practicing it outside of the College was, and is, not advised. Like Cyrodiil, there were still wandering groups of Necromancers that did not function alongside the College. Since the College was independent of the jurisdiction of the Mages Guild, it was unaffected by the &lt;a href=\"Necromancy%20Ban%20of%203E%20431\"&gt;Necromancy Ban of 3E 431&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent eradication of that ban which led to battles against &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistrust.\nThe College is often blamed for the Great Collapse of 4E 122 and is therefore widely distrusted. It is often believed that it was activities at the College that caused the disaster; the only evidence supporting this is that only the College remained almost untouched. The College has since been cautious as to avoid provoking the population of Skyrim. Many nationalistic &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; also do not trust the College because of the fact that the immigrant &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; make up the majority of the members within the faction. Additionally, most Nords view magic and its practitioners as spineless and weak.\nThe only positive relationship the people of Skyrim have with the College of Winterhold are requests for various items to be enchanted for them. &lt;a href=\"Sergius%20Turrianus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sergius Turrianus&lt;/a&gt; explains that enchanting services are one of the few connections between the College and the people of Skyrim. Occasionally, he will have his students travel to a specific location in Skyrim to pick up an item from a person who made a request to the College to have the item enchanted.\nLectures.\nLectures are held in the Hall of the Elements during the day. These cover a wide range of subjects and the Dragonborn is welcome to listen, provided they have joined the College.\nQuests.\nJoining the College opens a questline consisting of eight &lt;a href=\"%23College%20of%20Winterhold%20quests\"&gt;main quests&lt;/a&gt; and eight &lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;side quests&lt;/a&gt;, one of which is &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Quests\"&gt;radiant&lt;/a&gt;. There are three potential followers associated with the guild, becoming available once their three personal quests are completed. Three unique &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; can be unlocked by completing tasks for the College: Gatekeeper - Join the College of Winterhold; Revealing the Unseen - Complete \"Revealing the Unseen\"; and \"The Eye of Magnus\" - Complete \"The Eye of Magnus.\""}

{"id": "11201", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11201", "title": "Colovia", "text": "Colovia is one of two geographic regions of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; that lies west of the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben River&lt;/a&gt; and east of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and in between the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid&lt;/a&gt; rivers. Colovia is culturally distinct from the areas of eastern Cyrodiil, officially known as &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;. Although currently unified with the Colovia as Cyrodiil, it has been its own independent nation throughout multiple points in history, often called the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nGeographically, the region most frequently identified as Colovia is bordered to the west by the Abecean Sea, to the east by &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben River&lt;/a&gt;, to the south by the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and to the north by the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Politically, the region is also bounded by its borders with &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast. Colovia's geography can be broken down into three primary regions: the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nGold Coast.\nThe Gold Coast is the western-most region of Colovia, consists of the entire coastline on the Abecean Sea, and continuing inland until the start of the West Weald forest and foothills of the Colovian Highlands. The borders of the Gold Coast follow the coastline inward to the mouths of the Strid River to the south, and the Brena River to the north. It is the flattest region in the entire Cyrodiilic province, and much less densely foliated than regions further east. The region gets its name from the sparse golden grass that dots the coastline, alongside the occasional stand of evergreen trees. The Gold Coast also contains Cyrodiil's primary port town of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWest Weald.\nThe West Weald is a large, forested region that runs along the Strid River, abutting the border with Valenwood, and continues in a roughly half-moon shape into the hills of the Colovian Highlands and Jerall Mountains. Once the Strid River ends, the West Weald dips into a steep valley that follows the border with Elsweyr east into the river basin surrounding the Nibenay River and its western tributaries. To the northeast, the forest melds with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt; that surrounds Lake Rumare and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The area is mildly hilly, with much of the bedrock showing through, and contains a number of lakes.\nThe West Weald contains a wealth of flowering plants and deciduous forests, as well as a good amount of quality farmland. In particular, the rolling hills make ideal locations for grapes, and both the &lt;a href=\"Tamika%20Vineyards\"&gt;Tamika Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Surilie%20Brothers%20Vineyards\"&gt;Surilie Brothers Vineyards&lt;/a&gt; are found just outside &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, near the head of the Strid River. The forested hills also support abundant wildlife (some rather dangerous), and a variety of flowing plants.\nThe West Weald also contains &lt;a href=\"Miscarcand%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Miscarcand&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city of one of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms.\nColovian Highlands.\nThe Colovian Highlands are a sparsely populated region making up the western foothills of the Jerall Mountains. It cuts a fairly straight swathe of land running northeast from the coast, along the Hammerfell border, into the Jerall Mountains proper. The vegetation is similar to that of the Gold Coast, though more dense, and there is a higher population of wild animals (in particular, mountain lions and wolves). There are almost no settlements, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise, in the region, though the city of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; was founded on the edge of the foothills in the Great Forest. A single road runs past Chorrol into the hills, and access to the few ruins or dungeons typically requires following extensive and circuitous paths along the mountainside.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, Colovia was part of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Empire\"&gt;Ayleid Empire&lt;/a&gt; in central Tamriel. When &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; overthrew the Ayleid and founded Cyrodiil, it did not initially include the regions west of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;. These regions (which included the Ayleid capital) banded together to form a loosely organized kingdom, under the name The &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. The region would remain essentially independent until well into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cyrodiilic Empire had a fairly stable relationship with Colovia, an arrangement which benefited both regions. Colovia held one of only two ports that gave Cyrodiil access to ocean trade, the other going through the swampy &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;, dangerously close to both Elsweyr and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Most of Colovia was not well suited for farming, especially large-scale crops and livestock, but was a prime source of furs and pelts from its mountain animals, as well as the finest wines in Tamriel.\nIn the early days of the Empire, its Heartland was often the target of ambitions of &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; rulers, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Elves\"&gt;Direnni Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Colovia was situated between Cyrodiil and its enemies, and saw significant military action as armies clashed on its soil. It was also the major focus of Cyrodiilic expansion under the &lt;a href=\"First%20Dynasty\"&gt;First Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, which was constantly pushing the border of Cyrodiil west. In &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt;, the Empress \"officially\" pushed Cyrodiil's border all the way to High Rock, which would have included at least the entirety of the Colovian Highlands. Finally, in &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; invaded Tamriel, the Colovian Estates was fully integrated into the Cyrodiilic Empire under &lt;a href=\"King%20Reman%20I\"&gt;King Reman I&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Second Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiilic rule.\nAlso, as an interesting side note, the Colovian Estates were given to Imperial General &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; to rule, by then-&lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Cuhlecain\"&gt;Emperor Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, marking the start of Talos rise to power. Talos, of course, later became Emperor himself, unified the entire continent, and took the Cyrodiilic name &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Colovian Estates began to overshadow the richer, more populous east then, which eventually led to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; that ended the Alessian Order. Control of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; then returned to a mercantile-based rule by magicians, whom the Colovians despised.

They serve as the rugged frontier between Cyrodiil and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Highlands are the desolate western foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. North-south travel is quite often impossible due to the sheer sides of the Highlands. The foliage and color is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, with evergreen trees, ferns, and yellow-green grasses between islands of gray rock. The Highlands are among the sparser regions in the country, both in terms of vegetation and dungeons. There are at least two small lakes; one has a waterfall and the other a small dock with a canoe.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; is nestled in the lower foothills of the Highlands, though it lies within the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black Road&lt;/a&gt; runs past Chorrol and is the only road that broaches the region. Access to most of the ruins and other points of interest is usually by foot on trails or through the thick grass and shrubs of the region.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Highlands are home to many varieties of &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s. Mushrooms like the &lt;a href=\"Clouded%20Funnel%20Cap\"&gt;Clouded Funnel Cap&lt;/a&gt; grow in abundance and &lt;a href=\"Fly%20Amanita%20Cap\"&gt;Fly Amanita&lt;/a&gt; can be found scattered about. &lt;a href=\"Flax%20Seeds\"&gt;Flax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ginseng%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ginseng&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldenrod\"&gt;Goldenrod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mandrake\"&gt;Mandrake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Motherwort\"&gt;Motherwort&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Viper%27s%20Bugloss\"&gt;Viper's Bugloss&lt;/a&gt; can all be found within these heights.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Animals&lt;/a&gt; found in the region include &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Lion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mountain lions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe Colovian Highlands have had no relevant urban development as of the late &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nPoints of interest.\nThe curious &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Top\"&gt;Cloud Top&lt;/a&gt; outdoor ruin is in the northwest Highlands. It has four pillars in the older &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; style, but a pillar in the center seems to be of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; lineage.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Sanguine\"&gt;Shrine of Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; is just north of the Highland border with the West Weald. Also, there are the ruins of a &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; that has no dungeon, located due west of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Promises%20Cave\"&gt;Broken Promises Cave&lt;/a&gt;.

It also functions as a &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; specialization for both pre-made and custom classes in most games. Classes specializing in \"Combat\" include: &lt;a href=\"Archer\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crusader\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacking.\nThe amount of damage done to an opponent depends on several things:\nPower attacks.\nTo use power attack, one must hold down the attack button. Each &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt; upgrades the Basic Power Attack to a Mastery Power Attack in a specific direction.\nThose proficient in &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt; have the same Novice, Apprentice, and Journeyman attacks, but also have special effects for Expert and Master level:\nBlocking.\nBlocking is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and reduces or neutralizes melee damage from an opponent. Melee attacks can be blocked with shields or, if experienced in Hand-to-Hand, with arms. Like attacks, blocking also provides unique blocking abilities at each rank of experience:\nAlternatively, one may want to learn how to circle an opponent and dodge or step away from them when they attack, to avoid being hit in the first place.\nOther combat situations.\nKnockdown.\nIf Fatigue is depleted during combat, either by being hit with Hand-to-Hand or a Drain Fatigue or Damage Fatigue spell, then the character will be temporarily knocked down. They will get back up again once fatigue recovers.\nEnemies can be knocked down by either destroying their Fatigue or using a Mastery Backwards Power Attack (Expert level required) on the foe, which has a chance of knocking them down.\nDodging.\nA character with Journeyman level &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; skill can do a quick avoidance roll by pressing block and jumping in a direction to quickly roll in that direction. If the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"speed\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt; is high enough, an enemy's power attack can usually be dodged without rolling by simply moving out of the way.\nYielding.\nTo Yield, simply block and press the use button on the attacking character as if to talk to them. Depending on the situation and their disposition, they may accept the yield and stop fighting. The amount of disposition is different for each NPC.\n&lt;a href=\"Creatures\"&gt;Creatures&lt;/a&gt; and permanently-hostile NPCs (like &lt;a href=\"Bandits\"&gt;Bandits&lt;/a&gt;) never yield naturally. However, if a &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; spell (such as Captivate) is used with a 100-point Disposition boost, the Bandit will yield and even discuss rumors. The Bandit will, however, attack as soon as the Spell wears off.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Cheats\"&gt;exploit&lt;/a&gt; has been found with regard to yielding.\nCombat mechanics.\nA common tactic used in combat is to &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; an enemy's strike using a weapon or shield.\nEven a simple block offers an opening to strike, either with &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. A wise strategy is to block as default, and watch for the open-chested weaknesses most creatures have.\nAn experienced blocker using high quality hardware will be more likely to stagger an enemy.\nJudicious use of blocking is the foundation of advanced melee combat.\nIt is easier to perform the specialized power attacks attained at high weapon skill levels by starting the power attack and then selecting a direction, as opposed to moving and then starting the power attack."}

The direction of the mouse also determines your chance to hit an enemy, and your damage.\nAttacking Techniques.\nMelee.\nIn order for the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; to draw their weapon, they must click on the crossed swords icon, their weapon will then rise on the right side of the screen. When the Champion wants to sheathe their weapon again, they will have to click the crossed swords icon again. Swinging the weapon is linked to the right mouse button, if the Eternal Champion moves the mouse while holding down the right mouse button, the weapon will \"mimic\" their mouse movement. The following are possible melee attack moves in Arena:\nDepending on the Eternal Champion's attack, the following melee attack combinations are possible:\nBows.\nCombat with bows is a bit different, the Eternal Champion pulls out their bow by clicking on the crossed swords icon again. However, the Champion does not need arrows in order to fire their bow, instead bows are worn out by continued use and need to be repaired. The Eternal Champion can fire their bow by aiming their cursor at an opponent and then right clicking where they want the arrow to go. Damage and fire rate is dependent on the quality of the bow. A high quality bow can do high damage while shooting rapidly while lower quality bows shoot slower and do less damage.\nMagic.\nThe Eternal Champion can also use spells to fight opponents. Spells can either be offensive spells or defensive spells. In order to cast spells, the Champion must first click on the cast spell icon. After that, the Eternal Champion can then click on the spell they wish to use from the list. If the same spell wants to be cast again, the Champion may right click the spell icon or do Shift + C to save time. Using a magic item works the same way, except they click on the \"Use Magic Item\" icon instead."}
{"id": "1053182", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1053182", "title": "Combat (Blades)", "text": "Combat in has four general aspects: melee combat, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, and character &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat involves a rock paper-scissors mechanic for causing and receiving damage. This involves two different categories of damage: &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Damage\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Physical%20Damage%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, being paired to different creatures with different susceptibility to different kinds of damage. &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; can also be rock paper-scissor paired to damage giving a creature with weaknesses some much needed protection. Causing &lt;a href=\"status%20effects\"&gt;status effects&lt;/a&gt; is also a major part of combat in \"Blades\". While status effects depend on type, and are effected by rock paper scissors, stat damages have no resistances or weaknesses attached. If a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; deals stat damage, only by reducing frequency of damage done, and amount of damage done - by &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;blocking&lt;/a&gt;, for example - can stat damage be reduced. Stat damage also is dealt in higher amounts than elemental damage as well, but they do not do any &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; damage.\nIn \"Blades\", absorbing damage is more done with negation via armor than just by having a high amount of raw health. The &lt;a href=\"Fugitive\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; can regenerate more quickly than most enemies, but not all (like &lt;a href=\"Trolls%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and other blades).\nMany players may find success in the game's combat by combining patterns of moves together, either chaining particular moves or switching between various different items based on the tactical situation. For example, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;'s long casting time and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20Surge\"&gt;Magicka Surge&lt;/a&gt;'s long wait time may make them difficult to justify using on their own, but when combined, they can be a very effective tactic; Magicka Surge allows for Paralyze to be used more frequently and without prevention (except by user's death), hampering the enemy's ability to fight back. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Power%20Strike\"&gt;Power Strike&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively slow, low-damage, but if used to turn a high block into a normal block, then the Fugitive can chain hits, countering the enemy's use of their &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\n\"Combat starts automatically when you and an enemy are close to each other.\"\n\"To attack, first hold on either side of the enemy. A red circle will appear and grow quickly. When it turns gold, release or swipe towards your foe.\"\n\"Release or swipe when the circle is full to strike with a powerful critical hit.\"\n\"After attacking from one direction, you can perform a combo attack by immediately attacking again from the other side of the screen. Combo attacks are faster and deal extra damage.\"\n\"If the circle is gold but you no longer want to strike, you can swipe down to cancel your attack.\"\n\"Swarming enemies like Skeevers and Spiders stay out of reach. You can only hit them with weapon attacks when they charge in to attack.\"\nAttacking.\nTo attack in \"Blades\", you need to hold down on either the right or left side of the screen and attempt to let go when the two circles overlap. Switching sides every attack will give you combo attacks, which massively increase damage output. Alternatively, you can hold down on either side of the screen and attempt to drag your finger to the opposite side when the circles overlap; this will slightly increase attack speed, but makes it more difficult to use abilities, spells, and potions.\nDamages are dealt via melee, abilities, spells, as well as enabled, or boosted or negated by &lt;a href=\"enchantments\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; and potions.\nCountering enemy damage.\nThere are many different ways to handle the enemy in . In the fight, none of them involve running away from the enemy across the map or controlling the characters movements as normal, although avoiding a fight in general is possible at times.\nBlocking, Enchantments- ones that negate or deal damage for example, armor that counters enemies' weapons or spells/ enchantments, and weapons that counter the enemy's armor and resistances.\nMelee.\nMelee in Blades follows a rock paper scissors mechanic for both physical and elemental damage.\nIt also, unlike some titles games, damages the armor and weapons, which need to be repaired.\nBlocking.\nBlocking will reduce damage, High blocking will cause a stagger or &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents enemies from blocking unless they use an ability and thus spend &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;. This is very useful, and plays a pivotal role in positioning an enemy into a pain or death kata.\nAbilities.\nYou can have three active abilities at a time in \"Blades\". To use them, go to the Menu \u2192 Character \u2192 Skills \u2192 Abilities and then choose which abilities you would like to equip. Abilities in combat are outlined in green and require stamina to cast. Stamina regenerates passively and can be boosted using &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;.\nStaggering and stunning the enemy can be achieved through effective use of abilities and high block. It is advised to do this as it can be a drastic benefit.\nSpells.\nYou can have three active spells at a time in \"Blades\". To use them, go to the Menu \u2192 Character \u2192 Skills \u2192 Spells and then choose which spells you would like to equip. Spells in combat are outlined in blue and require &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; to cast. Magicka regenerates passively and can be boosted using armor and jewelry enchantments.\nStunned, &lt;a href=\"Blind\"&gt;Blind&lt;/a&gt;ed, and paralyzed are status effects caused by spells.\nPotions.\nPotions in \"Blades\" can be used during combat and out of combat in missions. They can be accessed in two different ways during combat; either click on the health bar, or go through the menu using Menu \u2192 Character \u2192 Potions. To access potions while out of combat in &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;, you will have to go through the menu option.\nPotions can be used to regenerate health, stamina, and magicka, or to give the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;fugitive&lt;/a&gt; resistances to certain types of damage for a few seconds.\n&lt;a href=\"Poisons%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Poisons&lt;/a&gt; can be used to temporarily poison your &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; for a few seconds; this will reduce enemy resistances for the duration of the potion's effect.\nStatus effects.\nThese are a big part of combat.\nSimilar and different to damage being inflicted, status effects are conditions being inflicted to the enemy. Instead of having their magic, stamina, or health reduced, they are subject to circumstances that are undesirable, be it impairing or disarming, or in some cases, damage resulting. \nThey include: Stunned, Staggered, Blinded, Paralyzed, Poisoned, Frozen, On Fire, and Shocked. \nThe First four are major and temporarily cripple the target in some way.\nThe Last four are minor, except for perhaps blizzard (in terms of effect) and involve a small cloud of the element in question (much smaller than spell elemental clouds) that cause minor damage in their respective element type over a short period of time\nThis can be gotten out of by using an ability."}

{"id": "925484", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=925484", "title": "Combat (Morrowind)", "text": "Combat, aside from the dictionary definition, is a skill category in that involves attacking enemies with &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of three categories that the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; can choose to specialize in during &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;character creation&lt;/a&gt;, the others being stealth and magic. Combat skills are based on weapon classes, such as long blade, short blade, axe, or marksman.\nAttack types.\nThere are three basic attacks that can be performed, each depends on the direction the Nerevarine is moving when you start your attack. (Not necessarily how they are moving when the attack is finished).\nChop.\nThis is the default attack. To chop, all you need to do is start your attack while standing still, or you can run forwards and strafe left or right at the same time. You will raise your weapon and do a downward stroke at your opponent. Most weapons seem to deliver the most damage with this attack. Spears and daggers do not, however, have good chop damage.\nSlash.\nTo perform a slash, start your attack while moving to the left or right. You will swing your weapon sideways right to left instead. This is a good attack to use in close combat, as you will be more likely to dodge your opponent's attacks while moving to the side. Most weapons are good for slashing, the notable exceptions again being spears. A few, mostly long blades, are best used with this attack.\nThrust.\nTo perform a thrust, start your attack while moving forwards or backwards. You will attack straight ahead with your weapon. This attack is good for keeping your distance from opponents, especially since you can start it while moving backwards, and always keep yourself out of range of their attacks. Most weapons do not do as much damage when thrusting, but spears are ideal for it. Most short blades also receive a slight advantage with this attack.\nMarksman.\nIn addition to the three melee attacks, there are also ranged weapons. For these you will either need a bow and arrows, a crossbow and bolts, or a supply of throwing weapons. For bows and crossbows, you must equip both the weapon and the ammunition in order to use them. Bows and crossbows are two-handed weapons, so you cannot hold a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or a light while using them. Throwing weapons are not restricted in this manner.\nWeapons.\nThere are five basic classes of melee weapons, as well as Hand-to-hand combat and Marksmanship.\nAxes.\nAxes can be one-handed or two-handed. They are best as chopping weapons, though fairly effective for slashing as well. They are by far the most damaging of weapons, but they are also quite heavy, and generally slower in attack speed, and with a narrower range of attack than most other weapons.\nBlunt weapons.\nBlunt weapons include clubs, warhammers, staves, and maces, and can be used for a variety of different fighting styles. For damage, warhammers are the best you can get outside of axes, and have the advantage of range as well. Maces and clubs are not nearly as strong as their two-handed cousins, but give you the advantage of faster speed and the ability to use a shield. Staves are mostly useful for their ability to hold powerful enchantments, though they are also faster and have a wider range than any other two-handed weapons. Blunt weapons typically have narrow damage ranges. For example, while a Longsword might have a damage range of 2\u201320, a blunt alternative will have a range of 8\u201312. In this way, \"charge time\" is far less necessary with blunt weapons.\nLong blades.\nLong blades are good versatile weapons, able to chop, slash, and in most cases thrust with almost equal facility. Long blades are also the most numerous weapon class, and there are more\u00a0artifact-class long blades than any other weapon class. They are generally faster in attack speed than axes or blunt weapons, though like axes, they are limited in their range of attack. They come in both one-handed and two-handed varieties. One-handed blades are slightly less damaging and slightly faster, and allow the use of a shield. If you use a two-handed blade you will be unable to block, even if you have a shield equipped in your inventory.\nShort blades.\nShort blades have the lowest base damage of all weapon classes, but they make up for this by having a minimum damage as high as their maximum damage. This makes this weapon able to deal high damage per second because the Nerevarine does not need to charge the weapon. They are all one-handed, and their light weight is perfect for those who want to be able to carry a lot of loot, or just stay fast on their feet. They are mostly equally effective at chopping and slashing, and slightly better for thrusts. Short blades are exceptional for stealth builds.\nSpears.\nSpears are great for those who like a different style of combat, as they are generally best used with thrust attacks, and not very effective for chops and slashes, in contrast with all the other weapon types. They have the widest range available, allowing you to keep your distance. They are all two-handed, so you cannot use a shield, but if you keep far enough away from your opponents, you should not need one. Spears are also generally lighter than most two-handed weapons, with the exception of staves. However, spears lack the variety of options of the other weapon classes, as there are far fewer quality spears available. It is also harder to find training in the skill \u2013 only 2 characters offer spear training, &lt;a href=\"Flaenia%20Amiulusus\"&gt;Flaenia Amiulusus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mertis%20Falandas\"&gt;Mertis Falandas&lt;/a&gt;. Morrowind is the only \"Elder Scrolls\" game to have spears.\nHand-to-hand.\nOne other option for melee combat is to not use weapons at all. This is a much more difficult path to take, as attacks with the fists deal damage to the opponent's\u00a0fatigue\u00a0instead of their\u00a0health. When they become exhausted and fall over, the Nerevarine can start dealing damage to an enemies health. If you manage to get good at hand to hand, it has the advantage that an exhausted opponent is much less likely to hit you with their attacks. A character with a high hand-to-hand skill can render enemies completely defenseless within a few seconds, though it could take hours to train hand-to-hand early-game.\nThis skill is useful in a few quests in the expansions where you are expected to disable an opponent without killing them, so you will want at least a few levels so that you can land a blow to knock out your target if your supply of fatigue-draining magic is insufficient.\nMarksman\u00a0weapons.\nMarksman weapons come in three varieties: bow and arrows, crossbow and bolts, and throwing weapons. Bows, crossbows, and throwing weapons are placed into your main weapon slot, while arrows and bolts get their own ammunition slot (where they will stay even after switching to another weapon). Unenchanted ammunition that hits an enemy will randomly be added to their inventory where it can later be reclaimed, but be warned that enemies might equip it and fire it right back at you (especially if you are using a throwing weapon against an unarmed opponent). The chance of this happening is determined by the game setting\u00a0codice_1\u00a0(25% by default). Ammunition that misses is lost forever.\nIf you throw/fire a ranged weapon directly into an incoming spell, the two projectiles collide in mid-air and cancel each other out. This also works with spells against spells.\nBows.\nThese are the most commonly found marksman weapons. Bows can be found in many places, or you can instantly get yourself the best option weightlessly with the use of a\u00a0Bound Longbow\u00a0spell. Bows cannot be fired underwater. On hit effects are useless on bows because the bow itself never hits anything.\nArrows.\nArrows are required to use a bow, and can only be used with a bow. They are equipped into a separate ammunition slot, though equipping them is done in the same manner as any other item. They can be commonly bought at shops, found as loot, or found in large numbers on &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; corpses. Arrows cannot be enchanted by the Nerevarine, though there are many types of &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchanted arrows&lt;/a&gt; that can be found. Arrows are affected by gravity, but they take a long time to start dropping, so aiming above the target is only necessary on distant targets. The most powerful arrow in the game is the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Arrow%20of%20Slaying\"&gt;Ebony Arrow of Slaying&lt;/a&gt;, and only 5 of them exist.\nCrossbows.\nCrossbows are far less common \u2013 only two varieties are found in the main game (\u00a0adds\u00a0a third). They have a longer reload time between shots than the other marksman weapons, but have the unique advantage of having the same minimum and maximum damage (on crossbows themselves, anyway; bolts still have a small range of damage). This makes them ideal for rapid firing in close quarters, though they can be used for medium-to-long range attacks as well (but be warned that gravity will bring down a bolt that was not fully drawn back sooner, making rapid-fire long-ranged combat less than ideal for crossbows).\nOne disadvantage of crossbows is the relative rarity of their ammunition. You will be mostly dependent on the vendors for your supply, since bolts are rarely found in great supply in the wild. There are, however, vendors that sell an unending supply of bolts.\nThrowing weapons.\nThrowing weapons are another option for ranged attacking and include throwing stars, throwing knives, and darts. Since they do not require a bow to use, you can travel lighter and still hold an item in your other hand. However, they suffer from the same problem as crossbows, in that it can be hard to find a steady supply of quality throwing weapons (indeed, all restocking purchasable throwing weapons are not especially good). For the sake of determining damage, they are treated as both the bow and the arrow, essentially dealing double the damage listed on the weapon itself. For most throwing weapons, this is not enough to overcome the power added by, say, a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Long%20Bow%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric long bow&lt;/a&gt;, but many of the throwing weapons added by the\u00a0\u00a0expansion can hit for hundreds of damage with sufficient strength.\nIt also deserves mentioning that thrown weapons move much more slowly than arrows or bolts, and succumb to gravity sooner. Somewhat comically, the\u00a0Boots of Blinding Speed\u00a0can give the Nerevarine enough speed to outrun a weapon they have just thrown.\nChance to hit.\nCombat in \"Morrowind\" is relatively straightforward. Your chance to hit can be generalized as\u00a0codice_2.\nHit rate.\ncodice_3\u00a0Order of Operations (PEMDAS) applied.\nIn essence, your hit rate is equal to your weapon skill, increased by 1% for every 5 points of Agility or 10 points of luck you have. This is then multiplied by somewhere between .75 and 1.25, depending on how much Fatigue you have left. Having full Fatigue will increase your accuracy by 25%, and being depleted of fatigue will decrease your accuracy by 25%. Finally, your hit chance is increased by a flat amount from fortify attack effects (such as from the\u00a0Warrior birthsign), and because of a glitch, blindness effects.\nEvasion.\ncodice_4\nEvasion works exactly the same as hit rate, only the defender's weapon skill is not used and evasion is increased by Sanctuary instead of Fortify Attack.\nBlocking.\nBlocking is a simple matter of having a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; equipped. Your chance to block is your chance to evade, but with your block skill also included in the equation. You cannot block without a shield, so if you are using a two-handed weapon or want to carry a\u00a0light\u00a0instead, you will not be able to block attacks. Blocking will not protect you from spells.\nDamage.\nDamage dealt can be expressed as\u00a0codice_5.\nWeapon damage.\nGenerally speaking, you can figure out a weapon's damage by looking at the weapon's description. Each attack type for a given weapon will have its own damage range \u2013 unlike some other RPGs, the weapon damage is not chosen randomly from this range, but rather this range is to describe how damage will be if the attack button is pressed quickly or if you let the weapon be pulled back all the way before releasing.\nBows and crossbows have this damage further increased by the projectile they shoot. How this works is fairly simple \u2013 the arrow/bolt's damage is added to the bow/crossbow's. See the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0page for a listing of all projectile strengths.\nThrowing weapons are treated oddly, in that they are considered both weapon and projectile. Simply put, the damage of throwing weapons is double what it says in the item description.\nNote that the damage of any cast on strike\u00a0enchantments\u00a0are not affected by how far the weapon is pulled back \u2013 they do deal damage randomly within the range listed.\nStrength modifier.\ncodice_6\nAt 0 Strength, you deal only 50% of your expected damage. This increases by 1% for each point of Strength you have, up to 150% at 100 strength. If you\u00a0fortify your strength\u00a0to 150, you will deal twice the expected damage.\nCondition modifier.\ncodice_7\nCondition is a simple ratio \u2013 if your weapon has 50% condition left (say, 400/800), you will deal 50% as much damage as you would have with a weapon in perfect condition.\nCritical hit multiplier.\nThis is equal to 1 for regular attacks, 4 for melee critical hits, or 1.5 for ranged critical hits.\nIf you perform an attack without being seen, a message will appear informing the Nerevarine that they have dealt critical damage (this is generally referred to as a 'sneak attack' or 'critical hit'). This is a simple multiplier, but damage dealt by cast on strike enchantments is not multiplied.\nIt is easier to perform multiple sneak attacks on a target if you can somehow remove it from combat between attacks (it performs fewer sneak checks and is less likely to run away). A\u00a0calm\u00a0effect can help nicely with this, though be warned that you can rack up a new bounty for Assault with each attack if a guard is in sight (even if the target originally initiated combat).\nArmor reduction.\ncodice_8. This number cannot be higher than 4 (i.e. damage cannot be reduced to less than 25% of the original amount).\nArmor affects damage in a more complicated way than the other factors, since how much damage a particular armor Rating prevents depends on the amount of incoming damage.\nHere is a quick list of things to remember regarding armor:\nHand-to-hand.\ncodice_10\u00a0Fatigue Damage or\ncodice_11\u00a0Health Damage\nHand-to-hand\u00a0uses its own damage formula, which does not take strength or condition into account. The above formulas describe the damage dealt by a fully-drawn back punch, with health damage being dealt only against targets that have collapsed from a lack of Fatigue or that are paralyzed.\nStagger/knock down.\nOne potential side-effect of damage is staggering or even knocking down opponents. Higher damage (and lower opponent Agility) will increase the chance of these effects, which means that slower, harder-hitting two-handed weapons are generally more likely to keep an opponent off its toes. Note that hand-to-hand attacks have an unusually high stagger rate and will knock an opponent down automatically once they run out of fatigue.\nArmor.\nArmor is used to reduce damage from physical attacks. The strength of armor is known as Armor Rating, or AR. The AR for each piece of armor is\u00a0codice_12. The AR for each unarmored slot, including shield, is codice_13. Equipment slots filled with clothing (anything without a listed Armor Rating) are treated as Unarmored.\nTotal AR is\u00a0codice_14. In other words, your cuirass makes up 30% of your total armor rating, while your shield, helm, greaves, boots, and individual pauldrons make up 10% each and each gauntlet/bracer accounts for 5% each.\nIf going completely unarmored, you need to know about the\u00a0unarmored bug.\nUseful spells.\nOther than the obvious attack spells, there are several tactical spell effects which can be very helpful in combat.\nDeath.\nWhen you die, you are presented with a screen with all of your saves, and must select one to load."}
{"id": "17495", "revid": "25356303", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17495", "title": "Combat (Oblivion)", "text": "Combat involves harming an object or &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;. There are two types of attacks: melee attacks, involving use of a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;to-hand combat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; attacks, especially those of the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spell line. All attacks will always hit (assuming one actually hits the target physically); there is no \"dice roll\" that determines if one hits their opponent, as in other &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt;s and . However, the amount of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; one does depends on their &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; level in the weapon or spell they are inflicting the damage with, and the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; or resistance of their opponent.\nAttack speed.\nMelee attacks.\nDifferent weapons have different attack speeds, and thus affect how much damage one does over a certain amount of time. The base attack speed is 1.0, which is the attack speed of standard &lt;a href=\"Longswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;longswords&lt;/a&gt;. Weapons with an attack speed of less than 1.0 are slower, and those with an attack speed of greater than 1.0 are faster. Generally, the smaller a weapon is, the faster attack speed it'll have (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Axes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;War Axe&lt;/a&gt;). Hand-to-Hand is extremely fast, but this can be deceptive as breaking the rhythm of the attack (such as being blocked) can result in noticeable pauses between flurries, sort of a minor stagger. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; attacks made with a one handed weapon deal 6x &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; damage. The type of melee weapon used is not taken into account when calculating critical damage (in other words, it doesn't matter whether it is blade or blunt). However, two-handed weapons do not have a critical damage multiplier.\nThese are the attack speeds from slowest to fastest:\nBow attacks.\nThere is only one sort of bow, there are not, as in other games, short and longbows, or crossbows. Bows are, though, made of different materials, so their attack isn't always the same. Bows all have the same base attack speed, which is very slow, about 0.5. Bows, however, do deal ranged damage, so the lack of attack speed is made up for by the amount of time they have while their melee-attacking enemy is closing in on them. Damage dealt by bows works slightly different than with melee weapons (outside of the bow being used as a melee weapon). Instead of just using the attack damage of the bow, the damage inflicted is the sum of bow and arrow damage. Bows deal x2 critical damage when one attacks while sneaking, or x3 with the appropriate perk.\nMagical attacks.\nMagical attacks are mainly of three different categories:\nOf these three categories, there are four subcategories:\nAll combat-oriented spells are usually of the Destruction school of magic; healing spells are obviously from the &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; school. Charm spells are &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;-oriented. There is no critical damage multiplier for casting spells while sneaking."}
{"id": "230329", "revid": "25356303", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=230329", "title": "Combat (Online)", "text": "Combat in comes in two separate types, Player vs Environment and Player vs Player, however, both are designed to work in similar ways. Player vs Player combat is available after reaching &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 10.\nLight &amp; Heavy Attacks.\nLight Attacks are basic attacks performed with one's weapon. They can be weaved together with abilities if one's timing is correct, which can increase damage per second by a fair amount (about 20%).\nUnlike in other games, Heavy Attacks are primarily used to restore &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;. They will also knock down an enemy that is &lt;a href=\"Off%20Balance\"&gt;Off Balance&lt;/a&gt;. Restoration and Lightning staves will start dealing damage immediately, and therefore may be detrimental if in &lt;a href=\"Stealth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Medium\" attacks can be performed by releasing a heavy attack before it is fully charged. However, doing so does not provide any advantages.\n&lt;a href=\"Physical%20Weapon%20Expert\"&gt;Physical Weapon Expert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Expert\"&gt;Staff Expert&lt;/a&gt; will increase the damage of both attacks. &lt;a href=\"Retaliation\"&gt;Retaliation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Butcher\"&gt;Butcher&lt;/a&gt; provide increases in certain instances. &lt;a href=\"Tenacity\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt; increases the resources heavy attacks restore, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowstrike\"&gt;Shadowstrike&lt;/a&gt; gives stealth after killing an enemy with a heavy attack. &lt;a href=\"Siphoner\"&gt;Siphoner&lt;/a&gt; will reduce opposing players' recovery when attacking, and &lt;a href=\"Expert%20Defender\"&gt;Expert Defender&lt;/a&gt; will reduce damage from those attacks.\nBreak Free.\nBreak Free allows the player to remove some crowd control effects from themselves, like &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;. They are also immune to those effects for 7 seconds after breaking free, indicated by white swirls around their feet.\nAs breaking free costs Stamina, it is sometimes necessary to conserve stamina to be ready to avoid stuns and hit with subsequent heavy damage (ie &lt;a href=\"Hedge%20Maze%20Guardian\"&gt;Hedge Maze Guardian&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Hunter%20Keep\"&gt;Moon Hunter Keep&lt;/a&gt;). This is especially true for magicka-based players, who tend to have low &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Online%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and resistances as well as low Max Stamina.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlord%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Warlord&lt;/a&gt; reduces the cost of Break Free. Some sets like &lt;a href=\"Indomitable%20Fury\"&gt;Indomitable Fury&lt;/a&gt; provide benefits when breaking free.\nInterrupt.\nInterrupt allows the player to disrupt and cancel an enemy's attack. Generally, attacks that are interruptible have a cast time, and are indicated by red lines moving towards the enemy. The easiest way to do this is to bash with one's weapon or shield, which costs stamina. The abilities &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Breath\"&gt;Deep Breath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Focused%20Charge\"&gt;Focused Charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Shock\"&gt;Crushing Shock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Venom%20Arrow\"&gt;Venom Arrow&lt;/a&gt; will also interrupt enemies. Most crowd control effects will interrupt normal enemies (ie not bosses) as well. &lt;a href=\"Opportunist%20%28Champion%29\"&gt;Opportunist&lt;/a&gt; will increase one's physical attack damage after interrupting.\nUltimate Abilities.\nUltimate Abilities are very powerful attacks that can be unlocked by successfully filling up the Finesse bar. These attacks level up the more that they are used, like other skills. Ultimate Abilities are one of the six skills in the hotbar that can be used by players.\u00a0 Ultimate Abilities are class based, meaning that different classes will be able to unlock different abilities. \nDamage.\nThere are several different types of damage in \"Online\":"}
{"id": "149603", "revid": "3256079", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=149603", "title": "Combat (Skyrim)", "text": "Combat in is fighting with &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, or one's own fists.\nArmed.\nThe player is able to acquire a variety of &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; by buying from shops in towns, won through quests, collected from dead opponents, or made in forges. As with fists, weapons can be used with the attack button (PC: LMB) and holding the button before releasing will result in a power attack which deals more damage to an opponent. Single handed weapons deal less damage per strike but are faster and the other hand (left) can be used for a shield or other weapon. Weapons also have varying weight depending on the size and material, so may cause the player to become overburdened.\nEnemies and companions' health bar shows at the top of the screen with a red line which shrinks when they are successfully attacked (damage to health). Enemies may go into a crouch when health is almost depleted or (human) may beg for mercy, though they regenerate health when left and will attack you further unless mods are used.\nA variety of enchantments can be applied to weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, and explosion (&lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt;) or ones that absorb an opponent's health or stamina.\nAlternating between attacking and using your shield to absorb an enemy's blows reduces damage to the player, the amount depending on their blocking skill.\nA ranged weapon such as a bow (with arrows), crossbow, or magic staff (such as of ice spikes) can be used to attack enemies from a distance. This is especially effective where the enemy has a powerful melee attack and the player must stay out of range. Holding the attack button when using the bow causes it to be drawn back further meaning distance enemies can be attacked. Ranged weapons can only be used if the player has appropriate ammunition (such as arrows, bolts) in their inventory. Staffs consume power upon use and will need to be recharged using filled soul gems. Larger soul gems will power the weapon for longer. However, unlike unarmed spells the staffs do not consume the player's magic so can be used repeatedly. Some staffs require the player to hold then release the attack button to charge them up first.\nIf sneaking and not seen (eye closed), attacks have an added damage bonus and can be fatal in one shot on occasion. It is possible in some cases to stealth kill enemies without others becoming aware, or if they are alone.\nPressing R (PC) causes the player to bring out or put away their selected weapons. Alternatively, hold the attack button. Pressing R when a bow is drawn or spell is charged causes the attack to be cancelled. When weapons are out, walking and running are slower. It is possible to use weapons when riding a horse.\nBoth armed and unarmed attacks consume stamina which may cause the player character to pant (indicates low stamina). This can be regenerated by waiting or using stamina potions. Power attacks consume more stamina than regular attacks and certain weapons have a special attack that consumes a large amount of stamina.\nA housecarl or companion (unless passive) will automatically attack enemies with weapons and magic they have unless told to wait elsewhere, horses will also attack enemies.\nDefense.\nShields can be used to absorb some of melee or ranged (arrow, bolts) attacks depending on shield rating and blocking skill level. However, these are ineffective against magic attacks. Wards can be used to protect the player from destruction magic. Alternative methods to dodge attacks can be hiding/dodging behind obstacles or moving out of range of the attack making targeting harder. Attacking an enemy from behind when they are attacking a companion is also effective and certain shouts (ice form) and powers will temporarily paralyze the opponent.\nPerks.\nUnarmed.\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;other games&lt;/a&gt; in the series, where &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt; combat was a &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0\"Skyrim\"\u00a0lacks a skill tree, though there are\u00a0perks for\u00a0unarmed combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Steel\"&gt;Fists of Steel&lt;/a&gt;.\nA perk from the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; perk tree which requires a Heavy Armor skill of 30 and at least one rank of &lt;a href=\"Juggernaut%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt;. It adds the base armor rating of worn heavy gauntlets to unarmed damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20Talons\"&gt;Poison Talons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis perk from the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; skill-tree adds 20 points of poison damage towards unarmed combat, while in Vampire Lord form.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough it does not directly affect unarmed attacks, &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage (Perk)&lt;/a&gt; can be useful for improving unarmed damage. If The Dragonborn is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; and the Necromage perk is active, the bonus from Fists of Steel will be improved as will any Fortify Unarmed enchantments on equipment equipped after the perk is active.\nUnarmed combat does not improve from One-handed perks like Armsman and Dual Flurry.\nItems.\nUnarmed.\n\"Skyrim\" offers only one enchantment that benefits Unarmed combat,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Unarmed\"&gt;Fortify Unarmed&lt;/a&gt;. It is only available on one item, and benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; perk\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Insightful%20Enchanter\"&gt;Insightful Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gloves%20of%20the%20Pugilist%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Gloves of the Pugilist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gloves of the Pugilist are a named pair of &lt;a href=\"Fur%20Gauntlets%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fur Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in \"Skyrim\". They can only be looted off of &lt;a href=\"Gian%20the%20Fist\"&gt;Gian the Fist&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway%20Vaults\"&gt;Ratway&lt;/a&gt;, and are disenchantable. This is the only item that provides the\u00a0Fortify Unarmed\u00a0enchantment.\n&lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Ring of the Beast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ring of the Beast adds 20 claw damage for vampires. This effect is not the same as Fortify Unarmed\u00a0and\u00a0may show up as Khajiit Claws, but stacks with the natural bonus of both\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0claws. It is found during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rings%20of%20Blood%20Magic\"&gt;Rings of Blood Magic&lt;/a&gt;,\"\u00a0as part of the vampire branch of the\u00a0\u00a0story quest.\u00a0Being a quest-related unique item, it cannot be disenchanted.\nCombat.\nUnarmed.\nAny character made in\u00a0\"Skyrim\" has access to\u00a0unarmed combat. Having no skill tree, the only difference from character to character is damage dealt. Men and Mer have a base damage of 4, while racial abilities give &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; characters 12 additional damage and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; characters 10 additional damage in unarmed combat. This does not include the 6 additional damage they hold in the code, giving Argonians a base damage of 20 and Khajiit a base of 22. Khajiit\u00a0and\u00a0Argonian\u00a0become the races of choice given their damage bonus, which far exceeds the potential DPS (Damage-Per-Second) of most starting weapons. All characters also have access to the majority of power attacks and &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Camera\"&gt;finishing moves&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0with only a few being unique or restricted.\nWhatever race is chosen, there are three basic styles for\u00a0unarmed combat:\nMany players will find it advantageous to float between the three styles depending on situation, as the lack of a primary weapon leaves several perks available to distribute. Those same available perks result in\u00a0unarmed combat\u00a0sometimes being a melee option for\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0builds as well as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bows&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0being a secondary/ranged weapon to\u00a0unarmed combat.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneaking&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0has its own unarmed &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Camera\"&gt;critical kill&lt;/a&gt;, as a successful sneak attack from behind will yield a choke-out/neck snap animation if damage is sufficient to kill the target."}

She does not seem to trust in herself. She needs the Archive, she says, to cast her greatest &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; yet\u2014to seal herself into the upper floors. She says it is for the protection of mortals, of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as a whole. I know not what she means. Where she goes she brings magic; she brings beauty. Danger is only a side-effect.\nThe Learned One says that, were the Firstmages to follow her in casting her spell, there are not many of us who would survive. But unlike &lt;a href=\"Firstmage%20Earil\"&gt;Earil&lt;/a&gt; and his cowardly friends, most of us would cherish death at her hands. Anything to push the boundaries of her magic.\nI have spoken to her at length about her plans, and my mind shivers at the possibilities. What could she seek to do? Guard the upper floors with her magical armory? I have seen her tinker with conjured weapons\u2014clearly she has needed her magic to do battle before. Does she seek to mask the upper floors with a conjured shield? Incredibly costly and inefficient, but it would work.\nOr could she\u2014and I do not write this lightly\u2014seek to hide herself behind a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;broken dragon&lt;/a&gt;?

It would explain the magic she has been working.\nOr I am overthinking the issue. Though she is the most powerful sorcerer I have ever encountered, she has exhibited directness that, like her magic, I cannot replicate. Whatever she has planned, it will be a feat of magic, and it will move us, I am sure."}

Alternatively, siding with the Dark Brotherhood allows the Dragonborn to assassinate Maro for an added bonus, during the assassination of the Emperor.\n&lt;a href=\"Breaching%20Security\"&gt;Breaching Security&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s cousin, &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to Skyrim becomes almost apparent. As the Emperor's visit approaches, Maro assigns his son, Gaius Maro, to verify the security of the major Holds. However, Gaius meets his demise at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"To%20Kill%20an%20Empire\"&gt;To Kill an Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the beginning of the quest, Maro can be found\u00a0outside of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0awaiting the false\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;Gourmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Commander Maro intercepts the Listener after he or she successfully assassinates a decoy of the Emperor, after the Listener is betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;. Maro promised to spare Astrid and the Brotherhood if she gave up the Listener, but consumed by hatred for the Brotherhood for killing his son, Maro goes back on his word, ordering his Penitus Oculatus agents to kill the Listener and leading the Penitus Oculatus to destroy the Falkreath Sanctuary, seeking to kill everyone in the Dark Brotherhood.

If the Dragonborn chooses to spare him, if he spots the Dragonborn when they are near him he will say, \"You again!\" If they interact with him, he will exclaim in utter disbelief at their survival and immediately attack them to finish the job. Once aboard the ship, when the Dragonborn enters the Emperor's room, Titus will state, \"Well, once again I have proven Commander Maro the fool,\" presumably because Maro informed the Emperor that the Dark Brotherhood was destroyed.\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Breaching%20Security\"&gt;Breaching Security&lt;/a&gt;.\nGaius: \"Father, you worry too much.

It was poor quality road and was covered in reeds that always grew back onto the road despite numerous efforts to get rid of them including using fire and horses. It was used by merchants to ferry passengers and trade goods between the town of &lt;a href=\"Slough%20Point\"&gt;Slough Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hixinoag\"&gt;Hixinoag&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the city of &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; to the south.

The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; proscribes the use of wood to kindle forge-fires, though in some areas the burning of peat or coal can get kilns up to metal-forging temperatures. Other Bosmer make do with bone clubs, or use axes and spears with blades of stone or obsidian.\nIn the coastal towns such as &lt;a href=\"Haven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Velyn\"&gt;Port Velyn&lt;/a&gt;, Bosmer swordmanship has benefited from the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; advisors and a reliable supply of imported metal weapons. Strangely, the High Elves are not similarly appreciative of the Bosmeri composite horn bows, which are arguably the finest in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile some have described the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; as an alliance of mutual convenience, I would characterize it as one of mutual exasperation. Swordsmanship is a case in point. Few Wood Elves have the mental discipline for traditional Altmeri martial schooling. They are easily distracted, and have no patience for the philosophical aspects of the training. Altmeri masters, who describe their system of swordsmanship as \"&lt;a href=\"Proper%20Conflict\"&gt;Proper Conflict&lt;/a&gt;,\" refused to adapt their techniques to the smaller stature and shorter reach to their pupils.\nSo the Bosmer returned to their traditional method of warfare: &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt; . By the age of fourteen, a Wood Elf youth is proficient enough with the bow to accompany hunting parties. Long-distance archers are called &lt;a href=\"Jaqspur\"&gt;Jaqspur&lt;/a&gt;s. The style of draw used by Jaqspurs has been described as \"snatching and releasing in one continuous motion.\" This allows Jaqspur to maintain a very high rate of shooting, though years of training are required to be accurate at such speed.\nThe Bosmer are perfectly willing to purchase and use wooden bows and arrows crafted by other races, but the Green Pact prevents them from making any of their own. Traditional Bosmer bows are crafted from horn and sinew. Strings are also made of sinew; &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; gut is said to work best, and is thus prized among Valenwood archers.\nBosmeri arrows are carved from bone, and fletched with the feathers of various bird species. The Wood Elves believe the source of bone used influences the characteristics of the arrow. &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; bone arrows are thought to strike with enough force to known down a target. Bird bone arrows fly faster and more accurately. &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senche-tiger&lt;/a&gt; bone arrows deal extra damage. Trials by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; observers have been unable to replicate these alleged effects. Upon hearing this, the Bosmer merely cluck their tongues and smile."}

They can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Collections\"&gt;Collections&lt;/a&gt; tab and can only be acquired by completing certain quests.\nCompanions.\nThere are currently six available companions:\nAcquisition.\nIn order for companions to be unlocked, two quests must be completed to unlock both characters respectively. Companions are not account-wide and cannot be used by another character until the quests to unlock either companion have been completed, despite showing as unlocked within the collections tab.\nCombat.\nCompanions will either initiate combat when in the vicinity of a hostile or will join an on-going combat prompted by the player. Companions can be called back from any interaction or made to engage with specific targets. Using a heavy attack on an enemy will force a companion to focus on that target instead, similar to &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;summonable pets&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nIt is possible for a companion to die during battle, a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Online%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; can be used to revive them. If a companion is still dead by the time a battle is finished they will automatically revive.\nSkills.\nBoth companions have their own set of skills and ultimate abilities, these will be used during battle. Companion ultimate abilities must be triggered by the player and actively selected within the skill bar. Unlocking and upgrading skills requires XP, after fights and battles companions will gain a certain amount of experience alongside the player. The larger the enemy, the more XP gained. All companions are Level 1 when first unlocked and can level up to a maximum level of 20. Companion ultimate abilities unlock at this level.\nEquipment.\nCompanion equipment is bound to whichever companion they are given to and are limited to companion use only, meaning they cannot be used by players. Companion equipment can be dropped by bosses, found as loot or looted in chests, a companions presence during these activities will increase the chance of equipment drops and even more so with certain skills enabled. Companion equipment cannot be researched, deconstructed, crafted or improved. \nGear Traits.\nCompanion equipment carries unique gear traits which differ from equipment used by the player:\nRapport.\nAs well as upgrading a companions skill, their rapport with the player can increase or decrease over time. Different levels of rapport produce different outcomes and make a difference to the companion dialogue and quest related options available to the player.\nIncreasing Rapport.\nBy carrying out certain activities that the companion likes or is interested in, the rapport between the companion and player will increase. Doing so will unlock further dialogue options and questlines revolving around the companion. Completing these will further increase rapport. Companions will inform the player of what they like doing which will aid in increasing these levels.\nDecreasing Rapport.\nCarrying out activities which a companion disapproves of will decrease the rapport and make the companion favor the player less. Decreasing rapport will result in less dialogue options and at low levels may prompt companions to unsummon themselves and remain locked for a period of time.\nRestrictions.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Assistant\"&gt;assistants&lt;/a&gt;, there are areas in which companions are unable to be summoned or will be unsummoned if certain requirements are met."}

Upon reporting to Galmar, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is offered a covert mission of subterfuge and blackmail in Markarth as a means to gain leverage in The Reach. Rumor has it that Raerek, &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Igmund\"&gt;Jarl Igmund&lt;/a&gt;'s uncle and &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt;, is a faithful &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worshiper but not at all a true Son of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. If a way can be found to confront him with his belief, he may be persuaded to aid the cause.\nFinding evidence.\nThe seat of power in Markarth is &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, hewn into the rock to the city's southwest. Raerek's quarters are located in the northwestern wing of the keep and secured by an adept lock. Guards frequently patrol the halls at all hours, however Raerek will be attending to the Jarl throughout most of the day. Sneaking into the room and searching the dresser will reveal &lt;a href=\"Raerek%27s%20Inscribed%20Amulet%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Raerek's Inscribed Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccosting him regarding his resistance to The Cause will garner his feelings that Ulfric is a dangerous man and that he is no friend of the Markarth to which Raerek is so unyieldingly loyal. However, threatened with the prospect of having his faith in Talos made public, Raerek bends his knee to demand as otherwise the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; would imprison him and forever besmirch the Jarl's family name. Reluctantly, Raerek tells of a large, heavily guarded wagon filled with silver and weapons headed to &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to aquire a leveled amount of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; out of Raerek by choosing the persuasion option, which does not require a high level in &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;.\nBack at the Reach Stormcloak Camp, Galmar is pleased to hear of such a lucrative target and indicates that he has a scouting party already out in the field near the area the wagon should be located.\u00a0\nSecuring the wagon.\nA small scouting party led by &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; can be located by heading east up the road and past &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Tower%20Redoubt\"&gt;Broken Tower Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. Ralof indicates that they have actually been tracking the wagon for some time and that it has recently had an \"accident\" which has stopped the wagon in its tracks and will allow for an ambush.\nThe Dragonborn has the choice to stick to Ralof's plan or take on the operation in their own fashion. If one chooses to stick to the plan, then the Dragonborn will go in and distract the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; while Ralof and his men follow the road to the southeast so that the Stormcloaks take down the enemy scout. After neutralizing the scout, Ralof and his men will head to the top of the ridge to act as fire support, raining arrows down upon the Imperial guards and leaving them easy pickings for an assault if the Dragonborn chooses to engage them directly.\nConclusion.\nOnce all the Imperials have been killed, Ralof will indicate that Galmar should be notified of the success and that a new wagon should be sent for the loot. Opening the chest in the back of the wagon will net a dozen or so &lt;a href=\"silver%20ingot\"&gt;silver ingot&lt;/a&gt;s as well as other miscellaneous items and swords. After returning to the camp with the good news, Galmar will provide coin for a job well done and new orders. &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;The Battle for Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt; is brewing and needs fresh support to commence."}

Fortunately, the Beldam knows where the ingredients, which she specifies, can be obtained from: All deep within the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region's&lt;/a&gt; dungeons.\nA Myth, a Mineral and an Organ(ic).\nThe Agent may obtain the ingredients in any order, but must get all three before the time limit expires. The Beldam will give the player the names of three dungeons for them to find each ingredient in, each of which will hold one of the required ingredients, found lying somewhere within. However, the Agent will face a different set of challenges separating them from their goal.\nThe Undead Horde.\nThe dungeon containing the mythical ingredient into which the Agent must delve will feature a high number of &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mummy%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;mummies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Warrior%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;skeletal warriors&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the usual distribution of dungeon based demons. These will continue to spawn until the Agent finds the ingredient and escapes, and will spawn in groups of five. Regardless, the Agent must grab the ingredient and escape the dungeon as quickly as possible.\nA Beastly Burden.\nThe dungeon that holds the mineral that the Beldam requires contain an increased number of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;mythical beasts&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"wereboar\"&gt;wereboar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Daggerfall%20Creature%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt;. These will, like the undead, spawn in groups of five or more alongside the usual dungeon occupants, all with the intention of slaying the Agent. Regardless, the Agent simply has to find the ingredient, take it and make their escape as swiftly as the can.\nOrganic Observations.\nIn contrast to the other two dungeons, the lair holding the organic ingredient will feature no specific creatures, barring those that usually lurk within the dungeon. The Agent therefore simply has to locate the ingredient and obtain it prior to making their escape.\nThe Weather Witches.\nOnce all three ingredients have been obtained, the Agent must return to the Beldam before the time limit expires to complete the quest. Upon speaking with the Beldam, she will greet the Agent thus:\n\"Quick sister, take this [Agent's race]'s load. Mince the [mythic ingredient], peel the [mineral], and grind the [organic ingredient] to bits. Here we have three glittering baubles we have no use for. Take them, [Agent's name], as our way of thanking thee.\"\"\nWith that, the quest is complete, although there will be no effect on the weather.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive three different minerals from the Beldam for completing the quest successfully: one &lt;a href=\"Jade%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;jade&lt;/a&gt;; one &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;malachite&lt;/a&gt;; and one &lt;a href=\"Turquoise%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;turquoise&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be a boost to their reputation by 5 points within that specific Coven.\nConversely, failing the quest will see the Agent lose 2 reputation points with the Coven."}

It is an unmarked quest given by &lt;a href=\"Angi\"&gt;Angi&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Angi%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Angi's Camp&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must complete a series of archery tests by Angi.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter talking with Angi she will offer to train the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; skill for free. The training takes place on a shooting range near her house.\nAngi will give the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"practice%20arrow\"&gt;practice arrow&lt;/a&gt;s to use on the targets, but some more can be found by her shack. The rules for training are:\nThe training consists of four rounds. Completing all four rounds grants a total of six skill points in Archery. Also, after completing the fourth round, talk with Angi and she will reward you with her bow, &lt;a href=\"Angi%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Angi's Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst round: Composure.\nThe first round is based on composure. It requires shooting the nearest three targets without any time limit. Angi will give a demonstration while giving some insight on her background. There are three targets and every target hit grants 1 skill point in Archery.\n\"My father was rarely home, so it was my mother who actually taught me how to use a bow. She always said composure was the key to a successful archer. If you can remain calm, even in the midst of chaos, your arrow will most likely find its target.\"\nSecond round: Speed.\nOnce the first round has been completed, talk to Angi to begin the second round.\nThis round is based on speed. It requires shooting the same three targets of the first round, but in 8 seconds. Angi will again give a demonstration while recounting some of her life. She will signal then the start of the round after a countdown. Completing this round grants another skill point in Archery.\n\"\"My older brother took me out hunting a lot when I was little. At the time, it was difficult to keep food on the table, let alone have enough left over to sell at the market. So whenever we came across more than one deer in a single location, it was imperative we kill as many as we could.\"\"If you can learn to keep your composure and trust that each shot is true, then you should be able to quickly handle multiple targets.\"\"\nThird round: Precision.\nThis round is based on precision. It requires hitting the furthest target at the back of the range with no time limit. Angi will perform the shot first.\nIt may be difficult to see the target due to the surrounding foliage. If in doubt feel free to walk over to the target at any time during the round. It may be helpful to use the &lt;a href=\"Magelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magelight&lt;/a&gt; spell to mark the target, so it can be seen better. Completing this round grants another skill point in Archery.\n\"\"We've talked about speed and composure. Now we'll go over precision. Often times you won't be able to get as close to your prey as you'd like and you'll have to settle with a long shot. However, with such a long shot, it's more than likely that's the only shot you'll be able to take before your prey runs off.\"\"OK, your turn. Try and hit that target way in the back, far behind the other three. Remember to take your time and make your shot count.\"\"\nFourth round.\nThis round is based on all of the three previous skills: composure, speed and precision. It requires hitting all the 4 targets in 10 seconds. Again, Angi will show how it is done while giving some final words of advice. The &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; shout can be useful here by giving you more time to aim, though using the shout for the first three will take up the shout's duration so it is more advantageous to use it for the more challenging fourth target. Also, having &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Eye%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eagle Eye&lt;/a&gt; can be useful.\nCompleting this round grants another skill point in Archery. In addition, speak with Angi after and she will reward you with &lt;a href=\"Angi%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Angi's Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"We've talked about composure, speed, and precision. Now it's time to use all three at once. I'm warning you now, this challenge will be quite difficult. It may take you a couple of tries, but that's what practice is all about.\"\"Just remember everything I've taught you and you should be able to complete it.\""}

While you are in this building, make sure to pick up the copy of from the eastern upstairs room. Speaking with the Thane will reveal that her housecarl was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;. She asks you to help her advisor &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Borodin\"&gt;Borodin&lt;/a&gt; in the inn and her court mage &lt;a href=\"Golun%20Drenduf\"&gt;Golun Drenduf&lt;/a&gt; in the local mages guild. \nBorodrin will have learned nothing useful in the tavern; in fact it appears he id publicly defiant of the thane.

Upon telling her what you know, she will ask you to investigate &lt;a href=\"Betar%20Nes%27%20House\"&gt;Betar Nes' House&lt;/a&gt; for clues. Head there and examine the clues. The relevant bit of information comes from a contract found behind on the ground behind the counter. It tasks Betar-Nes with killing the thane if she will not comply with the worm cult. Upon reading it, you will be attacked by a worm cult assasin. Kill him and return to the Thane's Hall.\nWorm Cult Assasin: \"You ask too many questions.\"\nAt the entrance of the hall, you will encounter Aera, who will tell you that Golun has been murdered in the library. Head there and investigate the body. You will find a glowing orb on his body. Using it will cause a projection of Golun's memories to appear. Speak with it, and it will tell you that the worm cult are using the spirits of the companions to empower Sinmur in the crypts beneath Nimalten. The entrance is in the fireplace by Golun's body. \nEnter the crypts and you will immediately be ambushed by Borodin, who will take you to a deeper part of the dungeon. Proceed through the dungeon in order to kill Borodin. Along the way, Borodin will tell you that the Thane's life is in danger if she does not comply with the cult's demands. After you have killed him, head back out of the crypts and look for the thane. You will find a bunch of dead bodies on the floor of the hall, indicating a battle has taken place. The thane will be upstairs; speak to her and she will reveal that Aera was leading the cultists in the attack. \nThane's Housecarl: \"I saw her head toward the water.\"\nHead outside and speak with the wounded housecarl about Aera's whereabouts. He will tell you she headed to the water. Follow her there. There is a wounded guard there who says she went into the crypt. Confront her there, and she will tell you how the cult came to her while she was grieving and promised her she could see her dead husband and son again. She promises that she is done with the cult after this. You now have the choice to either arrest her, exile her or kill her. \nThane's Housecarl: \"She went into the crypt \u2026.\"\nIf you kill her, \nIf you exile her, \nIf you arrest, she will flee into the next room and you will be forced to kill her there.

There is no magical incantation which frees you from the thrill of skooma running through your blood.\nBut it is through the understanding of that thrill, and the acceptance of the lust within oneself for that thrill, and the casting aside of the shame that the thrillseeker feels when he cannot set aside what becomes in the end his only comfort and pleasure, it is through this knowledge and understanding that the victim comes to the place where choices may be made, where despair and hope may be separated.\nIn short, only knowledge and acceptance can deliver into the slave's hands the key that opens his shackles and sets him free.\n\"The narrative of &lt;a href=\"Tilse%20Sendas\"&gt;Tilse Sendas&lt;/a&gt;' tale carries the reader through the stages of early infatuation, ecstatic obsession, and profound degradation of her addiction, and in the course of the story she subtly enables the reader to discover that the hopelessness of the addict comes from the addict's own unconscious assumption that only a helpless and foolish person could become addicted to skooma, and that, consequently, no such helpless and foolish person could ever achieve the admittedly difficult task of renouncing, once tasted, the exquisite delights of the skooma. Tilse Sendas shows that once the addict overcomes the burden of her own self-despising, that there is the possibility of redemption. And, against all of society's dearly held beliefs, she says that it is not altogether clear that the addict SHOULD renounce the sugar, but that it is only one of the choices that the skooma addict must make. Tilse Sendas' casual proposition that skooma addiction is not necessarily a sign of moral and personal weakness is essential to her thesis that a cure is possible, but it has not endeared her or her book to the upright and conservative elements of Dunmer society.\""}

I'd rather keep my name out of this, if it's all the same to you. I'm - well, let's call me Rohg. I was a decent &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;. I listened to my clan chief. I tried to live by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Grudge\"&gt;Grudge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Promise\"&gt;Broken Promise&lt;/a&gt;. And then I had a revalation. I heard the word of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; and my life was completely changed.\nSo what happened? I was on my way to visit the city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, taking a barrel of my clan's famous tree-stump ale to trade, when I was bodily assulted by a gang of Vosh Rakh recruiters. Praise Trinimac's name! They wrestled me to the ground, pulled a sack over my head, and took me to some secret location. I don't mind admitting I was scared for my life!\nAfter what seemed like hours, one of the Vosh Rakh elders removed my hood. She said that she was going to show me the error of my old-fashioned thinking. That she was going to open my mind and make me more receptible to Trinimac's holy message. I won't go into too many details, but I will say that her methods included frequent beatings, endless repetition of key phrases, threats against my family, and a judicious amount of vile-tasting beverage that she explained would help me better understand the words of Trinimac.\nWhen I finally relented and declared my devotion to Trinimac and the Vosh Rakhm, the process only continued for another hour before the elder was convinced of my sincerety. Then I was given my mask and robes and welcomed into the fellowship of the Vosh Rakh. Praise Trinimac!\nNow? Now I'm a loyal member of the fellowship, one of Trinimac's sharp blades. I fight for the Vosh Rakh. I will die for the Vosh Rakh, if they ask me to. But here's a little secret - I don't want to be a Vosh Rakh! As far as I can tell, most of the recent converts don't want to be a part of the group. We just can't help ourselves. The recruitment drive is that good."}

Now, don't get me wrong. I ain't saying this out of pride, but I ain't ashamed of my occupation neither. Thieves got a perfect right to exist in the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. People say we're dishonest. Of course, those people are usually either &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; or priests, which really slays me. Sort of the snake calling the worm legless.\nRulers like us. Crime in moderation is good for the economy. The trick is to keep it at a good even pace, with a well timed lull and a minor wave to keep the fat bottoms from becoming complacent. Of course, stupid, but talented thieves will keep stealing, empty their pockets, and steal some more. This ain't good for no one. That's where the guilds come in.\nA &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;thieves guild&lt;/a&gt; is what they call a crime regulator. We protect each other and punish the clumsy and greedy. The kings depend on us to keep the amateurs out of business.\nYeah, occasionally, a king will come down on us. I've even seen my &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Thieves Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt; get himself stuck in prison once or twice. Some cohort of mine said her first Guildmaster got himself hanged. Then the Thieves Guild has to get foul on the king, and, let someone who knows tell you, the results ain't pretty.\nI got into the guild, the way I've seen most thieves do it. It was a few years back, when that bully &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; was sitting on the throne only everyone thought he was the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. My parents farm turned into eight acres of dust and rock, and they threw me and my brothers out. I was always a skinny thing, but by the time I made it to the closest town, I was a good deal more skinnier.\nJust cause the town had some dirt that plants could grow on didn't make them that much richer than my folks were. I tried to get all kinds of jobs, but the hungrier and more raggedier I got, the quicker anyone who might have work would kick me out. When the rainy season finally came, it came like a sea, and I didn't have nowhere to stay. Lucky I found the unlocked cellar door.\nTurns out that the owners of the house slept like old dogs, cause I robbed them blind (and tripped into things like I was the blind one) and they never woke up. I sold all the stuff at a dirty pawners I knew and spent the next two days living like a &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;potentate&lt;/a&gt;. Then I got my first visit from the local thieves guild.\nI remember what the guy looked like, but not exactly what he said. Something like, \"Hey, kid, if you want to steal in these parts, you're going to have to join the Guild. Otherwise, I or someone like me is going to break your skinny arms so you can't steal.\"\nI've known some people who've refused membership in the Guild and kept on stealing anyhow. I've broken one of their arms. As for me, this was the first offer I'd had for a career since my pa told me that if I didn't milk the &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;, he'd rip my head off. In comparison, this guy at the tavern was almost a gentleman. I agreed right away.\nSure, I had to prove my worth to the Guild before I could join and even now. But having two working arms is only part of the benefit. They trained me, taught me, and kept me out of prison. How many other guilds can boast a forgery expert on the premises?\nSo the next time you're calling some swindling merchant or usurious priest a thief, think about it. There is honor among thieves -- I should know."}
