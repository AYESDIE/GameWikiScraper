He is the antagonist of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;March of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nThird Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;Captain Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt; was the Imperial commander of Fort Frostmoth. He was a Knight Protector of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; on Solstheim in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;.

Of no relevance to the choices made by the player in game, Carius found himself abducted by the Daedric Lord &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; and forced against his will to partake in a series of trials during the events of the , along with others on Solstheim. He was forced to confront the Nerevarine inside the Mortrag Glacier, but it is unknown whether or not he survived this encounter.\nFourth Era.\nHis subsequent appearance inside Fort Frostmoth, and his increased rank (from Captain to General), imply that he was spared by the Nerevarine. He was presumably killed in the Eruption of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; or its following ash storms. He was resurrected by &lt;a href=\"Ildari%20Sarothril\"&gt;a powerful necromancer&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately killed by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; during the events of . He was unaware of his own death and resurrection, thinking no time had passed and little had changed.\nPhysical appearance.\nCarius most notably has no pupils in his eyes and a &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt; embedded in his chest. He wears a unique, unobtainable &lt;a href=\"General%20Carius%27%20Armor\"&gt;armor piece&lt;/a&gt; that has a chest design similar to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%27%20Armor\"&gt;General Tullius' Armor&lt;/a&gt;, but with a similar color scheme to the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Armor\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus Armor&lt;/a&gt;. His armor has a brace which holds his heart stone in place, and he also wears unobtainable gauntlets, boots and a helmet identical in appearance to their &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, but are actually unique and named after him, known as the &lt;a href=\"Falx%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Falx Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falx%20Boots\"&gt;Falx Boots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Falx%20Helmet\"&gt;Falx Helmet&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;March of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarius is found to be responsible for the prevalent Ash Spawn attacks on Raven Rock after the Dragonborn finds a &lt;a href=\"Declaration%20of%20War\"&gt;Declaration of War&lt;/a&gt; written by Carius on the remains of one. Upon showing him the note, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Veleth\"&gt;Captain Veleth&lt;/a&gt; remarks that General Carius lived long ago and should not still be alive, and tasks the Dragonborn with killing Carius to stop the Ash Spawn threat on the colony. He is found in the ruins of Fort Frostmoth along with an army of Ash Spawn.\nCombat.\nHe is extremely strong, capable of doing severe damage. He typically outlevels the Dragonborn, meaning he will always have a large amount of health and stamina. He summons &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in battle upon detecting the Dragonborn, and wields the &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Cudgel\"&gt;Champion's Cudgel&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;unique warhammer&lt;/a&gt; that randomly inflicts &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; damage.

As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Tullius has been assigned as the military governor to Skyrim.\nBackground.\nGeneral Tullius was born in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where he eventually became a talented General in regards to putting down unrest.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, after what the Empire considered the murder of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, General Tullius was sent to Skyrim by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric was leading skirmishes against the Empire, and the Legion was, originally, unsuccessful in beating his Stormcloaks. When Tullius got sent to Skyrim after the murder of High King &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire became more successful in their campaign. Tullius, being experienced in putting down unrest, started turning things around for the Empire. He personally captured Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants at &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and was trying to have them executed at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, until &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; appeared and Ulfric, alongside his men, escaped in the chaos. Still, under his command, the Legionnaires, largely consisting of a locally recruited militia Legion of scouts and skirmishers, started massacring the Stormcloaks, and slowly pushing them back. Tullius had troops stationed in &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt;, which he was trying to use in attempts to conquer &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, he was also attempting to conquer &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; from the Stormcloaks, as its proximity to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; would force Ulfric to keep forces stationed at home. Tullius also pocketed men in the Rift, who took out the Stormcloak soldiers at &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Watchtower\"&gt;Shor's Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;. These troops were stationed here to secure the rear guard of the Legion in the event of a siege of Windhelm. Tullius also ordered &lt;a href=\"Margret\"&gt;Margret&lt;/a&gt;, an Imperial spy in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, to find and obtain the deed to &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;, a silver mine serving as the jail of Markarth, which belonged to the Stormcloak-loyal &lt;a href=\"Silver-Bloods\"&gt;Silver-Bloods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thonar%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thonar Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the family, found out that Margret was a spy, and tried to have her get assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Weylin\"&gt;Weylin&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Forsworn. &lt;a href=\"Ganna%20Uriel\"&gt;Ganna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gemma%20Uriel\"&gt;Gemma Uriel&lt;/a&gt; are imperial spies living in Kynesgrove that help Tullius to supply his troops.\nDespite his successes, Tullius also had some obstacles. Tullius' requests for reinforcements were refused by the Emperor, as he could not risk weakening Cyrodiil's defenses on the border with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Nordic culture also often worked against Tullius, as he knew little of the Nordic ways. Where Tullius had learned that the High King was chosen through the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Crown\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; was sought by Ulfric, as it would potentially rally people behind him, and legitimize his claim, since the Crown was used to determine the High King before the Moot was formed. Tullius also requested &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, to garrison Imperial forces in his city. However, the Jarl did not accept Tullius' requests, instead preferring to remain neutral. When the Legion became aware of Ulfric's plans to march on Whiterun, they asked to garrison troops again, however, this time some intelligence was shared regarding Ulfric's plans, resulting in the Legion forces under &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Quentin%20Cipius\"&gt;Legate Quentin Cipius&lt;/a&gt; being sent to Whiterun to defend it from the Stormcloak invasion."}

This means that the armor cannot be improved past &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Improvement\"&gt;flawless&lt;/a&gt; quality without boosting the Smithing skill over 100. This can be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; items and/or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Potions\"&gt;blacksmithing potions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;Fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nThe cuirass is primarily bronze, gold, and dark red. Emblazoned across the chest is the Imperial insignia, along with some additional gold flourishes. An array of gold medallions adorn the belt and two more act as a clasp on the front. A small scarlet cape/hood is present on the back, but serves for aesthetic purposes.\nIt shares almost the same appearance as the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Armor\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus Armor&lt;/a&gt;, except for the gold coloring and decorative flourishes."}

However, &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on the garrison of Helgen allowed Ulfric and the other captured rebels to escape back to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to reorganize. Tullius leads his men in an attempt to defend Helgen to allow the residents time to evacuate, but the soldiers are forced to abandon the town themselves when Alduin proves invincible to their arrows and magic and tears the area apart. Surviving the attack, Tullius retreats to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; to regroup. Alduin's interruption of Ulfric's execution ends up prolonging the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; as a result.\nPolitical views.\nTullius is said to be opposed to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; and to resent the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, which he ironically has in common with his nemesis, Ulfric Stormcloak. This becomes apparent during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;,\" when Ulfric expresses vehement indignation about the Thalmor being present at the negotiations in &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, and Tullius shows a thinly veiled agreement with Ulfric right in front of &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;.\nTullius often displays ignorance and disinterest about the history and culture of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. However, if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; completes the civil war questline in favor of the Empire, Tullius will mention that even though he \"\"will never understand these Nords,\" he has come to foster much respect for them, stating that \"The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man down to his true self.\"\"\nInteractions.\nThe Dragonborn first meets Tullius in &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; where he prepares to execute a captured &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and several of his men. His execution was disrupted by an attack by &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Missing%20in%20Action\"&gt;Missing in Action&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can find an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Missive%20%28Battle-Born%29\"&gt;Imperial Missive&lt;/a&gt; which details Tullius being aware that the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Thorald%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Thorald Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; and has tasked &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Clan Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt; to inhibit any inquiries regarding his disappearance. Should the Dragonborn pursue diplomatic means to negotiate Thorald's release, the Thalmor guards of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Keep\"&gt;Northwatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; will deny having him as a prisoner and furthermore would refuse to release him unless by order of the Imperial Legion. The Dragonborn can ask Tullius to order his release, but he will deny them the request, stating it would cause far too many problems in regards to the uneasy peace right now between the Empire and the Dominion.\n&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Tullius may be one of the people attending Elenwen's party at the Thalmor Embassy.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Tullius will lead the Imperial delegation in Season Unending, to create a temporary truce between the Stormcloaks and the Legion. He is joined by Legate Rikke, Elisif the Fair, Balgruuf the Greater if Whiterun is still under his control, and Elenwen, representing the Aldmeri Dominion to ensure the White-Gold Concordant is upheld.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Legion, Tullius is involved in most of the Legion's quests:\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Windhelm\"&gt;Battle for Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nTullius will deliver a speech in an attempt to bolster his troops' courage and lead the siege on Windhelm as it is bombarded by catapult fire from the &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Eastmarch Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; will follow the player across the city until they reach the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, the general demands Ulfric and his second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;, to surrender, making it clear that, one way or another, the general would be sending their heads back to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to present to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after, a fight ensues and, once Ulfric is defeated and Galmar slain, he will ask Tullius to let the Dragonborn kill him, saying it will make for a better song, though the player may refuse and let the general have the honor. Following this, Tullius and Rikke step out and the former delivers a second speech to his troops, reassuring that the war is over and they can return home. In addition, he promises higher wages for the Legionnaires in Skyrim and pensions for the families of the fallen. If interacted with, the Imperial soldier will comment on his newly developed respect for the Nords and claims he will not return to Cyrodiil for quite some time, claiming that, despite his discomfort with Skyrim's cold weather, he has come to see the province as a home.\nStormcloaks.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Solitude\"&gt;Battle for Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn joins the cause of the Stormcloaks, General Tullius is defeated alongside his second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;. After a brief exchange of words, the Dragonborn is offered a chance by Ulfric Stormcloak to personally execute Tullius. Whether the Dragonborn defers to Ulfric to kill Tullius or ends the general's life themselves, Tullius will be killed one way or another. Before his death, Tullius concedes that Ulfric and the Stormcloaks had a point regarding the decadence of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the uncertain future Skyrim faces, but with his last words, he claims the Imperials are not the villains and warns Ulfric that the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; ultimately benefited the Thalmor and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; the most."}

The &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; do their best to close the gates, but it is to no avail.\"\n\"I've heard nothing good. In Morrowind, they say the man-god &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; has gone missing. Some believe he has been taken by the &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Many are dead in the land of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href=\"St.%20Jiub\"&gt;St. Jiub&lt;/a&gt;, who drove the &lt;a href=\"cliffracer\"&gt;cliffracer&lt;/a&gt;s from Vvardenfell, has fallen to the daedra hordes.\"\n\"The news has not been good. I've heard it said that the daedra have overrun the town of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. The entire town has been destroyed.\"\"\n\"\"There is grave news from Skyrim. From &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the foul daedra attack the land.\"\n\"I hear all of Skyrim is under siege. The daedra lay waste to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;, and there is little to do to stop it.\"\n\"There are foul tidings from Skyrim. The &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; speak of the end of all times.\"\"\nRumors.\nRumors\n\"\"We're all talking about the &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s murder. We have no emperor. And no heir. That's never happened before. I suppose we should all be worried.\"\n\"The Emperor and his three sons, dead, right under the noses of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;. It's a disgrace.\"\n\"I think we're all in for some hard times. The death of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim\"&gt;Uriel Septim&lt;/a&gt; and his heirs changes everything.\"\n\"I'm not sure the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; is any more serious a problem than beggary and petty thievery. And it's certainly a discreet and secret problem.\"\"\n\"The legions patrol the roads, and they've always been sufficient. I can't imagine we'll ever be at war with the provinces... not in my lifetime.\"\n\"\"The &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; sounds like a dangerous thief.\"\n\"Some say that &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Traven&lt;/a&gt; is mis-using the power of the Arch-Mage's position to further his personal agendas.\"\n\"Arch-Mage Traven is the first to take such a hard stance on &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. It upset more than a few people.\"\n\"Necromancy may be legal in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, but few will openly admit to practicing it now that the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; has banned it.\"\"\n\"The Mages Guild runs more or less like it always did, but we lost quite a few members when the practice of Necromancy was banned.\"\n\"Not only has Necromancy been banned in the Mages Guild, but the Guild won't deal with anyone who openly uses it.\"\n\"\"Half of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council of Mages&lt;/a&gt; resigned when Traven took over the position of Arch-Mage.\"\"\n\"I don't know what Arch-Mage Traven has against Necromancy, but the first thing he did after taking over the Mages Guild was to ban its practice.\"\n\"The Mages Guild has made more than a few enemies since Necromancy was banned.\"\n\"\"Things in the guild have been different since &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Traven&lt;/a&gt; was named Arch-Mage. They're more structured, but everyone seems tense.\"\n\"Have you ever met anyone who got rich betting on the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;? Didn't think so.\"\"\n\"The Arena's faked. You think those guys are getting killed? Really? It's just berry syrup and ham-acting.\"\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;The Council&lt;/a&gt; runs the Arena to amuse the masses, and it pays for itself, with all the fools who lose their shirts gambling.\"\n\"Is there anywhere in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; you can avoid &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Disease&lt;/a&gt; spreading little nuisances.\"\n\"I've seen plenty of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt;. You'd think they'd be picked clean after 2000 years, but, no, there's still great treasures there.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; ruins? The big thing is to watch out for the traps. Thousands of years old, and still working. Amazing.\"\n\"Watch for &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Minotaurs&lt;/a&gt; in the forests. Aggressive beasts. They'll tear right through your armor, too.\"\n\"Best way to take out a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; is with a big weapon. Forget spells. Just smack them and watch the bones fly!\"\"\n\"If you're all alone in the woods and you see a troll coming, you run. Problem solved. Next question?\"\n\"All that stuff about having to set trolls on fire is a bunch of hooey. They don't like fire, but a good sword will cut them up fine.\"\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; confer blessings of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; on those who've pleased &lt;a href=\"the%20Nine\"&gt;the Nine&lt;/a&gt; by righteous acts.\"\n\"Those who live by the Commands of the Nine receive Blessings of &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; when they visit Wayshrines of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Those famous for good deeds may receive Blessings of &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; when they visit &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"If you've been good, Wayshrines of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; may bless your &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Virtuous visistors to Wayshrines of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; may receive Blessings of &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Please the Nine with good works, and visit Wayshrines of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; for Blessings of &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"You've seen wayshrines in the wilderness? Those who've pleased the Nine may receive Blessings of &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt; at the Wayshrines of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"When you visit a Wayshrine of &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, and you've lived a good life by the Nine, you may receive a Blessing of &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\n\"If you've done good deeds, the Nine will bless you and cure diseases when you visit their wayshrines.\"\n\"Ancient Wayshrines of the Nine are scattered through the wilderness. The righteous who pray there receive powerful divine blessings.\"\n\"Wayshrines of the Nine in the wilderness confer blessings on the righteous and faithful.\"\n\"\"The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; is densely urbanized, with a few large parks and waterside dock areas.\"\n\"Well, it's no problem traveling from the Imperial City to &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;... if you're a wizard and can walk on water. I'd stay off the roads though.\"\"\n\"If you're on a road, you can usually outrun anything. If you're in good shape, and not wearing a tin suit.\"\n\"\"My favorite town? &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. Lovely old stone buildings, and the harbor at sunset is beautiful.\"\n\"No one wants to live in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Well, maybe in &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, but they're like &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. They don't feel the cold.\"\n\"The people of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; consider themselves to be more civilized and sophisticated than &lt;a href=\"Colovians\"&gt;Colovians&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\n\"I'm not saying Colovians are dumb. They're just hard-headed.\"\n\"The Colovians are proud of their reputation for being independent, rough, and rebellious.\"\n\"\"In the west, in Old Colovia, that's where men are men. That's the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\n\"It's still pretty wild east of the Niben. Few people, except for bandits, but at least it hasn't been picked clean by treasure-hunters.\"\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; isn't so bad, once you get used to the flies. And being lost all the time. And the &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;will-o-the-wisps&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Where does our food come from? The &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nibenean Valley&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;? Great wines, cheeses, and tomatoes.\"\n\"The Nibenay Basin grades from rolling farmlands by the river east to the rugged uplands of the &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"The lands surrounding &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; are studded with small settlements, farms, and woodland game reserves.\"\"\n\"Nobody goes into the mountains but hunters and thieves on the lam. Food and shelter is hard to come by.\"\n\"The Heartlands and Nibenean Valley are the agricultural breadbaskets of Cyrodiil.\"\n\"\"There's islands in &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; no one has visited in a hundred years. No telling what you'll find.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; is bordered on north and east by rugged mountains and to the south by marshes and rainforest.\"\n\"The lowlands of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Great Forest&lt;/a&gt; rise to the upland plateau of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\n\"Colovia is dotted with isolated farms and settlements, with most of the population in the coastal margin.\"\n\"\"The Colovian Highlands? Near the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; border? No one lives there. That's barren wastelands.\"\"\n\"The Colovian Highlands are barren wastelands along the border with Hammerfell.\"\n\"\"Western Cyrodiil is called '&lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;,' and includes the Gold Coast, West Weald, and Colovian Highlands regions.\"\"\n\"Colovia is a land of rugged wastes and highland forests.\"\n\"Cyrodiil is surrounded to the north and east by the lofty Jerall and Valus mountain ranges.\"\n\"On Cyrodiil's northern border is the sparsely populated mountain wilderness called the Valus Mountains.\"\n\"High mountain ranges rise to the borders in the north and east, and marshes and rainforests extend to the southeast borders.\"\n\"It's our natural barriers that keep us safe, mostly. Mountain borders north and east, open sea to the west, and bogs and rainforest to south.\"\n\"\"You can find &lt;a href=\"Cairn%20Bolete%20Cap\"&gt;Cairn Bolete&lt;/a&gt; growing in caves. They're said to mark the place someone has died.\"\"\n\"I don't even know what a will-o-the-wisp is, much less how to kill one. I think they're just swamp gas, myself.\"\n\"I don't like to think about zombies. Missing arms, legs, heads. They smell awful, and they're hard to kill.\"\n\"\"I ran across a &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; once. Seemed to suck the energy right out of me.\"\n\"I saw a &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt; once. It threw a curse on me I'll never forget.\"\n\"Best way to take out a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; is with a big weapon. Forget spells. Just smack them and watch the bones fly!\"\n\"I might swim more if it weren't for the &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt;. Sharp teeth, and some carry disease.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt;. \"Nature's guardians\" my foot! Mean things. They'll curse you, or they might call a &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; to tear you apart.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;. What's the point? Annoying buggers, though the meat isn't bad.\"\n\"Only thing worse than an &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; is two ogres. Tough bastards, and spells seem to bounce right off of 'em.\"\n\"They say that when you murder someone, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; comes to you in your sleep. It's how they recruit new members.\"\n\"I understand the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; is hiring new members. Not bad work for some folks.\"\"\nRumors\n\"\"I still can't believe what happened at the Chapel. &lt;a href=\"Trevaia\"&gt;Trevaia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laralthir\"&gt;Laralthir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dumania%20Jirich\"&gt;Dumania&lt;/a&gt;... all dead.\"\"\n\"What can be said about taxes? They're high, but we must pay. At least they are administered efficiently, and the shrinkage is within decent limits.\"\n\"The Elder Council and the bureaucracy have managed the Empire's affairs for decades. The Emperor rules, but the Council handles all the details.\"\n\"\"They say &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; is more beautiful. I've never been. For the present, I must count the Imperial City the most glorious in Tamriel.\"\"\n\"I have not read the works of Mrs. Ottus. I'm told some find her guide books useful, though she apparently has strong opinions on some matter.\"\n\"Legion duty here in Cyrodiil is usually a dull affair. In the East, though, things are a bit more challenging, and one can make a name for oneself.\"\n\"I've sometimes thought I'd like to make a pilgrimage to the Wayshrines, but my duties prevent me from such extensive and dangerous travel.\"\n\"I've not always been happy with the standards of conduct in the Mages Guild, but Hannibal Traven's reforms are quite encouraging.\"\n\"It is pleasant, and a bit melancholy, to walk among the graves in Green Emperor Way and contemplate the dead who precede us.\"\n\"\"Lots of dogs in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;this town&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of sheep, too. Of course, I prefer the taste of sheep.\"\"\n\"Chorrol appears to be clean, prosperous, and well-ordered. Countess Arriana, her staff and guard is to be praised.\"\n\"The people have a simple faith in the Nine, and the clerics do their part to heal and comfort them in adversity.\"\n\"\"There's been trouble with smugglers and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; in the Trans-Niben, but &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt; is taking steps to deal with the problem.\"\"\n\"I admit to sharing the common enthusiasm for the Arena. It is barbaric, but the stakes of life or death make the drama irresistibly compelling.\"\n\"\"Millona Umbranox, Arriana Valga, and &lt;a href=\"Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt; seem to rule their counties perfectly well without male assistance.\"\"\n\"Millona Umbranox is better off without that irresponsible husband of hers. The most honorable thing he ever did was to disappear and leave her alone.\"\n\"\"It is fashionable to make fun of &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Terentius\"&gt;Regulus Terentius&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I think it is poor sport to mock the poor and disadvantaged.\"\n\"I've never heard the Countess mention her husband. I believe it is something of a sore point with &lt;a href=\"Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Lady Millona&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\n\"It's curious. Skingrad's people scarcely ever set eyes on the Count, but he's apparently loved and respected by all his subjects.\"\n\"The Count of Skingrad and I are not social intimates. In fact, I don't believe Janus Hassildor has any social intimates.\"\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Countess%20Alessia%20Caro\"&gt;Alessia Caro&lt;/a&gt; visits &lt;a href=\"Arriana%20Valga\"&gt;her mother&lt;/a&gt; in Chorrol regularly. A dutiful daughter... and a dutiful wife, I hear.\"\"\n\"No wonder Narina Carvain is so cranky. If you had to live year-round in a cold, drafty, soot-stained castle like Bruma, you'd be cranky, too.\"\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt; is an intemperate, bibulous philanderer. And a Dark Elf. Other than that, he is perfectly suited to be a count.\"\"\n\"Andel Indarys may or may not have killed his wife, and it may or may not have been an accident. And I doubt we'll ever know for sure.\"\n\"\"How did a Dark Elf become &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;? King Helseth and Barenziah have considerable influence, and Helseth and Indarys are cronies. Get it?\"\"\nRumors\n\"\"There's been some terrible trouble at the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in Anvil. All of Dibella's priests and priestesses murdered!\"\n\"Anvil is all in an uproar. First the Chapel attacked, now &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;the prophet&lt;/a&gt; ranting about the end of the world!\"\n\"I can't believe it!

She recently got Ardaline out of a bind, and I hear it wasn't completely within guild rules.\"\n\"\"&lt;a href=\"Kud-Ei\"&gt;Kud-Ei&lt;/a&gt; runs a tight ship in &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. She may not always play by the rules, but I wouldn't want her on my bad side\"\"\n\"I can't believe a Mages Guild associate was found dead in Cheydinhal. What kind of place are they running there?\"\n\"I heard that one of the Skingrad mages was assaulted, but I don't know the details.\"\n\"\"I saw &lt;a href=\"Erthor\"&gt;Erthor&lt;/a&gt; earlier. Guess someone rescued him again. Hide your scrolls while you can.\"\"\n\"The Anvil guild has made quite a name for itself under Carahil. Did you hear about the recent murderer they caught?\"\n\"The roads near Anvil are safer now, thanks to Carahil and her guild hall. She's an example for us all.\"\n\"\"I understand that &lt;a href=\"Dagail\"&gt;Dagail&lt;/a&gt; is in much better control of her faculties now that &lt;a href=\"Kalthar\"&gt;Kalthar&lt;/a&gt;'s plot has been exposed.\"\n\"Kalthar tried to ruin the Leyawiin guild. Just goes to show you can't trust a Necromancer, even if he claims to be \"reformed.\"\"\n\"Sounds like the Skingrad branch of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; can't even keep track of its members. How appalling.\"\n\"Did you hear that &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt; left the guild? I think &lt;a href=\"Deetsan\"&gt;Deetsan&lt;/a&gt; is in charge in Cheydinhal now.\"\n\"I hear a new Associate came to &lt;a href=\"Teekeeus\"&gt;Teekeeus&lt;/a&gt;'s aid recently. Something about an old enemy of his storming into town.\"\"\n\"The Chorrol guild hall had an unpleasant visit recently, from someone who had a grudge against Teekeeus.\"\n\"\"Did you hear that someone played yet another prank on &lt;a href=\"Jeanne%20Frasoric\"&gt;Jeanne Frasoric&lt;/a&gt; in Bruma? I don't know how she keeps falling for these things.\"\"\n\"The Council of Mages has been dissolved. Arch-Mage Traven has been deserted. He's all we have left.\"\n\"\"Without the Council of Mages to guide us, how will we stand up to the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Have you heard? Someone desecrated the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Llathasa%20Indarys\"&gt;Llathasa&lt;/a&gt;. No wonder her ghost haunts that place.\"\"\n\"Captain Lex blames the Gray Fox for stealing the tax collection.

His hubris grew in recent years. He convinced himself he was the Spider's Champion. \"We need the Old Blod,\" he would say, \"the blood of &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;!\" He sought it with fervor.\nHe found our undoing. Skalg brought the mage here, alive and unbroken. He was a golden Elf, tall and proud and striking. I could see lust in his amber eyes. Not for me, likely not for any mortal flesh, but for something greater.\nSkalg gave him the drink we'd often used before. He planned to chain the Elf, to keep him alive as long as possible, a vessel of that most valuable blood.\nWe argued. This was not the Song I heard, nor the path I was to walk along &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;'s threads. But Skalg convinced me I could not see the intricacies of Her Web. And so I trusted.\nThe mage did not succumb, and his fury was great. Skalg burned to ash before I cried out. Not even the blood-forged guardians have the Elf pause as he smote his way to the roge. He struck down &lt;a href=\"Borz\"&gt;Borz&lt;/a&gt; and took the hammer in his hands.\nHe produced a small fork from his robes, then lapped it against the hammer. &lt;a href=\"Morkuldin\"&gt;Morkuldin&lt;/a&gt; bucked and shuddered. The walls cried out in protest. My clan died around me, blood pouring from their ears and eyes. The Elf's laughter drowned out the screams. But above it all I heard the Song.\nI approached the Elf from behind, no fear in my heart. I felt nothing but the faith as I gripped his silken hair and plunged his golden face into the forge flames.\nSilence. So much silence.\nI still hear Her in silken dreams. Her whispers tell me how to calm the forge, to make it slumber, to keep it hidden. My time here ends, and soon I will join Her atop the Spiral Skein.\nSomeday, another will hear her Song, even if they do not realize what drives them. On that day the forge will breathe again, and feast for the glory of the Silver Spider.\nIt is time. I shall give myself to her children, so they may feast and nest. My husk shall be a vessel for their offspring, a nurturing cocoon. I shall live on, peering out from endless eyes, and so shall I know Her glory."}

Don't come back.\" The sword was a message to never return home to her mother who has disowned her. She gives a reward for performing her mother's deed, then asks to be left alone."}

He left the stronghold to go adventuring in his earlier days, thus being exiled. Once he returned to Dushnikh Yal, Burguk was the new leader, and the Chief allowed him to reclaim his spot in the stronghold. Although Ghorbash states his desire to adventure again, he is reluctant to leave, for fear of dishonoring his place the chief had made for him. He can, however, be convinced via &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;persuasion&lt;/a&gt;, paying him, or beating him in a brawl. Once he is convinced to take up adventuring again, he can be a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, or speaking to him again when wearing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt; opens up Ghorbash as a &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; candidate:\n\"\"That amulet. I've seen the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; wear them when they're looking to marry. With your strength, you should have no trouble.\"\"\nInterested in me, are you? \"You're strong. Clever. I'd be proud to face the challenges of life with you, if you feel the same.\"\nFollower.\nBy default, he wears &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Despite wearing &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, his highest &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; are in &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; being slightly lower level than the two. His skills make him an effective &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;. Any combination of a single-handed weapon and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; also suits him. In contrast with followers like &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stenvar\"&gt;Stenvar&lt;/a&gt;, Ghorbash is less effective with Heavy Armor and &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weaponry.\nAs with many followers, Ghorbash resists arrest if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; chooses that option after acquiring a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;, although he cannot be commanded to &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt;, nor will he attack innocent people when commanded. Ghorbash can also join the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacking him enough times will result in the Dragonborn gaining a bounty from the &lt;a href=\"Tribal%20Orcs\"&gt;Tribal Orcs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"I used to wander the corners of Skyrim like you. I miss those days.\"\nUpon winning the brawl:\n\"Your fists speak louder than your words.\"\nConversations.\nOglub.\n&lt;a href=\"Oglub\"&gt;Oglub&lt;/a&gt;: \"You could challenge Burguk, my brother.

However, as she grew up, Ghorza began to find distaste in the tribe's traditions, feeling shackled by their strict ethics.\nEventually, after having decided to not \"end up as the third wife of some lowly chieftain,\" she abandoned her tribe along with her brother, &lt;a href=\"Moth%20gro-Bagol\"&gt;Moth gro-Bagol&lt;/a&gt;.

These apparitions appear as flying transparent shades with glowing red eyes.\nUsually found in dungeons, Ghosts likely haunt the places where they died. It is possible to identify Ghosts by their distinctive moan \u2014 lower and longer than a &lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;'s moan.\nAlthough they do not possess a material body, these spirits should not be underestimated. They can deal significant damage with their hands at close combat. However, their strongest ability and at the same time their major weakness is their ranged spell, which is used to attack opponents from far away. This spell does not damage &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, but instead it drains &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; from the target. This unique ability makes Ghosts a formidable enemy to &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;.

He is a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; with a short temper and a stabbing wit. He is very jaded, often taunting the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; by stating that he does not believe they will survive the next fight, for example: \"\"You see to it that the people of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; get some entertainment, and I'll see to it that you get a decent burial!\"\"\nHowever, as Owyn is presumably short-tempered and irreverent with all those he speaks to, this is probably not meant as a personal insult. As the Hero advances through the ranks of the Arena, Owyn becomes more and more friendly. He has asked the Battle Matron, &lt;a href=\"Ysabel%20Andronicus\"&gt;Ysabel Andronicus&lt;/a&gt;, to marry him but she refused saying \"I'm old, not desperate.\"\nInteractions.\nThe Hero can talk to him to become a combatant in the Arena, and to receive rewards and advancement after fights. He also gives the Hero a brief history of the Arena, although an anonymous &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Team%20Gladiator\"&gt;Blue Team Gladiator&lt;/a&gt; standing nearby can give a more complete history.\nOn the ground beside Owyn, the Hero can find a crumpled &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Branwen\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; written by &lt;a href=\"Branwen\"&gt;Branwen&lt;/a&gt; claiming to be Owyn's daughter, and that he does not believe her.\nUpon meeting Owyn for the first time, he expresses his strong disbelief at The Hero for asking to participate in the Arena. Owyn laughs in an insulting way and asserts The Hero will not be able to survive for long. In fact, upon asking for rumors, he jabs an insult by calling the new participant an idiot and wonders if there is any truth to that.\nHowever, as the Hero ascends in rank, Owyn completely changes his look and expresses his surprise several times, especially when The Hero has triumphed over three &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. He finally gives his respect and offers more moral support.\nWhen reaching the rank of Hero, Owyn no longer chastises The Hero and when asking for rumors again, he does admit he is curious on &lt;a href=\"The%20Grey%20Prince\"&gt;The Grey Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s ambiguous origins and later, his love life.\nDialogue.\n\"\"I don't know who you are, friend, but you've got about ten seconds to tell me what you're doing in my &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Bloodworks\"&gt;Bloodworks&lt;/a&gt; before I lop your arms off.\"\"\n\"\"You again, huh?

When the timer runs out, the character will begin to rapidly lose &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Morrowind\" and \"Oblivion\", the counter is a visual indicator. In \"Daggerfall\" and \"Skyrim\", there is no visual indication of how long can be spent underwater before begining to drown.\nBy game.\nIn \"Daggerfall\", the duration the &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; can stay underwater without taking damage by drowning is determined by their &lt;a href=\"Swimming\"&gt;Swimming&lt;/a&gt; skill. The &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; spell prevents damage caused by drowning for its duration. \nIn \"Morrowind\", the oxygen meter will deplete from full to empty in 20 seconds, after which the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; will begin taking three points of damage every second until they either surface for air or lose all their remaining &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and drown. Unlike \"Oblivion\", and much like , oxygen is a static timer of 20 seconds. The &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; effect on enchantments, spells and potions prevents damage caused by drowning.\nIn \"Oblivion\", the oxygen meter is proportionate to the character's &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;. The minimum time one can spend underwater is four seconds with zero &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; and the maximum is 34 seconds with 100 Endurance, with each point of Endurance providing an additional 0.3 seconds. Once oxygen is fully depleted, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; will rapidly lose &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; until they surface for air or lose all their remaining health and drown. The average oxygen duration of a newly created character ranges from 10 seconds for those with 30 Endurance to 23.5 seconds for those with 65 Endurance. The &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; effect on enchantments, spells and potions prevents damage caused by drowning.\nIn \"Skyrim\", the oxygen meter does not have a visual indicator, but the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will begin to rapidly lose 20 &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; each second after 20 seconds underwater. Characters other than the Dragonborn cannot drown or take damage from being underwater for longer than 20 seconds. The &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Waterbreathing&lt;/a&gt; effect on enchantments, spells and potions prevents damage caused by drowning. Contrary to popular belief, &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; does not affect the time the Dragonborn can stay underwater."}

He serves as the leader of the Greybeards, noted as surpassing all the others in his mastery of the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile few details are known regarding Paarthurnax as a supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; considered him a legendary lieutenant of Alduin, and during the Fourth Era, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; accused Paarthurnax of committing many atrocities. At some point during the war, Paarthurnax, along with a few other dragons, switched sides and taught the rebels the Voice. Their leaders &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; were all taught personally by Paarthurnax, who was the first dragon to defect to the rebels, becoming the first Tongues. It is said that &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; called upon Paarthurnax, as Paarthurnax pitied Man, to teach them the Voice.\nLate during the Dragon War, the leaders of the rebellion used an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to cast Alduin adrift into time atop the Throat of the World. Paarthurnax was not present during the fight but felt when Alduin was defeated, like the other dragons. Paarthurnax knew that Alduin would one day return, and as such, he chose to live atop the Throat of the World for thousands of years, waiting for Alduin to emerge again.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"2E%20373\"&gt;373th&lt;/a&gt; year of the Second Era, the Dragonguard noted that Paarthurnax was already under the protection of the Greybeards of High Hrothgar, refusing to act until they had an opportunity to strike against him.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Dragon Crisis of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; met with Paarthurnax on several occasions, the first to do so in over a hundred years. Paarthurnax provided the Dragonborn with the information regarding the Elder Scroll, suggesting they use it on the place where time was broken to go back in time to learn the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAfter the Dragonborn used the Elder Scroll and learned the Dragonrend Shout, Alduin appeared atop the Throat of the World, challenging them. Before the fight broke out, he offered Paarthurnax one last chance to join his side, stating that his power had waxed whereas the power of Paarthurnax had waned. Paarthurnax refused to ever serve Alduin again. Alduin was eventually defeated at the Throat of the World by the Last Dragonborn and Paarthurnax, fleeing the field to fly to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, where he would devour the souls of the dead. After capturing &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn traveled to &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; to face Alduin and defeat him.\nThe End of the Dragon Crisis.\nWith Alduin defeated, Paarthurnax mourned the death of Alduin despite believing he had abandoned the right path in the arrogance of his power. He shared the belief of the Last Dragonborn that Alduin needed to be destroyed. With the death of Alduin, Paarthurnax was rejuvenated and set out to attempt to convert the remaining dragons to the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;. Odahviing, another dragon serving the Last Dragonborn, questioned whether Paarthurnax's quest could succeed, believing few would want to exchange the rule of Alduin for what he considered the tyrannical Way of the Voice.\nDeath.\nDuring the Dragon Crisis, &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esbern\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;, two of the few remaining surviving Blades, find out about Paarthurnax. They both accuse Paarthurnax of atrocities during the Dragon War, but do not elaborate further. They refuse to offer the Last Dragonborn their services until Paarthurnax is slain.\nWhen approached regarding the charges, Paarthurnax himself tells the Last Dragonborn that he understands why the Blades do not trust him due to his inborn nature. He asks the Dragonborn whether it is better to be born good, or overcome your evil nature through great effort. If Paarthurnax is slain, master Arngeir of the Greybeards speaks in displeasure, considering it a breaking of their trust and a loss of ancient wisdom."}

The conclusion of the main storyline slightly differs depending on whether or not Paarthurnax is still living. Working with all factions prior to engaging Paarthurnax runs the risk of making the quest impossible to complete. \nKilling Paarthurnax.\nDefeating Paarthurnax is not especially difficult, as he displays only the usual powers common to all dragons and, at this point, the Dragonborn would have had access to both the &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; shout and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonbane\"&gt;Dragonbane&lt;/a&gt; sword.\nSparing Paarthurnax (PC only).\nIt is possible to complete this quest without needing to slay Paarthurnax by typing this command into the console:\ncodice_1\nThis way, Paarthurnax will remain alive, the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; will still be hospitable, and the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; will talk once more.

{"id": "54903", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=54903", "title": "Paarthurnax (Skyrim)", "text": "Paarthurnax (&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon Language&lt;/a&gt;: ), called \"the Old One\" by other &lt;a href=\"dov\"&gt;dov&lt;/a&gt;, is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;. He served as &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s lieutenant during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, during which he was said to have committed and witnessed unspeakable atrocities against &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt;kind.\nPhysical appearance.\nDespite dragons being immortal, Paarthurnax shows clear signs of great age, including tattered skin on his wings and tail, broken and chipped horns and chin-spikes, dulled color in his skin and eyes, and several teeth missing.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nPaarthurnax claims it was Alduin's false claim of godhood that turned him against his older brother. However, Nordic legend states that it was &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; herself who intervened, and sent Paarthurnax to assist mankind. Either way, Paarthurnax, along with several other Dragons, betrayed their former master and taught mankind to use the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. Mankind eventually prevailed, and Alduin was banished from &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with all Dragons, the lust for power was innate and still strong within him and if left unchecked, he would surely revert to his old ways. To overcome this, he retired to the peak of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; and lived in seclusion so that he could meditate and focus on the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;, a pacifist creed developed by &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; that preached the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods rather than martial exploits.\nJurgen Windcaller also founded the Greybeards, a monastic order dedicated to mastering the Way of the Voice. He built &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, located near the peak of the Throat of the World, which served as the monastery where the Greybeards meditated and perfected their Voice. Paarthurnax became the &lt;a href=\"grandmaster\"&gt;grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the Greybeards, but continued to live in seclusion at the peak of the mountain.\nFirst Era.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, he would often visit the legendary Dragon &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; during his imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;. He recalls that Numinex was so lonely and disturbed by his captivity that he could not remember his own name.\nFourth Era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; kept a record of any known surviving Dragons from the Dragon War. According to the \"&lt;a href=\"Atlas%20of%20Dragons\"&gt;Atlas of Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\", Paarthurnax is recorded as one of the only dragons that survived. Given his history and the atrocities he committed during the Dragon War, the Blades are very keen on killing him despite contributing to mankind's victory over his own kind.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Greybeards teach the &lt;a href=\"Clear%20Skies\"&gt;Clear Skies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, they use it to approach the summit of the Throat of the World, seeking Paarthurnax for information on the location of an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaarthurnax is not surprised when the Dragonborn is confused over his form as a dragon. When this is mentioned, he replies with \"\"I am as my father &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; made me.\"\" He teaches the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; shout. If the first word has already been learned, he will teach the second, and if the first and second words have been learned, he will teach the third one. He can also help the Dragonborn to meditate on their shouts, giving them additional perks depending on the word chosen.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Alduin's Bane&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn recovers the Elder Scroll from the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt; and reads it at the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt;, Paarthurnax helps the Dragonborn in defeating &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. After the latter escapes to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, Paarthurnax will devise a plan to capture a dragon in &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; to find out where Alduin has gone.\n&lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Blades learn that Paarthurnax aided Alduin during the Dragon War, they seek to kill him. When the Dragonborn mentions that Paarthurnax betrayed Alduin, the Blades will state that this simply means that he has the ability to betray them and others as well. If he is not killed, he appears for a small speech in the &lt;a href=\"Epilogue%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/a&gt;. This quest will not go away until the Dragonborn kills him, or until the Greybeards are sought out afterwards, sitting at their table at High Hrothgar. They will give the Dragonborn a debriefing on their excursion to Sovngarde and battle against Alduin, and they will hint at their fate and future accomplishments.\n&lt;a href=\"Epilogue%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Epilogue&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Paarthurnax was not killed at the request of the Blades, he appears at the Throat of the World in this quest, which is immediately after &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt; sends the Dragonborn back to Mundus upon completion of the final quest, &lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Alduin's defeat, Paarthurnax is struck with grief as he is not happy that Alduin has fallen since he still considers him as his brother. Nevertheless, he notes that Alduin's defeat was necessary. Paarthurnax then speaks of his intent on bringing the \"&lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;\" to all dragons and flies off. However, he can still be found perched on the mountain's &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; at any given time, and will still aid the Dragonborn in meditating on Shouts. Although Paarthurnax behaves at this point like an essential character, it is possible to kill him after meditating (see below) upon a shout, but a powerful Poison of Lingering Damage Health will be needed to overcome his healing rate. At such point, the Dragonborn may return to Delphine at Sky Haven Temple to further their progress on the &lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Blades\"&gt;Blades quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeditation.\nPaarthurnax will guide the Dragonborn in meditating on words of power. Meditating on a word grants a perk related to that shout until the Dragonborn meditates on a different word. There are three choices:"}

It seems to be something like a delayed response to an actual physical or magical attack by the player, as if the animal, once the spell has worn off, decides that it has just been attacked and seeks to get at its attacker, the player. &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; have been observed doing this after the effects of a Pacify spell have worn off, coming after the player who was still nearby but by no means in true close proximity to them. Pacified wolves, too, have been seen doing the same thing after the spell has worn off. This behavior seems similar to what would happen if the player shot an arrow at a distant wolf, hit it, but did not kill it: the wolf would rightly interpret the action as a personal attack, and come running after the player.\nDual casting this spell will increase the maximum effective level by x2.2.

Treethane Rolon explains that to accuse someone there must be three types of evidence: witness testimony, physical evidence, and a magical omen. He goes further pointing three suspects: &lt;a href=\"Aranak\"&gt;Aranak&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0merchant,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spinner%20Eranas\"&gt;Spinner Eranas&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gathiel\"&gt;Gathiel&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the Treethane's advice, speaking to the villagers will provide with many pieces of information and witnesses to the case.\nGathering witness.\nSpeaking to &lt;a href=\"Sendranir\"&gt;Sendranir&lt;/a&gt;, she will not be suspicious about the Spinner and the Khajiit, claiming that the former is a very good citizen and the latter has been in the village for years. She wonders if the Green Pact is extended to non-Bosmer. On the other hand, she is sure that Gathiel is guilty, for she has been always scheming and became cured of a sudden mysterious disease that got her for weeks in the very night the Pact was broken. She is willing to testify against Gathiel.\nSpeaking with &lt;a href=\"Naeldil\"&gt;Naeldil&lt;/a&gt;, she will also point to the Spinner's innocence. While recognizing Gathiel's ego, she does not believe the Spinner's wife could commit that crime, as the village prayed for her during the weeks of disease. She accuses Aranak, for she saw him sneaking into the woods the very night the Pact was broken. She is willing to testify against Aranak.\nFinally, speaking to &lt;a href=\"Orchelos\"&gt;Orchelos&lt;/a&gt;, he will testify to the innocence of Aranak, mentioning that the Khajiit was the connection of Karthdar with the rest of the world. He makes sure that Gathiel is completely innocent, even showing some feelings for her. However, he despises the Spinner and reveals that Eranas is an alchemist, saying he must use herbs. He is willing to testify against Eranas.\nInvestigating the village.\nSpinner Family House.\nHeading towards the Spinner Family House, you will find important evidence. A bowl is seen with cut flowers, making for possible physical evidence against Eranas.\n\"&lt;A large cutting of a vibrant but wilting plant lays here on Spinner Eranas' alchemy stand. Most of the blossoms have been removed.&gt;\"\nYou can also find \"&lt;a href=\"Gathiel%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Gathiel's Diary&lt;/a&gt;\", in which she expressly mentions being extremely ill and her husband being weary. If he intended to cure her, he would not have been successful by respecting the Green Pact. At the end of the diary, she writes that Eranas had discovered that Sanguine Alendil may have provided her a cure, continuing to mention that she had found a way of getting the flower. Because of this, the diary can be used as physical evidence against Gathiel.\nTreethane Rolon's House.\nInside the authority's house, it is possible to find an astrological scroll about her. Despite the direction of good health, it can be used as a magical omen against her.\nThe village.\nThe village holds three more pieces of evidence. In the middle of the village, the magical omen against the Spinner can be found, his Broken Sigil. At the merchant booth, it is possible to find Aranak's Khajiiti Merchant's Invoice, having an order for Sanguine Alendil. Near his cart, a charred rock makes reference to a magical omen against Aranak.\n\"&lt;The Spinner's Sigil, a complex weaving of found fallen branches, is broken into several pieces and left in a pile. It is normally found above his door. This could be the mystical sign needed to accuse the Spinner.&gt;\"\n\"&lt;A charred rock sits next to the shattered cart of the Khajiit merchant, Aranak. It seems oddly smooth and is still warm to the touch. If the merchant's cart was struck by lightning, that could be a mystical sign of his guilt.&gt;\"\nThe Judgement.\nAt this point, it is possible to join together the pieces of the mystery. Gathiel was sick, and Eranas could not find a way to cure her. She became desperate, and after he discovered that Sanguine Alendil could provide a cure, she anonymously made an order to Aranak, who secretly cut the flowers. Eranas then found snd used the sacred blossom to cure Gathiel.\nIt is possible to conclude that all are guilty, but only one accusation can be made against only one of them. Before making the accusation, it is possible to question each of them.\nAranak will mention that even if he did cut the flower, he could not be included in the Green Pact. The magical omen was also bad luck of his chart position, and for trying to protect it he was in the woods that stormy night.\nSpinner Eranas will say that he found the flowers already cut, and as a Spinner his obligation is to teach and protect the Green Pact. Moreover, he mentions the broken sigil was very unfortunate, but could be someone trying to accuse him.\nGathiel claims that the reason for her cure was a simple prayer. She becomes very angry knowing that her diary was read, saying it was natural to wish for a cure. According to her, even though she looked for something that would help, the prayer ended up saving her.\nThe Judgement Chamber.\nTo accuse someone it is needed to appoint a witness, the physical evidence and the magical omen. You must appoint the evidence related only to the accused. Whoever is this person, after the verdict, you must lead the person to the Judgement Chamber. There, a series of spirits of nature await, and down an enormous tree, the guilty is consumed by nature, and the case is closed."}

Found in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, this palace serves as the headquarters for both the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.

From this room, the Jarl's Quarters and several other bedrooms can be accessed. Off to the right of this room is the kitchen.\nTo the left of the kitchen sits the dungeon (which is called Windhelm Barracks). Across from the dungeon is the sleeping quarters for the other inhabitants of the Palace, including the chambers of Wuunferth the Unliving, where an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; can be found. It bears heavily Gothic features, as is typical for many ancient Nord buildings.\nPlaques.\nOutside the palace are three commemorative plaques that each bear the name of a &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Joining%20the%20Stormcloaks\"&gt;Joining the Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are several ways to join the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.

Upon entering with Ralof, the quest is automatically received after leaving the keep. The quest can be also be activated either by going to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and talking to &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; or by talking to traveling farmers or Stormcloak soldiers. Another way to join is to betray the Imperials by bringing the Jagged Crown to Ulfric Stormcloak instead of General Tullius.\n&lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis castle is the headquarters of Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, leader of the Stormcloaks. After the end of the Civil War questline, if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; supported the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the rebel Jarls that were removed from power are now located within the Palace.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn accesses the Palace in search of Ulfric's steward, &lt;a href=\"Jorleif\"&gt;Jorleif&lt;/a&gt;, who offers clues on the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"the%20Butcher\"&gt;the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Amulet\"&gt;Strange Amulet&lt;/a&gt; is obtained and Wuunferth the Unliving is accused, he is imprisoned in the dungeons of the Palace."}

Pal La. I remember when I first heard that name, not long ago at all. It was at a &lt;a href=\"Tales%20and%20Tallows\"&gt;Tales and Tallows&lt;/a&gt; ball at a very fine estate west of &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup\"&gt;Mir Corrup&lt;/a&gt;, to which I and my fellow &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; initiates had found ourselves unexpectedly invited. Truth be told, we needn't have been too surprised. There were very few other noble families in Mir Corrup\u2014the region had its halcyon days as a resort for the wealthy far back in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;2nd era&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and on reflection, it was only appropriate to have sorcerers and wizards present at a supernatural holiday. Not that we were anything more exotic than students at a small, nonexclusive charterhouse of the Guild, but like I said, there was a paucity of other choices available.\nFor close to a year, the only home I had known was the rather ramshackle if sprawling grounds of the &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mir Corrup Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. My only companions were my fellow initiates, most of which only tolerated me, and the masters, whose bitterness at being at a backwater Guild prompted never-ending abuse.\nImmediately the School of Illusion had attracted me. The Magister who taught us recognized me as an apt pupil who loved not only the spells of the science but their philosophical underpinnings. There was something about the idea of warping the imperceptible energies of light, sound, and mind that appealed to my nature. Not for me the flashy schools of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;, the holy schools of &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, the practical schools of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchantment\"&gt;Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;, or the chaotic school of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;. No, I was never so pleased as to take an ordinary object and by a little magic make it seem something other than what it was.\nIt would have taken more imagination than I had to apply that philosophy to my monotonous life. After the morning's lessons, we were assigned tasks before our evening classes. Mine had been to clean out the study of a recently deceased resident of the Guild, and categorize his clutter of spellbooks, charms, and incunabula.\nIt was a lonely and tedious appointment. Magister &lt;a href=\"Tendixus\"&gt;Tendixus&lt;/a&gt; was an inveterate collector of worthless junk, but I was reprimanded any time I threw something away of the least possible value. Gradually I learned enough to deliver each of his belongings to the appropriate department: potions of healing to the Magisters of Restoration, books on physical phenomena to the Magisters of Alteration, herbs and minerals to the Alchemists, and soulgems and bound items to the Enchanters. After one delivery to the Enchanters, I was leaving with my customary lack of appreciation, when &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Ilther\"&gt;Magister Ilther&lt;/a&gt; called me back.\n\"Boy,\" said the portly old man, handing me back one item. \"Destroy this.\"\nIt was a small black disc covered with runes with a ring of red-orange gems like bones circling its periphery.\n\"I'm sorry, Magister,\" I stammered. \"I thought it was something you'd be interested in.\"\n\"Take it to the great flame and destroy it,\" he barked, turning his back on me. \"You never brought it here.\"\nMy interest was piqued, because I knew the only thing that would make him react in such a way. &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. I went back to Magister Tendixus's chamber and poured through his notes, looking for any reference to the disc. Unfortunately, most of the notes had been written in a strange code that I was powerless to decipher. I was so fascinated by the mystery that I nearly arrived late for my evening class in Enchantment, taught by Magister Ilther himself.\nFor the next several weeks, I divided my time categorizing the general debris and making my deliveries, and researching the disc. I came to understand that my instinct was correct: the disc was a genuine necromantic artifact. Though I couldn't understand most of the Magister's notes, I determined that he thought it to be a means of resurrecting a loved one from the grave.\nSadly, the time came when the chamber had been categorized and cleared, and I was given another assignment, assisting in the stables of the Guild's menagerie. At least finally I was working with some of my fellow initiates and had the opportunity of meeting the common folk and nobles who came to the Guild on various errands. Thus was I employed when we were all invited to the Tales and Tallows ball.\nIf the expected glamour of the evening were not enough, our hostess was reputed to be young, rich, unmarried orphan from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Only a month or two before had she moved to our desolate, wooded corner of the Imperial Province to reclaim an old family manorhouse and grounds. The initiates at the Guild gossiped like old women about the mysterious young lady's past, what had happened to her parents, why she had left or been driven from her homeland. Her name was Betaniqi, and that was all we knew.\nWe wore our robes of initiation with pride as we arrived for the ball. At the enormous marble foyer, a servant announced each of our names as if we were royalty, and we strutted into the midst of the revelers with great puffery. Of course, we were then promptly ignored by one and all. In essence, we were unimportant figures to lend some thickness to the ball. Background characters.\nThe important people pushed through us with perfect politeness. There was old Lady Schaudirra discussing diplomatic appointments to &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; with the Duke of Rimfarlin. An orc warlord entertained a giggling princess with tales of rape and pillage. Three of the Guild Magisters worried with three painfully thin noble spinsters about the haunting of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Intrigues at the Imperial and various royal courts were analyzed, gently mocked, fretted over, toasted, dismissed, evaluated, mitigated, admonished, subverted. No one looked our way even when we were right next to them. It was as if my skill at illusion had somehow rendered us all invisible.\nI took my flagon out to the terrace. The moons were doubled, equally luminous in the sky and in the enormous reflecting pool that stretched out into the garden. The white marble statuary lining the sides of the pool caught the fiery glow and seemed to burn like torches in the night. The sight was so otherworldly that I was mesmerized by it, and the strange &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; figures immortalized in stone. Our hostess had made her home there so recently that some of the sculptures were still wrapped in sheets that billowed and swayed in the gentle breeze. I don't know how long I stared before I realized I wasn't alone.\nShe was so small and so dark, not only in her skin but in her clothing, that I nearly took her for a shadow. When she turned to me, I saw that she was very beautiful and young, not more than seventeen.\n\"Are you our hostess?\" I finally asked.\n\"Yes,\" she smiled, blushing. \"But I'm ashamed to admit that I'm very bad at it. I should be inside with my new neighbors, but I think we have very little in common.\"\n\"It's been made abundantly clear that they hope I have nothing in common with them either,\" I laughed. \"When I'm a little higher than an initiate in the Mages Guild, they might see me as more of an equal.\"\n\"I don't understand the concept of equality in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; yet,\" she frowned. \"In my culture, you proved your worth, not just expected it. My parents both were great warriors, as I hope to be.\"\nHer eyes went out to the lawn, to the statues.\n\"Do the sculptures represent your parents?\"\n\"That's my father Pariom there,\" she said gesturing to a life-sized representation of a massively built man, unashamedly naked, gripping another warrior by the throat and preparing to decapitate him with an outstretched blade. It was clearly a realistic depiction. Pariom's face was plain, even slightly ugly with a low forehead, a mass of tangled hair, stubble on his cheeks. Even a slight gap in his teeth, which no sculptor would surely have invented except to do justice to his model's true idiosyncrasies.\n\"And your mother?\" I asked, pointing to a nearby statue of a proud, rather squat warrior woman in a mantilla and scarf, holding a child.\n\"Oh no,\" she laughed. \"That was my uncle's old nurse. Mother's statue still has a sheet over it.\"\nI don't know what prompted me to insist that we unveil the statue that she pointed to. In all likelihood, it was nothing but fate, and a selfish desire to continue the conversation. I was afraid that if I did not give her a project, she would feel the need to return to the party, and I would be alone again. At first she was reluctant. She had not yet made up her mind whether the statues would suffer in the wet, sometimes cold Cyrodilic climate. Perhaps all should be covered, she reasoned. It may be that she was merely making conversation, and was reluctant as I was to end the stand-off and be that much closer to having to return to the party.\nIn a few minutes time, we tore the tarp from the statue of Betaniqi's mother. That is when my life changed forevermore.\nShe was an untamed spirit of nature, screaming in a struggle with a misshapen monstrous figure in black marble. Her gorgeous, long fingers were raking across the creature's face. The monster's talons gripped her right breast in a sort of caress that prefaces a mortal wound. Its legs and hers wound around one another in a battle that was a dance. I felt annihilated. This lithe but formidable woman was beautiful beyond all superficial standards. Whoever had sculpted it had somehow captured not only a face and figure of a goddess, but her power and will. She was both tragic and triumphant. I fell instantly and fatally in love with her.\nI had not even noticed when Gelyn, one of my fellow initiates who was leaving the party, came up behind us. Apparently I had whispered the word \"magnificent,\" because I heard Betaniqi reply as if miles away, \"Yes, it is magnificent. That's why I was afraid of exposing it to the elements.\"\nThen I heard, clearly, like a stone breaking water, Gelyn: \"&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; preserve me. That must be &lt;a href=\"Palla\"&gt;Palla&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Then you heard of my mother?\" asked Betaniqi, turning his way.\n\"I hail from &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. practically on the border to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think there's anyone who hasn't heard of your mother and her great heroism, ridding the land of that abominable beast. She died in that struggle, didn't she?\"\n\"Yes,\" said the girl sadly. \"But so too did the creature.\"\nFor a moment, we were all silent. I don't remember anything more of that night. Somehow I knew I was invited to dine the next evening, but my mind and heart had been entirely and forever more arrested by the statue. I returned back to the Guild, but my dreams were fevered and brought me no rest. Everything seemed diffused by white light, except for one beautiful, fearsome woman. Palla."}

Pal La. The name burned in my heart. I found myself whispering it in my studies even when I tried to concentrate on something the Magister was saying. My lips would silently purse to voice the \"Pal,\" and tongue lightly flick to form the \"La\" as if I were kissing her spirit before me. It was madness in every way except that I knew that it was madness. I knew I was in love. I knew she was a noble &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; woman, a fierce warrior more beautiful than the stars. I knew her young daughter &lt;a href=\"Betaniqi\"&gt;Betaniqi&lt;/a&gt; had taken possession of a manorhouse near the Guild, and that she liked me, perhaps was even infatuated. I knew Palla had fought a terrible beast and killed it. I knew Palla was dead.\nAs I say, I knew it was madness, and by that, I knew I could not be mad. But I also knew that I must return to Betaniqi's palace to see her statue of my beloved Palla engaged in that final, horrible, fatal battle with the monster.\nReturn I did, over and over again. Had Betaniqi been a different sort of noblewoman, more comfortable with her peers, I would not have had so many opportunities. In her innocence, unaware of my sick obsession, she welcomed my company. We would talk for hours, laughing, and every time we would take a walk to the reflecting pond where I would always stop breathless before the sculpture of her mother.\n\"It's a marvelous tradition you have, preserving these figures of your ancestors at their finest moments,\" I said, feeling her curious eyes on me. \"And the craftsmanship is without parallel.\"\n\"You wouldn't believe me,\" laughed the girl. \"But it was a bit of scandal when my great grandfather began the custom. We Redguards hold a great reverence for our families, but we are warriors, not artists. He hired an traveling artist to create the first statues, and everyone admired them until it was revealed that the artist was an elf. An &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Scandal!\"\n\"It was, absolutely,\" Betaniqi nodded seriously. \"The idea that a pompous, wicked elf's hands had formed these figures of noble Redguard warriors was unthinkable, profane, irreverent, everything bad you can imagine. But my great grandfather's heart was in the beauty of it, and his philosophy of using the best to honor the best passed down to us all. I would not have even considered having a lesser artist create the statues of my parents, even if it would have been more allegiant to my culture.\"\n\"They're all exquisite,\" I said.\n\"But you like the one of my mother most of all,\" she smiled. \"I see you look at it even when you seem to be looking at the others. It's my favorite also.\"\n\"Would you tell me more about her?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice light and conversational.\n\"Oh, she would have said she was nothing extraordinary, but she was,\" the girl said, picking a flower from the garden. \"My father died when I was quite young, and she had so many roles to fill, but she did them all effortlessly. We have a great many business interests and she was brilliant at managing everything. Certainly better than I am now. All it took was her smile and everyone obeyed, and those that didn't paid dearly. She was very witty and charming, but a formidable force when the need arose for her to fight. Hundreds of battles, but I can never remember a moment of feeling neglected or unloved. I literally thought she was too strong for death. Stupid, I know, but when she went to battle that -- that horrible creature, that freak from a mad wizard's laboratory, I never even thought she would not return. She was kind to her friends and ruthless to her enemies. What more can one say about a woman than that?\"\nPoor Betaniqi's eyes teared up with remembrance. What sort of villain was I to goad her so, in order to satisfy my perverted longings? &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; could never have conflicted a mortal man more than me. I found myself both weeping and filled with desire. Palla not only looked like a goddess, but from her daughter's story, she was one.\nThat night while undressing for bed, I rediscovered the black disc I had stolen from Magister &lt;a href=\"Tendixus\"&gt;Tendixus&lt;/a&gt;'s office weeks before. I had half-forgotten about its existence, that mysterious &lt;a href=\"necromantic\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; artifact which the mage believed could resurrect a dead love. Almost by pure instinct, I found myself placing the disc on my heart and whispering, \"Palla.\"\nA momentary chill filled my chamber. My breath hung in the air in a mist before dissipating. Frightened I dropped the disc. It took a moment before my reason returned, and with it the inescapable conclusion: the artifact could fulfill my desire.\nUntil the early morning hours, I tried to raise my mistress from the chains of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, but it was no use. I was no &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. I entertained thoughts of how to ask one of the Magisters to help me, but I remembered how &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Ilther\"&gt;Magister Ilther&lt;/a&gt; had bid me to destroy it. They would expel me from the Guild if I went to them and destroy the disc themselves. And with it, my only key to bringing my love to me.\nI was in my usual semi-torpid condition the next day in classes. Magister Ilther himself was lecturing on his specialty, the School of &lt;a href=\"Enchantment\"&gt;Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. He was a dull speaker with a monotone voice, but suddenly I felt as if every shadow had left the room and I was in a palace of light.\n\"When most persons think of my particular science, they think of the process of invention. The infusing of charms and spells into objects. The creation of a magickal blade, perhaps, or a ring. But the skilled enchanter is also a catalyst. The same mind that can create something new can also provoke greater power from something old. A ring that can generate warmth for a novice, on the hand of such a talent can bake a forest black.\" The fat man chuckled: \"Not that I'm advocating that. Leave that for the School of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThat week all the initiates were asked to choose a field of specialization. All were surprised when I turned my back on my old darling, the School of &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed ridiculous to me that I had ever entertained an affection for such superficial charms. All my intellect was now focused on the School of &lt;a href=\"Enchantment\"&gt;Enchantment&lt;/a&gt;, the means by which I could free the power of the disc.\nFor months thereafter, I barely slept. A few hours a week, I'd spend with Betaniqi and my statue to give myself strength and inspiration. All the rest of my time was spent with Magister Ilther or his assistants, learning everything I could about enchantment. They taught me how to taste the deepest levels of magicka within a stored object.\n\"A simple spell cast once, no matter how skillfully and no matter how spectacularly, is ephemeral, of the present, what it is and no more,\" sighed Magister Ilther. \"But placed in a home, it develops into an almost living energy, maturing and ripening so only its surface is touched when an unskilled hand wields it. You must consider yourself a miner, digging deeper to pull forth the very heart of gold.\"\nEvery night when the laboratory closed, I practiced what I had learned. I could feel my power grow and with it, the power of the disc. Whispering \"Palla,\" I delved into the artifact, feeling every slight nick that marked the runes and every facet of the gemstones. At times I was so close to her, I felt hands touching mine. But something dark and bestial, the reality of death I suppose, would always break across the dawning of my dream. With it came an overwhelming rotting odor, which the initiates in the chambers next to mine began to complain about.\n\"Something must have crawled into the floorboards and died,\" I offered lamely.\nMagister Ilther praised my scholarship, and allowed me the use of his laboratory after hours to further my studies. Yet no matter what I learned, Palla seemed scarcely closer. One night, it all ended. I was swaying in a deep ecstasy, moaning her name, the disc bruising my chest, when a sudden lightning flash through the window broke my concentration. A tempest of furious rain roared over &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup\"&gt;Mir Corrup&lt;/a&gt;. I went to close the shutters, and when I returned to my table, I found that the disc had shattered.\nI broke into hysterical sobs and then laughter. It was too much for my fragile mind to bear such a loss after so much time and study. The next day and the day after, I spent in my bed, burning with a fever. Had I not been at a &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; with so many healers, I likely would have died. As it was, I provided an excellent study for the budding young scholars.\nWhen at last I was well enough to walk, I went to visit Betaniqi. She was charming as always, never once commenting on my appearance, which must have been ghastly. Finally I gave her reason to worry when I politely but firmly declined to walk with her along the reflecting pool.\n\"But you love looking at the statuary,\" she exclaimed.\nI felt that I owed her the truth and much more. \"Dear lady, I love more than the statuary. I love your mother. She is all I've been able to think about for months now, ever since you and I first removed the tarp from that blessed sculpture. I don't know what you think of me now, but I have been obsessed with learning how to bring her back from the dead.\"\nBetaniqi stared at me, eyes wide. Finally she spoke: \"I think you need to leave now. I don't know if this is a terrible jest --\"\n\"Believe me, I wish it were. You see, I failed. I don't know why. It could not have been that my love wasn't strong enough, because no man had a stronger love. Perhaps my skills as an enchanter are not masterful, but it wasn't from lack of study!\" I could feel my voice rise and knew I was beginning to rant, but I could not hold back. \"Perhaps the fault lay in that your mother never met me, but I think that only the caster's love is taken into account in the necromantic spell. I don't know what it was! Maybe that horrible creature, the monster that killed her, cast some sort of curse on her with its dying breath! I failed! And I don't know why!\"\nWith a surprising burst of speed and strength for so small a lady, Betaniqi shoved herself against me. She screamed, \u201cGet out!\u201d and I fled out the door.\nBefore she slammed the door shut, I offered my pathetic apologies: \"I'm so sorry, Betaniqi, but consider that I wanted to bring your mother back to you. It's madness, I know, but there is only one thing that's certain in my life and that's that I love Palla.\"\nThe door was nearly shut, but the girl opened it crack to ask tremulously: \"You love whom?\"\n\"Palla!\" I cried to the Gods.\n\"My mother,\" she whispered angrily. \"Was named Xarlys. Palla was the monster.\"\nI stared at the closed door for Mara knows how much time, and then began the long walk back to the Mages Guild. My memory searched through the minutiae to the &lt;a href=\"Tales%20and%20Tallows\"&gt;Tales and Tallows&lt;/a&gt; night so long ago when I first beheld the statue, and first heard the name of my love. That Breton initiate, Gelyn had spoken. He was behind me. Was he recognizing the beast and not the lady?\nI turned the lonely bend that intersected with the outskirts of Mir Corrup, and a large shadow rose from the ground where it had been sitting, waiting for me.\n\"Palla,\" I groaned. \"Pal La.\"\n\"Kiss me,\" it howled.\nAnd that brings my story up to the present moment. Love is red, like blood."}

I know how much you miss drinking out on the front lines, and believe me, the first few rounds are on me when you get back, but you can't possibly miss listening to some drunken idiot argue about politics.\nSo this Breton, he starts getting really loud, and he rants about all the reasons we're at war with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about economic factors, he talks about resources, he talks about &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt;, the guy goes on for what seems like forever, and that's when he stops to take a drink. Which was long enough for me to say two words: \"You're wrong.\"\nBecause this guy doesn't know a bloody thing about what it's like fighting the Dominion. Out on the battlefield, they don't care about economics or resources or religion. You're out there for one reason: to kill them before they kill you.\nEveryone else here knows the truth. For all their lofty &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; pretense, the Aldmeri Dominion only really cares about one thing: conquest. Though they do have standards\u2014they only want to conquer the non-Elves. Like us.\nSo I told that drunken fool the same thing you told us. Without soldiers like us standing between them and the Imperial throne, the Elves will push and push and push until they hold everything from the shores of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to the heart of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAny Altmer who looks at a Breton, he's going to see a human. Any Altmer who looks at a Redguard like me \u2026 well, there's no way around it, he pretty much knows I'm a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;. And there's no mistaking an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;. Ain't none of us Elves.\nLife is getting a little more relaxed in the city now, since everyone has pretty much accepted we're at war, and there's still the occasional High Elf in the streets who can go about his business without a fight. It's still sane enough that they can walk around in public. Inside the city walls, I've seen a handful of High Elves walking into the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, selling their wares, and even ordering those fruity wines they like so much, and as long as the city watch is keeping the peace, we'll be peaceful.\nBut when we're in the field, we don't hesitate. Everyone \u2014 except that one loudmouthed Breton I put in his place\u2014everyone knows we're holding the line against the Altmer. And when we come back to town in one piece, we're going to be heroes, and we'll be shouting and drinking in that tavern.\nSo make sure you come back in one piece.Stay safe,&lt;a href=\"Duqaq%20af-Wazif\"&gt;Duqaq af-Wazif&lt;/a&gt;"}

Pirate queen Fortunata ap Dugal of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; has contacted the dark brotherhood and wishes to personally meet with the assassin who will carry out her contract. \nHead to Castle Anvil. You will find the pirate queen in the throne room. Speak with her and she will tell you what you need to do. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; has been expanding its influence, and Fortunata wants to send a message to &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Count Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; that they cannot protect him.

It will be on the top floor, on the dresser by the bed. Using this key, you can take the gatehouse passage northeast of the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Bank of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to secretly get into the castle. Alternatively, you can talk to &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Luca%20Plavius\"&gt;Sergeant Luca Plavius&lt;/a&gt; at the castle gates to learn that only people with a special writ are allowed to enter the castle, and that the chanters from the chapel have such a writ. You can then go to the chapel graveyard and intimidate &lt;a href=\"Chanter%20Amia\"&gt;Chanter Amia&lt;/a&gt;. She will not give you her writ, but she will tell you about a passage through the moat that will allow you in. \nEither way, once you have made it into the castle, make your way to the southeastern room. You will find the commander at the table. If you sneak up on him and use your blade of woe, you can avoid a drawn-out boss battle. Either way, once he is dead, make your way to the northeastern room. As you approach the Count's Suite, you can overhear the count performing the Black Sacrament. Head in and talk to him. He will assume you are there because of his ritual, and will ask you to kill Governor Fortunata ap Dugal in exchange for information about who is killing dark brotherhood agents. When you tell him why you are really here, he will still offer the job. \n&lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt; will then show up behind you. Speak with him and he will tell you to fulfill the count's contract, to murder your previous client. Head across from this room to the dignitary suite and use the secret passage in the wardrobe to make your way out of Castle Kvatch. Make your way over to Anvil and speak with &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Motierre\"&gt;Mirabelle Motierre&lt;/a&gt; outside the castle. She has been working as a dark brotherhood spy here, and can tell you how to approach this contract. She will tell you the easiest way to kill the governor is to poison her wine. You can move about the castle through the secret passageways behind the red drapes. \nSneak your way to the top floor, then to the dead end in the southeast of the castle. There, you will find Fortunata's wine decanter. Poison it, then head down the passage west of there to make your way to the governor's suite. You will find Fortunata there; tell her you have completed her contract, and she will offer to have a drink with you on her balcony. Mirabelle will come and deliver the wine that you poisoned; after Fortunata drinks it, Mirabelle will taunt her before she dies of the poison. \nWith Fortunata dead, head out of Anvil castle. You can use Fortunata's secret escape route behind the red drapes. Once you are out, return to the sanctuary and speak with Astara to finish the quest."}

Once inside, the Agent will instantly be attacked by an assassin, who will shout when attacked:\nAfter killing the assassin, and their companions, the Agent must find the client's corpse, lying somewhere inside the building. When found, the Agent will also find a note laying beside the body, which reveals the reason why the client was killed. However, this is not the end of the quest, for the Agent must track down the person who had the client killed.\nThe Known Entity.\nAsking around the town in which the client lived about the person referenced in the note reveals that they are to be found in another town. Once in town, the Agent will once again have to ask the locals for a more specific address and directions to the person in question. However, when the Agent finally meets with the person in question, they not only find that they are a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; Operative, but that they are aware of what the Agent has been doing:\nAfter this, the Operative will transform into a &lt;a href=\"Nightblade%20%28Enemy%29\"&gt;nightblade&lt;/a&gt;, while several other members of the Brotherhood will appear as assassins to defend the Operative. Once all of them lie dead, the Agent may search their bodies for clues, but will find nothing other than their equipment.\nAn Inherited Threat.\nSome ten to twenty-one days after the meeting with the Operative, the Agent will be given a letter by a courier. The letter reveals that the daughter of the client has heard of the Agent's \"heroic action in avenging my [her] father's death,\" and would like to meet with the Agent in another town. The Agent must head to the daughter's town, and find the building she is inhabiting.\nOnce inside the building, the Agent must find the daughter, although before anything can be said the daughter will exclaim:\nA quartet of assassins will appear, and mock the Agent for their predictable response to the daughter's letter. Once all four are killed the daughter will ask the Agent to escort her to a safe house in another town, from which she will attempt to escape the &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;. Successfully escorting her to the safe house before the time limit expires will be enough to complete the quest.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a standard boost to their &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Guild. Failing the quest will not only see the Agent forfeit a reward, but also have their standing with the Guild harmed:\nKilling the Dark Brotherhood Operative will grant the following changes to the Agent's reputation:"}

Now we'll finally learn how &lt;a href=\"Faolchu\"&gt;Faolchu&lt;/a&gt; was originally killed.\nWalkthrough.\nAlana explains the Direnni Armor is the key to the past. It belonged to her beloved and was buried in this place of honor. It was her beloved's hand that cut Faolchu down. The armor will make the wearer relive the last moments of the battle as Alana's husband. But one has to be careful, whatever one do can effect events and may have untold consequences. Not only will the Vestige live through the past, what they do, may also change the destiny of those around.\nPut on the armor and when Faolchu dies, the armor will eject them back to the present, unharmed. Asking Alana more questions at this stage will reveal the history of why these events occurred. Go over to the skeleton and put on the armor, then talk to Alana again. She is waiting by the stairs and she tells the Vestige, now in the shape of her husband, that Commander Parmion is waiting. As his best officer and noblest knight, he should be by the commanders side at this moment.\nAlana is getting impatient and implies that the blow to his head rattled his senses. They need to strike against Faolchu's headquarters soon. They have work to do, and the captured messenger handed the \"Alessian Orders\" off before they got to him. They must retrieve the Orders among the enemy soldiers.\nLeave the crypt and follow the marker to find the Alessian soldier's camp. Sneak in if possible and find the papers beside a soldier. Take it and go back to the Direnni Camp. Find the commander and give him the Orders. The commander is pleased and says that they now can prepare a proper counterattack to the upcoming Alessian attack. He mentions that the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; King has just arrived and he is eager to get involved.\nHe surprised us all by coming here, but he's a brilliant tactician and his advice can only help. Meanwhile, the commander will send Alana and her unit to put an end to Faolchu. The Vestige can argue about that decision but the commander thinks Alana can handle it and they are needed to defend the camp. But speak to Alana before she goes and don't forget the King.\nHead over to Alana and she will reasure her husband she will handle Faolchu and come back again, then find the &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Ayleid King&lt;/a&gt;. He is surprised to find a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; fighting for the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; and that armor. He's heard stories about him: \"They say you fight as if &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; himself blessed you\".\nShow him the \"Alessian Orders\", and the King see that the Alessians plan to slip past the defenses and catch the Direnni with their trousers down? What a curious phrase. Use the Direnni magic of the armor to spot the covert Shadow Scouts before they can do any significant damage, then dispatch them quickly. Asking the King more questions will reveal the interest he has in the Knight.\nListen to the Commander's speech for the soldiers then head out to the battle field to find the Shadow Scouts. After it's all over and the last scout is defeated, a Direnni Scout approached and with his dying breath he said that Alana was ambushed at Faolchu's headquarters. Find Faolchu's lair to find out what happened. When outside the lair, &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Hanil\"&gt;Scout Hanil&lt;/a&gt; delivers a message that it was a trap, and Commander Parmion fought bravely, but they cut him down and took Alana."}

He has struck a deal with the invaders; if they win, he gets to keep his position in exchange for some gold. You can intimidate him into drinking your potion and leaving; if you do not, .

Your arrival will create a distraction that allows him to overwhelm his adversary; give him the potion and he will head off.\nOnce all the hostages have been freed, head to the lighthouse in the northwest of the sanctuary to signal the Dominion troops.

Once you enter the lighthouse, you will find that a struggle has taken place there; talk to Telonde and he will tell you what &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt; has been doing. Telonde and his compatriots were tortured, mutilated and often killed in furtherance of a ritual to bring &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt; back from the dead. Pelidil wanted Naemon to lead an army of the undead, but it did not work out; an evil spirit spoke through Naemon's body, spit in Pelidil's face and headed off. After relaying this information, Telonde will die. You should now head to the top level of the lighthouse and light the beacon.\nOnce the beacon is lit, head outside and to the entrance of the Sanctuary to speak with Major Cirenwe. She will tell you that Vicereeve Pelidil has fled to sea before they could take the sanctuary, and will task you with going after him. For this, you must seek out the help of Captain Jimila at the docks to the west. Jimila will be on her ship; speak with her to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Pelidil%27s%20End\"&gt;Pelidil's End&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

And trust me when I tell you of its danger, for my past observations have taken me to quite hazardous locales. I've studied the fearsome senche-tigers lurking with the green depths of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. I've followed tracks of the deadly &lt;a href=\"behemoth\"&gt;behemoth&lt;/a&gt; through the poison swamps of &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;. I've researched the horrid &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;frost trolls&lt;/a&gt; prowling the icy mists of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch's&lt;/a&gt; mountains. So believe me when I tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fabricants&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most dangerous creatures I have ever attempted to observe.\nA fabricant is unique to the biome of Clockwork City, and I thank &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; every day that they are not able to spread their evil throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. These unwholesome creatures of beast and machine stalk the plains and ravines of this counterfeit world's wasteland. They come in many gruesome variants, and all present dangers to the unwary traveler. And make no mistake, they will kill any intruder on sight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Verminous%20Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;verminous fabricant&lt;/a&gt; is unlike any creature I have seen before. It may be smaller than many monstrous beings in Tamriel, but it's also quick. This fast and agile creature attacks with metal claws resembling small scythes, and a pointed horn protrudes from its snout. Its lithe form means that it is able to follow you into smaller spaces, and trust me when I say that these creatures are relentless in their hunt.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nix-hound fabricant&lt;/a&gt; is far more familiar, though I still shudder when I feel its lifeless, glassy eyes upon me. It's covered in brass, its back leg replaced entirely with metal limbs. Its gouging snout now has the edge of a blade. Given time, this creature will build up energy to produce a scalding beam. I've seen flesh melt and mer die after being struck by it.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Beetle%20Fabricant\"&gt;beetle fabricant&lt;/a&gt; was obviously modeled after the &lt;a href=\"thunderbug\"&gt;thunderbug&lt;/a&gt;, though why &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; thought that this already dangerous creature needed metallic updates I'll never know. Each of its scuttling legs has been replaced by metal limbs, and its lightning attacks seem to have a greater force than I have ever seen in nature. Like its other counterparts, this creature is aggressive, and will attack on sight. All caution should be taken if you see this monster in the wild.\nViewing these amalgamations of natural and unnatural, one has to ask why these creatures were created. And created they were, by the Clockwork God himself. Why would Sotha Sil willingly choose to bring about such monsters into the existence of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;? My research has led me to believe that few are courageous enough to ask him.\nPerhaps they are simply an experiment gone wrong, or guards to protect his precious experiments. Whatever their reason for existence, fabricants remain a very real threat within the walls of this world-prison. I will continue to study their existence to best know how to avoid, escape, and perhaps even put an end to their miserable existence. I very much doubt the absentee Father of Mysteries will even notice my attempts to undo the madness he has wrought in his own city."}

His heart, torn from its primal aspects, was an empty pit.\nFrom the wild came a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; unlike any other. Her eyes were of fire, hair of wind and rain, and all who gazed upon her quaked in fear. All except the Silvenar.\nThough she bared her fangs, he did not shy away. Though she sought to lose him in the underbrush, the vines parted for him to follow. She growled, filled with confused desires, wishing both to stay, and to leave.\nIn a bright clearing, she faced the Silvenar, and ripped at him with claws and teeth. Though he fended off her blows, still his blood soaked into the grass and the flowers wept.

She will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Spinners\"&gt;Spinners&lt;/a&gt; here have changed the story of &lt;a href=\"The%20Silvenar\"&gt;The Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Lady\"&gt;The Green Lady&lt;/a&gt;, and that it must be changed back before it negatively affects the Bosmer people. \nShandi will take you to a man called Elilor. He will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Spinner%20Indraseth\"&gt;Spinner Indraseth&lt;/a&gt; is the only one who can begin or end the tale, but that she has been making the story more wild and dark lately. He will suggest that adding you to the story would give it a new interesting twist, and will suggest that you examine the handfast in front of you; Spinner Indraseth will not be able to resist beginning the story. Once you examine it, an apparition of Spinner Indraseth will appear behind you. If you choose to speak to Shandi and Elilor before you speak with Indraseth, they will encourage you to make sure the Silvenar and the Green Lady end up happy together once you are inside the story.\nEither way, speak with Indraseth. She will tell you her intentions of keeping the Silvenar and the Green Lady apart, and then depart for the Caverns of Valeguard, to the north. Shandi will tell you that since you have been let into the story, you can enter. Once inside, talk to the apparition of &lt;a href=\"The%20Hound\"&gt;Ulthorn the Hound&lt;/a&gt;; he will tell you that Spinner Indraseth is merely a puppet of his, and that the story is a vision of things to come, shaped according to his whim. Head deeper into the cave and you will find the Silvenar; speak with him and he will summon his plant allies to help you restore his tale. You will be confronted by several enemies; use the plants of the same colour as the enemies to dispel them. Once this is done, head even deeper into the cave, into the Heart of the Cavern. \nIn the Heart of the Cavern, you will find a man named &lt;a href=\"Farandor\"&gt;Farandor&lt;/a&gt; who will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Novel%20Idea\"&gt;A Novel Idea&lt;/a&gt;\"; that quest takes place in the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do them both simultaneously. Either way, head on and you will find Spinner Indraseth again, who has turned the Silvenar into a giant monster. Defeat the monster, and the apparition of Indraseth will disappear and the real Indraseth will show up. She has temporarily broken free from the control of the Hound, and will give you the essence of the Silvenar and ask you to head on and free the Green Lady from the tale. \nHead on into the Wilds of the Heart and you will find the Green Lady there; talk to her and she will say that the Hound is her consort, and that the story will see them together. She will then run off; follow her through the caves, and you will run into a &lt;a href=\"Strangler\"&gt;Strangler&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Vine\"&gt;Vine&lt;/a&gt; that can be talked to. It will tell you that it will clear the path ahead if you bring it the entrails of a &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;Thunderbug&lt;/a&gt;.

A long, long time ago, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; grew bored, which is a very dangerous thing to happen to a Daedric Prince of Madness. As is true of all the House of Troubles, he held no love in his heart, and so he did something very cruel. He took a mighty rock from the void that surrounds us, and flung it far, far, far toward &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Now Sheogorath didn't much care where this large rock would hit or what chaos it would cause. He simply wanted to see what it would do.\nWho was to stop this evil plan? Was it the Divines, in all their good and wisdom? No, for they can do no more than offer false hope and hollow faith. Perhaps the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, with their power and enchantments? But no, neither mer nor man could offer enough to get these pitiful Princes to face such a daunting challenge. And so it flew and flew and flew, and straight down it came to the most beautiful island in all of Nirn. It fell toward &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany wept and wailed as it approached. The &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; prayed to &lt;a href=\"Azura%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, who did nothing. Men and mer prayed to the Divines, who did nothing. But the Dark Elves, we prayed to the Three, to our ever glorious &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Living Gods&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; heard our prayers.\nHe raised his hand, calm and serene, glowing in his holy light. And the fall of the celestial rock became slower and slower and slower still. And all who wept and wailed stopped, for Baar Dau had finally come to its resting place. Safely there it hung in the air, above the spot where &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; would one day be built.\nNow you may ask, what wisdom was there in this? Why did not the great Vivec simply set this celestial rock softly down upon Nirn's verdant earth? But listen well, for there is a reason, as with all things the Three do. Every day our faith is tested by &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt;, and every day we show our love for Vivec and the Tribunal by keeping it aloft. Because it is our love, our devotion, our faith in the Tribunal that keeps it hovering above. It is proof of not only Vivec's might, but of the love of his followers.\nAnd so it forever hangs, a reminder to all. Together, now\u2014Praise Vivec! Praise the Three!"}

Some are in the bard's own hand, while others, mere shadows of the originals, remain only as bedtime tales for children. The structure exemplifies the helical form favoured by listeners about the hearth on a long winter's eve. As to whether they describe real events, be allegory, or be mere entertaining fancy, the reader must decide.\nKieran was on the road from &lt;a href=\"Wren\"&gt;Wren&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fairtree\"&gt;Fairtree&lt;/a&gt;, when he grew weary from the midday sun. His boots were tight and he thought to remove them for a bit in the shade of a nearby oak (oaks being a favourite of bards). This particular oak was venerable and gnarled, with sturdy branches that dipped and swooped, nearly touching the ground in spots. From its shade Kieran watched the forest creatures playing in the warm sun. But for the rustling of leaves, high above, the only sounds were of butterfly wings and birdsong.\n\"What a peaceful day,\" Kieran thought as he watched a butterfly drift by, \"What a beautiful day! In truth, since bards first told tales, has there ever been a day more peaceful and beautiful than this?\"\nHe drank from his waterskin and, taking his lute from its sack, cleared his throat and began to sing:\n\"Oh, the maidens of Wren are passing fair ... ...with breasts like melons, and flaxen hair ...\"\nHe had just taken a deep breath to bellow the lusty chorus when a small, feminine voice said, \"Kind sir ...\"\nHe leaped to his stockinged feet, his face flaming red. \"Who's there?\" he cried.\nThe small voice repeated, \"Please, sir, if you will be so kind ...\"\nKieran looked about but saw no person or creature addressing him.\n\"Pray thee,\" he cried. \"Show thyself or have cause to fear my dagger.\" (He tried desperately to remember where he had last seen it.) \"Whether thee be friend or foe, pray thee show thyself now.\"\nThe small voice replied from above him, \"Kind sir, thou hast no cause to fear me, and I am in need of help. Can thou find it in thy heart to aid me?\"\nHe looked up and saw naught but a small robin's nest, three branches above him. Climbing swiftly, he found a robin with three tiny robinlings, their mouths open wide.\n\"Good mother robin,\" he asked, \"Can it be thee who addresses me thus?\" \"Kind sir,\" she replied, \"I have hurt my wing and it will be at least a day before I might fly. If my children do not eat soon, they will die. Would you be so kind as to bring a fat, juicy meal? Would you find a caterpillar or earthworm or grub for my children?\"\nNow, Kieran was kind of heart and it was not within him to refuse a plea such as this, so off he went into the forest. Searching under some mulberry leaves, he soon found a small green caterpillar. It seemed a perfect meal for young robins.\nPlucking it from the leaf upon which it fed, he prepared to hurry back to the oak when he heard a tiny voice. He opened his hand and the caterpillar looked up at him with her big brown eyes wide with fear. \"Kind sir,\" she said, \"wouldst thou kill me so thoughtlessly?\"\nKieran scratched his head in puzzlement and the caterpillar continued: \"When thou cooled thy feet beneath the oak, didst thou not find joy in my parents' beauty as they danced before thee in the sun? I, too, am soon to change. Wouldst thou deny thy successors the joy of my dancing? And if I do not live to have children, how will thine own children find such joy? Please, sir, would not an earthworm serve the needs of the robinlings just as well? \nKieran looked into the eyes of the caterpillar and knew that he could not feed her to the robins. Carefully, he placed her beneath her mulberry bush and continued his search.\nNear a rushing brook, Kieran found a flat stone that, when moved, revealed a juicy earthworm enjoying the cool moist earth. \"Aha.\" he thought. \"As nice as the caterpillar may have been, this truly seems a more fitting meal for young robins.\"\nHe had no sooner plucked the earthworm from its cool abode (where it had been frantically trying to burrow away from him), when he heard a voice so faint he might have imagined it:\n\"Kind sir,\" he thought he heard, and Kieran looked in his hand. The worm continued: \"I am but a lowly creature, it's true, but might I plead such case that I have?\"\nKieran rolled his eyes skyward as the worm sat up and seized its chance. \"I am not a lowborn worm like others you might find. No, I am a prince among earthworms. I come from an ancient lineage. My ancestors burrowed the earth when fires belched from black pits throughout these lands. I command millions like myself. Were it not for my loyal followers, you, good sir, would be up to your neck in leaves, tree trunks and mouldy carcasses. I'll make a bargain with you. If you release me and choose, instead, a pathetic grub for the robinlings, I will dispatch an entire clan of earthworms to keep your foreyard clean and sweet-smelling for as long as ye shall live.\" The earthworm looked hopefully at Kieran (while calculating the distance to the ground). \"Good sir, what say ye?\"\nKieran was beginning to lose his patience, but, seeing the value of the earthworm's offer, decided that a grub would, indeed, make a tasty morsel for the young robins. He returned the earthworm to its moist haven and carefully replaced the flat stone above it. And, true to his desire, a short while later, in a forest glade, beneath a wide slab of discarded bark, Kieran chanced upon that which he sought: a fat white grub that would grow the robinlings into beautiful songsters. He plucked it from its hiding place and set forth. It was a beautiful day, indeed.\nNearby, in stately &lt;a href=\"Trowbridge\"&gt;Trowbridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Caladan\"&gt;King Caladan&lt;/a&gt; did live with his lovely daughter, &lt;a href=\"Einlea\"&gt;Einlea&lt;/a&gt;. The princess was the apple of the old man's eye and the crown jewel of his small kingdom. He looked upon her with the blind pride of a doting father, and she, for her part, did naught but bask and flourish in his bounty.\nTrowbridge was quiet now, the chief sounds being the clatter of cart wheels and the cries of street vendors, but it was not always so. Three years earlier there had been trouble with &lt;a href=\"Carthan\"&gt;Carthan&lt;/a&gt; to the west. It was not much, a border dispute, but the king persuaded a wizard named &lt;a href=\"Loziard\"&gt;Loziard&lt;/a&gt; to come to Trowbridge in his employ, to aid him in the contest. Loziard was unknown by all in Trowbridge and kept to himself within the palace, coming and going as he pleased. When Trowbridge prevailed, with almost no loss of life, there was joyous celebration for days and weeks thereafter. Time passed, yet Loziard remained. The King, not wanting to seem ungrateful, said nothing, but became increasingly discomforted with the wizard's presence and wished for his departure.\nOn Einlea's twentieth birthday, King Caladan called for a celebration and holiday through all his land. Unknown to his subjects, he intended to proclaim his retirement and the transference of his crown to his beautiful daughter. Out of politeness, and nothing more, he invited the wizard Loziard to aid him in devising a proper speech.\nLoziard was furious. He paced his chamber, his black brows knitted with intensity that would have soured any cow's milk. \"Why,\" he cried aloud, \"am I treated so unjustly by the old buffoon? Were it not for my skills, the border contest, mayhaps even the kingdom itself, might have been lost. I deserve more. I deserve the crown. To give it to that primping simpering daughter of his, who thinks naught of more than her own whim, is a slap more stinging than that of gauntlet. I will have justice. I will demonstrate, amply, for all to see, wherein lies true power.\"\nThereupon, Loziard made his preparations.\nPrincess Einlea's birthday came on a summer morning. Everyone within the city, and from the farms without, gathered to the palace for the festival. Banners waved from every rooftop. Fiddlers fiddled and dancers danced. Bakers baked wonderful sweets for the occasion. It was a day long to be remembered.\nAt noon, precisely, King Caladan and Princess Einlea emerged onto the main balcony to the cheers of the kingdom. \"Good citizens of Trowbridge,\" called the King, \"We are but a tiny kingdom, but we prosper, do we not?\"\nLoud hails (mostly) erupted from the crowd below. Encouraged, Caladan continued, \"But now I am an old man. The day has arrived when younger blood can better attend to the needs and events of the kingdom. My subjects ... My loyal subjects and friends ... It is with honour ...and pride ...and the greatest of expectations ...that I transfer my kingdom and my crown to my loving daughter. To one and all, I give you\" (a long pause here) \"Einlea.\"\nAs cheers filled the air, Caladan made a grand, sweeping gesture with his arm, intending to make the presentation as spectacular as the pride that filled him. His robe went \"swoooosh\" and his hand pointed to ... nobody. What was this? Where had she gone? Where Einlea had been, moments earlier, there now was naught but vacant air.\n\"Er ...Einlea ...?\" he called, uncertainly. But there was no response. Silence fell over park and courtyard. People glanced at each other nervously.\nOld Loziard clapped his hands in glee. He danced. He hugged himself with uncontained laughter. \"How wonderful ...\" he cried. \"What a breathtakingly stunning and talented a wizard I am..\" For what he had done, of course, was to rid himself of Einlea for once and for all. With one stroke, crafty and evil, he had removed the vain creature from the palace. Nought else remained between him and that which he desired.\nNow, magic is a tricky thing. Like all forces in the world, it must be kept in balance. As surely as day balances night and summer balances winter, so too must positive magic balance negative. For every hurtful or destructive spell, there must be an act of equal goodness or charity lest trouble overflow into the world. For every black wizard, there must be a white. For every spell of combat destruction, there must be healing. Know ye this ...if all who practice magic cast naught but healing or protective spells, dark, horrible forces would build up until chaos and ruin would burst forth and rain our doom down upon us. Thus may spells of healing be broken by harm, and the worst of spells be broken by charity.\nKnowing this, Loziard planned well his act of vengeance. To permanently rid himself of Einlea (short of killing her outright) he must devise a spell so cunning that no act of kindness would ever break it. He was pulling lice out of his long beard, late one evening, when he burst into laughter. He would make her into something ...disgusting.\n\"I will make her into a frog.\" he laughed, then frowned. No ... that had been done. People might expect it and go around, like mindless idiots, seeking frogs, hoping to earn a kings ransom. And then, a brilliant plan occurred to him.\n\"I will make her into a bug, an insect, a WORM ...\" He almost choked on his wine. \"Oh. How perfect.. I will make her into something so truly loathsome that she will spend the rest of her little bug life in terror of being squashed by the first person who sees her.\" He squealed and his rings jangled and his fat jiggled and he snorted wine out his nose in laughter. \"Oh, how absolutely delicious ...\"\nAnd that's exactly what he did. While King Caladan and his subjects scratched their heads in puzzlement, nobody saw a small fat white tree grub plop to the cobblestones beneath the main balcony and immediately curl up, glistening and quivering.\nEinlea was terrified. What had happened? Well, she had seen enough of Loziard's magic to know what had happened. But why? Why would he do this to her? She didn't have long to ponder the question. A huge black hound, hundreds of times her size, ran to the cobblestone where she lay, and almost gobbled her with one slurp of his tongue. From somewhere, she found the wherewithal to roll out of his way and into the crevice between the stones. His HUGE slurpy tongue followed her, drooling and panting great hurricanes of hot awful breath down at her. But just as the tongue was about to lick her into the waiting stomach, the hound's owner yanked his massive chain and pulled the beast toward home.\nIt is true that Einlea, in her life as a human, was self indulgent and not inclined to effort or resource, but that was merely because she had no need of either. In the following days, she had cause to discover plenty of both within her. After the incident with the hound, she knew she must go far away from people and dogs. And she knew what kinds of creatures dined on grubs, too. She slept out of sight under leaves, in places where grubs would not likely be sought.\nEven so, Einlea's days were filled with terror and adventure. There were circling hawks by day and owls by night. A bear, tearing at a rotting tree trunk, gobbled grubs, indistinguishable from Einlea, by the hundreds, as she watched in horror from behind a nearby rock. The smallest stream was now an enormous, gushing torrent, to be crossed in a nutshell under the greatest of peril. Einlea passed these tests, along with many others, and she passed them well.\nIt was on her tenth such day that a clumsy boot kicked aside the piece of bark under which she had sought shelter from the sun. Blinded by the sudden light, she heard an exclamation from high above. Then, before she could react, two fingers dropped from the sky and plucked her up and deposited her firmly inside a huge fist.\nTen days ago, Einlea would have been paralysed with terror. But that was ten days ago. Her mind raced. \"Who is this clumsy idiot, anyway??\" she thought, \"and what on earth does he want with a tree grub? At least he didn't squash me on the spot. That's encouraging, isn't it? So he must be here to rescue me..\"\nShe wriggled and squirmed in his fist until she could see his face, high above her, between two of his fingers. \"Ugh. A beard. If I'm going to be rescued, why can't it be by a fine young prince?\" But it then occurred to her that she was speaking from old habit. \"I wonder how many of those foppish boys could have survived these past ten days?\" She laughed, thinking of them. \"Not many, I bet. Those who wouldn't have curled up and died immediately would, by now, be whimpering and crying for their mothers.\" She looked at Kieran again. \"Well ... maybe he would look better if I wasn't looking straight up his nostrils. Ouch.. Why isn't he more careful with me??\"\nAnd then it occurred to Einlea that, if this oaf were truly rescuing her, he probably would have said something to her.\n\"Uh-oh.\" Einlea's heart raced and she started wriggling furiously, imagining the worst of all possible deaths. \"He must be going fishing.\"\nEinlea couldn't do much in her current state, but she could spit. And spit she did. In quantities unimaginable for so small a grub. She spit and spit and spit until her tiny grub mouth was too dry to spit another drop. She felt Kieran's hand squirming and thought, \"It's working..\"\nKieran was fair disgusted. Twas bad enough that he had to touch the slimy thing, but now it was oozing something and becoming truly revolting. Finally, just before he reached the robin's oak, he could take it no longer. He stopped and examined the creature in his hand. White and plump and glistening, it was, in truth, a repellent creature. Yet the poor thing was obviously terrified. It gazed up at him with what he imagined to be minuscule grub eyes, pleading. Kieran thought of the caterpillar and the earthworm, and his heart gave in. Heaving a great resigned sigh, he found a nice clean root and placed the grub upon it. And thus was Loziard's spell broken.\nNone could have been more astonished than Einlea when she unexpectedly grew to her former size, except, perhaps for Kieran, who nearly died of fright. He was no more than catching his breath when Einlea regained her wits. Raising her index finger, warning Kieran not to say even ONE word, Einlea snatched Kieran's coat to cover herself. Then, with fire in her eyes, and as much dignity as she could muster, she was off to Trowbridge, leaving Kieran to stare, open-mouthed, at her departing figure.\nEinlea knew she could not simply enter the city and confront Loziard. The moment he saw her, he would but cast another enchantment upon her. So, disguising herself as a shepherd, she found an abandoned house on the moors and began to make her plans. What happened next is a tale worth hearing. But it is a tale for another evening. Indeed, it is a tale to be told over many an evening, and many a good pot of ale.\nAnd what of the baby robins? Having no alternative, Kieran climbed the tree and took from his pack his last piece of fatty mutton. Tearing it into small shreds, he gave it to the grateful mother robin, who fed it to her family.\nUpon returning to the ground, Kieran looked first toward Fairtree, his former destination, then, grinning, set off after the most surprising young lady, for whom he now had many questions. \"Who knows ...\" he called back to the robins, \"It may be fate. And besides, I need my coat.\"\nHe was heard, late that evening, far down the road, singing:\n\"Oh, the maidens of Trowbridge are passing fair ... ...with breasts like melons, and flaxen hair ...\""}

I promised Lanarie I would find her son.\"\"\nQuick walkthrough.\nApraxic route:\nTalerion route:\nWalkthrough.\nIn order to start the quest, approach &lt;a href=\"Lanarie\"&gt;Lanarie&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Kinlady Avinisse's Mansion&lt;/a&gt; in northeastern &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt;. When spoken to, the following conversation will commence:\nLanarie will direct you toward &lt;a href=\"Talerion\"&gt;Talerion&lt;/a&gt; in the basement of the mansion opposite from where the quest was started. He can be found in the basement, looking at the \"Broken Passage\" to the &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20Waterworks\"&gt;Shimmerene Waterworks&lt;/a&gt;. When approached, the following conversation will begin:\nHead upstairs to the ground floor and enter the room with the door to Kinlady Avinisse's Garden. &lt;a href=\"Arathel%27s%20Map\"&gt;Arathel's Map&lt;/a&gt; may be found on an end table next to a chair sitting in front of the fireplace. When examined in the inventory, the map will have the following description:\nA faithful reproduction of Arathel's map. It clearly points to a location in Shimmerene.\nThe map appears to show an arch with hedges to either side. Past the arch is a statue on a pedestal, and in the very back of the image is a balcony overlooking the area. Buildings extending beyond the top of the map can be seen on either side.\nThe location the map shows is a secluded hedge maze near the &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20Dockworks\"&gt;Shimmerene Dockworks&lt;/a&gt;. Exit Kinlady Avinisse's Mansion, head down the steps and around the bend, and then bear right at the fork by &lt;a href=\"Orninlusea\"&gt;Orninlusea&lt;/a&gt;'s performance. Follow the road straight until reaching a branch of the stall &lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20Bazaar\"&gt;The Ruins Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Anchors%20Aweigh%20Inn\"&gt;Anchors Aweigh Inn&lt;/a&gt;.

It should be adjacent to a table which &lt;a href=\"Snabugha\"&gt;Snabugha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lairiwene\"&gt;Lairiwene&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quorarion\"&gt;Quorarion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elianne%20Alfena\"&gt;Elianne Alfena&lt;/a&gt; are surrounding.\nEnter the maze itself and turn right and follow the hedges. After a couple of turns, you will see a scroll lying on the ground. You need to read it. After that you will have two options to continue this quest: either tell Talerion about the contents of the letter or go to &lt;a href=\"Riharai\"&gt;Riharai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anchors%20Aweigh%20Inn\"&gt;Anchors Aweigh Inn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf spoken to Riaharai, she will send you to talk to the hooded man on the second floor of the Inn.

Eventually, you will get to the Mother's Den sublocation. There you will talk with the &lt;a href=\"Mother%20of%20Rats\"&gt;Mother of Rats&lt;/a&gt;:\nTo help find out where Mirulon helds Arethel, she will tell the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to search for &lt;a href=\"Zan%27hi\"&gt;Zan'hi&lt;/a&gt;, a Khajiit under command of the Mother of Rats who spies on Mirulon. Zan'hi will be located in the cavern in the southwestern part of the waterworks.\nWhen approached, the following conversation will take place between &lt;a href=\"Zan%27hi\"&gt;Zan'hi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hedani\"&gt;Hedani&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe Vestige has to talk to him:\nIt is revealed that Mirulon wants to bend Arathel's mind and make him kill the Sapiarch. The Vestige goes deeper into the caverns. When he approaches the Mirulon's chamber, the following conversation takes place between Arathel and Mirulon:\nAfter entering the chamber, Mirulon can be seen standing in the centre and Arathel running away.\nMirulon: \"So the rat queen sends her vermin to destroy me? Come then.\"\nAfter the battle, the &lt;a href=\"Mirulon%27s%20Letter\"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; should be retrieved nearby. Then the Vestige should proceed to the Aquaducts and talk to Arathel.\nArathel will then have to be escorted to the Mother's Den. At the time of the arrival, it is revealed that Talerion has found this location. A small conversation will take place:\nArathel: \"Mother!\"\nTalerion: \"Hold there, Arathel! By order of Divine Prosecution!\"\nEdgar Jend: \"Easy, guardsman. This boy is under our protection.\"\nMother of Rats: \"All of you, quiet! Have a word with our mutual friend, Talerion ... if you want the truth that is.\"\nSome of the characters present can also be talked to:\nAn evidence should be presented to Talerion:\n\"So ... it's you.

What are you doing here?\"\nAfter the evidence of his innocence is presented to &lt;a href=\"Talerion\"&gt;Talerion&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother of Rats will thank the Vestige for his actions:\nAfter the quest conversation:\nTalerion: \"Take notice, sewer-dwellers. I know where you are. Keep your affairs in order or our next encounter will be far less pleasant.\"\nLanarie: \"Thank you so much for finding Arathel.

Every &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;\u2014even every &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt;\u2014has its own tastes, styles, and unspoken rules. Since you've wisely chosen to purchase this book, you know fashion is more than just a pastime of the idle rich. Understanding which colors and styles mean what and who wears them can help you blend in, get better deals, or even save your life.\nFirst, the obvious: if you're traveling in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the tumultuous time of this writing, be careful what you wear! Only don the colors of one of the warring alliances if you know for sure the status of your destination\u2014towns and keeps change hands so frequently. Why, once I was porting a cart of fine casks of &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Madeira\"&gt;Dream Madeira&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Alessia\"&gt;Castle Alessia&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sejanus%20Outpost\"&gt;Sejanus Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, knowing the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; forces there would appreciate (and pay well for) a good &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Online%29\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;, but by the time I arrived, they'd been driven out by the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Already in view of the outpost, I knew I'd been spotted in my brilliant yellow tabard, so I made no move to flee when a band of Pact soldiers began to approach. Luckily for me, the rowdy &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who led the assault were in a festive mood, and though they commandeered the wine, they let me leave with my life.\nYou can tell quite a bit about someone by what they wear, of course. The more you know about a potential customer, the better, so pay close attention and you'll get better deals and have an idea of what someone might be looking for. Did you know that master &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;anglers&lt;/a&gt; favor pinkish-purple tones? I've been told they wear them because the &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; are unable to see that particular shade, making the fishers practically invisible to poor, tasty creatures. Prominent &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; wear an earthy grey tone supposedly made of a secret &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; concoction that protects the cloth from stains, and high-ranking &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; members wear an unmistakable dusky blue. If you know who you're dealing with, you know what to sell them!\nAnother good tip is to keep your eyes open for colors and styles you haven't seen before. If you find someone wearing a bold, iridescent color and ornate armor or dress, find an excuse to talk to them. Anyone who stands out has a great story to tell at the very least, so buy them a drink or entice them with your rarest goods. I once met a dangerous-looking &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; clothed head to toe in a shining bronze color I'd never seen. After some friendly banter and a few mugs of &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Sweetmilk\"&gt;aged sweetmilk&lt;/a&gt;, he gave up the locations of several dangerous ruins chock-full of &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; relics he couldn't carry out. Quite profitable, if you have the right connections.\nSo there you have it: fashion matters. Pay attention to local customs and dress as you travel, learn who wears what, and profit! There's much more to learn beyond my advice here, but you've got a good start now. Keep your eyes open, wear the right thing, and seek out the bold and you'll improve your margins substantially!"}

Another dabbler in the mystic arts. I'm certain she is barely mediocre.\"\n\"You shut up! I read the scroll. I get to tell you what to do.\"\nThe dremora was silent. Compulsion bound his voice.\n\"I want to know how to make a magic dress. I need it for her birthday.\"\nThe dremora's answer was more silence.\n\"You have to tell me. It's in the rules.\"\nFreed from the previous compulsion, the dremora answered, \"First, you need a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;. I happen to have one, and would gladly give it you for so noble a cause.\"\n\"Really? Why do I need it?\"\nWith a hidden smile, the dremora handed over the dull &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;black gem&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"It is not enough to cast a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; upon an inert object. Magic requires thought, intent, will and emotion. The soul powers the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. The bigger the soul, the more powerful the enchantment.\"\n\"So how big is the one in this soul gem?\"\n\"Oh, that one is empty. You'll have to fill it. But it can hold the largest of souls easily. Do you know how to do that?\"\n\"No,\" the young man said sullenly.\n\"Let me show you. You cast a spell like this.\"\nThe tendrils of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul trap spell&lt;/a&gt; spilled from his fingers and surrounded the boy. The young man's eyes went wide.\n\"I didn't feel anything,\" he complained.\n\"How about now?\" the dremora asked, plunging his talons into the youth's rib cage. His heart beat only once before it was pulled from his chest.\nQuickly the dremora snatched back the black soul gem, just as the youth died. His soul tried to flee, but was trapped by the spell and drawn into the gem. Only black soul gems can hold the souls of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Your mother obviously never told you never to accept a freely given gift from a summoned dremora,\" he said to the corpse. \"You see, it breaks the &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, freeing the summoned from the summoner. Now, let's go find your mother. After all, I have another black soul gem.\""}

Something seems to be inside.&gt;\"\nWhen approaching &lt;a href=\"Pa%27alat\"&gt;Pa'alat&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a bottle balanced on a dagger stuck to a tree. The bottle will contain a note; read the note and it will tell you, \"The eagle's eyes watch the main road into this den of inquisity.\" It will tell you to meet someone there to help the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; see the truth.\nHead to the southeast of the area, near the road. You will find &lt;a href=\"Cariel\"&gt;Cariel&lt;/a&gt; there; speak with her and she will tell you what is going on. In the town here, there is a former Eye of the Queen who is suspected of going rogue and selling Dominion secrets to the other alliances. Cariel will put on a disguise and lead you into town; speak with her again once inside and she will tell you to search the quarters of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; soldiers for evidence of correspondence. They have two guards posted, &lt;a href=\"Legionnaire%20Andwulf\"&gt;Legionnaire Andwulf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Irvina\"&gt;Scout Irvina&lt;/a&gt;, but Cariel will tell you how to deal with them. Andwulf is easily intimidated and Irvina can be distracted by the men of leisure around the camp. You only have to get rid of one of them to get in. Once inside the lodge, start looking for evidence.\nThe evidence you are looking for is in the chest on the left side of the room. It will indicate that the Pact is facilitating &lt;a href=\"Krin%20Ren-dro\"&gt;Krin Ren-dro&lt;/a&gt;'s undercover visit to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. With this evidence in hand, return to Cariel. She will tell you how to get into the Daggerfall Covenant lodge. The two guards outside the lodge are &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Quinton\"&gt;Scout Quinton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Seyran\"&gt;Scout Seyran&lt;/a&gt;. Scout Quinton will let you in if you tell him you are there to meet the captain's sexual needs, and Scout Seyran will abandon her post if you persuade her there is a keg of booze you're hiding nearby. Once in the lodge, you will find the evidence you need in the chest by the bed. Bring all the evidence to Cariel in the center of town and she will tell you what should be done next.\nThe next step is to steal back any Dominion documents Ren-dro may have stolen. His manse is crawling with guards though, so you need to cause a distraction. Head into the guard camp to the north and set the crates there on fire. This will cause the guards there to turn hostile, so you will have to dispose of them. Once four of the crate piles are on fire, head into Krin Ren-dro's Mansion with Cariel and start searching. You will find what you want on the top floor, on the table on the southwest side. It is a note called \"&lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Intelligence%20Topsheet\"&gt;Dominion Intelligence Topsheet&lt;/a&gt;\". Once you have found it, Cariel will tell you she found something on the backside of the mansion; meet her there and she will show you the hatch to a secret lair. Head inside and fight your way to the other side of the cave.\nThere, you will find Ren-dro together with &lt;a href=\"General%20Cassel\"&gt;General Cassel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Bathes-In-Blood\"&gt;General Bathes-In-Blood&lt;/a&gt; from the Daggerfall Covenant and Ebonheart Pact, respectively. Kill all three, then leave the cave and talk to Cariel to finish the quest."}

He will tell you that this is the location of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;'s last stand against the Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, and that his ghost still haunts the place. Cantier intends to find out why Ranser's ghost is still here, but he needs your help to get past the undead that infest these ruins. \nHead up the stairs and into the Traitor's Tor. Your target is the big tower in the center of the area. You will find a skull here; Cantier will theorize that it belongs to Ranser himself. Examine the skull and you will hear a voice in your head; the skull is not Ranser's; it is the skull of his betrayer. You will be taken into the past to experience for yourself what happened that day. Head outside and speak with &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt; there. He will tell you that Ranser's forces are losing the battle, and that the only possible path to victory is some sort of magic that &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt; gave him. He will ask you to place magical powder in the braziers in each of the four towers, not counting the central tower. The powder will make the flames turn blue; once you have put it in all four braziers, head back to the central tower and speak with King Ranser himself. He will be up one flight of stairs. \nThe king will tell you that he intends to attack the orcs through the breach in the north wall. He will tell you to go and inform General Dathieu about this plan; the general will still be by the tower's entrance. Dathieu will upon hearing this foolish plan tell you that he would rather betray his king than send more people to their deaths pointlessly; he will ask you to seek out &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Taern\"&gt;Captain Taern&lt;/a&gt; and tell her to stand down and not execute the King's orders. He will tell you that if you cannot persuade Taern and the rest of the king's guard to stand down, it might be best to use a sleep scroll. \nThe sleep scroll will be in a damaged chest in the northeast of the fort. Note that once you have it, you can no longer talk to Taern and attempt to talk her out of it. If you choose to talk to Taern first, . If you're going with the sleep scroll, you will find Captain Taern between the scroll's location and the central tower. Use the scroll, then head for the north tower to witness a confrontation between Ranser and Dathieu. Ranser will not listen to reason, so Dathieu kills him, but Ranser immediately comes back as a skeleton because of Reezal-Jul's magic. Said magic will cause all of the soldiers here to live forever, though Dathieu's bones will be scattered as punishment for his treason.\nAfter witnessing this, you will wake up in modern times next to Scholar Cantier. Tell him what happened, and he will tell you it is probably a good idea to collect the general's bones from across the ruins, in an effort to break the curse on this place. Grab the skull, then head out and collect the rest of the bones from around the area. One set will be to the southwest, behind a piece of wall. You will find another pile of bones near the entrance to these ruins; again behind a wall. Finally, the third pile will be in the southeast. Once you have collected all of the bones, Dathieu will rise and tell you to meet him where he slew the king. Head there, and you will see Datrieu confront King Ranser again.

There is a winding path up the mountain from where you found Radrase. There, you will find an injured woman named &lt;a href=\"Veldrana\"&gt;Veldrana&lt;/a&gt;. She is dying of the cold, and will ask you to bring some kindling to keep her warm. There is some kindling by a tree up the path to the north, collect it, then return to Veldrana to light a fire with it. When you have done this, talk to Veldrana again. She will tell you that the worm cult were doing something on the mountain, but they were scared off by something in the ruins. They left their leader and ran off. \nHead further up the path to the ruins. You will find a tower with a ladder in it that will take you further up. Up here, you will take constant damage when not near a campfire, so take care. You will find the body of the cult leader at the first campfire, along with his grimoire. It will describe a necromantic ritual for which you need to collect a number of ingredients: an animal hide, some crushed Nightshade and an Animus Geode. These things can all be found around the area. Take care that you light the campfires along the way, so as to not constantly take damage from the cold. \n\"&lt;The shredded corpse of Nordahl. His injuries don't appear to be from sabre cat claws. If anything, they seem to have been made by human fingernails.&gt;\"\nThe Crushed Nightshade will be by the first campfire site you come upon after reading the diary. it will be in a burlap sack behind some crates. The animal hide will be in the southwest of the area, and the Animus Geode will be in a tent to the center. The Animus Geode is the only one that is not near a campfire site, so take care not to freeze to death while collecting it. Once you have all three, head to the ritual site in the southeast to perform the ritual. The ritual site is unaffected by the cold, so there is no need to worry about that there. Light the candles there in a specific order: East, West, North, South. Then place the nightshade in the bowl and the animal hide in the mound, and use the Animus Geode. This will summon and bind the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Nordahl\"&gt;Nordahl&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the worm cultists here. \nTalk to Nordahl and he will tell you that he and his men were slaughtered by the draugr, who also took the fragment of Wuuthrad with them. The draugr sealed the entrance to the ruins again after killing the worm cultists, so you will have to find a way to unseal it. Examine the ancient carvings on the western wall of the area to uncover clues for the puzzle. The area immediately next to the carvings is unaffected by the cold, but you will still have to take care on your way there. Ince you have collected the clues, head to the entrance to the temple and solve the riddle. The riddle revolves around activating the runestones to change the runes on them. The solution is as follows: The stone to the right of the entrance must be an eagle, the center stone should be a snake and the left stone should be a whale. Once you have solved the puzzle, head into the temple. \nHead through the temple to the other end. You will be facing hordes of draugr here, so take care. On your way, make sure to pick up the copy of &lt;a href=\"Myths%20of%20Sheogorath%2C%20Volume%201\"&gt;Myths of Sheogorath, Volume 1&lt;/a&gt;, located in the western room, left of the stairs behind a bookcase. Once you have reached the other end, head through the door to the peak. Here, you will once again be plagued by the cold and you will have to light campfires. There is a skyshard in the south of this area, so make sure to collect it. Once you have it, go to the central table in the area and use it to summon the dragon priest &lt;a href=\"Vosis\"&gt;Vosis&lt;/a&gt; and kill him. This battle will be a lot easier if you keep the campfires around the table lit, so that you will not take constant damage from the cold. Once Vosis is dead, the shard of Wuuthrad will appear on the altar. Take it and return to where you found Veldrana. \nSpeak with &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Andrin\"&gt;Centurion Andrin&lt;/a&gt; to finish the quest."}

The Dominion has no territorial rights in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. If the Altmer do not return to Summerset, their invading armies will be destroyed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; have traded with our &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms for ages, but they've made a mistake in allying themselves with the perfidious &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of Summerset. Though we of the Covenant wish them no ill will, if they maintain their alliance with the Dominion, they will suffer the same fate at our hands as the High Elves. They must reconsider, or they must face our wrath."}

Either walk onto the ship and fight with the pirates onboard or sneak past them until reaching the Captain's cabin, or use other methods to get on board.\nAlternative methods to enter.\nOne method of entrance is to get on the stone path west of the ship where there are a bunch of crates lined up. The pirates are loading all of these boxes onto the ship. Walk up to the northernmost crate and the player will be asked if they want to hide in the crate. Do so and they will be loaded inside the ship.\nThe second method of entrance to the captain's cabin is to jump from the dock onto the balcony of the ship and pick the lock, which could prove difficult for a low level Hero lacking in a high security score, as the lock is fixed at the very hard level. If the Hero is able to pick the lock, the best way to fight the captain is to run out the rear door once he begins to fight them and swim to shore. The captain will just pace back and forth on the rear deck and the Hero can shoot arrows with impunity.\nA third way of entrance is to hide inside the crate, then go up a level. Wait for the pirates to finish their conversation. When they finish, go quickly back to where the Hero entered the ship and go as far back as possible (a detect life spell helps here) and wait for the pirates to pass. Go down the hall where they were talking, and to the left is a small alcove with a ladder. Take this ladder up directly to the captain's cabin. Either wait until around 10pm when the captain goes to sleep and sneak attack him, or enter and attack him.\nA fourth method is to provoke the pirates on the deck by taking items from the crates, or simply walking/jumping onto the ship. Eventually, they will attack but the city guards will dispatch them with ease. Then, wait to enter the captain's cabin at night or early morning. The Hero can pickpocket the sleeping captain, take his key and desired gold, loot his chest, and kill him.\nA fifth method is to buy a &lt;a href=\"poisoned%20apple\"&gt;poisoned apple&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"M%27raaj-Dar\"&gt;M'raaj-Dar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Leap on to the balcony on the back end of the ship and unlock the door. If this is done at night the captain will be asleep. Take all food in the room, including from containers, then reverse pickpocket the captain and place the apple in his inventory. Once the captain wakes up and eats the apple, it will kill him without alerting anyone.\nCaptain Murder.\nWhen the captain has been eliminated, two pirates will come down to check on the captain. The Hero may either kill the pirates or hide from them until they leave. If the Hero immediately leaves the room when the pirates knock on the door, the pirates can be avoided altogether. After they're dead or gone, search the captain's body for the key to his &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. In his chest there are some gems and .\nWhen confronted by the pirates, if the Hero runs out on deck and onto the waterfront, the city guards will assist in killing the pirates.\nIf it is not desirable to fight the crew members, hide at the opposite side of the trapdoor that leads to the outside of the cabin (the two pirates that enter will face towards the trapdoor) thus once they enter, quickly leave and there will be no need to battle. Another method is to use the captain's key to unlock the exit door to the stern and jump into the waters.\nExit the Marie Elena and travel back to Vicente Valtieri to report the success and to receive the reward, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Band\"&gt;Black Band&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was not the curse that plagued me, but the narrow-mindedness of these provincial men and women.\n\"I was afraid to hunt, so I was always hungry, and the hunger turned me feral. It was in this state that I came across them. A family of innocent farmers, just like the innocent farmers that had hounded me from village after village. My vision turned red and I flew into a fury.\n\"At last my hunger was satisfied.\n\"But when the rage subsided and I looked on what I'd done, my stomach turned. This was what all those villagers were afraid of, when they tormented me with their torches and sickles.\n\"That's when I acknowledged my curse for what it was. I have hunted many years since, afraid to turn myself in, but disgusted with my base impulses.\n\"You don't realize what a great favor you have done, capturing me.\"\nAnd then having told his story, the creature, looking very much like a man, begged me to put him out of his misery."}

I remember enough to keep searching through an ocean of tears, raised to astronomical depths. My dreams offer solace, where I return to distant, faded times. Through trees entwined with cool autumn air, my sorrow is lured by fragrant, bittersweet memories. I am at home as much as my world and consciousness allow. I remember falling into the most beautiful lake I've ever experienced. She swallowed me whole, like a droplet, and I was enraptured and enwombed within her bliss. The lonely windswept desert sky of my soul was filled by her luminous stars and warmed by her sunlit radiance. I gazed downward in awe and saw it all reflected in the shimmering ripples dancing and playing about the surface. It appeared to me as real as the very wonders it was reflecting. I stepped forward to prove to no one and everyone that they were, by belief. For an aching instant I was betwixt the two and the summation. Confusion befell me and I fell through, only to realize I hadn't entered the lake, I had left it.

I began to know the deadpan search for freedom and forgetfulness, and I released the hold on my life. Though it still lurched, pained, in front of me, I just stared back with tired, vacant eyes as if watching the most fascinating of nothing. My mind drifted, only to be slammed back reluctantly, repeatedly, and painfully by those I vaguely remember knowing, as if from a different life and age. I try, in vain, to forgive and forget myself as I paste on those plaster smiles and strain to look levelly. I remember. I forget. I forget again. I remember less. I am saddened at the thought that I have forgotten. I am not who I used to be. Though it pained me so, I was never so real as those lonely, lost times of my undoing. I am torn asunder at the thought of losing forever that, which has changed my life eternally, and that which I fear in the depths of my soul will never be again. That, which has gifted me with more pain than I have ever known in all of my lives or all of the lives that I know through my own.\nWho am I to ask this of you?"}

The establishment of an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; governor in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, however, signals a new era for the Reach and its peoples. The scholars and travelers of Tamriel can finally venture into the Reach and perhaps come to understand the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; and their ways.\nWith that goal in mind, I undertook the journey to Markarth in the spring of &lt;a href=\"2E%20560\"&gt;2E 560&lt;/a&gt;, carrying a letter of introduction from &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Moricar\"&gt;Emperor Moricar&lt;/a&gt;. Governor &lt;a href=\"Caddach\"&gt;Caddach&lt;/a&gt; (not without misgivings) helped me obtain a guide\u2014a young warrior named &lt;a href=\"Duinal\"&gt;Duinal&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to introduce me to the &lt;a href=\"Eagleseers\"&gt;Eagleseers&lt;/a&gt;, one of the friendlier Reach clans. Five days' travel brought us to the Eagleseers' dhun (a fortified hilltop village, common in the hinterlands). Duinal explained my mission, and I was received by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Darragh\"&gt;Chief Darragh&lt;/a&gt; and his close adviser, the witch &lt;a href=\"Aislin\"&gt;Aislin&lt;/a&gt;. At first, Darragh seemed puzzled by my intentions, and Aislin frankly regarded me with contempt. I believe the only reason they permitted me to stay was that Darragh thought it might be useful to have Caddach owe him a small favor.\nWe arrived in early spring and found preparations underway for a ceremonial hunt. The first of the season, it seemed. The clan's food stores were low after a long winter, but the snow was finally melting and a large party of hunters was making ready to leave. The night before the hunters set out, the clan gathered for a ceremony seeking &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s favor. Wild dances represented the chase and the kill, a rather violent spectacle that I found unsettling\u2014invoking a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; for any reason seemed reckless to me. Aislin and her sisters presided over the whole affair. At the height of the ceremony, she commanded clan warriors to take me away. The secret rites that followed were evidently not for the eyes of an outsider. I never did learn anything more about it.\nThe ceremony (whatever it was) evidently met with Hircine's approval, for the hunt went well. I remained with the Eagleseers for two weeks after the hunters returned, observing their lifestyle. They are a bawdy, plain-spoken people, and some of them went out of their way to see if they could intimidate or shock me. However, the fact that I was under Chief Darragh's protection seemed to shield me from the worst of that sort of thing. With my stocks of paper and ink running low\u2014and conscious of the fact that I did not wish to wear out my welcome\u2014I offered gifts of some small trinkets I brought with me, said farewell, and made my way back to Markarth.\nWhen I returned to the Eagleseers in midsummer, I was surprised to find the clan's dhun half-empty. I learned that they had moved their flocks to the high pastures and many of their folk had established temporary camps to watch over their valuable livestock. Reachfolk do not steal from other Reachfolk unless the clans are feuding, but the mountains are home to &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, and other dangerous beasts, so the flocks must be constantly guarded. Other Eagleseers had left to set up fishing camps along nearby rivers, or had gone to Markarth to trade. It was a busy time, yet different from my previous visits.\nMy third visit in the fall showed me yet another aspect of clan life. Like most Reach clans, the Eagleseers sow no fields and look forward to no autumn harvest. They do, however, gather wild roots and berries, preparing for the winter to come. Smokehouses were full of meat being preserved, as this is the time of year when the Eagleseers cull their herds, slaughtering the livestock they need to sustain themselves through the cold months. I brought many useful gifts from Markarth this time\u2014knives, blankets, and such\u2014and made a point of joining in the clan's work at every opportunity. The Eagleseers seemed to be growing accustomed to my presence.\nFour months later, I returned in midwinter, a difficult and dangerous journey in the snow. I was anxious to see how my friends among the Eagleseers\u2014for by now I had a few\u2014were getting along. Winter, I had learned, is the season for crafting tools, clothes, and toys. Hunters try their luck as weather and game permit, but most people survive on the food they were able to store away in summer and fall. To my dismay, I found the Eagleseers grieving and furious.\nThree days before my return, warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Six-Fords\"&gt;Six-Fords&lt;/a&gt; clan had waylaid an Eagleseer hunting party and killed Chief Darragh. Apparently the Six-Fords and Eagleseers have been engaged in a feud for years over some old insult. The two clans pursue their quarrel in fits and starts, but winter is the season for feuding and raiding. Aislin openly blamed me for Darragh's death: the old chief's welcome of a soft outlander had angered the hard &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; of the Reach, and they had shown their displeasure. I left shortly thereafter, feeling unsafe among the clan.\nRegardless, I learned much during my year with the Eagleseer clan."}

Arrogant. Self-important. All these words and more can be used to describe the self-styled merchant lords of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. The four mercantile houses began to take shape about one-hundred-and-sixty years ago. They began as legitimate businesses, working to elevate Abah's Landing and create a center for trade and commerce between &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt; has never been cooperative to those who tried to carve civilization out of the wilderness and, despite their best efforts, each mercantile house slowly became more corrupt as the pursuit of illegal profits quickly outdistanced more above-board enterprises.\nThe four houses emerged as the at-Addin Syndicate, House Vien, the Thazahrr Cartel, and Gurges and Associates. In time, the lords of these four houses controlled almost all of the commerce and gold flowing through the port city\u2014both legitimate trade and illicit activities. Most of their profits came from smuggling, slavery, and other unlawful transactions. The merchant lords supplied Abah's Landing with goods and services while also establishing lucrative (if modest) trading partnerships in distant lands. As fortunes grew in Abah's Landing, it wasn't long before other groups began to take an interest in the area. This began a long and tumultuous relationship between the merchant lords and local criminals and crime bosses. Indeed, rumors of a \"hidden\" merchant house even began to circulate, and evidence abounds of a covert war being fought among the houses and the so-called \"hidden house.\" While I have not been able to uncover any details concerning this conflict, the outcome can clearly be seen. Gurges and Associates was shattered and the other three houses were reduced to pale shadows of their former glory as a clandestine power emerged as the controlling interest in the port city.\nFor the last fifteen years or so, the merchant houses took a step back. Oh, they continued to engage in business and provide funds to support city services, including guards and infrastructure, but they no longer showed the swagger and bravado that exemplified their behavior for the decades prior to that time. Though no mayor or merchant house or secret guild took center stage, it appears evident to me that someone or something has influenced Abah's Landing from the deepest shadows. For this reason, I urge caution when dealing with Hew's Bane.\nIn my next report, I'll begin to provide background on each of the prominent merchant houses operating in the area."}

Founded by Afshuur at-Addin, a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; male known for both his physical prowess and his disarming charm, the Syndicate grew and flourished for almost one-hundred-and-twenty years. The enterprising Afshuur started out as a simple arms dealer, buying, selling, and trading Redguard swords, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; axes, and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; bows. His first customers were the pirates and privateers that used Abah's Landing as a port of call on their trips to more prominent locations, but it wasn't long before he was making shipping deals with those very same vessels and their crews.\nAs time passed, the Syndicate added armor and shields to its inventory, seeking to provide a one-stop shopping destination for anyone in need of protection or those interested in sailing into battle. Pirate crews, mercenary bands, and even privateers in service to one flag or another were clamoring for armor and weapons with the Syndicate seal of quality and assurance. These connections led to another lucrative profit line\u2014the Syndicate began serving as a broker for mercenary contracts.\nThe current leader of the Syndicate, Orahan at-Addin, rules the business with an iron fist. Ruthless and brilliant, the Redguard male treats every negotiation as a battle, every competition as a war. In fact, war has become at-Addin's primary avenue of trade, which allows him to keep the family enterprise profitable even in the wake of the unrevealed calamity that befell each of the merchant houses recently. As my queen is well aware, the machinations of the unknown party I have dubbed \"the hidden house\" continue to be evident while also continuing to elude me. I will have answers, I just don't know when I will have them.\nOrahan at-Addin deals in arms and armaments, mercenary contracts, and smuggling supplies to all sides of any given conflict. He has no trouble selling weapons to the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, armor to the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and vital supplies to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014as long as each side has the gold to pay for his services. With the sudden absence of the power that had held the merchant houses in check and had even weakened them with a masterful yet secret attack, the Syndicate has begun to make moves to put it back into a position of power in Abah's Landing.\nRegardless of other concerns, I recommend caution when dealing with Orahan and his family. But make no mistake, you will have to deal with them if you plan to make a move on Hew's Bane and Abah's Landing."}

A den of vice and corruption such as &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; requires a master to feed its needs. Or, in this case, a mistress. Enter Lady Felice Vien, who arrived in Abah's Landing from &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; with her dignity, a cask full of gold, and the intention to make a place for herself amid the debauchery and depravity of the port city. Very little information concerning the circumstances of her arrival still exists, but I was able to determine it had something to do with her late husband, a prominent noble in Wayrest, and her alleged role in his death.\nWhatever the situation that sent her to Abah's Landing, Lady Felice wasted no time purchasing property and establishing the Winsome Welwa, a tavern and inn that soon became the talk of the port. What started as a humble eatery and fest hall began offering other entertainments, entertainments of the less than legal kind. Lady Felice saw that the people moving through Abah's Landing had particular vices, and she knew that there was gold to be made if she could satisfy their needs.\nToday, House Vien handles the more intimate and discreet demands of Abah's Landing, including illicit substances, prostitution, and other vices. The Winsome Welwa, modeled after the infamous Chaste Harpy in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, serves as a brothel and the base of operations for the current head of the house, Lady Ylanie Montaine. Despite the calamity that befell all of the merchant houses, she continues to make a modest profit administering to the illicit needs of pirates, merchant crews, and visiting nobles looking for a bit of adventure. All of the house's trade is focused on Abah's Landing, all under the Lady's discerning eye. She presents a proper, genteel countenance when she strolls the city streets and meets with clients and vacationing dignitaries, but she has a violent, even murderous, temper\u2014though few who have the misfortune to see that side of her live to tell the tale.\nSecrets are as much Lady Ylanie's stock and trade as are sex and drugs. She might prove to be a powerful ally in your ambitions, provided you never turn your back on her or partake in any of her tempting pleasures."}

Significant not only for its unusual leader, but for the type of business she decided to trade in. The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who called herself Thazahrr-ra formed the Thazahrr Cartel to handle the despicable but necessary slave trading moving through the port city. The powerful Thazahrr-ra, one of only a few women in Khajiit history to take the male honorific \"ra\" as her own, formed a cartel that included &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, and a few Khajiit.\nHow could a Khajiit run a slavery cartel? Quite handily, it turns out. The legend of Thazahrr-ra grew as fast as the fortunes of the Cartel, describing a woman who would sell her own children if the profit was high enough. In addition to processing &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and Khajiit slaves on their way to distant lands, the Cartel expanded into the areas of smuggling and buying and selling information. Make no mistake: Being willing to sell your own people makes the Cartel extremely dangerous, as many of their competitors discovered over the years.\nToday, Thazahrr Goldfang, the sixth Khajiit woman to take the name and title of merchant lord of the Thazahrr Cartel, oversees the house's business. She appears restless and unhappy with the state of the houses in Abah's Landing, and with the state of her business in general. Whatever occurred to hinder all of the merchant houses seems to have hit the Cartel harder than most. She longs to return her organization to the position of power and prestige it enjoyed in the days before the activities of the \"hidden house\" so that she can claim the same honorific as her esteemed ancestor.\nThazahrr Goldfang bubbles over with anger and ambition. She feels that Abah's Landing owes her a level of wealth and respect that, frankly, it has no intention of awarding her with. For this reason, she remains frustrated, anxious, and more than a little dangerous. My recommendation? Do not approach the Khajiit slave trader. Not even with a ten-foot pole."}

It came to prominence during the rise of the merchant lords of &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Isobel%20Gurges\"&gt;Isobel Gurges&lt;/a&gt; - known as the Regal Pirate of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abacean&lt;/a&gt; - retired from raiding and pillaging to form a more or less legitimate business.\nOf course, legitimate business means something very different in a place like Abah's Landing. Isobel began by making loans with exorbitant interest rates, but it wasn't long before she took Gurges and Associates into gambling, fencing, laundering, and highjacking (where she had her crews steal cargo from merchant vessels so they could sell it back to those same merchants for an immediate profit).\nWhen the merchant house crisis rocked Abah's Landing fifteen years prior, Gurges and Associates was nearly bankrupted. The tumult since, as well as events leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, all but spelled the doom of the merchant house. Today, the Gurges family has only a handful of blood members and vassals, leaving its current patriarch, &lt;a href=\"Martinus%20Gurges\"&gt;Martinus Gurges&lt;/a&gt;, a bitter and jealous man. He has plans, however. Plants to rebuild his company, reclaim his fortune and holdings, and once again make the Gurges name something to be honored and respected, if not feared, in Abah's Landing. He has a long way to go to make his dream come true.\n(NOTE: These dispatches were \"recovered\" from a Taneth vessel and delivered to an interested party in Abah's Landing. I have published them so we may all know what our cousins across the bay think of us."}

Everything it contains is little more than theory and conjecture. I have no proof, you see. No facts to hang before you. All that said, I decided that you had a right to know my thinking on this subject. Better safe than sorry, as the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; are wont to say.\nI've suggested in my previous reports that there was another group or organization hindering and even actively attacking the merchant houses of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. I've referred to this as the \"hidden house,\" but I have a better name: &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20Conglomerate\"&gt;The Shadow Conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;. Like the vast chasm in front of you in the middle of the night, you can feel the Shadow Conglomerate's presence looming in the darkness, even though you can't see it.\nWhat is the Shadow Conglomerate? I really don't know. Every avenue I approach that promises to reveal the truth of the organization instead sends me running in a dozen different directions, searching for the next clue that always seemed to be at least one step out of reach. Here's what I do know. I believe that the Shadow Conglomerate was formed about forty years ago, suddenly coming on the scene to challenge the merchant lords after a century of only having to deal with themselves. Within twenty-five years, the Shadow Conglomerate has risen to a place of prominence that allowed it to actually cause the merchant houses to step back and concede a portion of their power and influence to this new and secret organization.\nI believe a battle of some sort took place in the deepest shadows. In the battle, the hidden house emerges victorious while the public-facing merchant houses were grievously wounded and forced off the pedestals they had raised themselves upon, the worse casualty was &lt;a href=\"Gurges%20and%20Associates\"&gt;Gurges and Associates&lt;/a&gt;, which stopped being an active concern almost overnight and has since become known as \"the Fallen House.\"\nIs the Shadow Conglomerate the true power of Abah's Landing? I cannot say for certain, and that is what troubles me the most."}

They can switch between abilities based on the behavior of the Fugitive. Many enemies will commonly use an ability to resist or escape a stun or paralyzing effect, so a series of complimentary unblocked combo hits cannot be administered without proper payment.\nNot only do abilities vary by enemy, but how cleverly enemies use them varies; an undead will not be nearly as annoying as a more sentient goblin, which might save a strike for an ice spike attack from the Fugitive. When countering enemy counters, their variability increases drastically, requiring careful attention and responsiveness to overcome."}

They are &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; effects that increase various stats and values relative to the player. They are determined by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; or obtained by completing &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; and tasks throughout the game. Active abilities will appear in the &lt;a href=\"Active%20Effect\"&gt;Active Effect&lt;/a&gt;s list, under &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. They are considered separate from &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Powers&lt;/a&gt; as they do not require activation and are not restricted to once a day use.\nArmor abilities.\nThe following are special abilities granted when wearing a full &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Sets%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;set of armor&lt;/a&gt; or a certain piece:\nBlessings.\nBlessings are passive, temporary buffs that normally last for eight real-time hours of gameplay (as opposed to eight hours of in-game time). They can be obtained by praying at altars, typically located in temples. Only one blessing can be active at a time. Activating a second shrine will relinquish the effect of the first.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; has eight of the the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; shrines available; the exception being the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Shrine of Talos&lt;/a&gt; as his worship is banned in the Empire. Should the Stormcloaks win the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the said shrine will be added.\nThe following is a list of the blessings and locations that can be obtained from altars and temples around &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Some blessings listed can only be obtained with the inclusion of and add-ons.\n&lt;a href=\"Meditations%20on%20the%20Words%20of%20Power\"&gt;Meditations on the Words of Power&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese are made available by talking to &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;. As with the shrine blessings, only one can be active at any one time. The player can choose to meet with the dragon and change the word at one's discretion without any repercussions whatsoever.\nQuest abilities.\nThe following are permanent abilities granted at the conclusion of particular quests.\nRacial abilities.\nThe following are abilities inherent to certain races of Skyrim. Not all races are mutually exclusive: i.e., the player can be a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; in addition to whichever starting race was chosen. It is, however, impossible to be both a Vampire and a Werewolf simultaneously, unless you use the Vampire-Werewolf hybrid glitch provided by the Dawnguard DLC.\nStanding Stones abilities.\nOnly one of the following passive abilities can be active at a time, unless using the &lt;a href=\"Aetherial%20Crown\"&gt;Aetherial Crown&lt;/a&gt;. They can be acquired by visiting the desired Standing Stone and activating it.\nTemporary abilities.\nThese are similar to blessings in that they are temporary in nature, but they can be active at the same time as any of the blessings.\nReferences.\n&lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda's&lt;/a&gt; \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Official Game Guide\""}

Nations will tremble and bow before me! I will be a god!\"\nSai Sahan: \"The Amulet of Kings will never be yours! It is protected by a ward of the Divines!\"\nMannimarco: \"You mean your ward of Stendarr, God of Merciful Forbearance, patron of gutless, law-abiding dimwits? It won't even slow me down!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai, are you well enough to continue?\"\nSai Sahan: \"Have no fear, Snow Lily. I am Redguard. We are like mountain bamboo: far stronger and more flexible than we might appear.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"I find it hilarious that Mannimarco chose such a massive projected appearance. He's obviously overcompensating for something.\"\nMannimarco: \"Persistent, aren't you? Do you really think you can keep me from acquiring the amulet?\"\nSai Sahan: \"The Amulet of Kings is under the protection of Stendarr's ward! It will never be yours!\"\nMannimarco: \"Ah, Sai. You still don't understand, do you? My plan will succeed because of your ward of Stendarr! It will prevent Molag Bal from observing or interfering. By the time the ward is down and the amulet is mine, it will already be too late!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You're insane if you think you can betray the God of Schemes!\"\nMannimarco: \"Naive child! You know nothing! Chim-el Adabal, the red diamond at the center of the Amulet of Kings, is the most powerful Soul Gem ever created! With the amulet in my possession, I will absorb Molag Bal's power, reducing him to an empty husk of ethereal flesh. Then I will trap his essence within the gem! In time, the name Molag Bal will be forgotten! In time, all of Tamriel will bow down before me! Soon, the God of Schemes will have a new name: Mannimarco!\"\nSai Sahan: \"I do not like Mannimarco as a mortal. I think I will like him even less as a god.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Please. A moment, my friends. I ... I must rest before we continue.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai? Are you all right? That bastard really hurt you, didn't he? I swear to the gods I'll take his head off!\"\nSai Sahan: \"I'll be fine, Snow Lily. I just need a moment to catch my breath.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Take all the time you need. I'll keep watch. If there's anything I can do, just name it.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"An enchanting moment. I'll be over here, bringing up my lunch.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Dank corridors, crumbling walls, nauseating smells. This place has all the charm of a Riften brothel. It must feel very much like home to you, Titanborn.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You mean a crypt filled with the rotting corpses of inbred kings and failed statesmen. Must be what it's like at a Tharn family reunion.\"\nSai Sahan: \"It is more pleasant in the summer months.\"\nMannimarco: \"Miserable fools! You are nothing!

We can't let that happen. Look what we can accomplish when we work together.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"How uncharacteristically optimistic of you, Titanborn. I may have that embroidered on a pillow.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"The Divines gave you a nose for a reason, Tharn. So you can keep your mouth shut and still keep breathing.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Well played, Titanborn. Well played.\"\nSai Sahan: \"My lord, with your permission.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"You needn't call me that anymore, Sai Sahan. We are equals now.\"\nSai Sahan: \"All those years ago, when we fought beneath our lord's banner to free the Empire from the Longhouse Emperors, we did so with a dream of freedom and peace in mind\u2015not just for the Empire, but for all of Tamriel. Together we forged a fellowship stronger than any blade, only to see it shattered upon the rocks of deceit by one of our own. That fellowship is no more, yet we four have assembled here, united by a single purpose. It is not vengeance that drives us, but truth and loyalty and justice. I, Sai Sahan, steward of the Abbey of Blades, call for the Five Companions to be reforged this day. By the light of Stendarr, and the heart of Lorkhan, may our blade fellowship be forged anew. And may the Vestige, our mutual friend and ally, become its tip, that we may thrust it straigt into the heart of a Daedric Prince.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai Sahan is right. You are the member that we should have had all those years ago.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"It is as the Scrolls foretold. The soulless one will become the brightest of five stars, and they shall guide us to the coming dawn.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Oh, please. You melodramatic sots! Fine, fine. If seeing one of your foolish prophecies come true will help to ensure the safety of the Empire, I'll play along.\"\nSai Sahan: \"We stand united once more\u2015the Five Companions are reforged, and together we will strike down the God of Schemes!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Come here, my friend. I've got a few things I want to say before you go.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Let's not forget the struggles that got us to this point. We're almost home. We just have a bit further to fight.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Are you all insane? You do realize what we need to do, right? We have to fight a Daedric Prince. Amulet or no, this is going to mean more death. Vestige! Come here. I'll tell you what they're afraid to mention.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Of course it is. The fact of the matter stands, however. One of the Five will need to give their life to fuel this attack, when the time comes.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"So you said before the Vestige arrived. And I've already thought over it. I'll do it.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Snow Lily, no! You should not need to give your life this way. This is my duty\u2015penance for my numerous failures. This is my chance to make things right.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"The Scrolls said nothing of this moment, and so I am not bound to their dictates. Vestige, I ask that you let me do this one thing. All that has happened was because of my hubris. I shall be the one.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sire, you've done enough. This was Mannimarco's doing, not yours.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"As the one who will fight the Daedric Prince, the Vestige should decide.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"I don't see you leaping to volunteer, Tharn. Saving your own backside again?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Hard as it may be, Lyris, don't be an idiot. I am the only one who knows the ritual and we don't have time to teach anyone else.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"That's enough. It won't be decided here and now. Vestige, come here. I have some final words for you.\"\nThe Prophet: \"This place is alive with pain and suffering. This must be where Molag Bal torments those who displease him.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Look there! Is that Mannimarco?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Mannimarco! He was a back-stabbing hypocrite with delusions of godhood. The fool got precisely what he deserved!\"\nIf Mannimarco is released:\nMannimarco: \"You actually released me? Naive fool! Future generations will pay for your weakness!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Are you insane? That worm didn't deserve your mercy!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Why do I get the feeling we're going to regret this?\"\nThe Prophet: \"There. That place should serve us well. Let us assemble and prepare the ritual.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"What do you suppose this place was?\"\nSai Sahan: \"A temple of some kind. The Dark Anchors may have pulled it into Coldharbour. Or, perhaps it was created by the Daedra to mock the Divines.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"What does it matter? We can't wait any longer. We must perform the ritual. Vestige, it is time for you to make your decision.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Position yourself over there, Vestige. And brace yourself.\"\nIf Lyris Titanborn is the sacrifice:\nSai Sahan: \"Snow Lily, no... don't do this. Please.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Death is simply life's next great adventure, and I am prepared to make the journey. I hope to see you all again one day, in Sovngarde. Until then, it has been my greatest honor.\"\nIf Sai Sahan is the sacrifice:\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai, I... I'll never forget you. And we'll finish this, I swear it.\"\nSai Sahan: \"I am honored to make this sacrifice. When you think of me, I hope you remember me fondly, and sing songs of this day while you toast to my memory.\"\nIf Varen Aquilarios is the sacrifice:\nLyris Titanborn: \"We'll never forget you Sire, or your sacrifice.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Great Akatosh, Dragon God of Time, forgive me for my hubris. Grant your divine power to the Vestige and restore your protection to Tamriel, that my sacrifice might not be in vain.\"\nRegardless of the sacrifice:\nAbnur Tharn: \"History may not remember your sacrifice, but those present here will never forget it. Divines of Tamriel! With this vessel of your power, the Amulet of Kings, I call upon your strength! Let this noble sacrifice be a testament to our desire to set things right and restore balance to the Mundus! Your champion stands ready! Accept this offering and imbue this vestige with your glory! Let the will of Molag Bal be denied! Vestige! Now is the time! You must ascend the path and face the Daedric Prince! You must face the God of Schemes alone. I will get the others to safety. Go!\""}

An item can only be enchanted once. However, simultaneous enchantments can be placed during the single enchantment process, if the item enchanted is a \"charge-based item\" (&lt;a href=\"%23Charge-based%20enchantments\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;).\nEnchanting an item requires magical knowledge of the type of enhancement to be added. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must know a spell with the same effect and be of sufficient skill in the appropriate &lt;a href=\"school%20of%20magic\"&gt;school of magic&lt;/a&gt; to cast the particular spell version they have. For example, if the Hero knows &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lighten Load&lt;/a&gt; and does not know Ease Burden, then they cannot do Feather enchantments until they reach journeyman expertise in &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; or obtain an apprentice-level Feather spell. An alternative to obtaining a spell at the correct level is to obtain the desired effect from a &lt;a href=\"Doomstones\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt; as there are no skill restrictions on casting powers.\nThe Hero will also need a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; containing a trapped soul. The greater the soul trapped, the more powerful an enchantment can be made. Unlike other games, characteristics and skill levels have no bearing on the power of the enchantment, the soul size is the sole determining factor. Soul Gems\u00a0may also purchased or stolen from &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; halls and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; itself. The Grand Soul Gems and Greater Soul Gems are primarily found in locked cases. Mages Guild members may simply pick up these loose soul gems for free.\nEnchantments can be performed at an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; in the Arcane University or the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt;. Alternately, if the &lt;a href=\"Frostcrag%20Spire%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Frostcrag Spire&lt;/a&gt; add-on has been purchased,\u00a0there will be a\u00a0personal Altar of Enchanting in the Spire.\nSoul Gems.\nSoul Gems are a very important part of enchanting. They are magic stones that can hold the captured souls of most creatures. They come in different sizes and power and are used to transfer magicka to items being enchanted (or &lt;a href=\"recharge\"&gt;recharge&lt;/a&gt;d, in most cases). There are five different types of soul gem found throughout the game. They are as follows:\nSoul Gem \u2014 Maximum Charge Capacity\nSoul Gems are single-use items. Once used to recharge or enchant an item, they disappear, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack Soul Gem.\nIt is possible through &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29%23Quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; centered around the Mages Guild to acquire \"Black Soul Gems.\" These grand-quality soul gems can be used to trap the souls of &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;; all other &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Grand Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt; can only capture souls from lesser creatures.\nCharge-based enchantments.\n&lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; that are enchanted have a number of charges determined by the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; used during the enchanting. Each time the weapon hits a target, it uses a certain number of charges (as determined by the magnitude of the effect produced). Typically, weapons are enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic to increase their effectiveness. It is also possible to combine different effect types, such as &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; \"and\" &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt; on strike. Some greater magical artifacts have 3000 charges, which exceeds even the strength of a Grand Soul Gem.\n&lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt; are also charge-based enchantments, but there is no known way for to enchant one (other than during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Mage%27s%20Staff\"&gt;A Mage's Staff&lt;/a&gt;\").\n&lt;a href=\"Recharging\"&gt;Recharging&lt;/a&gt; a weapon costs 1 per charge (this can get very costly), or it can be recharged with a Soul Gem. It is cheaper to purchase soul gems from a Mages Guild &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; and recharge\u00a0the items than it is to pay for a recharge.\nWeapons may also be recharged with &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s. They are one-use items that recharge \"all\" magical items in\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt should be noted that if\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is in\u00a0the inventory,\u00a0it can be\u00a0used to recharge weapons easily, as it is a reusable Soul Gem.\nUsing Azura's Star in conjunction with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; spell and a summon spell can save the Hero thousands of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; in recharge costs.\nConstant Effect enchantments.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amulets%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt; can be enchanted with constant effects. These enchantments are applied whenever the item is equipped. The magnitude of the constant effect varies depending on the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; used to enchant it, and is typically much lower than that of a charge-based enchantment. For example, with a grand soul gem, the most powerful light enchantment\u00a0that can be\u00a0placed upon it is up to 40 feet, whereas\u00a0there are\u00a0spells that illuminate up to 100 feet and beyond. Certain constant effects that do not have a capacity for variation (such as &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;) may be placed on an item to full effect using only a petty soul. Items enchanted by the Hero can contain only one constant effect enchantment."}

Enchanting is a type of arcane crafting, and is one of the three crafting skills of \"Skyrim\". Enchanting allows the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to add certain magical improvements and buffs to &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nThe act of enchanting requires an item with no existing enchantments, a filled &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, knowledge of an enchantment, and the use of an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. The Law of the Firsts states that once an item is enchanted, it can not be enchanted again and can not accept another enchantment. There are certain items that can be enchanted even though they already have an enchantment. These include the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20the%20Gargoyle\"&gt;Amulet of the Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; (in ), &lt;a href=\"Horksbane\"&gt;Horksbane&lt;/a&gt; (from ), the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Sword\"&gt;Silver Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Greatsword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Silver Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Longhammer\"&gt;the Longhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo enchant an object, have that object and a filled soul gem in inventory and then activate an Arcane Enchanter. The enchanting menu will appear, with four tabs. The first tab is the Disenchant screen which lists all of the disenchantable objects the Dragonborn has in inventory. Selecting objects here will destroy them and add their enchantment to the Dragonborn's list of known enchantments. Objects with already known enchantments are greyed out. The next tab lists objects capable of being enchanted. Select the desired object here. The next tab lists the known enchantments, select the desired one, or if the Extra Effect perk has been obtained, two may be selected. Note that any numerical bonuses listed in this tab are the maximum, as if a grand soul was used. On the last tab, select a filled soul gem from the list. If a lesser gem is selected, the corresponding lesser bonus will be displayed. Press the Craft key to create the enchanted item.\nArcane Enchanters can be found in all major cities, typically in the Jarl's Palace or Longhouse, in the court wizard's quarters. They are also found in many locations that feature humanoid, magic-using enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt;. Most &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;houses&lt;/a&gt; which the Dragonborn can buy, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, can be equipped with an arcane enchanter. There is even one in &lt;a href=\"Sinderion%27s%20Field%20Laboratory\"&gt;Sinderion's Field Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;Court Wizard&lt;/a&gt;s can sell the Dragonborn enchanted items, as well as soul gems, and likewise, the Dragonborn can sell enchanted items and soul gems to them. There is no Court Wizard in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nRacial bonuses.\n&lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; characters gain a + 5 bonus to enchanting at the start of the game.\nEnchantment types.\nEnchantments fall into two categories based on type of item:\nObtaining enchantments.\nThe Dragonborn initially has no knowledge of enchantments. To learn an enchantment, a magic item with the enchantment that the Dragonborn wants to learn must be disenchanted at an arcane enchanter. The strength of the enchantment on the item does not affect the strength of the enchantment learned by disenchanting it. Disenchanting destroys the item but grants permanent knowledge of the base enchantment, allowing its use when enchanting. Some items cannot be disenchanted to learn their effects, including &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Quest Items&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amulets%20of%20the%20Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Amulets of the Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20Armor\"&gt;Thieves Guild Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and many, but not all, items with unique names. &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt; also cannot be disenchanted.\nLeveling.\nThe following actions raise the Enchanting skill.\nIt should be noted that some enchantments such as &lt;a href=\"Banish%20Daedra%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Banish Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fortify Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Sneak\"&gt;Fortify Sneak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Absorb Health&lt;/a&gt; produce remarkably more valuable enchantments which can be turned around and sold to buy soul gems and other raw materials to accelerate the leveling process. However, the skill increase gained from the act of enchanting itself is strictly dependent on the size of the soul used and not on the enchanting effect chosen.\nAlso note that obtaining either &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Star%20%28Item%29\"&gt;The Black Star&lt;/a&gt; will save a lot of money on buying soul gems to enchant with and can be substituted for any use of a soul gem below.\nBooks.\nBooks that raise the Enchanting skill:\nPerks.\nEnchanting tree perks.\nThe following are enchanting &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available to select as the skill is leveled up.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn addition to perks increasing enchanting powers, leveling Enchanting increases them. For every 10 levels, enchantments will be 1% stronger.\nPerks from other trees.\nThe following perks from other trees affect &lt;a href=\"%23Weapon%20enchantments\"&gt;weapon enchantments&lt;/a&gt;. Note that while there are weapon effects from the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; schools, there are no relevant perks that enhance effects from those schools.\nEnchantments.\nWeapons.\nThere are 18 weapon enchantments available. The enchantments wear out after successive use, and to keep the enchantment in effect, it has to be \"refilled\" by using soul gems to add more uses. The larger the soul used, the more uses given via recharging.\nApparel.\nThere are 38 apparel enchantments available. The types of enchantments allowed on apparel are determined by what part of the body the apparel is covering. Unlike weapon enchantments, apparel enchantments do not require recharging and stay enchanted indefinitely. The strength of the enchantment is dependent on the size of soul used to enchant it and the enchanter's perks and skill, except for &lt;a href=\"muffle\"&gt;muffle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt;.\nMethod for maximum strength potions and enchantments.\nThe final set of gear will not improve the results of a Fortify Enchanting potion, but will improve the results for other potions. Additional potions can be brewed to improve enchantments of all types. One common application is to enchant a set of &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;Fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt; gear and combine it with a maximum strength Fortify Smithing potion to improve weapons and armor.\nThere is an alternative that is the exploit of the use of Fortify Restoration potions, which improves several status, including Fortify Enchanting. Also, there is an added ability called &lt;a href=\"Seeker%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Seeker of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; from the DLC which makes enchanting 10% more effective. The ability can be gained at the completion of the quest \".\" It goes very well with &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Armor\"&gt;Ahzidal's Armor set&lt;/a&gt;, as it increases skill in Enchanting by 10."}

I spent twenty years pulling &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; from the waters of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; before stumbling into the world of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. If a former &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; fisher-&lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; can figure it out, so can you!\nStep One: Find &lt;a href=\"Runes\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt;\nYears ago I noticed glowing runes when I fished in Black Marsh. At first I thought they were &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wisps&lt;/a&gt;! You're most likely to find them in dangerous places, so be careful. Look for the angular stones where the runes sit.\n\u2014Red Aspect runes remind me of fish: the minnows are plentiful but don't have much flesh on their bones, while the old grandfathers are the rarest but the richest catch.\n\u2014Blue Potency runes make me think of a fish's flavor. The good ones can improve your day, while the bad ones are best fed to your enemies.\n\u2014Green Essence runes are like the type of fish. Frost fish, armor fish, poison fish \u2026 you get the idea.\nSome people ask me why there are runes scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but that's a question for the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. I've never asked where fish come from, just where I can find more of them.\nStep Two: Create Enchantment\nOnce you have one rune each of aspect (fish age), potency (fish flavor), and essence (fish type), bring them to an enchanting station. Now, put the runes together and craft your first enchantment!\nThe best way you learn to fish is by fishing, and the same applies to enchanting. The act of creating an enchantment will reveal the meaning and function of unknown runes. Some will say \"You must comprehend how the rune resonates with your soul to truly understand it,\" but that's Mages Guild talk.\nStep Three: Enchanting Items\nYou have your first enchantment. Now you're ready to enchant your first item! Find the item you want to enchant and apply the enchantment. Easy, no? But of course, it's never that easy.\nEnchantments are very particular. Some are best for weapons, others for armor, and still more bind only to jewelry. Some may require higher quality items than what you have on hand. Oh, and no item that is already enchanted can take a new enchantment. \"Serve the right fish for the right occasion,\" as my egg-sister says.\nAppendix: Extracting Runes From Enchantments\nIf you have an enchantment you can't use, don't despair! Sell, trade, or gift them to friends who can use them.\nOf course, you can also extract runes from enchantments at any enchanting station. I call this \"gutting the fish.\" This destroys the enchantment in the process, but you'll get one of the runes back that you could use in another enchantment."}

Characters who carrying enough items to exceed their total encumbrance will be unable to move, but may still perform any other action.\nIncreasing and decreasing.\nThe total weight any character can carry is determined by &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; x 5. For example, if a character has a strength of 50, the total weight they can carry will be 250. As such, if the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; dedicates more points per level to Strength, they will be able to carry more items. The maximum natural encumbrance of any character is 500, but can be made higher with &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; that further increase strength. A character may become over encumbered if a Damage Strength or Drain Strength spell is cast upon them, thereby temporarily lowering their Strength and, by extension, their encumbrance. Damage and Drain Strength spells and enchantments can therefore be used as a pseudo-&lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;paralytic&lt;/a&gt;, preventing a combatant from moving and making them vulnerable to ranged attacks without being able to retaliate unless they themselves used ranged attacks.\nEffect on Speed.\nEncumbrance affects &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;. Characters will move slower according to the ratio of their current encumbrance to their total encumbrance, meaning characters carrying a smaller percentage of their total encumbrance will move faster than characters carrying a greater percentage, all other things being equal. As such, &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt; spells will serve to also marginally increase a characters speed, as well as prevent being over encumbered."}
{"id": "16730", "revid": "27699390", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16730", "title": "Encumbrance (Oblivion)", "text": "Encumbrance is the term given to the amount of weight a character (namely, the player's character) is carrying. In the user interface, weight is represented by the symbol. The total weight that a player can carry is governed by the &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; attribute.\nMechanics.\nA character's Encumbrance limit is equal to five times their &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; attribute. Characters are free to carry any amount of weight up to weight limit without penalty, although they will walk/run slower when carrying a lot at once. Any amount beyond the weight limit, however, results in the character becoming \"Over-Encumbered.\"\nIn Oblivion, when over-encumbered, the character is instantly rooted to the spot until the necessary amount of weight is removed.\nRaising carrying limit.\nThe easiest immediate solution to becoming over encumbered is to simply drop something heavy. Another, more agreeable permanent solution is to raise the character's &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; score when leveling up. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, a character's carry limit does not automatically increase with level.\nAs a temporary fix, using a &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; of Feather, or any method of raising one's &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, will increase one's carry limit. As Feather spells frequently last a very long time, it is entirely possible to re-cast the spell every time it wears out, or to cast a permanent Feather &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; on an item. However, enchanting items with Fortify Strength instead appears to provide much better benefits, since the increased Strength provides the character with greatly improved carry weight and significantly increases melee damage. Strength spells are also much more effective; a point of Fortify Strength allows one to carry 5 times more extra loot than a single point of Feather.\nReducing Encumbrance.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; skills increase, the impact of the armor's weight upon one's total encumbrance is noticeably reduced. However, this weight modification only applies to armor of that type that is actually being worn.\nThere are some monsters (such as &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;) with attacks that can either directly or indirectly lower a character's strength score, thus temporarily lowering the carrying limit of their victim. This is usually a minor concern for \"pure\" melee characters, but a dire threat to almost every other character archetype. It is advisable for a player to plan ahead for such a possibility, either by preparing spells and items to counter the problem or by scouting for such foes cautiously and ensuring that one has 'spare' carrying capacity available in an emergency.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burden%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Burden&lt;/a&gt; spell is the opposite of &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt;, increasing a character's encumbrance. Characters can cast &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dispel&lt;/a&gt; or drink potions with the same effects to remove this effect. Also, characters skills in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; can create effective &lt;a href=\"poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Burden%20%28Effect%29\"&gt;Burden&lt;/a&gt; effects, in order to restrict a target's movement.\nRelated ingredients.\nUnless an &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; has one of the encumbrance-related effects (discussed above) as its first effect, the ingredient must be combined with related ingredients via &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; to make a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; with that effect.\n&lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeather temporarily increases the maximum encumbrance of the target.\n&lt;a href=\"Burden%20%28Effect%29\"&gt;Burden&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurden temporarily increases the weight carried by the target.\n&lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Strength&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortify Strength temporarily increases the maximum encumbrance of the target."}

Exceeding this limit causes the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to become encumbered, preventing them from running or &lt;a href=\"sprinting\"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, encumbered individuals cannot use &lt;a href=\"carriage\"&gt;carriage&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fast Travel&lt;/a&gt; (unless riding a &lt;a href=\"horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;). When playing on PSVR being encumbered causes the teleport range to be significantly shorter.\nMeans of improvement.\nCarrying capacity can be improved by a number of means:"}

I have given my heart to my people, but now I shall give them more. I shall dedicate my life and my soul to them.\"\nThe woman turned and waved at the wall of ice. It melted away in moments.

If you do not persuade him, . \nEither way, once you have a pickaxe, head into the cave.

My frequent exposure to their habits and behaviors has made me something of an authority on avoiding physical harm when in the company of Nords, and I hope it may assist you, the reader, in the same.\nWith Nords, insults are not always insults\u2014unless they are. When conversing among themselves, references that might otherwise seem offensive (like \"you old &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horker's&lt;/a&gt; arse\") might, in fact, be familiar terms of endearment. One should avoid chiming in with similar epithets unless quite familiar with the Nords in question. Keep in mind, even then, that insulting a Nord's strength, bravery, or honor in any way almost inevitably leads to violence as the offended party attempts to prove otherwise.\nNever turn down a drink. You must become an expert at discreetly emptying your sixth or seventh cup of mead underneath the table (don't worry, there will be plenty of spillage already present; no one will notice). Refusing a drink is seen as an admittance of weakness and is a sure way to alienate yourself from those you have been forced to work alongside.\nMy last bit of advice is to attempt to speak in the simplest terms possible. Nords, while they do love absurd stories, do not appreciate the finer arts of conversation, and become suspicious of those who speak in elaborate language. A suspicious Nord is a dangerous Nord, likely to go off and begin yelling and throwing accusations that you're deliberately being confusing and must be lying. Keep it simple and you'll avoid bruises.\nGood luck, reader. You will need it as you attempt to cooperate with these brutish &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;."}

Where there are bandit caves or camps, there is usually a chief to keep chaos in order. Chiefs are the strongest member of a bandit gang, often wearing mid-level armor.\nForsworn.\n&lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; are members of a group of tribes, fighting for the 'old ways'. They are the original inhabitants of the &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Many can be found in the company of &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagravens&lt;/a&gt;.\nGhosts.\nGhosts are undead spectral appearing spirits of ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; warriors and &lt;a href=\"Nightingales\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, are usually found in ruins and caves. Nightingales are specific to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nReavers.\nReavers are a variety of bandit found on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. They behave in much the same way.\nWarlocks.\nMages are humanoids who use magic &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; as their primary weapon. Most often they are without armor, wearing just &lt;a href=\"Robes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt; and common boots. They often use &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;s for defense. They also usually carry a small secondary weapon, such as a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;. Mages encountered in the wilds of Skyrim are often &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;.\nPenitus Oculatus.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; are the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; guards. They may or may not be hostile depending on the circumstances. They can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; in the central part of the village. They are the main enemies in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hail%20Sithis%21\"&gt;Hail Sithis!&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVampires.\nVampires are humans who have been bitten by another vampire in order to gain their disease: &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. Vampirism can be cured easily if it is not full-blown, but a cure is quite hard if the disease is fully active. Vampires have black or red eyes and do not age, as they stay at the age they were bitten at by another vampire (&lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, who was bitten by a vampire at age ten, has appeared that way ever since.

Speak with him and he will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Gold Coast Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; are making it unsafe to go outside the walls of the settlement. Tabil will ask you to meet with his leader, Eraral-dro, to help take care of the problem.\nEraral-dro is in a market stall in the north of town. Speak with him and he will tell you that he hired the mercenaries to keep them safe from the &lt;a href=\"Houndsmen\"&gt;Houndsmen&lt;/a&gt;, but now he fears they might turn against the Khajiit. The mercenaries have been demanding more pay than what was agreed upon, so Eraral-dro fears that they are weighing two contracts. The mercenaries are about to receive a missive from the Gold Coast, which Eraral-dro wants you to intercept.\nYou will find the courier's campsite along the road to the north of town. You will find a &lt;a href=\"Note%20to%20Rufinus\"&gt;Note to Rufinus&lt;/a&gt; to the right of the tent, which will mention that new orders are coming from Cyrodiil. Upon reading this, you will be attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Courier%20Rufinus\"&gt;Courier Rufinus&lt;/a&gt;; kill him and take the Gold Coast Missive from his body. This missive will state that the mercenaries' new employer wants them to clear out the Khajiit. Bring this missive to Eraral-dro and he will ask you to come with him to make a plan. \nFollow him to &lt;a href=\"Rejmina%27s%20House\"&gt;Rejmina's House&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest of town, and speak with him again there. He will ask you to play the role of the courier, lest the mercenaries become suspicious. The courier's body has been taken upstairs in this building; head up and take his uniform, then head back downstairs to talk to Eraral-dro again. His plan is to have you bring fake orders to the mercenary captain, telling them to attack the nearby clan of werewolves. \nPut on your disguise, then head to the commander's tend southwest of town. Deliver the orders to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aurelia%20Blasio\"&gt;Captain Aurelia Blasio&lt;/a&gt;; she will obey them and rouse her men against the wolves. Once the orders are delivered, &lt;a href=\"Tabil\"&gt;Tabil&lt;/a&gt; will call your attention; he is hiding by the captain's tent. He will tell you the next part of the plan; you are to kill the mercenary commanders and make it look like the werewolves are the ones who did it. For this, you will first need to secure the paw of a werewolf; there are plenty of those for you to kill on &lt;a href=\"Four%20Quarry%20Islet\"&gt;Four Quarry Islet&lt;/a&gt; across the river. Once you have the paw, kill the three Gold Coast commanders in the tents nearby and use the paw to make it look like the werewolves did it. \nAfter all of this, speak with Eraral-dro by the town's south gates to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Tangled%20Net\"&gt;A Tangled Net&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The Golden Door is locked, level 20, and trapped. Enter the door to the north to find Engaer in his room.\nEngaer is not immediately hostile and will not attack. At this point, there are two options: attack him unprovoked or taunt him to make him attack first. After killing Engaer, exit the tower and return to Hrundi.\nSpeak with Hrundi and he will ask about Engaer and provide the reward for fulfilling the contract."}
