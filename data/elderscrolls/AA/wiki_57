After the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; has convinced the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; delegates to return to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Irnskar\"&gt;Prince Irnskar&lt;/a&gt;'s meeting after he had insulted them, &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Harvald\"&gt;Thane Harvald&lt;/a&gt;, disturbed by reports of &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist&lt;/a&gt; spies infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt;, requests the Vestige checks in on &lt;a href=\"King%20Jorunn\"&gt;King Jorunn&lt;/a&gt;'s meeting with the Pact leaders in the Fort Amol keep.\nBackground.\n\"Thane Harvald wants &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vurlop\"&gt;Lord Vurlop&lt;/a&gt; and I to go into the keep and check on King Jorunn. We need to make sure that the King and his war council are safe.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter having succesfully convinced the Pact delegates to return to Prince Irsnark's meeting, Thane Harvald instructs the Vestige to accompany Lord Vurlop to the keep to check in on the king's meeting, as he is afraid the element of surprise may give &lt;a href=\"Fildgor\"&gt;Fildgor&lt;/a&gt; and advantage. After reaching the gates of the keep with Lord Vurlop, he will turn to the Vestige and two &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; assassins will appear behind him to ambush them. The Vestige is saved by &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu&lt;/a&gt;, however, who appears behind Vurlop and swiftly stabs him to death. She will tell the Vestige the following.\n\"Told you something bad was going to happen. I didn't want you to walk into this trap alone. So I followed you. Good thing, too.\"\nIf the Vestige has the &lt;a href=\"Persuasion\"&gt;Persuasion&lt;/a&gt; perk, they can compliment Naryu on her dress. The Vestige must now enter the keep to look for a key to the Jarl's manor, which is carried by Stormfist troops that have infiltrated the keep. Killing the first guard they see will allow the Vestige to grab the key from their corpse and enter the manor. Once inside, they will encounter Naryu speaking to &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Vkor\"&gt;Sergeant Vkor&lt;/a&gt;, who appears to be under the influence of a poison and promptly falls over and dies. When speaking to her, Naryu will tell the Vestige there are two locked doors in the manor that the king could be behind. It is up to them to discover how to open them. Making their way upstairs, the Vestige can find a note on a bed detailing a precautionary riddle that will lead them to the location of the key. The first passage directs them to a note in front of the statue in the main hall of the upper floor, which directs them to an ancient Argonian relic on the first floor of the manor, underneath which is the key. When the Vestige opens the safe room doors, they will encounter a visage resembling King Jorunn, who will tell them the following.\n\"Thank you for all your hard work here in Fort Amol. I can't say that Vurlop was as useful as I'd hoped, but he served his purpose, right? I mean, just look at me! Stunning, am I not? A Breton leading the Nords. Who would have thought of it?\"\nYou think you can take King Jorunn's place? \"Well, yes. That's the entire point of why we're here. Now, I must apologize. I have matters to attend to. You'll find that my guards now control the manor. You can try to stop us, but I doubt you'll have very much luck.\"\nNow that the Vestige knows Dhalen aims to impersonate King Jorunn, they must defeat the illusionist. Returning to the main hall of the manor, they will find what appears to be King Jorunn standing next to the statue there. Upon further inspection, it is an illusion cast by Dhalen. Attacking the impostor will cause the illusion to break, and Dhalen will return to his true identity. After defeating him in combat, the Vestige must rush to the vault of the manor to rescue the Pact leaders.\nEntering the vault, they will discover King Jorunn lying on the floor, barely conscious, with &lt;a href=\"Way-with-Words\"&gt;Way-with-Words&lt;/a&gt; kneeling over him. She will tell the Vestige the king has been poisoned by one of the Stormfists pretending to be a servant using a Daedric poison. She doesn't think he will survive. They only just managed to survive because Naryu came to their rescue and defeated their pursuers. The Vestige promises her that they will get help. After leaving the vault, the Vestige must speak to Naryu who tells them she has sent word to Prince Irnskar, requesting backup. In the meantime, Naryu will return to Mournhold, as her contract is now completed. The Vestige must head downstairs to speak to Prince Irnskar, who will tell them the following.\n\"Where's my father? What did our so-called allies do to him? I'll kill every single Argonian and Dark Elf myself if my father's been harmed!\"\nUpon which the quest will be completed and the Vestige will be rewarded."}

{"id": "6121", "revid": "26459635", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6121", "title": "The Warp in the West (Book)", "text": "The Warp in the West was written by &lt;a href=\"Ulvius%20Tero\"&gt;Ulvius Tero&lt;/a&gt;, and describes the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;event of the same name&lt;/a&gt;. Ulvius Tero is a &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; archivist who cataloged these reports. This event is an example of a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;. The book itself describes this Dragon Break on the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region.\nSummary.\nThis book details a curious chain of events in High Rock, involving the resolution of the territories of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Wars and strange plights happened through 3 days and many people don't recall the 2nd, in which massive territorial and political changes occurred.\nContents.\nSecret: For Your Eyes Only.\nLet me offer my congratulations to Your Lordship for your recent appointment as ambassador to the Court of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;\nYour Lordship asked me for a review of existing &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; accounts from &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt; concerning The Warp in the West, and for a summary of the current state of affairs there.\nSince Your Lordship was in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; serving in the staff of Admiral Sosorius at the time, you probably know of these events only from Imperial proclamations and Chapel declarations, which identify this period as the 'Miracle of Peace'. During the 'Miracle of Peace', according to official accounts, the formerly war-wracked &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region was transformed overnight from a patchwork of squabbling duchies and petty kingdoms into the peaceful modern counties of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. The 'Miracle of Peace', also known as the 'The Warp in the West', is celebrated as the product of the miraculous interventions of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; to transform this troublesome region into peaceful, well-governed Imperial counties. The catastrophic destruction of landscape and property and the large loss of life attending upon this miracle is understood to have been 'tragic, and beyond mortal comprehension.'\nIn as much as this account confirms and validates the current borders of these counties, and identifies the rulers and boundaries of these counties as '&lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;ordained by the Nine&lt;/a&gt;', the 'Miracle of Peace' serves &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; objectives of peaceful consolidation of ancient petty states and sovereigns into manageable Imperial jurisdictions. The other remarkable features of these events -- mass disappearances, armies mysteriously transported hundreds of miles or completely annihilated, titanic storms and celestial phenomena, apparent local discontinuities of time -- fit comfortably into the notion that these events are part of a vast, mysterious divine intervention.\nHowever, this is only the public account of these events, and, as you may suspect, it conflicts with many other accounts. In short, while this explanation suits Imperial policy, it has little historical validity.\nYour Lordship should know that the Blades have concluded there is no plausible historical account of these events, and despairs that a plausible historical account shall ever be produced. The Blades have concluded that a 'miracle' occurred, insofar as the events are inexplicable, but the Blades strongly doubt the miracle was of divine origin.\nThere is good reason to believe that the ruling families of the four modern Iliac Bay counties had forewarning of the event. There is also some evidence that some of these ruling families may have been directly or indirectly responsible for the event. We do not know the exact sequence of actions that produced the event, although we are confident that the '&lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem'&lt;/a&gt; artifact was involved, and that a &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; was involved in employing that artifact. We unfortunately lost contact with that agent immediately after the event; his report might have gone some way to resolving the contradictory and paradoxical accounts of the event.\nThe Blades have on file few reports from agents dating from the \"Warp in the West\" period. Most of our agents were lost in the initial dislocations, and others were lost in the confusion after the event. I present a few of these reports to give you a general sense of their limitations, including the report of your diplomatic predecessor, Lord Strale. You will have had access to other private and rumored accounts of the period. I believe you will agree that these documents raise more questions than they answer.\nThe Report of Hammerfell Agent 'Briarbird'.\n'I was on assignment in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, a few miles south of &lt;a href=\"Bergama\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; on the 9th of Frostfall. I was encamped, as it was still early morning, when I felt the ground shake so violently, I was thrown to the ground. Dazed, I was aware of a great roar of a sandstorm, which alarmed me, as I had been on a high dune and had seen nothing like that on the horizon. It was on me before I was even on my knees, burying me and my camp.\nWhen I crawled my way out of the sand, I realized that I must make haste and get to Bergama as soon as possible, as all my food and water had been swept away. The sun was just rising as I began, like I said. When I reached Bergama, it was nightfall. The town was in chaos, filled with the soldiers of Sentinel. The Lord of Bergama's fortress was in ruins.\nThere had been an attack, but no one had seen it, only the invasion that followed it. The soldiers of &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; refused to be interviewed about how they had accomplished this sneak attack, but I came to learn that the whole of northern Hammerfell now belonged to them. Even stranger, I discovered that my walk from sunrise to sundown had not taken me not one day, but two. It was now the 11th day of the month, not the 10th. I had lost a day somewhere, and so apparently had everyone else... except Akorithi's soldiers, who somehow were aware of the correct date.\nI since have concluded that they had received advance warning, and so were better prepared to deal with the strange confusion of time and dates associated with the Warp.'\nThe Report of High Rock Agent 'Graylady'.\n'I was, at the time of the Warp, undercover as a witch in the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, in central &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. In order to give my report, I had volunteered for an expedition to gather supplies, which would allow me the freedom to reach my contact in &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. I was traveling north-east along the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, on the 9th of Frostfall, when I felt a great heat behind me, like a fire. I turned, but I regret to say I cannot tell you what I saw. The healers tell me my eyes were burned out of my sockets.\nI think I must have fallen into a state of semi-consciousness, for I distinctly remember falling as the ground seemed to give way beneath me. Then there was a series of explosions in the distance, to the south, and I heard high whistling noises that were getting louder, coming closer. I had my shield with me, and fortunately anticipated that volleys of some sort were falling from the sky. Though I could not see them, I could hear them coming from a distance away, and was able to use my shield to block them from striking me.\nThe assault stopped suddenly, and I could smell smoke. I learned later that most of the forest of &lt;a href=\"Ykalon\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt; and Phygias had caught fire, in an inferno that started further south in &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, I kept my bearings, and moved north, finally reaching a temple in the wilderness where my wounds were healed, as well as they could be.\nIt was there I learned that there had been a three-way clash between &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; not far from where I had been, and that the land midway between their kingdoms had been decimated.'\nThe Report of Ambassador Lord Naigon Strale.\n'His Imperial Majesty had sent me on a delicate errand, the details of which I cannot convey in this unsecure report, but my official capacity was to be the Emperor's ambassador to the court of Wayrest. From there, I was to meet with an old friend, Lady &lt;a href=\"Brisienna\"&gt;Brisienna&lt;/a&gt;, who was already in the vicinity. Forgoing any attempt at stealth, I was on an Imperial barge, sailing westward on the Bjoulsae, the morning of the 9th of Frostfall. I remember it was a slightly chilly day, but the sky was very blue.\n'We had just passed the delightful riverside village of &lt;a href=\"Candlemass\"&gt;Candlemass&lt;/a&gt; when the captain sounded the alarm. There, in front of us, was a colossal wall of water, at least thirty feet high. It smashed our barge to splinters before any of us had a chance to react. I woke up on the shore, having been rescued by one of my servants who had miraculously not lost consciousness. He and I and one other man were the only survivors.\nI thought at first that it was suspiciously similar to what happened to another agent of ours in High Rock but a short time before, where a freak storm had shipwrecked him in the Iliac Bay near &lt;a href=\"Privateer%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Privateer's Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Furious and determined to see if similar forces were at work, I began a quick march to Wayrest.\nThe march, however, was not so terribly quick. The villages all along the Bjoulsae were on fire, and battles raged between the orcs of Orsinium and the soldiers of King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; in the formerly independent principality of , just east of Wayrest. I am an accomplished mage, and quite able to defend myself, but it took the better part of a week to make it those few miles to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; of Wayrest and his queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; were celebrating their great victories when I arrived. By then, I had gathered the barest facts of the matter, that simultaneously there were seven great battles in the Iliac Bay, and no one could describe them at all, only their bloodsoaked aftermath.\nTo summarize: on the 9th of Frostfall, there had been forty-four independent kingdoms, counties, baronies, and dukedoms surrounding the Iliac Bay, if one includes the unconquered territories of the Wrothgarian Mountains, the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; Sea Coast, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. On the 11th of Frostfall, there were but four - &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; - and all the points where they met lay in ruins, as the armies continued to do battle.\nI was determined to find the truth from the King, even if I had to be a most undiplomatic diplomat to do it.\nEadwyre, though a generally jovial sort, had blustered, saying he did not want to give out military secrets. The Queen, ever calm with those unreadable red eyes of hers, told me, 'We do not know.'\nI think it is safe to assume that &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; did not tell me everything, but the facts of her story - which I later verified after pointed interviews in Daggerfall, Sentinel, and Orsinium - was that they had learned that a certain powerful, ancient weapon was going to be activated. I shan't give the name of it here. Out of fear that it would be used against Wayrest, the King had attempted to buy it from the young adventurer who had discovered its . Eadwyre believed, as it turns out quite rightly, that other powers in the Bay had also attempted to win ownership of this device.\nWhat happened then, as Barenziah said, 'We do not know.'\nThe morning of the 9th and the morning of the 11th somehow merged through some sort of Warp in the West, and Wayrest found themselves at war. Their land had expanded three-fold, but they were under attack by Daggerfall to the west, Orsinium to the east, and Sentinel to the south. There had been no time to understand what had happened, the King said. They had simply reacted, sending their armies to defend their lands against these enemies whose kingdoms had also gained great territorial advantage.\nThe battles continue on, now months later, as I return to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to make my report. What more do I have to say? They are bloody, violent clashes, as is always the case with modern warfare, but I have been to the blackened, desolate no-man's land between the four remaining kingdoms. No mortal army caused that devastation.\nI can say that the force that shook the Iliac Bay on the 10th of Frostfall &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt; was infinitesimally greater than the power these mighty kingdoms are wielding today.\nI can say that there were other strange events on that day which kept the kingdoms from breaking free of the Empire, and accomplished likely more besides.\nAnd I can say there is nothing left of it - this power, this weapon - in the Bay. The Warp that it created swallowed it up.'\nCurrent Political Affairs in the Iliac Bay.\nAlmost twenty years have passed, and the region, though transformed, has stabilized. There are no more disputed territories, and the kingdoms of Daggerfall, Wayrest, Sentinel, and Orsinium hold their new borders in relative peace.\nWayrest spreads across the eastern coast of the Bay, stretching from the land formerly called &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; to half of Gauvadon. Eadwyre has passed on to his ancestors, leaving his kingdom in the hands of his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;, who has two children by her royal consort, and seems likely to hold her father's lands. Your Lordship may also choose to communicate directly with &lt;a href=\"King%20Helseth\"&gt;King Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and Queen Barenziah in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. Their primary preoccupations are, of course, with &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;'s affairs, but they may still have useful observations upon Wayrest's ruling families and political environment that may aid you in your understanding of the court of Queen Elysana.\n&lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;King Gortwog&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; controls much of the Wrothgarian Mountains as well as the profitable rivercoast of the Bjoulsae. He persists in his demands that Orsinium be recognized as an Imperial province separate from High Rock. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; treats Gortwog as a recognized king, and collects taxes directly from Orsinium, but officially Orsinium remains a county of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, though technically it spans both the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell.\nSentinel has gained the most land, sprawling across the entire southern Iliac Bay from &lt;a href=\"Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt;, beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, to the edge of &lt;a href=\"Mournoth\"&gt;Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;'s territory. Queen Akorithi at her death left her enormous kingdom to her only surviving son, &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, who is now surely one of the most powerful kings in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; is still ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; King &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; Queen &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;. Their land now encompasses all of western High Rock, from the border they share with &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt; to the east, to &lt;a href=\"Ykalon\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt; to the north. They have four children now, and are much beloved in their realm.\nIf there are other repercussions of the mysterious Warp in the West, they have not yet come to our attention in the course of twenty years of observation."}

He believes he knows how to defeat the cursed army of Anka-Ra that has laid siege to Craglorn since the Celestials appeared.\"\n\"I learned of a strange Imperial being held captive by the Dragonstar Arena Guard. He claims to know how to defeat the cursed army of Anka-Ra that has laid siege to Craglorn since the Celestials appeared.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter being initiated into the &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers\"&gt;Star-Gazers&lt;/a&gt;, you will find an Argonian named Brown-Tooth on the road back to town. She will tell you that a naked Imperial appeared out of thin air at the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Arena\"&gt;Dragonstar Arena&lt;/a&gt; and started shouting about defeating the &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra\"&gt;Anka-Ra&lt;/a&gt;. He was taken to the Bangkorai Gate. \nHead to the Bangkorai Gate. In a tent to its north, you will find the naked imperial, though he is now wearing underwear. His name is &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Valerius\"&gt;Titus Valerius&lt;/a&gt;; speak with him and he will tell you that he came from the distant past, and he knows how to defeat the Anka-Ra and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Tarish-Zi\"&gt;Emperor Tarish-Zi&lt;/a&gt;. If you agree to free him, he will ask you to meet with him at Buried Sands, a delve not too far to the north. Head in and you will find Titus there, now fully clothed. He will tell you that your target is the ancient burial chamber at the far northwest of the dungeon. Once you reach the chamber, defeat the boss guarding it, and head inside. Titus will tell you that this is in fact his burial chamber. In ages past, he was trying to undermine Tarish-Zi's authority from within his own ranks; the presence of his remains in this burial chamber shows that he failed and was in fact given a military funeral by Tarish-Zi. \nHowever, the chamber also contains one of the three seals you will need to defeat the Anka-Ra. Titus will reveal that Tarish-Zi probably kept records of where his other generals were buried in a great library. The library in question is located in the south of the region, south of the &lt;a href=\"Scorpion%20Ravine\"&gt;Scorpion Ravine&lt;/a&gt;. It is an unmarked location; you will find a door there in a stone structure. Head inside and start helping Titus in looking for the relevant tomes. Investigating the wrong piles of books will summon &lt;a href=\"Tome%20Guardian\"&gt;Tome Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s that will try to kill you, so be on your guard. The tome you're looking for is in the pile furthest from the entrance; show it to Titus and he will read that the generals Tahmin and Riza were buried in the north, near the falls. He will suggest to split up so that he can scout Tarish-Zi's tomb while you recover the seals. \nThe tombs are not actually in the north of Craglorn; Riza's tomb is north of the Scorpion Ravine at the &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Anka-Ra's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; and Tahmin's tomb is northeast of &lt;a href=\"The%20Seeker%27s%20Archive%20%28Location%29\"&gt;the Seeker's Archive&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra%27s%20Mettle\"&gt;Anka-Ra's Mettle&lt;/a&gt;. These are world boss locations, but the boss won't actually spawn unless you interact with the &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazer%20Priest\"&gt;Star-Gazer Priest&lt;/a&gt; there. You will have to fight the respective generals once inside the tombs, but after that, you can claim the seals for yourself. Once you have both of them, head for the &lt;a href=\"Tombs%20of%20the%20Na-Totambu\"&gt;Tombs of the Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Titus there. \nThe tomb is west of the Scorpion Ravine. Head through to the other end of this open-air delve, and you will meet Titus standing by a door. He will tell you the door should open now that all the seals are nearby, and will enter. Head in after him and confront Tarish-Zi in his tomb. He will put up quite a fight, and will summon his allies to aid him in battle. Once he is dead, Titus will tell you to meet him in Belkarth. However, as you head back to the door, the Thief will appear. She will tell you that the reason the Anka-Ra were back is because &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Warrior&lt;/a&gt; has the power to call forth warriors from across time, and that &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; manipulated this to call the villainous Anka-Ra.

The Emperor\u2019s fascination with tigers has been documented elsewhere, though it is this translator\u2019s belief that it was Orylon\u2019s particular nature that colored that appeal. Such notions may become more apparent in the story\u2019s second installment.\"\nWhoa-ho! Are you listening? Watch me beat my drum and tell no lies; may hard fruit from this tibrol tree fall upon my head if I lie (I will not!)! Come, sit! Or dance with your backsides, for I am beating my drum!\nI tell you the tale of Perrif, the water-getting girl, (no, not &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;that Perrif&lt;/a&gt;, another Perrif -- this is an old story and in those days most girls were named after the Paravania), and Orlyan the Inverse Tiger of Cyrod, Black with Orange Stripes, Old Stony, Lord of Dark Fleas and Cake Batter, Always Roaring!\nLong ago near a river branch of the &lt;a href=\"Topal\"&gt;Topal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothri&lt;/a&gt; village sat there very sad: the men were away at skirmish and only the women, girls, and infirm elders were left. They were surrounded by jungle, a great batch of it between their huts and their portion of the river, and tigers were everywhere in those days hide-hissing in the trees. A three-beat for Tigers! Klo! Klo! Klo! So glad you are gone! You ate us! We will make due with pigment drawings! A four beat for their demise! Klo! Klo! Kloppa!\nOne morning it was Perrif\u2019s turn to go get the water (she was eight or nine or ten, I forget! Forgetting is fine, so nothing will fall on me! Ha!). Everyone warned her not to take too long! \u201cThe stripe-cats are out! They did not sleep last night because they can hear better than we can and the skirmish where our men are (while far away to us is cat-senses-close to them) is keeping them up and hungry!\u201d\nLittle Perrif, though, was very brave putting the jugs all in a row on top of her head and making for the jungle roads. But she was not stupid, so she sang a song to Dibe-Mara-Kin, our mothers in the Around-Us, and with that small blessing felt very, very confident. And she was almost to the water before any tigers found her at all, but they surely did! \u201cDon\u2019t run, little water-getting girl!\u201d they said (there were maybe three or four, I forget!) \u201cWe will kill you quick, we promise, but only if you don\u2019t make us run!\u201d Perrif ran so fast that even the tigers went, \u201cWow, that\u2019s an impressive stride, some forty in two drum beats with five jugs on her head\u201d, and that is how come we use this measurement in our current My Tribe Is Better Than Yours Games! No lie! Klo! Hudda!! Kloppa!\nShe ran so fast that she was able to find a giant rock to hide behind, hoping the tigers would lope right past her. And they did! \u201cThank you, three mothers,\u201d she whispered, kneeling and keeping the jugs steady with her hands, and praying some more to DMK just in case. After a while, it all seemed safe, and that is when the giant rock spoke up! (You heard me!)\n\"Praying is all well and good,\" the rock said, booming, \"But I'm the one who hid you from the tigers! My moss-shade! My stone-bigness! And now you owe me a favor!\" And it was true, she did, little Perrif, for in those days as it is now the laws of fancy-story must be kept, and in this case it was courtesy obligation, favor for favor. A three-beat for Favors! Klo! Klo! Klo! (Pay all of yours BACK!)\nThe rock said, \"So now! Roll me to the river and wash me! I'm filthy from the ages!\" And now Perrif could kind of make out a face in the rock, but it was covered so much in grub and lichen that there wasn't much to speak of, so she told herself she was thinking nonsense. While she was looking, the stone spoke up again, saying, \"Roll me, girl! It\u2019s river-time for me! I'm so dirty I can\u2019t stand myself!\"\nSo Perrif began to push, unearthing the rock from the tangle of the jungle floor, and it seemed very light to her despite its size, but she explained away the ease of the effort by tiger-fear (which was still on her!). It was lots and lots of pushing, and so the stone began to sing:\nRoll me down down down to the river that welcomes me\"Ge-rulla seb-seb-seb ytri topali ke wel\u2019kyn-ge\"I am a Welcome Stone\"Ge una Wel\u2019kyn Bal\"Just ask anyone of age, little girl, for they remember me\"Yn set ghyn aka, ky\u2019naless, synd laru\u2019me ge\"I am a Welcome Stone\"Ge yni Wel\u2019kyn Bal\"Wash me up up up and see!

Ald\u2019ald-het!\"I am Orlyan, the Long Gone Stone\"Ge yni Orlyan, the Ald-Het Bal\"The Around-Us will be happy to see me again!\"Aurbex lemha je-je ad\u2019soon al-ge!\"But it might go, \u201cWait, you looked different before!\u201d\"Hyn detta set, \u201cKa, g\u2019e lr\u2019khn nymbo!\u201d\"I am a Verily Stone!\"Ge yni V\u2019arla Bal!\"But it might go, \u201cWait, you looked different before!\u201d\"Hyn detta set, \u201cKa, g\u2019e lr\u2019khn nymbo!\u201d\"I am a Verily Stone!\"Ge yni V\u2019arla Bal!\"\nAfter a long time of pushing, Perrif finally got the big rock near the river\u2019s edge. She flopped to her backside, wiping off sweat, saying, \u201cPlease hold on, mister big rock, we\u2019re almost there. I\u2019m just really tired and somewhere we lost the jugs and that\u2019s going to get me in big trouble, which is going to be even worse if I stay out too late. Which I assume will happen, as I have to wash you still.\u201d\nAnd then the rock made a wistful-yet-gravelly sound, being so close to the water, saying, \u201cAll right, little water-getting girl, rest a bit. I\u2019m content for the moment, just being able to look at the water. Look how silly it is! Water is the silliest thing!\u201d And, at that, the rock started to laugh, O HO! HO HO!, dust and little leaves falling to reveal a face!\nPerrif gasped! The rock\u2019s face had a wide nose and heavy-lidded eyes and a mouthful of stony fangs, for all the world looking like a big-assed tiger head! She screamed, \u201cWait, you looked different before!\u201d\nStone: \"No kidding?\"\nPerrif: \"No kidding. What happened? You were just a normal hiding rock and now you look like a stripe-cat!\"\nStone: \"Ah, well, it must be because Welcome Stones like me absorb some of the thoughts of those that touch us. And you can\u2019t help but imagine a tiger!\"\nNow by this point little Perrif had become so overcome by tiger-fear that she yelped despite herself, kicking the big rock! And then she yelped again because she hurt her foot, and fell down, and got hurt more, and the Welcome Stone couldn\u2019t help but laugh because she looked so stupid. But when Perrif saw that laugh all she saw was the tiger teeth going up and down GRIND GRIND GRIND, and so she kicked the stone again in panic, this time with both feet. And WHOA did the stone start to roll down the hill going WHOA-HO NOW towards the river but little Perrif didn\u2019t notice because the tiger-fear made her run, run, run!\nStone: \"Hey, now waittaminnit! You come back here and wash--\"\nKER-SPLASH! The stone sunk like a rock.\nEnd of Part One."}

What need have we to know of the history and cultures which fragment so frequently, broken apart in so many inconsequential ways? The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Houses&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; monarchs, the warlords of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. What purpose does learning of their petty squabbles and worries serve to lead us towards the Chrononymic Will? If there is any topic of any worth, it is perhaps the environment of which the rest of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; is forced to live within. Factoring out the ever-changing influences of &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, we are left with constants that the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; Gears have created. Sunlight causes green leaves to grow. Winds affect weather and temperature. And water, that which all life is dependent upon, flows through an endless cycle.\nThere is limited knowledge of the water cycle which all things depend upon. Water is heated by the sun and turns to vapor. The vapor floats up within the sky, creating clouds. The clouds grow heavy and release their burdens, letting the water once more return to earth. And so it goes, a never ending-wheel.\nThe water that flows naturally throughout Clockwork City, commonly known as &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt;'s Blood, is rich with the overflow of our innovation. The unfortunate side effect is that it makes this water completely undrinkable for our residents. But in all things He is wise, and in this too He had a plan.\nOur home is shaped by the Divine Metronome, by the will of Lord Seht who sees the correct sequence. Yet even He knew of the beauty in this cycle, in this never-ending circle. And so He gave those who obeyed him the gift of water, of life, within the Halls of Regulation. Where everything is in perfect synchrony.\nAll water flows to the Halls of Regulation, where first it is filtered through fine mesh to separate larger sedimentation. Next the water is sent through the distillation initiator, powered by the cleansing magic to disinfect finer contaminates. Without this magical process, many toxins would still be present in the water when used by the citizens of Clockwork.\nThe cleansed water is then distributed to either the water reservoir or vapor manifold. The water reservoir retains all water given to the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, be it for drinking, bathing, or cleaning. The vapor manifold, however, holds equal importance, for it creates the humidity in the air which allows for organic life. Without it the very air we breathe would be deadly.\nSo join with me in praise for this most important of cycles, created gleaming and perfect by the will of Lord Seht. Perfect and perpetual, ever set in regulation."}

Upon talking to &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that the shout was uttered by &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, summoning the Dragonborn to High Hrothgar. The Jarl (after a heated discussion between &lt;a href=\"Proventus%20Avenicci\"&gt;Proventus Avenicci&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hrongar\"&gt;Hrongar&lt;/a&gt;) will suggest that the Dragonborn should travel to High Hrothgar, so that the Greybeards can educate them in the Way of the Voice.\nGoing to Ivarstead.\nThe first stage of this quest is to travel to &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;. The safest way is to travel via a route south from Whiterun, beginning at the destroyed &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, staying on the main road and heading east through the mountains, passing by &lt;a href=\"Haemar%27s%20Shame\"&gt;Haemar's Shame&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%27s%20Shack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemist's Shack&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, they could follow a route north, around the mountain, but this may present some challenges to low-level player characters (&lt;a href=\"Valtheim%20Towers\"&gt;Valtheim Towers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Toll%20and%20Wispmother%27s%20Well\"&gt;Ruined Toll and Wispmother's Well&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trolled%20Stormcloaks%20Darkwater%20Overhang\"&gt;Trolled Stormcloaks Darkwater Overhang&lt;/a&gt;).\nOnce in Ivarstead, cross the bridge and travel up the \"7000 steps\" to reach High Hrothgar. Before doing so however, talk to some of the villagers as they can provide some information about High Hrothgar. One in particular, &lt;a href=\"Klimmek\"&gt;Klimmek&lt;/a&gt;, will request that they deliver some supplies to High Hrothgar, by placing them in the offering chest located just outside of the building. Doing so will reward them with a leveled amount of gold when they return to let Klimmek know they finished the errand.\nThe 7000 steps.\nOne should be careful when traveling up the steps, as there is an array of enemies that could be encountered, including a (fixed) &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost troll&lt;/a&gt; and other random leveled enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;snow bears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn is at a higher level, they can also come across a dragon. The Frost Troll can be difficult to defeat for a lower leveled Dragonborn and there are a wide range of different strategies which could be used when confronting it, including:\nStrategies.\nThe temporary effect &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Voice of the Sky&lt;/a&gt; can be gained whilst traveling up the steps, by reading the ten etched tablets along the path. A short distance after the troll encounter is High Hrothgar, and the next stage of the quest.\nHigh Hrothgar.\nOnce the Dragonborn has made it up the 7000 steps they will arrive at High Hrothgar. Go inside and they will be approached by four members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, but only one will talk:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;. He will ask the Dragonborn to demonstrate their abilities. Use one of the Shouts on Arngeir, the Shouts cannot hurt them. After speaking to Arngeir, the Dragonborn\u00a0must demonstrate their newly learned word of power for Unrelenting Force on three spectral forms. Then go to the High Hrothgar Courtyard to learn and demonstrate the Whirlwind Sprint shout. After that, Arngeir tells them their training is complete. He will then task the Dragonborn to travel to the Nordic ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt; to recover the Horn of &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; to be permitted to learn the final Word of Unrelenting Force from the Greybeards, starting \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

{"id": "17790", "revid": "25646820", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17790", "title": "The Wayward Knight", "text": "The Wayward Knight is a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; in . The &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Daedric Invasion&lt;/a&gt; has spread far and wide across Cyrodiil. Gates have opened at virtually every major town. &lt;a href=\"Farwil\"&gt;Farwil&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Thorn\"&gt;Knights of the Thorn&lt;/a&gt; have entered the gate outside &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nFarwil's father &lt;a href=\"Count%20Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Count Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0fears for his son's safety, but must prepare for battle. &lt;a href=\"Amminus%20Gregori\"&gt;Amminus Gregori&lt;/a&gt; and his men patrol the gate itself. Nothing has come out since the Count's son went inside the\u00a0Oblivion Gate.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter speaking to the Count, head to the Oblivion Gate outside the city and meet up with Amminus. He will advise the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; not to go in, as it is dangerous and he says that he is guarding the entrance; but so far nothing has come out, not even Farwil and his Knights. They have been gone for two days, and the Count is offering a reward for the safe return of his son, or failing that, proof of his demise.\nGo through the gate and soon they will see the fate of one of Farwil's men. Clear the path of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; along the way\u2014they will have to go through some caves as well, where the rest of the men met their fate. \nExpected walkthrough.\nFinally the Hero will meet up with &lt;a href=\"Farwil\"&gt;Farwil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bremman%20Senyan\"&gt;Bremman&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with Farwil to hear an exaggerated version of what has happened, and speak with Bremman for the real version. After that, head over the bridge to the Chaos Stronghold. There are a few &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; guarding the bridge, but try not to knock them over the ledge, as Farwil and Bremman might decide to jump into the lava after them.\nOnce inside the tower, try to keep Farwil alive by healing him with Target or other healing spells (Farwil also heals himself if the player waits an hour). If the Hero accidentally hits either of the two, and they begin to attack, use block and talk to them in order to yield (sometimes Bremman rejects the yield even though you have 100 disposition; the Hero should do their best to avoid hitting them, but if they can't help it use a charm spell on them, then try to yield again). Unfortunately, they seem to get in the way a lot since they are both melee-based characters.\nWhen the Hero arrives at the top of the tower, take the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternative walkthrough.\nFarwil and company tend to rush straight into combat, making it difficult for the Hero to be stealthy, to do any side exploring, or to simply keep them alive. Leaving the others behind can make the tower crawl easier, but there are hazards to be dealt with using this approach and thus is not recommended for a low level Hero.\nImmediately after Farwil forces dialog, the Hero should exit the conversation immediately. Facing the bridge to the tower, turn right and descend to the edge of the lava while avoiding the fireball towers. There should be an island off to the right. \nWith sufficient combinations of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;water walking&lt;/a&gt;, run or swim to the island. Pause to &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt; if required. Then, turn towards the bridge and run or swim to the tower island. This will put the Hero on the island behind the closed gate. With sufficient &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero can jump up on the bridge. This is easier to do on the far side of the bridge and that area is reached by going under the bridge. Kill whatever Dremora are on the bridge and the tower door is right before the Hero.\nEnter the tower and reach the sigil stone at the top. Taking the stone will close the gate and it will bring Farwil and company back to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nSecond alternative walkthrough.\nAfter getting the quest from a citizen of Cheydinhal, go directly to the gate outside of town and enter it. It is not necessary to speak to the Count or the guards at the gate. \nOnce inside the gate, proceed until the second entrance to The Bowels tunnels appears. Instead of going in, turn around and scale the cliff down. Proceed to left until the bridge appears on the right. Somewhere before Farwil engages the Hero, go down the right side and proceed as above to the tower via the island.\nThird alternative walkthrough.\nAnother approach is for the Hero to kill Farwill and company themselves. If done in Oblivion, this does not incur a bounty. It does sacrifice the magical item rewards of the request, but then allows the Hero to solo the rest of the tower at their leisure.\nDenouement.\nAfter the Hero, Farwil, and Bremman (if they survived) get back, talk to Farwil. He will give the Hero an amulet with a Fortify Speechcraft enchantment, and make them an honorary Knight of the Thorn. If the first or second alternate methods were chosen, Farwil will still respond as if he went all the way with the Hero, though this might just be his usual over-the-top bravado speaking.\nAdditionally, speaking to the Count will allow the Hero a choice between two items: the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Indarys\"&gt;Staff of Indarys&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Thornblade\"&gt;Thornblade&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompletion of this quest will also grant the Hero partial completion of the \"&lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;Allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\" quest.\nIf Farwil was killed along the way, the Count will instead reward the Hero with 75\u2013450 gold for their efforts. If they also managed to recover &lt;a href=\"Indarys%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;Farwil's signet ring&lt;/a&gt;, the Count awards them with an extra 200 gold and allows them to keep the ring."}

She asked me to help convince a man in the stocks to enlist.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen you come to the &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost%20Downs\"&gt;Hoarfrost Downs&lt;/a&gt;, you may stumble across an argument between &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Thayer\"&gt;Captain Thayer&lt;/a&gt; and her superior, &lt;a href=\"General%20Tibbin\"&gt;General Tibbin&lt;/a&gt; over rectuitment. Talk to Thayer afterward and she will tell you that the guard here is understaffed and rectuitment has been very slow since the start of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Montclair's&lt;/a&gt; war. She will lose her position if she cannot get new recruits, so she will ask you to help her talk some people into joining. She will point you toward &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Dathieu\"&gt;Martin Dathieu&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently in the stocks but will be released if he joins up. \nHead over to the stocks and talk to Martin. He will refuse to join the guard, as he fears he will get killed and his family will starve without him. He also thinks there is no evidence against him and that he will be a free man again soon. Take this information to &lt;a href=\"Deputy%20Ascenge\"&gt;Deputy Ascenge&lt;/a&gt;, who is standing nearby. He will say that there is actually evidence that Martin committed the crime, and that the man who would have vouched for Martin's innocence was probably also involved. From here, there are three people you can talk to to get more information. You can talk to Olivier who is east of the fighters guild, or you can talk to Martin's mother or sister, both of which are at the inn. \nIf you talk to Olivier, he will tell you that they did in fact commit the crime, but that he will not vouch for Martin. He can be intimidated to vouch for Martin's innocence though. If you do this, . if you do not, you will get nothing out of this conversation. Either way, Martin's &lt;a href=\"Aubrey%20Dathieu\"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Serine%20Dathieu\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; will be in the inn. If you talk to the sister, she will refuse to tell you if the family's financial situation is really that dire, but you can persuade her to tell you this. If you do so, she will tell you that he has only ever been a drain on their finances, and that it would be better if he enlisted with the guard. The last person to talk to is Martin's mother, on the second floor. She will say that she thinks Martin should join the guard and make something of his life like his father, &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt;. Martin thinks his father died without honour in King Ranser's war, but if you have completed the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Traitor%27s%20Tale\"&gt;A Traitor's Tale&lt;/a&gt;,\" you can tell the mother that he died with honour, and she will ask you to tell Martin that. \nAfter talking to all of these people, head back to Martin. You can present him with any of the reasons you got from the people you talked to, and he will agree to enlist with the guard. After this, talk to Captain Thayer again to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bandit\"&gt;The Bandit&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

It is hoped that the meeting will go smoothly.\nDetailed Walkthrough.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"Messages%20Across%20Tamriel\"&gt;Messages Across Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, Vanus Galerion will be inside the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guildhall\"&gt;Fighters Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; of your alliance capital, which is either &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Pact&lt;/a&gt; players, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; players and &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; players. He tells you that everything is ready for the summit at &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;. Once you inform him you are ready, enter the portal he opens.\nYou, Galerion and Countess Hakruba of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, will all arrive at the northwestern edge of the ruins where representatives from each of the three alliances have gathered. Vanus has assembled a team of experts on Coldharbour and he asks you to meet them on the way to the negotiation table.\nThe summit takes place at a table in the center of the island, southeast of where you arrived on Stirk. Galerion will greet each expert as you make your way up the path. The experts include &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Clarisse%20Laurent\"&gt;Lady Clarisse Laurent&lt;/a&gt;, Telenger the Artificer and Captain Alphuary.\nNegotiations Begin.\nOnce you climb the stairs to the meeting point, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; will approach the table from the left, where the Daggerfall Covenant camp is. Then, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; exits from her portal across from you. Finally, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; appears between the Ebonheart Pact banners on the right.\nAyrenn speaks first asking the other rulers to put aside their differences. However, King Emeric questions the meeting and asks if it is a ruse, a plan to divert Daggerfall and Ebonheart forces while the Dominion takes the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Jorunn adds that he thought backstabbing was Ayrenn's favorite tactic. Ayrenn responds to both by replying that &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; is more powerful than either of the other two alliances. Emeric refuses to help because he says he will not endanger his kingdom based on the words of Jorunn and Ayrenn.\nAn Alternate Plan.\nVanus interrupts their arguing, but all of the rulers have left the negotiations. You suggest to Vanus and Countess Hakruba that the guilds lead the attack. Vanus suggests you visit each leader individually to propose the idea, while Hakruba reminds you of the non-interference pact that binds the guilds. In order to fight Molag Bal's forces across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, each leader must accept the guilds' presence in his or her realm. All three leaders must consent to the new plan.\nConvincing the Alliance Leaders.\nBoth Emeric and Ayrenn disagree with Jorunn's stubbornness. However, you persuade Emeric and intimidate Ayrenn, who responds that she cares about her people and that her legacy will be one of a bold and decisive leader. Talking to Jorunn reveals that he tried to get the other leaders to co-operate.\nEmeric believes Ayrenn has no right to impose her will on all of Tamriel, but after some persuasion he agrees to consider the plan. King Jorunn refuses to be swayed by an \"&lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; lapdog\" until you intimidate him by questioning his legacy as the king who surrendered to Molag Bal. Queen Ayrenn is hesitant about sending the guilds against an unknown enemy but agrees because the other alliances will never unite and stop Molag Bal otherwise.\nMolag Bal's Forces Assault Stirk.\nYou tell Vanus, who has now moved to the table, of the agreement. However, he senses something is wrong as the air suddenly feels heavier, as if a storm is approaching.\n&lt;a href=\"Caldien\"&gt;Caldien&lt;/a&gt;, who has been announcing each of the rulers, suddenly drops to one knee and says, \"He has arrived.\" He pleads for Vanus to get away from him and run, before he is struck by lightning, and Molag Bal appears behind him. Molag Bal plans to destroy all three of the alliances at once because their leaders are all in one place. He announces his plan to rule all of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and disappears, killing Caldien and causing &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to spill out of newly opened rifts.\nThe island is under attack from Daedra pouring out of rifts around the island. Galerion will prevent more rifts from opening, while Countess Hakruba protects the leaders and you close the unstable rifts. In the Ebonheart Pact area, the Skald-King is under attack from a great &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Sormorask\"&gt;Sormorask&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ra%27Lorka\"&gt;Ra'Lorka&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"harvester\"&gt;harvester&lt;/a&gt;, is attacking Queen Ayrenn in the Dominion camp, and &lt;a href=\"Bitterwind\"&gt;Bitterwind&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;storm atronach&lt;/a&gt;, attacks King Emeric.\nYou return to Vanus who fears there is no time to waste. He and Hakruba confront the leaders in a speech asking them to trust the guilds and sanction their actions. Emeric and Jorunn agree, and Ayrenn remarks that much of their distrust was sown by Molag Bal.\nThe Battle of Coldharbour Begins.\nOnce you successfully repel the Daedra, Vanus announces that the time has come, and you follow him into a valley with a portal directly to Coldharbour. The assault force is mobilized, and you lead the army into Coldharbour."}

We dedicate our lives to protecting our homeland, to fight back against the dark tides of evil. Wherever malice rears its ugly head, wherever villains threaten our citizens, that is where we shall be.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; may be where we lay our heads, our order answers any urgent call. This need for quick mobility is what led the first of our order to bond with &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;gryphons&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of these creatures, our order is able to quickly move to far away locations. This is what led the Welkynars to choose Cloudrest as the home of our Aerie, given the city's central location within the island.\nOur order numbers four, representative of each of the cardinal directions. When one member decides to retire or dies in the line of duty, another is chosen to replace them. This initiate's training will take years to complete, as they will need to first capture and raise their own gryphon companion.\nEach Welkynar is chosen for his or her combat abilities. Though our order is well known for producing some of the finest battlemages within Summerset, magical ability is not necessarily a requirement to join. After all, Mornyalemar the Battle-Hardy is thought to be one of the greatest Welkynars to ever live, and had not one ounce of magical ability. An initiate need only prove themselves highly capable in battle to join our ranks.\nAny member of either Summerset governance or military may petition the Wekynars for aid. Of course, accepting the petition has always been up to the order's discretion. Between assignments, our members continue to patrol Summerset for signs of danger, often stopping in cities and collecting information on any potential threats.\nYes, a Welkynar never truly rests. But for this lifelong dedication, we ensure the safety of every citizen of Summerset. There is truly no greater honor than joining the ranks of this prestigious order."}

This quest is only available once the Dragonborn reaches level 20 and the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed.\nBackground.\n\"Balgruuf the Greater, Jarl of Whiterun, has a troubled child. He's asked me to help the boy.\"\nWalkthrough.\nHearing a rumor about the Jarl's children from &lt;a href=\"Hulda\"&gt;Hulda&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt; begins a &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous quest&lt;/a&gt; to \"Ask about Balgruuf's strange children\". This requires speaking with &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, he is in &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, but if the Dragonborn sided with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, he is in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; basement. When asked about his children, he reveals he is having problems with his youngest son, &lt;a href=\"Nelkir\"&gt;Nelkir&lt;/a&gt;, who has taken a sudden dark turn in his personality. This completes the miscellaneous objective and begins the true quest \"The Whispering Door.\"\nAfter a series of disrespectful words and a few dirty secrets of Balgruuf's, Nelkir tells the Dragonborn how the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Lady\"&gt;Whispering Lady&lt;/a&gt; tells him secrets. He directs the Dragonborn to the locked door in the basement (the \"Old Wooden Door\" or \"The Whispering Door\").\n(Listen at door) \"At last. I've been waiting for someone more fit to carry out my will. The child is spirited, but lacks... agency.\"\nOnce there, when the Dragonborn listens at the door, a voice tells them that they are more worthy than Nelkir (\"The child is spirited, but lacks... agency\"). She reveals herself to be &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, and orders the Dragonborn to open the door. When asked how, she says that all of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; is experiencing a severe case of paranoia, and that the boy knows of what she speaks. In order to find who has the keys, it is necessary to talk to Nelkir again. He says only &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt; and Jarl Balgruuf carry the key, and adds that \"nobody will notice if Farengar went missing - I promise you.\"\nAt this point, it is necessary to find the Jarl or Farengar. If the Dragonborn sided with the Stormcloaks, then the Jarl is back at the Blue Palace, but Farengar always remains at Dragonsreach regardless of Balgruuf's location.\n\"Excellent work. Now, I trust you're sharp enouh\" \"to see that the sword doesn't match the description of the Ebony Blade you may know. It has languished too long outside the winds of alliance and betrayal. To return to its past glory, it must first drink the blood of deceit. Your world is admirably seeped in lies and inclinations. My blade is a darling leech that feeds on deceptions, and nourishes its master. Seek out those closest to you. The final pluck of their misguided heartstrings will accompany my blade in the songs of your grandeur.\"\nAfter acquiring the key and unlocking the door, Mephala instructs the Dragonborn to take the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;, which is next to a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Admonition%20Against%20Ebony\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; warning of its corrupting evil.\nMephala now says the Ebony Blade does not match its legendary description, and has fallen to a lesser form due to its aging without use. In order to restore its former strength, it must taste the \"blood of deceit\". For the blade to do this, the Dragonborn must kill someone who trusts them: a person for whom a quest was done, or a follower. Collecting the weapon completes the quest, although the blade still needs \"charging.\"\nPeople who trust the Dragonborn can be identified based on what they say. They may say something like \"It is a fine day with you around\", or \"You've been a good friend to me. That means something.\" However, it is far easier to simply use a follower. Considering this, it may be easiest to use the Ebony Blade in the quests \"&lt;a href=\"Boethiah%27s%20Calling\"&gt;Boethiah's Calling&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Taste%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Taste of Death&lt;/a&gt;,\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Lights%20Out%21\"&gt;Lights Out!&lt;/a&gt;.\""}
{"id": "877134", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=877134", "title": "The Whistle", "text": "The Whistle is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Orsinium%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nIt was in the summer of my thirteenth year that I first discovered the whistle and my peculiar talent. I had long before then suspected that I had within me some latent and as yet-undiscovered skill that would, in time, set me apart from my peers and elevate me above them.\nAs a child, I had always related poorly to people and consequently I was the butt of many jokes and japes, especially among the bigger, stronger children, who had by then already begun to distinguish themselves as warriors and woodcutters and in other such burly professions while my slight build caused me to lag far behind in such pursuits. But among animals I found many and devoted friends, and so even at my loneliest, I was rarely without companionship.\nNow, it happened that some of the older children, being, as I have suggested, cruel and lording their superior strength over me, got it into their heads to play a mean trick. The trick was that they had found a whistle which produced a note that drove many creatures wild, but especially the &lt;a href=\"durzog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Durzogs&lt;/a&gt; of our homeland. They took me to a cave where a pack of durzogs had recently made their den and bade me to blow the whistle, or else they would beat me. As I have said, these children were much stronger than me and also cruel; many times I had limped home from a beating I'd received at their hands.\nBut I think now that the threat of beating would not have been enough to compel me to blow the whistle, had it not also been accompanied by jeers and insults, questioning my bravery. For though it was indisputable that I lagged behind them in strength, I was determined that none could outmatch me in courage or strength of spirit.\nTherefore, choosing what I knew would undoubtedly be the greater pain\u2014though not so great a pain as the shame of being branded a coward would have been\u2014I took the whistle and blew a strong, clear note on it, holding it longer than seemed wise, so as to settle the question of my fearlessness. My tormentors, on hearing the note, revealed their true nature and pleaded with me to stop blowing the whistle and wondered aloud whether I was crazy and said that I had a death wish.\nI did not stop blowing the whistle, but held the note until I saw the durzogs emerge from their lair, teeth bared and lips curled. When I stopped, they stopped. For a moment then, we stared at each other inquiringly. They were not a few feet away from me, and they waited, as if for a signal. I put the whistle to my lips again and blew another note. The durzogs again approached, but their malice did not seem to be aimed at me. In fact, they seemed to implore me for instruction. I tested this theory by gesturing upward as I had done many times with my dogs at home; like the dogs, at this gesture, the durzogs reared on their hind legs, in unison. I tried again, blowing the whistle along with the gesture for \"sit\" and \"lie down.\" The durzogs responded readily.\nNow the sight of this had lifted the fear from my tormentors who now were begging for a chance to use the whistle themselves and to command the durzogs. I confess I took delight in refusing them, for finally I found that they were envious of me and I felt that I had earned their respect.\nBut the largest of them, a dimwit named Reggid, clopped me over the head and took the whistle. I had barely got my senses about me (such was the force with which he hit me), when I heard him blow on the whistle and registered the subsequent snarls of the durzogs. As my vision clarified, I saw the animals rush toward Reggid with a murderous fury. They leapt and tore at his flesh, and he cried out to me, begging for me to take the whistle and to call the durzogs off. But I did not.\nThe others looked on in horror as the beasts devoured Reggid, but at that moment I am not afraid to confess I felt nothing but pride. I have long held that animals can tell better than we who is virtuous and who is not, and that day I felt my beliefs vindicated.\nWhen the animals had feasted, they returned to their den for a slumber. None of the others dared claim the whistle, but I have kept it with me all of this time, and used it in the taming and training of durzogs in many places across Tamriel. Never once have I had a beast turn on me."}

If only Dame Clarique can be convinced to free him.\nWalk over to Dame Clarique and talk to her. She is convinced he is a bandit. When the Vestige says he was trying to save the village she asks them why they trust him. We have only seen the cultists and no villagers. Either persuade her or offer to help but then his assistance is needed. Dame Clarique sends the Vestige to the docks to see what is happening if they want to help.\nHead down to the docks, sneaking past cultists if possible or if a Bloodthorn disguise is used, move among them undetected for a while. Arriving at the docks several villagers are held, free four of them and then look for Sellan's house and go inside.\nLook for clues to find out how to start the ritual. There is a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Tamien%20Sellan\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; on a table, a &lt;a href=\"Merien%20Sellan%27s%20Spellbook\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt; also on a table and four items can be found in the room that are necessary for the ritual. A ritual candle, glass gems, a bottle of masking salve and an urn with ashes in it.\nGo upstairs to the spell table, but first look at the &lt;a href=\"Merien%27s%20Incantation\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; with the incantation on the wine rack. Activate the spelltable and it will say: \"This table is prepared for ritual magic, simply waiting for an incantation to begin the process.\" Say the words, \"The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, my wife Amelie, my birthplace &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, my son Tamien.\"\nMerien's Spell Table.\n\"The salve hums with power as the scent of cherries wafts up from the table\"\n\"The burning odor of the candle mixes with the cherry scent of the salve. The spell increases in power.\"\nAfter placing the salve and the candle the two other items must be placed in the right order or the spell will fizzle and will not work.\n\"Success! The spell is complete!\"\nA ghostly figure will appear. When spoken to, they will be surprised that the Vestige can cast his spell. He is Merien Sellan, Tamien's father. The Vestige will need to let him know his son told them to bring the villagers there to hide. He will ask where he is, but then will change his mind, saying there is no time, as the Bloodthorns must be stopped."}

Consequently, he seeks the aid of the Dragonborn in his quest to recover it.\nUpon accepting the quest from Nurelion, he will produce &lt;a href=\"Nurelion%27s%20Mixture\"&gt;Nurelion's Mixture&lt;/a&gt; to help gain access to the phial. It is learned that the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Cave\"&gt;Forsaken Cave&lt;/a&gt; is the final resting place of his coveted phial and that the cave is located west of Windhelm.\nForsaken Cave.\nThe Dragonborn will encounter wolves, &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;snow bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost trolls&lt;/a&gt; upon entering the cave, and &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; as they progress deeper into it. The corridors lead into a small chamber guarded by several draugr. Two of the draugr stand in alcoves on the wall, and can be killed before they wake up. An adept locked door to the left of the entrance contains basic loot.\nThe path continues to the north-west, passing through a room guarded by two &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; draugr, and ends at the door to the Forsaken Crypt. On the shelves beside the door are several helpful potions.\nForsaken Crypt.\nThe Dragonborn enters into a room patrolled by a single draugr, then follows the path east to a bridge leading over the first room that they had entered. On the other side of the bridge is a draugr and a chest. A room to the north is guarded by two draugr, and then a circular section in the middle of the floor will attempt to crush the Dragonborn against spikes on the ceiling when first stepped onto \u2013 this occurs even if the Light Foot perk has been purchased. An expert locked door to the left of the entrance leads to a chest containing basic loot, before the path continues southwards to a covered walkway. Two draugr wait on the other side of the walkway, and a further two wait in alcoves around the corner.\nProceeding through the iron door, the Dragonborn passes through a hallway with two swinging axes into &lt;a href=\"Curalmil\"&gt;Curalmil&lt;/a&gt;'s burial chamber. Upon entering the room, Curalmil emerges from his sarcophagus, accompanied by several draugr guards. A platform behind the sarcophagus contains a chest and a Word Wall for the &lt;a href=\"Marked%20for%20Death\"&gt;Marked for Death&lt;/a&gt; shout. A passageway beneath the Word Wall leads to a room containing a basin that can be activated and filled with Nurelion's Mixture. This opens a hidden door into the chamber containing the White Phial. There are also many alchemical &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Game%20at%20Dinner\"&gt;A Game at Dinner&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA door in the south corner of Curalmil's burial chamber leads back to the Forsaken Cave. A lever on the wall opens a hidden door, and the Dragonborn emerges into the room where they had first encountered the bears or frost trolls.\nReturning with the Phial.\nUpon returning to his shop in Windhelm, Nurelion has become even sicker than before. Upon inspecting the phial, he is livid that the phial is cracked and vociferates at having sent such a clumsy adventurer to retrieve his life's ambition. With his lifetime dream broken, he is crushed and only manages to reward the Dovahkiin with 5 .\nNurelion's apprentice, Quintus Navale, may optionally be spoken to, as he is much more sympathetic to the Dragonborn's ordeal, he explains that Nurelion is not well and parts with a more reasonable reward of 500 .\nRepairing.\nAfter completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;The Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;\" (or if it is completed already), Quintus sends a letter by &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt; regarding the White Phial.

And it was a city of pleasant promenades, of learned scholars, of meticulous artisans, and of lissome dancers. And also did Delodiil have warriors fierce and proud, who protected the promenades, and the scholars, and the artisans, and the dancers. And though the warriors were few, they were bold.\nNow the people of Delodiil worshiped many gods, for they were devout and held all the Divines in reverence. But above all others they did venerate the Lady of Light, building for &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Merid-Nunda&lt;/a&gt; a chapel of colored rays and beams, which was for glory like a piece of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; brought down to the mortal world. And the people of Delodiil were proud thereon.\nBut across the valley was another city, &lt;a href=\"Abagarlas\"&gt;Abagarlas&lt;/a&gt;, which was to the darkness as Delodiil was to the light. Now Abagarlas had as many citizens as Delodiil, but few were dancers, artisans, and scholars, because most were warriors fierce and proud. These warriors were to other states and cities for the making of war in return for wealth. And thus did Abagarlas, in its own way, prosper.\nNow the King of Abagarlas saw the chapel of lights that was the pride of Delodiil, and he said, \"Is not Abagarlas as great a city as Delodiil? We shall have a great chapel of our own.\" And he decreed that much of the wealth of Abagarlas be spent in the building of a shrine to his own patron Divine, who was the Lord &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Mola Gbal&lt;/a&gt;. And the people of Abagarlas reared up a vast shrine to Mola Gbal, but they were but rude soldiers rather than artisans, and the shrine was misshapen, ill-colored, and burdensome to look upon. But it was, nonetheless, larger than Delodiil's chapel of lights, and thus the King of Abagarlas boasted that his city was greater therefore than Delodiil. But the people of Delodiil evinced no dismay, and went about their business as before.\nAnd this unconcern of the Delodiils ate a hole into the heart of the King of Abagarlas, and he was vexed unto madness. He sent soldiers to profane the small shrine to Merid-Nunda in Abagarlas, and then went to his vast shrine to Mola Gbal, where he swore a mighty oath. And slaying a family of visiting Delodiils on the altar, the King vowed that he would gather his army, march across the valley, and capture all the Delodiils, sacrificing them to Mola Gbal within the chapel of lights.\nAnd the King of Abagarlas mustered all his soldiers, and on a night in which the skies were lit by a furious racing aurora, he marched them across the valley to Delodiil. But when the King and his army arrived they found the land empty, for the city of Delodiil was gone, unto every brick!\nAnd the King thought he heard laughter in the lights in the skies, mirth that turned to shrieks of fear that came, not from above, but from back across the valley. In haste the King marched his soldiers back to his city, but when they arrived at Abagarlas, they found it utterly destroyed as if by scorching light. And of the families of the soldiers and the King, nothing could be found but their shadows burnt into the walls of the city.\nThus Abagarlas. But of the fate of Delodiil, nothing more was known."}

No one makes a name spending their whole life in a small town. I plan to document the noteworthy incidents of my travels so I have them for a book I'm going to write when I retire from adventuring.\nDay 7\nI had to defend myself from a bandit attack on the road today. I guess they didn't expect me to be more proficient with a blade than they were, but fortunately my training paid off. I dispatched one, and the other two fle, wounded. I did not relish the act, and while I realize that it was either him or me, I hope I do not have to do so again in the future. Now it's time to get past this unpleasant incident and focus on building my legend!\nDay 16\nI helped rescue a family's cow from a burning barn today! I got a little singed, but they gave me a jug of fresh milk, a block of cheese, and told me to stop by whenever I passed through this area. My &lt;a href=\"renown\"&gt;renown&lt;/a&gt; is growing, and I look forward to more adventures in the days to come.\nDay 22\nI've already encountered some strange things in my travels but without question the most disturbing so far was watching that man take his own life just outside the town of &lt;a href=\"Goldfolly\"&gt;Goldfolly&lt;/a&gt;. He was sobbing and incoherent, and there was nothing I could do as he brought the knife across his wrists. At first I was reluctant to go through his belongings, but my rumbling stomach overrode my misgivings. It looked like he was just setting off on a trip, and his provisions were fully packed and unused. I briefly considered bringing the body back to town, but they would just as likely condemn me for dragging a corpse into their midst as thank me for returning him. I couldn't just leave him to rot though, so I left a letter under the door of the Inn and watched from a nearby hill as he was buried the next day.\nOn a related note, I believe I've acquired my first magical item from this unfortunate fellow. I'm not sure what this amulet is supposed to do exactly, but the way it glows tells me that it must hold some type of power. I believe it will help me in my future endeavors. Soon enough, I'll be in full enchanted armor with a blazing sword!\nDay 24\nHaving touble sleeping. I believe this wooded area must be haunted as I keep hearing voices. I'm sure my spirits will improve when I emerge from this shrouded forest.\nDay 26\nI haven't slept in days. The voices have gotten louder and more persistent every day, even after I left the woods. I am haunted by the death I caused and the death I did not prevent. I have tried to bury the amulet in the forest, but I cannot bring myself to leave it.\nDay 30\nI am a monster and I don't deserve to live.\nTrivia.\nAs the quest item in the Inventory, the title is \"A Young Traveler's Journal.\""}

She is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Larak\"&gt;Chief Larak&lt;/a&gt;. She can also serve as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; and can be &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nBorgakh is first encountered either using the training dummy in front of &lt;a href=\"Larak%27s%20Longhouse\"&gt;Larak's Longhouse&lt;/a&gt; or being inside the house itself. If engaged in conversation, she expresses her envy towards the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who, unlike her, can travel wherever and whenever they wish.\nShe explains that she will soon be of age and, by tradition, will be married to one of the Orc chiefs from another stronghold. To that end, she trains so that she may offer her strength to the other tribe while her own people will receive good trade in return, thus benefiting both tribes. Asking for Borgakh's opinion on the matter will have her confess that she actually feels caged. She admits that, while she once looked forward to meeting new people and seeing new places when being of age, she no longer feels the same way about it. Furthermore, she elaborates on that it is the chieftain who actually chooses which chief she will have to marry, and that she still has no idea who that will be.\nWhen requesting Borgakh to become a follower, she will at first decline, stating that, despite her feelings, she will follow the traditions of her people, and that she does not want to shame her ancestors. However, after further persuasion (or through paying off her dowry), she will choose to follow the Dragonborn after all, quoting that &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; also teaches the Orcs to follow their own fate.\nWhen Borgakh becomes a follower, she will confess her feelings for the Dragonborn when the latter is wearing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, calling them strong and clever while declaring marriage feels right this time. After the wedding ceremony is over she will remark that &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; weddings are vastly different from Orc weddings, observing that Nord weddings involve less blood and violence.\nFollower.\nBorgakh comes well-equipped with &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcish armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"steel%20plate%20armor\"&gt;steel plate armor&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel armor&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the level the Dragonborn is upon first meeting her. She wields an &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Sword\"&gt;Orcish sword&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20bow\"&gt;Orcish bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nBorgakh primarily uses a &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, making her a good tank if well-equipped. She will not use the &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; unless the enemy is out of range. She is also skilled at &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;, making her slightly more versatile.\nUpon dismissing her, she will return to her home at &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Khazgur%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mor Khazgur&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"I envy you, outlander.

Supposedly, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hanse\"&gt;Hanse&lt;/a&gt; was the obvious choice for succession, however the Moot's failure to appoint him High King ultimately led to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fourth Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; learned of his place of burial while on a search for the Jagged Crown. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; was sent to retrieve the crown from &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt; where a skirmish between &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; soldiers took place.

Because of this, many view them as barbarians. Despite their infamy, they are known to be extremely agile and quick. Their nimbleness serves them best in any art involving thievery. Many are well respected &lt;a href=\"Archery\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, due to their inherent mastery of the bow.\nThe Wood Elves are the various barbarian Elven clanfolk of the Western Valenwood forests.

Tree Sap suggests the wild vitality and youthful energy of the Wood Elves, in contrast with their more dour cousins, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Language\"&gt;Aldmeri Language&lt;/a&gt; \"bos\" means \"forest\" and \"mer\" means \"people,\" so \"Bosmer\" translates to \"Forest People.\"\nAccording to the Elder Scrolls Online \"Ask Us Anything\" Forum &lt;a href=\"http%3A//elderscrollsonline.com/en/news/post/2013/05/06/ask-us-anything-variety-pack-4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, elves of all three kinds (Bosmer, Dunmer, Altmer) live about two or three times longer than the other races (humans, Orsimer, Khajiit, and Argonians). A 200 year old elf is old, a 300 year old elf is very old. Anyone older than that has prolonged their life through powerful magic. Orsimer, while technically Mer, are counted as \"beast-race\" according to this.\nValenwood.\nValenwood is a south-western region of the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and home to the Wood Elves. Valenwood is a largely uninhabited forest wilderness. The coasts of Valenwood are dominated by mangrove swamps and tropical rain forests, while heavy rainfalls nurture the temperate inland rain forests. The Bosmer live in timber clanhouses at sites scattered along the coast and through the interior, connected only by undeveloped foot trails. (See the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;).\nPhysiology.\nThe Bosmer are one of the smallest races in Tamriel with males being smaller than females. They are born with skin colors ranging from light brown to pale tan to light green. Some Bosmer also may have horns. Biologically, the Bosmer are cousins of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, or Dark Elves, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, or Orcs, and the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, or High Elves. The Wood Elves lineage is less noble than that of the Altmer, but they have adapted well to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s fled mainland &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, they joined the Bosmer in seclusion, eventually being totally assimilated by the Bosmer. This probably significantly affected biology of modern-day Bosmer.\nHistory.\nThe Bosmer province of Valenwood was claimed as a wasteland province of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and its geography is partially described in several Imperial surveys. The Bosmer live in many different towns. However, due to the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, they have built none of them themselves. The Wood Elves permitted a few roads to be built by the Second Empire, but neglect their maintenance, as the Bosmer do not need roads to move easily through the thickest forest; these roads would be now overgrown were it not for the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, who have repaired and widened them for rapid passage of their arms to and from the coast.\nBeginnings.\nThe Bosmer are commonly believed to have had constantly changing forms known as \"&lt;a href=\"Changeling\"&gt;Changeling&lt;/a&gt;s\" during the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, and were eventually taught to maintain one shape by &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; under the terms of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Those who refused were largely killed in the ensuing war and had their spirits bound to the &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;Ooze&lt;/a&gt;. Writings describe the Bosmer's settling on the shores of Valenwood in a different way than most historical records describe. It says that the Bosmer (or Aldmer/Altmer) of the time wanted to be free of the main-stream way of life on Alinor (or the Summerset Isles) and instead wanted to live a life of simplicity in the forest and, because of this, left their home of their own accord. However, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Geographic%20Society\"&gt;Imperial Geographic Society&lt;/a&gt; describe the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; (or Altmer) landing on the shores of the province in ancient times, and leaving some of their own people behind so that they would have ties to the Tamrielic mainland when in a time of need (this would explain the supposed pact of old that they made which gave the Thalmor the right to annex Valenwood at the beginning of the Aldmeri Dominion's revival).\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First Era was founded after King &lt;a href=\"Eplear\"&gt;Eplear&lt;/a&gt;, a Bosmer, and founder of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, began his rule. Soon after this founding, the Bosmeri began to change, to suit the environments of the forest in which they lived. In return for the patronage of &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, the Forest God (either one of the old ancestor spirits or an aspect of the true pantheon), they swore never to kill, injure, or eat any of the vegetation of the new home, which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;. The Bosmeri unity should be considered an important military feat in itself, as Eplear managed to unify the disparate groups into a unified group. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20340\"&gt;1E 340&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; formed a trade pact with the human slave rebels of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. They were then forced to undo this in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, when one of the Great Hunts killed king &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, who was planning on declaring war on the Bosmer. Valenwood was able to maintain its independence for the majority of the First Era. It was only in &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, after unrelenting warfare from the Cyrodiils and Colovia combined, coupled with the devastating effects of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, that finally brought the Camoran Dynasty into the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Reman then ensured that Valenwood would not be a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; by raising the cities of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eldenroot\"&gt;Eldenroot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; from local trading posts to full-fledged powers in their own right. Falinesti is considered the capital of the Bosmer.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;, the Camorans tried to unify themselves once more under one banner. However, they had culturally drifted too far apart. They then began to war with one another, with the Khajiit to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;ns to the north. As they were not unified, they offered no resistance to the encroachments made by the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman settlements.\nThe majority of human outposts built during the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; have been abandoned during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, and have been reclaimed instead by \"&lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;\" such as &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0that share the forests with the Bosmer tribes. Humans, in general, have learned not to intrude in the forests of Valenwood. While they once depended entirely on the annual Stridmeet caravans of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, the Wood Elves now rely entirely on the sea power of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; for whatever they require from the outside world (as of &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;).\nMilitary.\nFor a brief period of time, the Colovian armies used Bosmer Archers, such as in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Rihad\"&gt;War of Rihad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20862\"&gt;2E 862&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0However, they were highly undisciplined and too prone to desertion to be of significant use. As a rule, Bosmers are adept at sneaking, and one of their most famous poems, the &lt;a href=\"Meh%20Ayledion\"&gt;Meh Ayledion&lt;/a&gt; literally means \"The One Thousand Benefits of Hiding\". They are recorded as having been involved in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and although it is not explicitly mentioned which side they fought on, it is likely that they went to the aid of &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim I&lt;/a&gt;. However, the war itself left Valenwood unscathed.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nValenwood became part of the \"&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;\", a coalition of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, Bosmer and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; sometime between &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, a city of Valenwood acting as their capital. They also became part of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; that was considered to be the most stable empire in Tamriel. They ruled until the armies of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; wiped them out.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter conquering Valenwood, Tiber Septim wisely decided to let the Bosmeri retain some symbols of its independence, so as to limit dissension. Thus, they allowed the creation of local chiefs and the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Kings&lt;/a&gt; to remain.\nCamoran Usurper.\nAlso known as &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, Hart-King, and Camoran Hart-King, the Camoran Usurper began his deadly attacks on Valenwood in &lt;a href=\"3E%20249\"&gt;3E 249&lt;/a&gt;. Two years later, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20251\"&gt;3E 251&lt;/a&gt;, the Camoran Usurper had conquered all of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and began his fateful march northwards before eventually being defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; by Baron &lt;a href=\"Othrok\"&gt;Othrok&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five Year War, lasting, as it did, from &lt;a href=\"3E%20395\"&gt;3E 395&lt;/a&gt; until its conclusion in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, was a serious conflict between &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. More details are available on the main article of this War.\nOther changes.\nAt the close of the Third Era (as of &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;), significant changes were occurring in Valenwood. The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; had been sighted again for the first time in \"over 500 years.\" The \"Walking City\" of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; has taken root for the first time in recorded history, and there is a new Bosmer prophet, the Precursor, preaching that the old Forest God &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; is returning with new gifts for his favored people. Whether these are isolated events, or signs of some great change coming to Valenwood, remains to be seen.\nFourth Era.\nSeeking to recreate the previous incarnations of the Aldmeri Dominion, the Thalmor expanded their power into the provinces of Valenwood, Elsweyr, and briefly into Cyrodiil and Hammerfell. Following the consolidation of Valenwood and the Summerset Isles into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion began a policy of expanding Aldmeri influence and power across Tamriel, at the expense of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil. The Aldmeri Dominion first expanded into Elsweyr, adding the Khajiiti kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt; as its client states. However, this expansion caught the attention of the Mede Empire, which began a rivalry between the Dominion and the Empire that would ultimately lead up to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, a devastating conflict fought between the Dominion and Empire. Following its &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;peace treaty&lt;/a&gt; with the Empire after the Great War, the Third Aldmeri Dominion experienced increased prestige and power that the Mer had not possessed since the Second Aldmeri Dominion, which had been defeated by Tiber Septim in the final years of the Second Era. Confident of its ability to dictate the Mede Empire, the Dominion further expanded its influence into the other provinces of Tamriel, including the homeland of the Nords, Skyrim. It also reestablished diplomatic relations with the Mede Empire, even though they were still engaged in a cold war. During this time, the Thalmor seem to view the Wood Elves as racially inferior, as it is mentioned that they carry out regular purges.\nReligion.\nThe main religion in the forests of Valenwood is that of the Forest Gods and ancestor worship. According to legend, the Bosmer witnessed the death of Yffre, the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; to die. In his passing, his spiritual energies formed an Earthbone, a natural law, to limit certain aspects of the world. Yffre's Earthbone placed a limit on the ability of a being to change its form and nature, as previously they could change them at will. However, the Bosmer, having witnessed the formation of the Earthbone, learned how to manipulate it to avoid its restrictions. The most notable of their uses of this ability is the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, a ritual known only to the shaman of Valenwood. This act is reserved to protect Valenwood from invading forces, the ritual permanently transforms all participants into mindless, blood-thirsty monsters, who will then consume all of their enemies and then themselves. The Bosmer have noted that all monsters in the world were born from previous Wild Hunts. And is also enacted at the end of each era as a ritualistic practice within Valenwood.\nCreation myth.\nA Khajiit story gives us a possible explanation of how the Bosmer were created or came to be: The &lt;a href=\"Words%20of%20Clan%20Mother%20Ahnissi\"&gt;Words of Clan Mother Ahnissi&lt;/a&gt;. It goes as follows, in scripture from The Words Of Mother Ahnissi: '&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; heard the First Secret and snuck in behind Azura. And Y'ffre could not appreciate secrets, and he told Nirni of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s trick. So Nirni made the deserts hot and the sands biting. And Nirni made the forests wet and filled with poisons. And Nirni thanked Y'ffre and let him change the forest people also. And Y'ffre did not have Azura's subtle wisdom, so Y'ffre made the forest people elves always and never beasts. And Y'ffre named them Bosmer. And from that moment they were no longer in the same litter as the Khajiit.\nAnd because Y'ffre had no appreciation for secrets, he shouted the First Secret across all the heavens with his last breath so that all of Fadomai's children could cross the Lattice. But Azura, in her wisdom, closed the ears of angry Ahnurr and noisy Lorkhaj so they alone did not hear the word.\nThe Green Pact.\nThe Bosmer allegedly made the Pact with &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, the Forest Deity. The Bosmer were religiously carnivorous and cannibalistic as a result of the Green Pact, a central portion of the Bosmer faith. The Green Pact is never explicitly shown, but in its simplest form, it sets these rules down: Bosmer may only consume meat-based products and are forbidden to harm any plant for their own betterment. As a result of these stipulations, Bosmer are dependent on either stone or imported timber for construction purposes.\nThe Green Pact has also heavily impacted Bosmeri cuisine, combat, and weaponry. They have developed methods of fermenting meat and milk to develop powerful alcoholic beverages and weapons such as bows are often made of treated and shaped bones. Most notable about Bosmeri combat is their stipulation that a combatant must consume an enemy's corpse within 3 days of killing them. Their families are allowed to help eat the kill. This has led to changes in approaches to combat, such as fasting and planning family feasts following a battle. They also cannot smoke anything of a vegetable nature. Bone pipes are common, however, and are filled with caterpillars or tree grubs."}

The curious and adventurous nature of the Bosmer contrasts with that of their more dour \"cousins,\" the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture and traits.\nWood Elves reject the stiff, formal traditions of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i high culture, instead preferring a romantic, simple existence in harmony with nature and its creatures.

Their &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; also helps ensure that any close encounters won't get them killed.\nDrawbacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; are particularly useful for \"sneaky\" characters, but Wood Elves don't gain bonuses to these skills. This lack can be slightly alleviated by choosing either &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady\"&gt;The Lady&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;The Mage&lt;/a&gt; as birthsigns.\nAlso, while Light Armor is certainly safer than no armor at all, it wears down quickly and provides little protection. Wood Elves also begin the game with low &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. less carrying capacity), and female Bosmer also have reduced &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. dramatically lowered &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;)."}

They are supreme hunters, guides, and masters in sneaking and thievery, revering nature and the forest, and may be the only &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; with a sense of humor.\nOfficial description.\nThe Wood Elves, or Bosmer, are mischievous, curious and nimble. Because their homeland of Valenwood is often attacked by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Cabal\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, Wood Elves are experts at the art of defense. They are also gifted archers, perhaps the best in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, lies in the heart of their homeland. It has evolved into a center of political and cultural importance and is of vital strategic importance in the battle to control Tamriel.\nPersonality and characteristics.\nCheeky and clever usually extreme tacticians, as shown with even the youngest of Bosmer. They are revered as outgoing with their own kind and are 'one' with the forest and nature, as a whole. Many swear allegiance to either &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aeradan%20Camoran\"&gt;Aeradan Camoran&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Wilderqueen\"&gt;The Wilderqueen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory &amp; culture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; abandoned their home of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; and landed in their new home of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these new inhabitants stayed in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but others ventured further to find where they belonged. The &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; that ventured into &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; had set their eyes upon the unconstrained and lush jungle and all understood that they could not change this for them to inhabit. Instead they decided to adapt to the new surroundings. This new &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; became the Bosmer also known as Wood Elves, Bolche, or Tree-Sap people. This transformation is credited by the Bosmer to &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre the Forest God&lt;/a&gt;. In the doctrines, a pact was made to never to kill, injure, or eat any of the vegetation of this new residence as abiding appreciation. This became known as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Frond%20and%20Leaf\"&gt;Treaty of Frond and Leaf&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; begins in &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; written record when &lt;a href=\"King%20Eplear\"&gt;King Eplear&lt;/a&gt; unites the wild Bosmer and establishes the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. This newly forged kingdom becomes an emissary between the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the Ayleid territories grow increasingly independent and the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; eventually rises as a new autonomous state while enslaving the tribes of men that lived there. &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, who became known as The Slave Queen, in &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Rebellion\"&gt;year 242 started&lt;/a&gt; a rebellion to take over Cyrodiil that initiated the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; that subsequent year when the White-Gold Tower crumbles into the hands of rebels. Some of the Ayleids embraced the change of leadership while the others who opposed the this transition sought sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, these Ayleids are assimilated by the Bosmer. By &lt;a href=\"1E%20340\"&gt;1E 340&lt;/a&gt;, Bosmer &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; of Valenwood commences a trade treaty with the blossoming Alessian Empire. The treaty didn't maintain long due to the influence of emerging new &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; against all mer by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. These strict teachings spread all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; eventually reaching &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to convert &lt;a href=\"King%20Borgas\"&gt;King Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Following his faith, the King decided to rally support in Cyrodiil for a war against the Bosmer in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;year 369&lt;/a&gt;. On his way, he was a causality in an infamous &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Proceeding from this act of self-defense sparked the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; that lasted fifty years in Skyrim. Valenwood managed to maintain its independence until &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;year 2714&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt; ultimately conquered the depleted Bosmer after enduring warfare and a debilitating &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; from the island of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;. Official authority was stripped from the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; but the Empire granted sovereignty to each &lt;a href=\"treethane\"&gt;treethane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;. This would keep them together as a unit if needed, yet separate enough not to rally against the new Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era to present&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bosmer stayed compliant citizens to the Cyrodilic Empire until its failing in year &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;. News spread that &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Potentate Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; and all of his heirs were massacred by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; leaving the empire without anyone to take the throne. This caused civil war and insurrection all over Tamriel. As others fought for the claim of the empty throne, the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camorans&lt;/a&gt; attempted to repeat history by uniting Valenwood under one rule. This endeavor failed due to each &lt;a href=\"treethane\"&gt;treethane&lt;/a&gt; having developed into distinct cultures that couldn't reconcile their differences. As even brother fought brother in Valenwood, there was no protection to the coast against the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; who used this to raid and attack &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt;s to the north or &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiits&lt;/a&gt; to the east. For the Altmer to protect their homeland, they used an old treaty to invade and unite Valenwood under the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bosmer are strict carnivores and cannibals. They eat the dead after battle, and decorate the skulls and bones of their kills everywhere. Their cannibalism is a matter of ritual significance, and typically quite private within a family or tight-knit group. Bosmeri beverages include &lt;a href=\"Jagga\"&gt;Jagga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rotmeth\"&gt;Rotmeth&lt;/a&gt;, and Sun's Dusk ale. The Wood Elves practice rituals which magically shape the woods around them into housing, temples, and art. This is done through days of slow, rhythmic chanting, as well as fasting done prior to and during each ritual. Hacking, cutting, burning, or otherwise causing damage to Valenwood's &lt;a href=\"graht-oak\"&gt;graht-oak&lt;/a&gt;s is punishable by expulsion. Paper is only usable by the Bosmer when made from non-native trees."}

The Dominion very nearly destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, if not for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;, which forced the Elven armies to withdraw from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Following its victory in the Great War, the Third Aldmeri Dominion experienced increased prestige and power that the Mer had not possessed since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, which had been defeated by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; in the final years of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. Confident of its ability to defeat the Third Empire, the Dominion further expanded its influence into the other provinces of Tamriel, including the homeland of the Nords: &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. It also reestablished diplomatic relations with the Third Empire, even though they were still engaged in a cold war.\n&lt;a href=\"Malborn\"&gt;Malborn&lt;/a&gt;, from the quest &lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;, hates the Thalmor as evidenced by him helping the Dragonborn infiltrate a Thalmor party. According to &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;, Malborn's family was killed by the Thalmor in Valenwood. Therefore, Malborn's family was possibly made of Imperial allies or sympathizers.\nPopular usage and unique gameplay.\nBosmer are often played as stealthy &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;archers&lt;/a&gt;, choosing &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light armor&lt;/a&gt; and favoring the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest lines due to their innate skills and abilities. Their natural immunities to both poison and disease make them the most viable candidate for any player not wishing to become a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; but wishing to be protected from these illnesses. This is an advantage over other races which would require enchanted apparel to counter such biological agents, such as &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak\"&gt;Hevnoraak&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt;. These resistances, along with their special Command Animal power, make Bosmer an excellent choice for a scout, thief, assassin or treasure hunter type character.\nAlthough the Command Animal power will be obsolete to a high level player, it gives amateurs a way to avoid an otherwise suicidal combat with a powerful creature, such as &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost troll&lt;/a&gt;s without requiring &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Allegiance\"&gt;Animal Allegiance&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, one may even elect to weaken a mammoth by forcing it to fight &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;its herder&lt;/a&gt; using Command Animal, and, once it's near death, cast &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; for an easy &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;grand soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nBosmeri characters, through certain ways, can enter the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt; without the need for an invitation, but the guards will be more vigilant towards them and are more likely to attack them than they would to an Altmer."}

They protect a tree they say was planted by Y'ffre at the creation of the world.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon approaching Brackenleaf, you will be stopped by a man named &lt;a href=\"Eringor\"&gt;Eringor&lt;/a&gt;. He will inform you in what kind of place you have found yourself; the people here, the Briars, protect an ancient tree called the Brackenleaf. If you ask what it takes to become a Briar, he will say that it is not easy, and will direct you to &lt;a href=\"Glaras\"&gt;Glaras&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlaras will be in the Memorial to the Hunt, in the northern branch of the great tree. She will tell you that something called the Outsider is constantly trying to steal the heart of the Brackenleaf, but is always stopped by the Briars. She will tell you that if you wish to become a Briar, you must visit the three shrines and listen to the masters. \nThe first shrine, to The Snake, is west of the great tree. Light the brazier and a man called &lt;a href=\"Hednor\"&gt;Hednor&lt;/a&gt; will appear; he will describe how the snake strikes its prey from behind, so that they never see it coming. Next head south to the shrine of the Tiger and light the brazier. Master &lt;a href=\"Miliril\"&gt;Miliril&lt;/a&gt; will appear and explain that the tiger uses brute force to dominate its prey. Finally, east of here is the shrine of the Wolf. Upon lighting the brazier, Master &lt;a href=\"Gaerthir\"&gt;Gaerthir&lt;/a&gt; will explain that wolves hunt in packs and use their numbers to overpower their foes. \nHaving listened to all three masters, return to Glaras at the base of the tree. She will tell you that for your next trial, you should head to the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Leap%20Grotto\"&gt;Sacred Leap Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, capture one of the red frogs there and eat it alive. That way you will be able to see the true nature of the forest. The frog will try to get away; you will have to chase it. Once you have the frog, eat it, and you will see a vision. A &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20Spirit\"&gt;Spriggan Spirit&lt;/a&gt; will appear; speak to it and it will tell you to seek out the spirit of the Brackenleaf, in the center of the grove. \nHead outside and go west. Be wary though, as the forest is now populated with the spirits of all kinds of animals. You will spot a big tree here; this is the Brackenleaf. Speak to it and it will ask you whether you wish to be like the Tiger, the Wolf or the Snake. \nAfter choosing your spirit animal, you will be told to hunt its prey. The tiger must hunt the snake, the snake must hunt the wolf and the wolf must hunt the tiger. You will find your prey to the south; kill it, then talk to the Spriggan Spirit again. She will tell you that your trials are not yet done; you must also prove yourself stronger than your predator. Return to the shrine of the animal you chose, and light the brazier. Your predator will then appear. For the tiger this is the wolf, for the wolf this is the snake and for the snake this is the tiger. Once your predator is dead, return to the Brackenleaf. \nThe Brackenleaf will reveal that there is one last trial for you to overcome: you must venture inside the tree itself and try to get your hands on the Heart itself. The Brackenleaf will reveal that you are in fact the Outsider that the Briars protect the tree against, as is every new recruit. Only by defeating the masters and taking a piece of the heart can you prove yourself worthy of becoming a Briar. \nYou will teleported into the tree for this trial; your spirit animal will join you for these fights. Your first opponent will be Miliril and her &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senche-Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Once she is defeated, head on and face Gaerthir and his wolf. Finally, you will face Hednor and his pet snake. Once all three have been defeated, head on into the final chamber and up to the brazier. This is Brackenleaf's heart; take a piece and the Brackenleaf will speak to you, telling you that you have passed the trials and are now a Briar. He will then teleport you back to the village. \nSpeak with Glaras here and she will tell you to go pray at the shrine of your chosen animal once more. Do this, then return to Glaras to complete your initiation and this quest. Following this quest, you may pray at shrines throughout Grahtwood and receive bonuses based on your spirit animal.\nSpirit animal.\nSnake hunts Wolf, Tiger hunts Snake and Wolf hunts Tiger.\nThese bonuses last for one hour, and can be re-added by visiting a &lt;a href=\"Blackbriar%20Blazier\"&gt;Blackbriar Blazier&lt;/a&gt;. These are scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. One such Blazier is located near the &lt;a href=\"Southpoint%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Southpoint Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;."}

As with the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, the Bosmer worship &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; as the king of the gods, and tend to trace their lineages back to him. The most important deity in the Bosmeri pantheon, however, is &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, who is known as the \"spirit of the now\" (the present), in contrast with the nature of Auri-El.\nList of revered and worshiped gods.\nY'ffre.\nY'ffre the Storyteller is the defining deity of Bosmeri religion. While Auri-El might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of \"the now,\" who transformed himself into the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; and established the laws of nature. According to legend, Y'ffre offered the ancient Bosmer a way to defeat their enemies, providing they did not consume, harm, or harvest any of Valenwood's plants. This deal between the Bosmer and Y'ffre is known as the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, of which one of the results is the ritual called the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. As per the \"Meat Mandate\" (a core tenet of the Green Pact), Bosmer are exclusively and religiously carnivorous, and must consume the flesh of any fallen foe. They can also not smoke or otherwise consume any plants from Valenwood, having to resort to their signature &lt;a href=\"Bugsmoke\"&gt;Bugsmoke&lt;/a&gt;.\nAuri-El.\nAuri-El the Time Dragon is the king of gods, chief of many elven pantheons. Most &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and Bosmer claim direct descent from Auri-El. The god took part in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;mortal plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIus.\nIus the Extremely Agitated is a god of which the statues can be seen throughout Valenwood (and some parts of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;), said to answer the prayers of animals. He is portrayed as a misshapen humanoid, carrying a rod and a large set of scales (although local worshipers do not know the reason for him to carry the scales). Legend has it that, answering to an &lt;a href=\"Cattle\"&gt;ox&lt;/a&gt;'s cry for help, eating the farmer that threatened its life and then disappearing. Another myth speaks of a vengeful pet wombat who asked Ius to block the gate of &lt;a href=\"Rockcreek\"&gt;Rockcreek&lt;/a&gt;'s palace with an equipment store, causing the royal family to go mad and eat one another (and the wombat).\nOthers.\nOther gods in the Bosmeri pantheon:"}

To the right of the potato basket, one can find a stack of open air crates, containing 11 empty wine bottles. To the right of this, one can find three &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; corpses, and five pieces of &lt;a href=\"Seared%20Slaughterfish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;seared slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; on a table. To the right of the table, next to the stairs, there is one &lt;a href=\"corundum%20ore%20vein\"&gt;corundum ore vein&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe western edge of the main chamber holds an alchemy table, most likely where one will find the the head of the necromancers. To the right of this, there is a bookshelf containing many food items, a randomized frenzy poison, and \"&lt;a href=\"Herbalist%27s%20Guide%20to%20Skyrim\"&gt;Herbalist's Guide to Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\".

The cuirass and greaves are considered heavy armor, but all of the other bound armor pieces are considered light armor. The majority of the pieces can be obtained, as spells for custom spell purposes, or as items for glitching into permanent items, from &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Stones\"&gt;Rune Stones&lt;/a&gt;.\nBugs.\nThere is a glitch that makes bound armors and weapons permanent. Have the bound weapon or armor on your person (through casting the spell or through a rune stone), have it become damaged (or simply be an &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk%23Armorer%20Perks\"&gt;Expert&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt;), repair it with a repair hammer, drop any of this same item type, wait out the spell and pick it/them up. You then have yourself a weightless &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for dropping all similar items is that the game is not coded to tell the difference. To clarify: with permanent &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Boots%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bound Boots&lt;/a&gt; in inventory (that can be dropped at any time), casting Bound Boots creates a new pair that must be repaired before dropping. At the expiration of the spell, the game is coded to remove the first Bound Boots it finds, regardless of permanence. There is only one exception: permanent bound items that have been enchanted; they are considered by the game to be a different type of item and are not affected.\nAlternatively, (only works with bound weapons) you could go to the mages guild in the imperial city and create a spell that summons 2 bound weapons at a time. When summoning, you will only equip one of the weapons and will be able to drop the other items. If you have the magicka, you can do this to obtain all \"Weightless Daedric\" items."}

Thus, Conjuration governs the magicka cost of the spell, and One-Handed governs the damage of the weapon. &lt;a href=\"Apparel\"&gt;Apparel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with the \"&lt;a href=\"Fortify%20One-Handed\"&gt;Fortify One-Handed&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Enchantment%20Modifiers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; increases the bound sword's damage, as it would with any physical one-handed &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsefulness.\n&lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; who cannot accommodate for the &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; of an offensive weapon may select the Bound Sword for instances when melee combat is more appropriate than spells or when the mage's &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; has expired.\nWith the \"Soul Stealer\" perk unlocked, Bound Swords automatically cast Soul Trap on foes. Because of this, characters who desire to make use of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; and need to fill &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; quickly might find using Bound Sword advantageous.\nIt's also extremely powerful for low level players, as the casting cost is lower than 100, the Novice Conjuration perk has no prerequisites, and \"Mystic Binding\" can be attained in at most 5 skill levels.\nAs a spell, it can also be smuggled into areas where weapons are not supposed to be available, such as &lt;a href=\"Prison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt;. This is true for the other bound weapons, but the sword's availability to any profession means it's perfect for just these instances. Bound weapons also cannot be &lt;a href=\"disarm\"&gt;disarm&lt;/a&gt;ed by the &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; shout."}

I'll receive a bonus if I kill Vici as she addresses the crowd.\"\nWalkthrough.\nBefore leaving the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, it is a good idea to talk with the Dark Brotherhood members. In particular, &lt;a href=\"Gabriella\"&gt;Gabriella&lt;/a&gt; says that she has scouted the area and has left something on a parapet overlooking the balcony (\"an excellent spot for a long-range kill\"), while &lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt; will talk about a loose gargoyle that can be used to do the deed.\nEntering the temple.\nThe quest begins in Solitude, in the Temple of the Divines. In front of the temple there will be a group of people. The bride and groom are in two chairs opposite the temple door. Talking to the bride starts the event immediately, or else it will start on its own after waiting a while. Alternatively, after entering the temple, up the first stairs on the right and out the door on the right, the Dragonborn will end up on top of the roof, looking down on the gathering. The event will start on its own.\nThe balcony.\nAfter about thirty seconds, the bride and groom will get up from their thrones, and enter a door. This door will lead them to the balcony above their place of honor that faces the assembled guests. Vittoria should be killed after she starts speaking.\nMethods for killing Vittoria Vici.\nThere are many methods that can be employed to successfully assassinate Vici, some of which may avoid the Dragonborn incurring a bounty and are easier to achieve.\nQuick fast travel.\nStaying hidden while standing on the balcony behind her during her speech allows her to be killed in one hit (using a silent kill method like &lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Assassin's Blade&lt;/a&gt;). Any repercussions can be avoided by immediately fast traveling to another location before anyone notices and becomes an enemy. Using a weapon that can capture a soul at the same time should be considered. However, the bonus gold is not available using this method.\nHowever, it is possible to push the gargoyle onto Vici during her speech and then immediately fast-travel to another location before she dies (however this method does NOT work if you fast travel \"before\" the gargoyle hits her). This will bring her body along (sometimes and otherwise return to the balcony after fast travel escape to loot her body). She continues the death animation at the destination and dies there, which allows her body to be looted. This method avoids any bounty yet does get the bonus.\nSniper.\nThe \"something\" that Gabriella left are &lt;a href=\"Firiniel%27s%20End\"&gt;Firiniel's End&lt;/a&gt; (an enchanted, &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; bow that does 20 &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven Arrows&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Fortify%20Marksman\"&gt;Potion of True Shot&lt;/a&gt; on the balcony across from where the bride delivers her speech. It is reachable by using the door in the northwest corner of the courtyard in front of the temple. There will be a clear shot from this point but there will be a chance of immediate discovery after the shot and pursuit by the guards, depending on &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill. Collecting the bow is recommended, even if it is not used for the quest, as it has fairly high stats and a useful enchantment. If they were not collected during the quest, the bow, arrows and potion will still be on the balcony and can be picked up at any time after the quest has been completed.\nThe shot can also be taken from the walkway above the balcony where Firiniel's End was left. The walkway runs all around the courtyard, however the angle and cover options appear best at the furthest corners. The shot should be taken while sneaking. Once done, a hostile response can be prevented by immediately backing away into the corner (or drinking an &lt;a href=\"invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; potion between release and impact), then staying hidden until the way is clear.\nAnother way to kill her is by using the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; on the bride. This will always be fatal, because this causes everyone to attack her. This will forfeit the gold bonus, however. The perk &lt;a href=\"Quiet%20Casting\"&gt;Quiet Casting&lt;/a&gt; is needed to do this unobserved.\nStatue.\nBabette revealed that a gargoyle statue above the balcony where Vici gives her speech is loose. Dislodging the statue during her speech will crush and kill her. The walkway above the bride gives access to the gargoyle. When the bride starts speaking, pushing the loose gargoyle (while in sneak, preferably) gives the best chance of escape, as no one may even see the act. This will usually (though not always) give the bonus for killing her in the middle of her speech. All the guests and the groom will now be hostile - however, a bounty may not be accrued. There is a window of time between when the crash is heard and when someone calls out where it is possible to fast travel out, making an easy escape, but losing the ability to loot her corpse.\nAnother way the Dragonborn could avoid detection with this method is if they become invisible after tipping the statue over. This will provide the Dragonborn with a larger pocket of time to fast travel out and/or loot the corpse. It is also possible to drop the statue on her while standing next to her on the speech platform by crouch hopping. This will make it easier to quickly loot her body but requires high sneak skill. On rare occasions, if the gargoyle falls on Vittoria, the groom may also be crushed. This can cause an additional 1,000 bounty in &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;. However, sometimes the bonus will be forfeited even if the statue is pushed onto Vici during her speech. Reloading a previous save and killing Vici again may be necessary if this happens. There's a chance that Vici's corpse may fall into the floor, making it impossible to loot her body.\nFrenzy poison.\nA way to minimize hostile reaction to the attack (or at least offer a big distraction), is to give a frenzy poison to &lt;a href=\"Asgeir%20Snow-Shod\"&gt;Asgeir Snow-Shod&lt;/a&gt;. This requires having the &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; perk &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Poisoned&lt;/a&gt;. Asgeir will then attack and kill Vici. This can also be achieved by casting &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; on him, if the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill level is high enough. After this, the guards will have to fight both him and his parents before they can do anything else, and by then the Dragonborn can be out of Solitude, and back in the Sanctuary.\nAtronach bomb.\nAnother alternative that avoids sneaking is to summon a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt; right next to Vici and then destroy it. Upon death, the Flame Atronach will create a large explosion that should kill Vici and, since she was not directly killed, will not incur any bounty.\nFlaming familiar.\nSummoning Flaming Familiar on the balcony will kill both Snow-Shod and Vici after it exploded. Asgeir may be able to survive the explosion if he managed to exit the balcony before Vici. This method also does not incur any bounty. After the guests become hostile, immediately sheathe the spell and they will lower their weapons. Loot the corpse(s) and fast travel back to the sanctuary.\nDragon.\nIf add-on is available, and if a dragon shows up, it can be tamed with the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout, and then commanded to kill Vici.\nPoison.\nWith the Pickpocket perk \"Poisoned,\" it is possible to sneak onto the balcony and, provided the right poison is used, drug Vici, then make a quick getaway. No weapons, no half-hearted sneak attacks and best of all, no bounty.\nSimple murder.\nShe can openly be killed, then a daring escape made with the guards hot on the Dragonborn's tail. This method does incur the standard thousand gold bounty, just like any other murder, but the bonus may still be earned if she is killed while speaking to the crowd. With the right perks and high enough Sneak and Archery levels, she can be shot with an arrow in the middle of the crowd without getting caught. As long as detection is avoided, this allows escaping without incurring the wrath of the Penitus Oculatus.\nDeceiving the Herd.\nIf DLC is installed, the \"&lt;a href=\"Deceiving%20the%20Herd\"&gt;Deceiving the Herd&lt;/a&gt;\" quest is active, and the quest log reads \"Kill someone out in the streets of Solitude,\" she can simply be killed while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Armor\"&gt;Dawnguard Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Planting the &lt;a href=\"Incriminating%20Letter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Incriminating Letter&lt;/a&gt; on Vici's corpse satisfies that other quest.\nWerewolf or Vampire assassination.\nAnother way is to go to a private spot or go somewhere that is unoccupied and then activate the transformation to &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;. There should be no bounty for killing Vici while transformed. Further, the werewolf transformation makes it easier to sprint out of Solitude. The guards can be lost by heading to the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20to%20Meridia\"&gt;Statue to Meridia&lt;/a&gt; just west of Solitude.\nUnrelenting force.\nA somewhat amusing method of killing Vici is using the Unrelenting Force shout. The third word must be unlocked, which means you have to have completed the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;.\" The shout can then be used to push Vici off the balcony, which is high enough to kill her. Furthermore, the shout can be used from Vici's left side, placing Asgeir in its area of effect as well and pushing them both off the balcony. Even if Snow-Shod isn't killed, the most immediate threat to the Dragonborn after the murder will be cleared.\nRune trap.\nAnother way to kill Vici is to use a Rune spell. The Dragonborn needs only place the Rune on the balcony, then run off and find a hiding spot. Once the Rune goes off and kills Vici, the Dragonborn can escape fairly easily. With sufficient Sneak skill and perhaps the Quiet Casting perk, the Dragonborn can escape detection and bounty.\nEscaping.\nIf immediate escape is not achieved, the fellow Dark Brotherhood assassin &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt; will appear and say that &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; sent him to help. He will take care of the crowd, allowing the Dragonborn to slip away. Being a member of the Thieves Guild can allow for an easy escape as well, because a guard can be bribed or only charge half of the bounty and everyone will 'forget' everything. Fighting the crowd is not advised as it can result in a hefty bounty, damaging the economy, preventing some quests from being achieved, and making Solitude sparsely populated to the point of eeriness. Alternatively, the Dragonborn may sheathe their weapon, and the guards will cease attack. However, Veezara may still try to kill the Penitus Oculatus agent guarding the door. Casting &lt;a href=\"Harmony%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt; can not only calm everyone down but will also level the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill by multiple levels. Note that if Harmony is cast before Veezara appears, Veezara won't be affected and will still attack the Penitus Oculatus agent. This can be solved by casting Harmony again or casting &lt;a href=\"Pacify\"&gt;Pacify&lt;/a&gt; on Veezara.\nAchieving the bonus.\nThe bounty will be paid as long as the bride dies during her speech on the balcony, regardless of the method used, except for a Frenzy cast on her. The bonus is simply a large amount of leveled gold. The Dragonborn will be rewarded with the unique spell named &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin%20%28Power%29\"&gt;Spectral Assassin&lt;/a&gt; (which summons &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Lachance\"&gt;Lucien Lachance&lt;/a&gt; as a temporary &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; once per day) regardless of whether Vici was killed while on the balcony. After reporting back to Astrid, whichever outcome achieved, she says to speak to Gabriella. This immediately concludes Bound Until Death and begins \"&lt;a href=\"Breaching%20Security\"&gt;Breaching Security&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

All bound weapons are weightless versions of non-upgraded &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound bow&lt;/a&gt; is the strongest bound weapon. When conjured, 100 &lt;a href=\"bound%20arrow\"&gt;bound arrow&lt;/a&gt;s accompany it.\nUsefulness.\nCasting bound weapons &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; in the presence of an aware enemy increases the Conjuration &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; each time the spell is cast. If used after the weapon appears, the skill relevant to the weapon type increases instead of Conjuration. For example, conjuring a &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound sword&lt;/a&gt; raises Conjuration when cast, but only raises &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; are successfully struck with it.\nPros.\n&lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Poisons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralysis&lt;/a&gt; can be used on bound weapons. If the poisoned weapon is sheathed or the conjuration ends without the weapon being used, the poison is lost.\nBound weapons can also be used to execute &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Camera\"&gt;Kill Camera&lt;/a&gt;s. If a bound weapon is used for the latter, its blue glow will be seen during the killcam cutscene.\nBound weapons can be used to increase the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; skill. If the Sword or Dagger are equipped in the right hand, they can be used in conjunction with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; in the left hand.\nSneak attacks can be performed with bound weapons, and depending on the weapon used, the damage multiplier can be increased, provided that the relevant perks are selected.\nBound weapons can be smuggled into places where the Dragonborn's weapons are not supposed to be available, such as &lt;a href=\"Prison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike physical weapons, bound weapons weigh nothing.\nUnlike physical weapons, bound weapons will not be removed from the Dragonborn's grasp via the &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; shout.\nCons.\nCasting bound weapons while sneaking can alert enemies to the Dragonborn's presence, especially if their &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill is low.\nBound crossbows, greatswords, maces, war axes, and warhammers do not exist.\nThe sneak attack damage multiplier for the Battleaxe is fixed at 2x damage due to the fact that there are no Perks in the Sneak skill tree that increase it for two-handed weapons.\nBound weapons cannot be used while riding a &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;.

When engaging her in conversation, the Vestige must make their case. Explaining to Faras that they need someone who can collect red star shells is of little luck, however, as she explains that is exactly why she needs Tirwin. Eventually, the Vestige is able to convince her to sell Tirwin for the price of three red star shells. The Vestige must now return to Llonas with this information, who will share an excellent spot for harvesting these star shells. He lends them his &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nix-Hound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nixxie\"&gt;Nixxie&lt;/a&gt;, whom he has trained in gathering red star shells. \nAfter gathering the shells, the Vestige will be approached by Tirwin.

After all Faras and Llonas have taken from me, I don't want them to profit from my release. At least let me cost them.\"\nIf the Vestige decides to continue on with the original plan, they must speak to Llonas and agree to puchase Tirwin from his mother by delivering the shells. Llonas will follow them to his mother where the transaction will take place. Afterwards, the Vestige must once again speak to Llonas and they will receive their reward. \nIf the Vestige, however, chooses to side with Tirwin, they must break into the Girwyn tower and steal the servitude obligation from the basement of the tower by hiding and staying out of sight of the servants and guards. Afterwards, they must deliver the obligation to Tirwin and she will be freed, vowing to leave Telvanni lands as fast as possible and rewarding the Vestige for their efforts. "}

He will explain that they are located somewhere in Western Skyrim, and that they were attacked by witches from the &lt;a href=\"Icereach%20Coven\"&gt;Icereach Coven&lt;/a&gt;. In order to help you escape, he says that he needs his flask back.\n\"My thanks. Hear me out if you want to escape this place.\"\n\"You were on the cart. I saw you before those witches caught us and tossed me into this stone box. Glad you're finally awake. Apologies for my ghastly appearance. I'm \u2026 not feeling my best.\"\n\"Don't be afraid. This may be jarring, but it's a necessary part of the plan.\"\nAfter finishing talking to him, he will get up and, using magic, make his way through the cell door, pulling the lever from the other side and opening it.\n\"You're free. Now, please. Hurry and retrieve my flask.\"\n\"Please, retrieve the flask. It must be nearby. I can sense it. We can talk after.\"\nHis flask is located in a cell to the right, on top of a nightstand. Pick it up, and return to him, standing next to the lever mechanism. He will immediately take it and drink from it.\n\"Did you find it? Give it to me.\"\nAfter he drinks from his flask, &lt;a href=\"Fennorian\"&gt;Fennorian&lt;/a&gt; will appear visibly better, no longer slouching and his complexion clearer. He reveals that he is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;House Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt;, whose investigation of smugglers from &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; led him to the coven, where he was captured. He will then tell you to follow him, as he leads you out of &lt;a href=\"Deepwood%20Barrow\"&gt;Deepwood Barrow&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Yes, that's \u2026 better. Thank you, I could feel my control slipping away.\"\n\"Yes \u2026 that was blood. But, I swear there's no cause for alarm. Not every vampire is a monster. I'm part of a group that only drinks from willing donors. We regulate the actions of less scrupulous vampires.\"\n\"Follow closely! You never know what's lying around in these old barrows.\"\nFollow Fennorian out of the Deepwood Crypts, and into the Crypt Vault. Inside the area will be a number of &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. Fennorian will wonder why the witches are storing the equipment. After picking up your weapon, Fennorian will lead you further towards the exit, into the Ceremonial Chamber. In the chamber, a man named Vitrus the Bloody is standing guard on the next door.\nVitrus the Bloody: \"What are you two doing out? Urgala still has need of you.\"\nFennorian: \"That's the brute who threw us in our cell! We have to get past him.\"\nVitrus the Bloody: \"I'll put you two milk drinkers back in your cage!\"\nFennorian: \"The only way out is through him! I'll support you from back here\"\nIn order to proceed, you will need to kill him. As this is an introductory battle, Vitrus is fairly easy to kill, and he will not be able to deal as much damage to the player. Fennorian will also provide support throughout combat. After defeating him, exit to Deepwood Barrow. In the new area, there will be a wider selection of new weapons and armor that you can choose from, before moving to the exit with Fennorian. After picking all the equipment you need, go inside Deepwood Cavern. A &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt; will stand in the way, and you must defeat it in order to continue. After killing it, move on to Deepwood Redoubt.\nIn Deepwood Redoubt, Fennorian will suddenly stop, as he will notice something from the bridge in the area.\n\"Over here! We're almost to the exit.\"\n\"Quick, hide! Look up on the bridge.\"\nApproach him, and crouch next to him. On top of the bridge he was looking at, two figures having a conversation will appear, crossing it to leave the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Matron%20Urgala\"&gt;Matron Urgala&lt;/a&gt;: \"As you'll see, the storm's effects will be quite devastating.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt;: \"As long as everything's ready for the first harvest, Urgala, I will be pleased.\"\nAfter they leave, go and talk to Fennorian. He says that one of the two people was the leader of the Icereach Coven, &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Urgala\"&gt;Matron Urgala&lt;/a&gt;, while he suspects that &lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt; might also be a vampire.\n\"Very curious. Let's talk for a moment.\"\n\"That was Urgala, leader of this branch of the Icereach Coven. She's the witch who locked us in the barrow. The others take their orders from her.\"\nIn order to investigate what is connecting those two individuals and the stolen remains from Bangkorai, Fennorian wants to follow Urgala and figure out what the storm she was talking about was. After talking with Fennorian, enter Deepwood Run through the door on the right of the area. In there, will be various &lt;a href=\"Harrowfiend\"&gt;Harrowfiend&lt;/a&gt;s as well as members of the Icereach Coven that you must defeat. It is also possible, however, to sneak by them, if one wishes to avoid combat.\nAfter navigating through Deepwood Run, go through the door that will lead you to Deepwood Crossing. Following the bridge that you saw Urgala on previously, exit to &lt;a href=\"Deepwood%20Vale%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deepwood Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The area is guarded by multiple members of the Icereach Coven, while an arcane &lt;a href=\"Harrowstorms\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; can be seen forming on top of the temple in the distance. Fennorian comments on this:\n\"Look, the sky! What have they done? We must reach that clearing!\"\nMake your way through the witches and reach the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Deepwood%20Temple\"&gt;Deepwood Temple&lt;/a&gt; located on the other side of Deepwood Vale. Icereach witches will patrol the temple, so one will need to fight them in order to reach the ritual site. Continue navigating through the temple with Fennorian, until you reach the Deepwood Temple Pinnacle. Once outside, you will see Matron Urgala once again with Rada al-Saran. They are at the center of the storm, while Urgala is performing a strange ritual using a Witch Pike. After talking to her Rada al-Saran will disappear, leaving her alone. You must defeat Matron Urgala in order for the storm to stop.\nEven after killing her, the storm shows no signs of dissipating, making Fennorian think that the pike must also be destroyed. Attack the pike in order to destroy it. After doing so, the sky will clear, as the storm will have stopped. Go and talk to Fennorian.\n\"You did it! The storm's dissapated.\"\n\"I wish we could have learned more before we killed Matron Urgala. I still don't understand what the coven has planned, and it's the not knowing that worries me.\"\nAfter speaking with Fennorian, the quest will end, and the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gathering%20Storm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Gathering Storm&lt;/a&gt;,\" will immediately start."}

The size of a bounty depends on the severity of the &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; committed. It is measured in &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and is represented by the white bar in the player's Infamy Meter.\nDealing with a bounty.\nThe player can either wait for the bounty to decrease and eventually go away, or pay it off. If the player chooses to pay off the bounty, all stolen items will also be removed from their inventory.\n&lt;a href=\"Guards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt; will approach the player in an attempt to make them pay their bounty. If they refuse, the guards will attempt to kill the player, and the bounty held will be increased. If one doesn't have enough money to pay off the bounty, all the gold from the player's inventory will be removed, and the bounty will be reduced by that amount.\n&lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fences&lt;/a&gt; are also capable of clearing off bounty if one is willing to pay them.\nAnother way for one to clear their bounty without paying gold is to use an &lt;a href=\"Edict\"&gt;Edict&lt;/a&gt;. Edicts can be used to clear both bounties and Heat, making them a very valuable item to have for people that often commit crimes in a short span of time. This, however, is best used when one has committed enough serious crimes to amass a substantial bounty, for depending on the type, they are capable of clearing from 500 to 100,000 worth of gold with one use.\nHeat.\nThe bounty system is also directly linked to the heat system, which informs the player of how the guards will react when they notice them. They will either approach the player peacefully and ask for the bounty to be paid off or attack the player if their heat is high enough. Heat is represented by the red bar of the Infamy Meter and reduces much faster than the bounty.\nInfamy Meter.\nThe Infamy Meter will become visible once a player acquires a bounty. It is divided into three sections, each representing the player's current status regarding their infamy, and what measures the guards will take to deal with them. The white bar represents the bounty, while the red one the current heat. The sword in the center signifies whether the guards will simply apprehend the criminal or, if it is colored red, attempt to kill them on sight."}

Bounty tracks the number and severity of crimes committed. From there, the offense is converted to a amount.\nComparison with previous releases.\nSeparation by hold.\nUnlike , where bounty was tracked and upheld across the &lt;a href=\"cities\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, bounty in \"Skyrim\" is kept separate by &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, when a crime is committed in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, this does not necessarily translate to a &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; arrest based on the Falkreath Bounty.\nEvading bounty.\nTraditionally, three options for resolving a bounty exist across games: paying the bounty off in gold, resisting arrest, or serving in prison. \"Skyrim\" introduces two more options: evading bounty by flaunting a . &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; can grant the title of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; to citizens, which allows the individual's menial crimes to be overlooked. Crimes such as murder or assault may not be overlooked, however it should be noted that evasion of a bounty via Thanehood can only be used once per hold unless the Dragonborn is elected Thane again by a new Jarl following the Civil War questline. The fifth and last option for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, assuming they are part of the Thieves Guild, is to pay more septims (bribing the guard) but retain stolen goods. It is also possible, if one's Speech is sufficient, to simply talk the guard out of apprehending the Dragonborn.\nStolen items.\nAs with other releases, all &lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; are removed when bounties are resolved.\nDealing with a bounty.\nWhen any bounty is accumulated, guards in Holds or cities accost the offender with law enforcement intentions, forcing them to halt and engage in dialogue. Four options exist for resolving the bounty (five for &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; members).\nGeneral overview.\nThese are the following bounties that can be acquired. The specific values may vary, depending on the crime and the severity of said crime. As a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned bounty is not received if no one witnesses the Dragonborn committing it. However, if a bounty is acquired, killing all witnesses before they can report it will effectively nullify the bounty. The crime bounty ratio is as follows: The more severe the crime, or the more crimes one has committed (even those with a low value), the higher the bounty. The higher the bounty, the longer the prison sentence, and the longer the sentence, the more skills that will be affected.\nPaying the fine.\nIf gold is paid, the guards leave and gold is automatically subtracted from the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould arrest be resisted, all guards in the immediate area, which may even include some bystanders and citizens, draw weapons and attempt to slay the criminal\u2014only upon the criminal's escape or demise do they relent. Certain followers can even turn on the Dragonborn depending on their disposition and morality. During combat, the perpetrator can choose to make the guard \"yield\" their attacks by sheathing their weapon(s) and thus initiating dialogue. This brings the criminal back to the conversation menu, in which they can elect to pay off the bounty or serve jail time. If the criminal's bounty is high enough, Jarls employ &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Collector\"&gt;Bounty Collector&lt;/a&gt;s who have an enforcement warrant to pursue and apprehend criminals or terminate non-compliant law evaders. Unlike guards of each city, who are limited to their specific jurisdiction, bounty collectors can appear in any hold or other location, &lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;randomly&lt;/a&gt;.\nServing jail time.\nCriminals can alternatively choose to spend time in jail for accumulated bounty. When selecting this option, the criminal is stripped of all items, weapons, and armor and placed in a cell. To wait the duration of the sentence, sleep in the &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;. Upon release, all items are returned. If the criminal chooses to escape, bounty is removed, but their items must be manually obtained from an evidence locker somewhere in the prison. If caught, they will receive a new bounty. It should also be noted that serving prison time causes certain skills to decrease in level. The &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Butler\"&gt;Dremora Butler&lt;/a&gt; can be used to retain essential items if one is incarcerated/\nPetty crimes.\nIf the Dragonborn steals a low value object then some of the lower class may send &lt;a href=\"Hired%20Thug\"&gt;Hired Thug&lt;/a&gt;s after them. For lower level characters they may be tough opponents.\nSpecial circumstances.\nHolding the title of Thane.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"becoming%20Thane\"&gt;becoming Thane&lt;/a&gt; of a Hold, minor bounties can be expiated simply by stating one's title as Thane. Offenses exceeding 1,000 though, will be upheld and cannot be excused using this method. Unless the hold has been captured during the civil war and the new Jarl happens to promote the Dragonborn as Thane again, this only works once per hold.\nMarkarth.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, citizens are sent to &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt; to pay off bounties. The sentence is served by &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; or the character can elect to escape. Being imprisoned in the mine is part of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThieves Guild.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29%23Special%20Jobs\"&gt;Special jobs&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, criminals gain the option of bribing guards to allow them to keep\u00a0&lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt;.\nBribery.\nThe \"Bribery\" &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill tree&lt;/a&gt; allows criminals to persuade guards out of arresting or fining them. This method does not remove the entire bounty, but the guard who attempted to collect on the bounty ignores it. The remaining guards who were non-witnesses may still respond to the bounty.\nPersuasion.\nAn option to persuade a guard to grant the Dragonborn clemency may sometimes appear, provided that they have a sufficiently low bounty level. Input phrases include, \"Any chance I could talk you into overlooking this?,\" \"You're making a mistake...,\" and \"I don't have time for this. Do you?\" Success is partially determined by speech level. If done correctly, one's speech will gain experience, but this will not clear a bounty.\nShould the Dragonborn have a speech level of at least 75, this option is always available as long as they are not trespassing anywhere, the bounty is relatively minor, and no guard has been previously persuaded to forget the bounty. To have it reappear and negotiate with the same guard, wait two days and it can be attempted again. Alternatively, one can resist arrest when a certain guard addresses them and then surrender to a different character.\nPacify.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"school%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;school of Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Pacify\"&gt;Pacify&lt;/a&gt; calms hostile targets. Coupled with the \"Kindred Mage\" perk from the same skill tree, the spell has the potential of calming guards, when a criminal acquires a bounty, causing them to forget the bounty temporarily and walk away. This option allows criminals to run or &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fast Travel&lt;/a&gt; to a safer location.\nSilencing witnesses.\nIf in a remote or enclosed location, murdering witnesses to a theft, murder, or another crime annuls the bounty one acquires automatically for committing the crime. Alternatively, if no one witnesses the crime and the criminal is properly \"stealthed\" while committing it, a bounty may not even be acquired.\nIt is worth remembering that animals also count as witnesses, so these must be slain to exonerate the criminal of all pending charges.\nTaking a Hold.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, whenever a hold is taken by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, a criminal's bounty is reset.\nStolen items.\nStoring stolen items in &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chests and containers&lt;/a&gt; or simply dropping may remove the bounty altogether. This is especially useful when items are accidentally picked up in &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shops&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;guild headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe owner of the item that witnesses the theft may simply take the item you picked up. In this case, you might not receive bounty."}

Therefore, they should not be underestimated. They will approach and demand that the player pay the bounty. If the Dragonborn cannot or will not pay for whatever reason, the bounty collector automatically becomes hostile and attacks. The total amount which the Dragonborn must pay is however much the bounty was, as well as an extra 20% fee to cover administrative expenses (essentially, they will demand an amount equal to 1.2x your current bounty)\nBounty removal.\nPaying off the bounty will remove the criminal status within that hold and thus prevent further attacks or arrest attempts by the guards when the Dragonborn is in that hold. However, if the bounty is high enough, the bounty collector will not talk to collect the bounty; instead, they may immediately attack until the Dragonborn is dead (it is unknown if it is a bug or scripted combat)."}

The arrow is then released and the string pushes the arrow forward.\nBows are found throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and are a common weapon, with many types varying in damage, arrow speed, weight, fire rate, and value. Also they are always a two-handed weapon.\nImprovement and damage.\nThe damage of a bow varies from bow to bow, with the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Long Bow&lt;/a&gt; being the weakest and &lt;a href=\"Dragonbone%20Bow\"&gt;Dragonbone&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0( only)\u00a0being the strongest. Every bow's damage is governed by &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; and the level of the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; skill, but there are multiple other ways to increase a bow's damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlmost all bows can be tempered using &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;s found near or around &lt;a href=\"Blacksmiths%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; and other locations. Depending on the material of the bow, a bow may be improved with &lt;a href=\"firewood\"&gt;firewood&lt;/a&gt; or the appropriate &lt;a href=\"Ingots%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingot&lt;/a&gt; to increase the damage of the bow. Depending on perks and level of the Smithing skill, bows can be made increasingly more powerful.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nBows may also be enchanted with weapon enchantments for a variety of different effects. The strength of the enchantment depends on the size of the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; used, the number of usages per charge and the level of the enchanting skill. The potency of &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; enchantments can be boosted if the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Augmented Fire, Frost or Shock perks&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction skill&lt;/a&gt; are chosen.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29%23Weapons\"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of enchantments that can be applied to bows.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Fortify%20Marksman\"&gt;Fortify Marksman&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0potions can be created or bought from &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; to temporarily increase the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; skill tree.\nWeight and fire rate.\nThe weight of the bow also dictates the effort required to pull the string back, or \"draw,\" meaning that the heavier the bow, the longer it will take, and the more damage the shot will do. The lightest bow is 5 and can fire 0.55 shots every second (1.818 seconds before 1 shot).\nStarting at 5, each additional unit of weight added to the bow subtracts another 0.0125 shots/second, so a bow weighing 6 fires 0.5375 shots/second (1.86 seconds/shot).\nThe fire rates between 5 and 6 may seem insignificant, but the difference becomes much more noticeable with heavier bows. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonbone%20Bow\"&gt;Dragonbone Bow&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is the heaviest bow weighing in at 20; and fires at a rate of 0.3624 shots/second (2.759 seconds/shot).\nThe overall draw speed can be calculated by the equation:\n full draw time = 0.4s + 1.66s / (weapon speed * (1 + Quick Shot perk))\nAs weight and quality of the bow's construction material are directly proportional, it is important to note that the better the material (i.e., Glass, or Daedric), the slower the draw speed, and thus the lower the fire rate.\nThe three fastest bows in the game in terms of draw speed share a common speed of 1.0, the fastest speed: &lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;, from the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20to%20the%20Ages\"&gt;Lost to the Ages&lt;/a&gt;\"; &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, acquired at the end of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;\"; and &lt;a href=\"Froki%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Froki's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, a unique long bow found in &lt;a href=\"Graywinter%20Watch\"&gt;Graywinter Watch&lt;/a&gt; that is obtained at the end of &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials\"&gt;Kyne's Sacred Trials&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrow velocity.\nThe velocity at which a bow shoots an arrow is inversely proportional to the bow's fire rate. In other words, the greater the fire rate of the bow, the lower the velocity.\nUsually this means that the heavier the bow, the greater the velocity of the shot. However, there are two exceptions to this rule. In the case of &lt;a href=\"Zephyr\"&gt;Zephyr&lt;/a&gt;, a unique bow weighing 10 and which fires 30% faster than other &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Bows&lt;/a&gt;, arrows fired from this bow will travel slower than even a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hunting Bow&lt;/a&gt; which weighs 7. This is due to Zephyr's previously mentioned unique enchantment. Also, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonbone%20Bow\"&gt;Dragonbone Bow&lt;/a&gt; weighs 20, which is one more than the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric Bow&lt;/a&gt;, however the arrows have a lower velocity than those fired from a Daedric Bow.\nThough the velocity depends on the fire rate, the velocity is not hindered by the &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Shot\"&gt;Quick Shot&lt;/a&gt; perk.\nRange.\nBows have two types of range, arc range and maximum range. The former varies from bow to bow and is directly proportional to the bow's firing velocity. Arrows fired from a low velocity bow will come down in an arc earlier than arrows fired from a high velocity bow. To compensate for this shorter range, low velocity bows must be angled higher to hit targets at range.\nThe latter type of range, or maximum range, is a universal range between bows. After traveling a certain distance, somewhere around 60\u201365 yards, all arrows have a damage of 0. Arrows at this distance will most of the time clip through (pass through) enemies and land on the other side having done no damage. This will still cause animals and characters to become aware of the Dragonborn's presence and search for them, however this will not cause friendly characters to become hostile.\nDifferences with crossbows.\nIf \"Dawnguard\" is installed, the player will gain access to &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;. Crossbows, similar to bows, are ranged weapons that benefit from sneak attacks, and can be enchanted and upgraded. Compared to the crossbow, a bow is much lighter and faster to reload, and arrows are much easier to acquire than their counterpart. However, its base damage is generally lower than the crossbow, and is slower to fire arrows, compared to the crossbow firing &lt;a href=\"Bolts%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;bolts&lt;/a&gt;.\nBows.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

So pay attention, and put away those blasted cup-and-ball toys.\nNow a &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; what's made of one piece of springy wood is called a \"self\" bow, because it's only itself, d'ye see? Them &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; with their longbows prefers it that way, and say a bow ain't no bow unless it's as tall as its archer before stringing. They like to use bow staves of yew, elm, or ash, 'cause those are woods that are dense and strong, yet flexible if tillered right.\nElven bows are usually shorter and more complicated. They're called \"composite\" bows because they're composed of several different pieces -- are you listening, you jackanapes? -- and even different materials. The central stave is usually wood, curved as in a self bow, but then pieces curved in the opposite direction are attached to the ends for added power. These \"recurved\" end-pieces are often made of horn or &lt;a href=\"carapace\"&gt;carapace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThem &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; down in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, now, they've got a problem, because they love their bows more even than me or you, but they can't cut no wood for staves 'cause of their loony &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;. So they make composite bows built entirely from horn, bug-shell, antlers, and even bone -- though how they get that bone to flex is way beyond me. Treat it somehow, they do, boiling it in vinegars or suchlike, or so I hear tell.\nNext is arrows. We'll start with the feathers what go on the back end to make them fly straight. Here, look how this arrow is fletched -- are the vanes in a straight line parallel to the shaft? No, they ain't. Come back tomorrow and I'll tell you why."}

He was researched by Denogorath \"the Dread Archivist\" by order of the \"Greater Titan\" Kkrohziz, who wanted the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Dusk\"&gt;Library of Dusk&lt;/a&gt; to contain information on the origins of the Titans.\nSome time after the Dragon War, Boziikkodstrun, who was considered a \"greater dragon,\" unsuccessfully attempted to fly out of the borders of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. This attempt impinged upon the attention of the \"&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Domination\" &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, who, noted by the remarkable feat of will-force, offered Boziikkodstrun a place in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. In his exhausted state, the dragon accepted the offer, and was bound in \"chains of cold ebon iron\" in the nethermost depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Lies\"&gt;Tower of Lies&lt;/a&gt;. There, he was interrogated and tortured for the secret of the dominance the dov had achieved over mortals, but never uttered \"a single syllable in his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;abrasive language&lt;/a&gt;.\" Vexed, Molag Bal took revenge on Boziikkodstrun by slowly consuming the flesh from his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bones&lt;/a&gt; (presumably, while he lived) and promising that if he couldn't obtain the secrets of the dragons from &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, then he'd make even mightier \"dragons of his own.\"\nThe skeleton was taken to &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Laboratory\"&gt;The Vile Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, where it was infused with the blood-of-darkness that reawakened it as a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. During the process, Bal ordered that the skeleton be somewhat adjusted and improved to a plan of his own devising, forming a bone-frame even mightier than that of dragons. It was then plunged into the deepest pool in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Chasm\"&gt;Azure Chasm&lt;/a&gt; in order to absorb the blue \"liquescence\" that would give it a new body, brain, and brawn. Within a \"nanaeon,\" a mighty creature drew itself from the chasm plasm and shook itself free of the primordial slime. In response to the summons of Molag Bal, it ascended and bounded nimbly up &lt;a href=\"The%20Endless%20Stair\"&gt;The Endless Stair&lt;/a&gt; as the first of the Daedric Titans."}

She will also bluntly state that \"If he'd only kiss [her], [she] wouldn't have to beat him up all the time!\"\nGames.\nThe Dragonborn can play \"hide-and-seek\" or \"tag\" with Braith, &lt;a href=\"Mila%20Valentia\"&gt;Mila Valentia&lt;/a&gt; and Lars Battle-Born.\n&lt;a href=\"Adoption\"&gt;Adoption&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf one wishes to adopt Braith through less noble means, one easy way is to enter Amren's house during the day (the house is usually unlocked while his wife is home), then hide on the left side of the bed, between the bed and the wall. From here, it is rather easy to kill Saffir with a stealthy arrow shot\u2014even if Amren is home. While Amren is seated in the chair by the front door, he is also an easy target.\nAs long as Braith does not witness the Dragonborn firing either arrow, she will not become hostile, though she may panic or flee, and say, \"You're mean. I hate you, I hate you forever and ever and ever.\" Even if she is hostile, using the spell &lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt; will keep her at bay until she calms down and starts saying things like, \"What...what am I gonna do?\"\nIt also possible to reverse pickpocket a frenzy poison or use the spell to make either Amren or Saffir attack the other, which will always result in Amren killing Saffir.\nAfter Saffir is dead, Braith (and all other children in Skyrim who are orphaned through similar circumstances) can be adopted, either directly or by waiting for her to go to &lt;a href=\"Honorhall%20Orphanage\"&gt;Honorhall Orphanage&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nLars Battle-Born.\nBraith: \"Battle-Born!

He is considered the husband of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and is the embodiment of the afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegend and lore.\nAccording to Nordic legend, the \"Elven Giants,\" the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, harboring bitterness against Shor for his creation of the mortal plane of Nirn, conspired against and brought about the god's demise at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, dooming Shor to the underworld. Storms and rain, natural phenomena associated with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, are said to have first begun to occur after these legendary events.\nAncient &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; tradition depicts Shor as a bloodthirsty warrior-god, who led the descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Wandering Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;) to victory over their &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; oppressors (the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;) time and again. Due to this close association with the races of Men, Shor is sometimes also referred to as the Children's God. Before his doom, Shor was called the King of the Gods, a title which has only been attributed to one other divinity; &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeliefs involving Shor.\nThe afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; is believed by Nordic culture to be a divine covenant between &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (Shor) and the descendants of &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Wandering Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; who fought at Shor's side in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; (most commonly, the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; and their own descendants, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;). This ancient belief holds that those of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;, who are linked by ancestry to these Ehlnofey, upon death find their souls judged not by how they lived but by how they died. Hence, the souls of such mortals who fall in battle or die fighting for their beliefs are given passage to the afterlife of Sovngarde per Shor's decree, where in Lorkhan's own image, they earn a place in Sovngarde's &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; among the fallen heroes of Men.\nShor may be considered the de facto ruler of this afterlife of Sovngarde, as other divinities who hearken back to the Dawn Era, such as &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, also reside there and they refer to Shor as their sovereign. This is a surprising revelation, as Shor's continuing active agency in his realm runs counter to Lorkhan's status as a \"dead\" god. This may be due to the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; can be killed as part of the divine contract of creation, meaning they too may have access to an afterlife of their own making, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong Nords, as well as others who can trace lineage to the Ehlnofey that stood at Lorkhan's side, Shor is often held in great reverence. Venerated as a Chief-God alongside &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; despite his status as \"deceased,\" and as the noble Lord of Sovngarde, many Nordic characters are heard to swear by Shor, and his name is regularly invoked in expressions of emotion. On several of the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Walls&lt;/a&gt; that were erected by the ancient Nords during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, references to Lorkhan are inscribed in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon Language&lt;/a&gt;, in which Shor is referred to as the \"hoar father.\" Tellingly, one such inscription upon the Word Walls translates as follows:\nRelationship to Sovngarde.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; ventures into &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; in pursuit of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin the World-Eater&lt;/a&gt; during the events of , only Shor's vacant throne is found within the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. The spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; and Nord heroes who dwell within Shor's hall will remark upon the apparent absence of the god, stating that Shor's light would blind the Dragonborn's mortal eyes.\nThe ancient Nordic god of trials against adversity, &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, who had been Shor's Shield-Thane during the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; and now guards the Whalebone Bridge leading to the Hall of Valor, recounts to the Dragonborn that no few among the heroic souls within Sovngarde were eager to confront Alduin as the dragon entered their realm, but that Shor restrained their wrathful onslaught. The spirit of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; likewise states that Sovngarde's honored dead had sheathed their blades at Shor's command, as the god apparently had foreseen the \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;fateful errant&lt;/a&gt;\" of the Dovahkiin.\nRelationship to Nirn.\nTogether with &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, Shor (&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;) is one of two deities mentioned in the religious traditions of almost all cultures in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Universally recognized as the divinity most responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;'s creation, interpretations of Lorkhan differ between the cultures of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; in particular: The former often view him as a fallen hero-god or patron deity to mortal kind, whereas the latter uniformly vilify him as a trickster or demon-god, responsible for separating their immortal essence from the spirit world.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; enters &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; and presents himself as &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, Tsun welcomes them with the words: \"\"Well met, mage of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The Nords may have forgotten their &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;forefathers&lt;/a&gt;' respect for the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Clever Craft&lt;/a&gt;, but your &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;comrades&lt;/a&gt; throng this hall. Here in Shor's &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; we honor it still.\"\" This remark by Tsun reveals Shor is well-informed about the realm of the living despite his status as a \"dead\" god.\nShor's lingering connection to the mortal world he created is evinced again by the &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20Valor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Call of Valor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt;, a boon which Tsun bestows on the Dragonborn in Shor's name for the vanquishment of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; enables the Dragonborn to bring one of Sovngarde's heroes to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; for a brief time, illustrating how Shor has the power to return the dead to the realm of the living; a divine clout the god shall wield in full at the final reckoning, when he and the heroic souls he congregated will ride out to show their final, best worth.\nBardic traditions.\nShor's Tongue.\n\"Shor's Tongue\" is the first of &lt;a href=\"Five%20Songs%20of%20King%20Wulfharth\"&gt;five songs&lt;/a&gt; that recount the tale of the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic king Wulfharth, dating back to &lt;a href=\"1E%20500\"&gt;1E 500&lt;/a&gt;. After the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;n army at &lt;a href=\"Glenumbria%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt;, where King &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; was slain, Wulfharth of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; was elected by the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; was so powerful that he could not verbally swear into the office, and scribes were used to draw up his oaths. Immediately thereafter, bards scribed the first of his reign: a fiery reinstatement of the traditional &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The edicts of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; were outlawed, their priests put to the stake, and their halls set ablaze. The shadow of King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; had ended for a span. For his zealotry, Wulfharth was called \"Shor's Tongue,\" and &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; of the North."}

Their corpses fell among us as we landed and we looked on them in confusion, shaken as we were by this latest battle in the war of twilight. The chieftains of the other tribes still held their grudge against our own, &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; son of Shor; more, they had united finally to destroy us and used skin-magic to trick us into disarray.\n\"Shor was disgusted with the defeat, and disgusted more when reminded by &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt; that our withdrawal had been wise, for we were outnumbered eight to one. Shor took on the form of his Totem then, which he used to better shape his displeasure, rather than to shout it aloud and risk more storm-death. His shield thanes, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, bowed their heads, collecting the spears and swords and wine-knives Shor threw about the broken pillars of the easternmost sky-temple. The rest of us looked away and to our own, not even to acknowledge the thunderclap that signaled our Queen's arrival, who stepped in from the tunnel of her own breath last.\n\"Kyne had taken the head of Magnar, the jarl that betrayed the weakness of our spear-lines and fled the field. Shor shook his scaled mane. \"That isn't Magnar,\" he said, \"Magnar, I fear, fell at sunrise and became replaced by mirrors. The other chieftains are using our forms to lead us astray.\"\n\"And then Shor walked away from his War-Wife to enter the cave that led to the Underworld. He needed to take counsel with his father yet again. \"Our chieftain loses heart,\" &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; said, Bed-Wife of Shor, hefting another body onto the corpse pile some of us were making, \"And so goes to the speak to one that has none anymore. Mirrors, indeed, and in that I see no logic.\"\n\"Tsun took her by the hair, for he was angered by her words and heavy with lust. He was a berserker despite his high station, and love followed battle to his kind. \"You weren't made for that kind of thinking,\" Stuhn said, dragging Dibella towards a whaleskin tent, \"Jhunal was. And no one should be speaking to him now.\" Tsun eyed the Clever Man who had heard him. \"Logic is dangerous in these days, in this place. To live in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; is to change your mind ten times a day lest it freeze to death. And we can have none of that now.\"\n\"Kyne could have stopped all of this but did nothing but stare at the crowd of Nords around her. Stuhn and Tsun were shifting and it was still uncouth to prevent this kind of neighboring. She looked on Jhunal and did not know if he should be spoken to or not. Rules were changing. Even her handmaiden was gone, and that lack of attendance was a transgression, but Kyne knew &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; was no doubt making treaties with one of the other chieftains, and the Pact still allowed for Tear-Wives to do that. After her husband Shor had forgotten to kiss her, a tradition among the War-Married when they returned from the field together, Kyne kept her storms to herself and knew there would be no true understanding until the twilight was lifted.\n\"Shor breathed the lamplights of the Underworld to life with small whispers of fire. The dark did not frighten him-- he had been born in a cave much like this-- but nevertheless it added to the mounting disgust in his spirit. Ever since the Moot at the House of We, where the chieftains of the other tribes had accused him of trespass and cattle-theft and foul-mouthery, he knew it would come to a war we could not win. Any of those words were enough for the treason-mark, and traitors were only met with banishment, disfigurement, or half-death. He had taken the first with pride, roaring a chieftain's gobletman into dust to underscore his willingness to leave, knowing we would follow. He had taken the second by drawing a circle on the House's adamantine floor with his tailmouth-tusk which broke with a keening sound, showing the other chieftains that it would all come around again. And he took the third by vomiting his own heart into the circle like a hammerclap, guarding his wraith in the manner of his father and roaring at the other tribes, \"Again we fight for our petty placements in this House, in the Around Us, and all it will amount to is a helix of ghosts like mine now spit into the world below where we fight again! I can already feel the war below us starting, and yet you have not yet thrown your first spears even here!\" We took our leave of the House and would never reconvene again in this age.\n\"The Moot looked to the tribe of Ald son of Ald but he would break no oath of the Pact, saying \"Shor has paid ransom now three times for the the sins we accused him of, and by that we will hold him as dead and shake not our spears against him or his kin. Of the below he speaks, he is confused by it, for under us is only a prologue, and under that still is only a scribe that hasn't written anything yet. Shor as always forgets the above, and condemns himself and any other who would believe him into this cycle.\" Ald's shield thane &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; shook his head at this, for he was akin to Tsun and did not care much for logic-talk as much as he did only for his own standing. He told his chieftain that these words had been said before and Ald only sighed and said, \"Yes, and always they will be ignored. As for the war you crave, bold Trinimac, and all of you assembled, do not worry. A spear will be thrown into this soon, from Shor's own tribe, and the House of We will be allowed our vengeance.\"\n\"Shor found the alcove at the core of the world and spoke to his dead father. He said a prayer to remove any trickery of mirrors and the ghost of Shor father of Shor appeared, saying \"Ald and the others have paid time and again for the the sins we accused them of, and by that you should hold them as dead and shake not the spears of your tribe against any of their kind again. Of the above he speaks, Ald is confused by it, for above us is only an ending, and above that still is only a scribe that hasn't written anything yet. Ald as always forgets the ground below him, and condemns himself and any other who would believe him into this cycle.\" But Shor shook his head at this, for he was akin to Ald and did not care much for logic-talk as much as he did only for his own standing. He told his father that these words had been said before and Shor only sighed and said, \"Yes, and always they will be ignored. As for the counsel you crave, bold son, and in spite of all your other fathers here with me, that you create every time you spit out your doom, do not worry. You have again beat the drum of war, and perhaps this time you will win.\" Shor son of Shor returned then to us on the mountaintop.\n\"He didn't need to explain what he had learned, for we had been there with him. Trinimac left Dibella in his tent as we assembled, and he had not touched her, frozen in the manner of the Nords when we are unsure of our true place, and asked his brother to rearm him. Stuhn was confused for a moment, thinking this an odd shift, but Mara was returned and had made great headway into treaty with the other tribes, telling him that such Totems here in the twilight could now be trusted. Our Queen merely nodded to her War-Husband and shouted us back to the fields of our enemies, towards a weakened spot among their spear-lines that Magnar our scout would light for us.\n\"And the awful fighting began again.\""}

Shornhelm is one of the more influencial cities in High Rock, being the seat of power for the entirety of Rivenspire, even over its companion city, &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Shornhelm is situated in the center of the Rivenspire region, near the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Kurallian%20Mountains\"&gt;Kurallian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The land around Shornhelm descends towards the land, to the west towards &lt;a href=\"Crestshade\"&gt;Crestshade&lt;/a&gt; and to the east towards &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;. The land south of Shornhelm is nothing but farmland, with the &lt;a href=\"Hinault%20Farm\"&gt;Hinault Farm&lt;/a&gt; being the most prominent. The northern end of the city holds the &lt;a href=\"Fevered%20Mews\"&gt;Fevered Mews&lt;/a&gt;, which is a cave near &lt;a href=\"the%20Doomcrag\"&gt;the Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt;. East of Shornhelm is several ruins of historical worth, such as the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Shornhelm%20Ruins\"&gt;Old Shornhelm Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. West of Shornhelm is nothing but light grasslands, in what is traditional &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;House Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; territory. But deep in the mountains is the &lt;a href=\"Silverhoof%20Vale\"&gt;Silverhoof Vale&lt;/a&gt;, where a group of &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt;s had traveled with the destruction of their homeland.\nShornhelm itself is walled-off, split into two separate districts. Upper Shornhelm is the home of the nobility as well as the political powers. This district overlooks the rest of the city, and it has an entrance to the Fevered Maws. The triumvirate of Rivenspire resides in Upper Shornhelm, where they can discuss matters of the region. Lower Shornhelm is virtually everything else, where the people congregate and trade with each other. The &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20Market%20Plaza\"&gt;Shornhelm Market Plaza&lt;/a&gt; is situated in the center of the area, with the main entrance directly south of it. The northwestern end of the market is the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Wolf%20Inn\"&gt;Dead Wolf Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Northwest towards the western gate is the &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20Chapel\"&gt;Shornhelm Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, where the religious deity is worshipped. On the west and east walls are the local &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapters, respectively. The northeast leads to the forge, as well as the stables and the eastern gate. The &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20Outlaws%20Refuge\"&gt;Shornhelm Outlaws Refuge&lt;/a&gt; has entrances on the east outer wall and an alley near the Market Plaza.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Legend of Dame Marcelle Stenric.\nDuring the 24th century, the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt; had ruled over the city-state of Shornhelm for several generations, after establishing themselves from distant &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt;. One of these rulers was &lt;a href=\"Aaric%20Dorell\"&gt;Aaric Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, who had a loyal niece known throughout the land as &lt;a href=\"Marcelle%20Stenric\"&gt;Marcelle Stenric&lt;/a&gt;, the Knight of Shornhelm. Stenric was loyal to her family and their holdings, defending them from various threats. When a powerful &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; threatened Shornhelm, she stood her ground and defeated the beast, with the fight lasting for a day and a half. It ended with the Troll's heading being severed by Stenric's blade, &lt;a href=\"Dauntless\"&gt;Dauntless&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Feud\"&gt;Great Feud&lt;/a&gt; occurred and &lt;a href=\"Lanciot%20Dorell\"&gt;Lanciot Dorell&lt;/a&gt; was taken by &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;House Tamrith&lt;/a&gt;, it was Stenric who fought the &lt;a href=\"Hammers%20of%20Umbrage\"&gt;Hammers of Umbrage&lt;/a&gt; (a brigand loyal to the Tamrith), to rescue her cousin. These two legends were what established Marcelle Stenric as a hero of Rivenspire.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Legacy of the Sage, Gyron Vardengroet.\nThe Sage, born as &lt;a href=\"Gyron%20Vardengroet\"&gt;Gyron Vardengroet&lt;/a&gt;, is well-known throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as a champion and counselor of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Gyron was born in a poor family from a humble village called &lt;a href=\"Moonguard\"&gt;Moonguard&lt;/a&gt;. From a really young age, Gyron was skilled in the arcane arts, more so than the typical Breton. This would begin his journey in learning more about the magic surrounding us. By the time he was one year old, he was able to levitate the family dog. He eventually took training from his local wizard, though he would surpass him, seeking out the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in Shornhelm. After traveling throughout the &lt;a href=\"Kurallian%20Mountains\"&gt;Kurallian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Gyron had arrived at the city gates of Shornhelm, the first city he had ever visited. At the Mages Guild, he took lessons from &lt;a href=\"Morkledder\"&gt;Morkledder&lt;/a&gt;, the Guildmaster in Shornhelm. But even then, Gyron surpassed the Mages Guild, leaving his homeland and studying at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Feud for the Throne; Ranser &amp; Phylgeon.\nA common consensus in Rivenspire was that King &lt;a href=\"Hurlburt%20Branquette\"&gt;Hurlburt Branquette&lt;/a&gt; was the greatest post-&lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; leader for Shornhelm, ruling from &lt;a href=\"Timeline%232E%20522\"&gt;2E 522&lt;/a&gt; to his death in &lt;a href=\"2E%20546\"&gt;2E 546&lt;/a&gt;. He led Shornhelm at the fateful &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Granden%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Granden Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Hurlburt was the twenty-first leader of Shornhelm, belong to &lt;a href=\"House%20Branquette\"&gt;House Branquette&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Black Drake's Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, King Hurlburt joined the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance that this point, consisted of the Kingdoms of High Rock. When he had passed away, the throne was passed to his legitimate son, &lt;a href=\"Phylgeon%20Montclair\"&gt;Phylgeon Montclair&lt;/a&gt;, who was only fourteen years old when he assumed the throne of Shornhelm. The Bretons of Branquette and &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;House Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; supported his older brother, &lt;a href=\"Ranser%20Branquette\"&gt;Ranser Branquette&lt;/a&gt;, who was born out of wedlock from a poor Tamrith cousin. What would follow was a competition for legitimacy for the throne, both brothers are each other's necks with the most prominent houses of Rivenspire taking part in the event.\nThe Brothers' Defense &amp; the Feud Aftermath.\nThe advisors of Phylgeon insisted that he was the legitimate heir, citing a codicil claimant called the \"Bretonnick Natalitie\" that states \"Howse Mount Clayre\" is the royal house of Shornhelm. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Council of the North&lt;/a&gt; took in various pieces of evidence, but at one point, the Bretonnick had disappeared, and Ranser appeared with a suspicious decree from the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; stating that House Branquette was their \"Royal House Delegates\" in the Kingdom of Rivenspire. Eventually, the competition had ended when Ranser became the King through a narrow victory. Phylgeon's advisors urged him to wage war for the crown, though he declined, rather being content with just being the Baron of Montclair. He went on to have a child named &lt;a href=\"Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign, Ranser was known for his brutality and bitter temper. Sometime later, Ranser had a daughter named &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, who would catch the eye of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, leader of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Though he would soon have other plans.\nKing Ranser's Tirade over the Covenant.\nTo further establish the Daggerfall Covenant, Emeric of Cumberland married &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, the Princess of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, to form an alliance between High Rock and Hammerfell. Knowing that his daughter was rejected, Ranser was furious. He withdrew the Shornhelm ambassador from the Court of Wayrest and did not attend the wedding in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;. After the wedding, the Covenant flourished from the trading, but all the while, Ranser amassed his army throughout Rivenspire, with help from the houses of the Kingdom. On the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; of 2E 566, &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; had begun with the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20566%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser utilized the &lt;a href=\"Oldgate%20Lancers\"&gt;Oldgate Lancers&lt;/a&gt; to fight at the forefront and siege weapons to break down the wall. Though eventually, the forces of Rivenspire were pushed back into their territory, where the city-state of Shornhelm would be razed by the Daggerfall Covenant and their new allies, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanser's Demise &amp; the Battle of Traitor's Tor.\nAs time went on, the Great Houses of Rivenspire withdrew from Ranser's Army. Both &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;House Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt; had left the conflict while minor factions such as &lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;House Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; never even took up arms in the first place. Despite the feud from the throne, House Montclair remained with Ranser to the bitter end, all the way to his demise, and even afterward. With their forces overwhelmed by the Covenant and the Orcs under &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;, Ranser's Army was pushed into &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, where their army was nearly obliterated. With what little they had, they escaped to a nameless tor where Ranser took a serious initiative. With the help of his court mage, &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt;, Ranser turned his remaining soldiers into immortal warriors, as the Orcs were demolishing them. Before Ranser could complete his ritual, he was killed by &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt;, who spilled the royal blood that made the ritual backfire, turning everyone into undying skeletons. To this day, Ranser's spirit remains there, taking a position of the tor, in case of an attack by Emeric. This nameless tor would live in infamy as the &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War Aftermath &amp; Wylon Montclair's Initiative.\nIn the end, the Kingdom of Rivenspire had given up on the fight, joining the Greater Daggerfall Covenant. The city-state of Shornhelm was left without a King, leaving the Council of the North to leading the region. This triumvirate consisted of the Bretons of Dorell, Tamrith, and Montclair. Baron Wylon Montclair felt that Rivenspire was in need of a King and that he should be that King. At one point, Wylon's historians were able to find the long-lost Bretonnick Natalitie which states, \"... seeing all in order then in Sharn Helm and its Lands Contyguous, the most royale and high ... (unintelligible) ... appointeth in Perpetuitie sayde Howse Mount Clayre in rulership over ... (unintelligible) ... and Sharn Helm. So mote it bee.\" With the document in hand, Wylon Montclair took the initiative, annexing the northern portion of Shornhelm, and waging civil war with the Daggerfall Covenant, continuing where Ranser left off. The Covenant and &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; were forced to step in, traveling to Shornhelm.\nShornhelm Divided; Enter the Daggerfall Covenant.\nAhead of time, High King Emeric had tasked a prized &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant with dealing with the situation after the dilemma in &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent convened with both &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, who were able to provide intel on House Montclair and the recent annexation. Members of the Shornhelm Guard, &lt;a href=\"Orlozag%20gra-Yarzol\"&gt;Orlozag gra-Yarzol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Juberic%20Gane\"&gt;Juberic Gane&lt;/a&gt; had left their faction and joined House Montclair in their pursuit. After defeating both of them, the Agent was able to free the nobility and the rest of the Guard. Afterward, &lt;a href=\"Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; had intervened, attempting to confront Reezal-Jul at the &lt;a href=\"Fevered%20Mews\"&gt;Fevered Mews&lt;/a&gt;. Both the Agent and Ravenwatch fought waves of &lt;a href=\"Bloodfiend\"&gt;Bloodfiend&lt;/a&gt;s and Montclair warriors until Reezal-Jul escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Eyebright%20Feld\"&gt;Eyebright Feld&lt;/a&gt;. Once Emeric had arrived into Shornhelm, beginning the war against the Great House Montclair.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Story of Andorak Lariat; the Legacy of Uriel IV.\nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor was at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, since he was an indirect heir to the throne. Since his parents are &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Septim\"&gt;Katariah Septim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gallivere%20Lariat\"&gt;Gallivere Lariat&lt;/a&gt;, noble of Shornhelm. Once Uriel IV had passed away, the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; would have been passed onto &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt;, but it was voted by the Elder Council that Andorak would disinherit the throne. This caused controversy with Andorak's supporters, who fought against Imperial forces. In response to this, the Elder Council had granted Andorak leadership of the Kingdom of Shornhelm, where his family had ruled ever since. The Ruby Throne was passed onto Andorak's cousin, &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;. Andorak Lariat and his family would rule over Shornhelm for quite some time.\nShornhelm during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Evermore was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Rodore\"&gt;King Rodore&lt;/a&gt;."}

But the Montclairs count humility among their many virtues, and have often been willing to defer to pretenders with weaker claims to royalty in the interest of peace. That this humility has sometimes been tragically over-indulged was sadly proven in the case of my father\u2014Phylgeon, 38th Baron Montclair.\nAs all students of Breton history know, the greatest post-&lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0monarch of Shornhelm was King\u00a0Hurlburt, who led our army at the Battle of Granden Tor and ruled the North from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"2E%20522\"&gt;2E 522&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0until his death in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"2E%20546\"&gt;546&lt;/a&gt;. Hurlburt was of House Branquette, 21st Count of the Name, and had taken as his queen Countess Iphilia of Montclair. When King Hurlburt died his legitimate son, Prince Phylgeon, was only fourteen years of age, and though his inheritance was championed by House Montclair, Houses Branquette and Tamrith supported his elder half-brother, Prince\u00a0&lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;Ranser&lt;/a&gt;, who had been born out of wedlock to a poor Tamrith cousin. (House Dorell, typically aloof, declined to endorse either candidate.)\nWhat is less well known is the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that led to Ranser being crowned King of Shornhelm rather than Phylgeon. The advisors of the young Baron Montclair (his mother had predeceased King\u00a0Hurlbut\"\"\u00a0by a mere two years) contended that he, as the legitimate son, was the proper heir to the throne\u2014a claim further buttressed by language in a codicil to the famous \"Bretonnick Natalitie\" that declared \"Howse Mount Clayre\" the royal house of Shornhelm. The Council of the North met to consider the various claimants, but during their deliberations the Montclair advisors found that the Bretonnick codicil had gone missing, while Prince Ranser brought forth a suspiciously long-lost &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; decree that named House Branquette their \"Breton Royal Delegates\" in Rivenspire.\nThe vote of the Council was a narrow victory for Prince Ranser, thereafter King Ranser of Shornhelm. Some of Prince Phylgeon's advisors urged him to fight for the crown, but the young prince declined, preferring to become simply the Baron of Montclair.\nOh, fateful humility! We all know where Phylgeon's deference led\u2014to the &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;tragic events of 566&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and the insurrection against the First\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in what is known (to our shame) as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. According to the standard histories, all the noble houses\u2014Montclair, Tamrith, even Dorell\u2014answered King Ranser's call to muster and marched behind his banner in his fatal war against High King\u00a0Emeric\u00a0and the South. What is not generally known is that Count Phylgeon of Montclair was uncertain of the rightness of Ranser's cause, and offered to both Kings Ranser and Emeric to serve as a peace envoy between the two sides. High King Emeric's reply has been lost to history, but Ranser's angry refusal is well known. Once again my father deferred to his elder half-brother, and the Montclair Knights joined Ranser's doomed army.\nIn the immediate aftermath of King Ranser's fall, Rivenspire fell into chaos. The Crown of Shornhelm went missing during the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;, and the fateful \"Direnni\u00a0decree\" that elevated Ranser to the throne has likewise not been seen since. The death of Ranser was the end of the line of House Branquette, and since then there has been no King of Shornhelm, Rivenspire having been jointly ruled by the triumvirate Council of the North. That body has tried, with the best of intentions, to keep peace and order in the northern counties, but nobody, if they were speaking honestly, would say the Council's efforts have sufficed. Shornhelm\u2014and the North\u2014need a King.\nAnd why shouldn't they have one? If I may speak frankly, setting aside, however regretfully, the traditional Montclair mantle of humility, then I must confess that I, Baron Wylon of Montclair, am certainly the legitimate heir to the throne of Shornhelm. My grandfather was King Hurlburt, and I descend from him in the direct and legitimate line of succession, a claim no one else in the North can make. (That also makes me the sole living heir to the domain of the Branquettes, much of which was unfairly parceled out to the Tamriths and Dorells, but no\u2014humility, always humility!)\nFurthermore, at this critical juncture I am fortunate to be able to announce that the long-missing Bretonnick Codicil has been found by the Montclair house historian, the operative clause of which I shall quote here:\n\"... seeing all in order then in Sharn Helm\"\" and its Lands Contyguous, the most royale and high \u2026 (unintelligible) \u2026 appointeth in Perpetuitie sayde Howse Mount Clayre in rulership over ... (unintelligible) \u2026 and Sharn Helm. So mote it bee.\"\nPeople of Rivenspire, Baron Wylon of Montclair is prepared to do his duty."}

Apparently &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Baron Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt; has started a rebellion and is looking to seize control of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Darien will then ask you to head to Shornhelm and talk to &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Eselde%20Tamrith\"&gt;Countess Eselde Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; to join her cause. \nHead to Shornhelm and go to the chapel. You will hear a conversation between the countess and some other nobles where they voice their disagreements on how to handle the situation. When the nobles have left, speak with the countess. She will ask you to investigate Montclair's betrayal and deal with two guards who defected and helped Baron Montclair take over the upper city. Your targets are &lt;a href=\"Juberic%20Gane\"&gt;Juberic Gane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orlozag%20gra-Yarzol\"&gt;Orlozag gra-Yarzol&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom live in the north of the city. This part of town is swarming with Montclair's soldiers though, so take care. \nOrlozag will be in the northwestern barracks. Kill her, then head to the prison cells. You will find a chest here with &lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Reezal-Jul\"&gt;incriminating evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing that Montclair is looking to take over all of Shornhelm, and that he is operating from a base in the &lt;a href=\"Fevered%20Mews\"&gt;Fevered Mews&lt;/a&gt;. You will also find a man here named &lt;a href=\"Skordo%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Skordo the Knife&lt;/a&gt;; speak with him and he will tell you that he was captured by Montclair's troops, and will ask you to let him out. If you do so, he will say he will report back to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Alard%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Alard Dorell&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext, head to the northeast of town. There will be two buildings in this section of town, both of which are relevant to this quest. On the top floor of the western building, you will find more &lt;a href=\"Reply%20from%20Reezal-Jul\"&gt;incriminating evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing that Montclair is planning to turn people into vampires to take over Rivenspire. The eastern building, Stornhelm Castle, is where Juberic Gane resides. Kill him, then head back to the chapel to report to Baron Dorell. He will tell you that the enemy general &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt; has kidnapped some nobles and that you should head to the Fevered Mews to go rescue them. He and the countess will then have a discussion where they agree to a two-pronged approach where they retake the upper city while you're in the Mews. \nAfter that, the countess will ask you to talk to her; she has information on the mews. It is apparently a place where the sick and infirm used to be sent, but it was sealed off some time ago. It's a complex ravine with many caves and an ancient ruin, which she suspects is where Reezal-Jul is operating a portal. If persuaded, she will then reveal the existence of an ancient sewer tunnel that will lead you right to the entrance of the mews. If you don't persuade her, \nHead through to the mews. In there, you will find &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt;, who will offer to assist you throughout the mews. You will have to kill at least one of Montclair's henchman here to get your hands on the key needed to free the nobles from their cages. Once you have the key, look for the nobles' cages in the side tunnels. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Aurine%20Tamrith\"&gt;Lady Aurine Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; will be in the southwest, &lt;a href=\"Nilthin%20al-Bergama\"&gt;Nilthin al-Bergama&lt;/a&gt; will be east of that and &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Estienn%20Guillon\"&gt;Sir Estienn Guillon&lt;/a&gt; will be in the northeast of the tunnels. Once they are all freed, the quest will direct you to speak with Count Ravenwatch. He will not say anything useful, but will avoid answering your questions as to why he is helping you. Either way, head to the southeast of the tunnels and enter the ancient ruins. \nHead to the northeast of the ruins and you will find a portal. Several waves of enemies will come from the portal, and you will have to kill them all to progress. Once they are dealt with, speak with Count Ravenwatch and ask him to close the portal. After it is closed, speak with him again and he will tell you to go and report to &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, who has recently arrived in Shornhelm.\nEmeric will be in the castle. Speak with him to finish the quest."}

In the book \"&lt;a href=\"Opusculus%20Lamae%20Bal\"&gt;Opusculus Lamae Bal&lt;/a&gt;\", her screams became known as\u00a0the Shrieking Winds, which still haunt certain parts of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nEntrances and sublocations.\nThe bastion has three entrances, one at &lt;a href=\"South%20Shriekwind%20Bastion\"&gt;South Shriekwind Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, one at &lt;a href=\"North%20Shriekwind%20Bastion\"&gt;North Shriekwind Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and the exit leads to Shriekwind Bastion Overlook, an unmarked vista point overlooking &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. The South Shriekwind Bastion entrance north of Falkreath enters the dungeon approximately halfway through by a hidden door.\nAlternatively, the mountain can be climbed a short way through &lt;a href=\"Peak%27s%20Shade%20Tower\"&gt;Peak's Shade Tower&lt;/a&gt;, which allows Shriekwind Bastion's discovery. After it is discovered, it can be fast traveled to.\nWalkthrough.\nThe first part goes through multiple hallways containing skeletons and vampires, which later leads to a large open area. Head left and go up the stairs; this leads to a few corridors and rooms containing skeletons. Eventually, one will come to a room with two gates, a large gate to the north and a smaller one to the south.\nThere is a circular stone with three handles in the center of the room. Two of the handles open secret doors leading to some gear and empty coffins. The third handle opens the small gate. There is a room with a chest and three chains on the wall. Pull the chain on the left to open the large gate.\nContinue through the large gate and continue going up. Near the top there is a wide hallway with a pillar that has a handle on it at one end and a gate at the other. Pulling the handle on the pillar will open the gate, but also start the flamethrower trap. Look to the right and find a chain on the inside of the tunnel. This will open the gate without setting off the trap. In the next room is the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce he is defeated, head up the stairs to the circular corridor. There is a chest along the outer wall, and on the inner wall is a doorway that leads to stairs that lead to the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt;. This word is for &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Fury\"&gt;Elemental Fury&lt;/a&gt;. The coffin before the Wall contains a leveled Draugr in it.\nExit through the door onto Shriekwind Bastion Overlook. It is possible to climb the mountain to this door and skip the dungeon entirely."}

Speak with him and he will tell you that his brigate had gone to pray at the shrine to &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; but have not returned. He mentions that the shrine has been overrun by Daedric witches. He will then ask you to look for his companions. \nFollow yout quest marker to a house. the door will be barricaded, and the person at the door will initially be hostile, but you can persuade her that you are not a witch's thrall and she will let you in. Once inside, speak with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Alhana\"&gt;Captain Alhana&lt;/a&gt;. She will mention that she does not know where the keepers of the shrine are, and will ask you to look for them. There are two main avenues she asks you to pursue: find the key to the locked dresser and talk to a non-hostile witch. \nThe witch in question, &lt;a href=\"Leifnar\"&gt;Leifnar&lt;/a&gt;, can be found on a cliff overlooking the lake. She will tell you that the witches are doing this because Kyne is doing nothing to stop the ongoing hostilities despite being the goddess of war, but she discloses no information on the keepers' whereabouts. \nThe key to the dresser can be found on one of the witches' thralls. Once you have opened the dresser, &lt;a href=\"Huvar%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Huvar's Journal&lt;/a&gt; will appear on top of it. The journal will mention that its owner came to pray, but that the keepers were acting strange and hostile, rather than acting kind like they normally do. \nThe final piece of information is found on the body of one of the witches. It is a book of hymns about Kyne. Once all pieces of information have been acquired, head back to Alhana and inform her of what you have found. She speculates that the witches have been controlling the keepers for some time, keeping them under their control by using their possessions. She then tells you to investigate the house where the head Keeper worked. \nYour target is a house on the other end of town. The door is locked, but there is a backpack next to the big tree in front of the house that will contain a scroll of finding. Use it and follow the light, and it will lead you to a loose window in the back of the house. You will find evidence here that a fight has taken place, but the most significant piece of evidence is &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Ormi%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Keeper Ormi's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, on the nightstand. It will reveal that Ormi herself has lost faith in Kyne after losing her children and now serves the Daedra.\nUpon reading the journal, Alhana will appear in the house, having climbed through the same window as you. Speak to her and tell her what you have discovered. This will complete the quest."}

Once informed of Claudie's spirit, Athel will refuse to abandon the property, insisting that the Vestige should go to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; to find a book about Spirit Summoning.\nOnce in the Mages Guild, ask &lt;a href=\"Eilina\"&gt;Eilina&lt;/a&gt; for the location of a spirit summoning book. She will direct the Vestige to the library upstairs. After finding the book, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reality%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;The Reality of Spirits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tsiniuc\"&gt;Tsiniuc&lt;/a&gt; will warn the Vestige of the dangers of spirit summoning. He will explain that he has heard that they have entered the ruins of Baelborne Tower, and offers advice given to him by his master. Tsiniuc will offer to help the Vestige in summoning the spirit so as not to undo the Baelborne curse, and will ask questions regarding the spirit. Answering the questions wrong will cause Tsiniuc to withdraw his offer. The correct answers in this order are: Claudie, A necklace, and either Revenge or Love.\nIf Tsiniuc retracts his offer, he will simply suggest that the Vestige should go to &lt;a href=\"Themond%20Mine\"&gt;Themond Mine&lt;/a&gt; behind the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Cathedral\"&gt;Daggerfall Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;. There, Claudie's items will need to be buried within the mine, which will be filled with &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rooks\"&gt;Red Rook Bandits&lt;/a&gt;. Once the items are buried, her spirit will appear.\nIf Tsiniuc's offer is accepted, he will tell the Vestige to go to the gravesite by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Cathedral\"&gt;Daggerfall Cathedral&lt;/a&gt;, and will take Claudie's items that were retrieved from the ruin and bury them in order to summon her spirit. Upon arrival, the Vestige will meet Claudie's spirit.\nClaudie's response will not differ regardless of whether or not Tsiniuc aided the Vestige. She will appear distressed, and will explain that, while she was alive in the tower, she also carried an unborn baby, and prayed for her child to be saved. Before dying, she had made a deal with a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, who had spared the child's life by letting them live in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. They then placed a curse on the waterfall in Baelborne Rock, located near the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lady Stone&lt;/a&gt;. She will beg the Vestige not to break the curse.\nAfterwards, the Vestige can choose to either break the curse or tell Athel to leave the ruins. Activating the Daedric Warding Stone at the bottom of the cursed waterfall will break the curse and trigger the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Tachnim\"&gt;Tachnim&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedra that Claudie had made a deal with. Tachnim will be hostile towards the Vestige, saying that Claudie's child serves the Daedra, and is upholding the bargain that was made. In order to break the curse, Tachnim will need to be killed.\nAfterwords, report back to Athel, who can be found in Baelborne Tower. He will tell the Vestige that a man had fallen through the tower from the sky, and that he is being nursed for his injuries. The Vestige can say that the man appears to be the person that they had met in Daggerfall, and that they must be Claudie's son, &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Themond\"&gt;Stefan Themond&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwords, Athel will reward the Vestige with the &lt;a href=\"Baelborne%20Signet\"&gt;Baelborne Signet&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; amount of .\nIf the Vestige chooses not to break the curse, they can return to Athel and tell him to leave. Doing so will cause him and his guards to turn hostile and attack. After his guards are defeated, Athel's body can be found at the bottom of a cliff, with Claudie's spirit and Tachnim overlooking from the top of it. She will say that the curse will remain, and that she had never asked what had happened to her child, but is comforted to know that Tachnim still honors the bargain. Afterwords, she will reward the Vestige with the Baelborne Signet and a leveled amount of ."}

Mighty warriors with potent powers, these Akaviri cut a swath through &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, defeating all opponents until they were met at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiilic&lt;/a&gt; army under the command of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;General Reman&lt;/a&gt;. After a brief battle, the Akaviri surrendered en masses to Reman, saying that in him, they had found what they had come to Tamriel to seek.\nWith the Akaviri added to his own army, Reman marched on, pacifying most of Tamriel, becoming Emperor, and founding the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The best and wisest of the Akaviri became the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, under the Emperor Reman's personal command.\nFor the next two centuries the Dragonguard protected the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, defending the Emperors with abilities said to have been learned from the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; themselves, which persisted in Akavir far longer than they did in Tamriel.\nBut when &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;2920&lt;/a&gt;, that was the end of the Reman Dynasty (as well as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;). Officially the Dragonguard was disbanded, some said in shame at having failed to protect the Emperor. However, when the Potentate assumed the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard was unofficially reactivated, more as an intelligence network than as an honor guard.\nOther former members of the Dragonguard followed different pursuits. Some joined their former centurion, &lt;a href=\"Dinieras-Ves\"&gt;Dinieras-Ves&lt;/a&gt;, when he founded the organization that would later come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Others became roving adventurers, selling their services as combat trainers or swords-for-hire.\nOne of these was a former Dragonguard whose name is now lost, and is known only to this chronicler as the Grandmaster. He too it upon himself to ensure that the martial and mystical arts of the old Akaviri would survive into the new and turbulent &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.

Talking to the spirit of Sir Edain, a former Knight of the Flame, will reveal how he ended up in the cave and he asks them to help in putting the spirits of The Three to rest as they threaten the land. He'll explain the procedure and encourage the Vestige to take his steel sword to aid in the quest to entrap the souls of The Three. Defeating the spirits will bind their souls to its steel.\nThe Three spirits are in three different places in the cave. After taking the former knight's sword they will find them further down and by activating the rocky tomb of each of the spirit's, they will appear to the Vestige. When all three are defeated and binded into the steelsword, they must proceed further down into the depth of the cave, to the big fissure.\nThe souls of The Three are seen in the large fissure, upon arrival. They are not very happy with the outcome but after throwing the sword into the fissure will make them disappear forever. When talking to Sir Edain afterwards, he has sensed a change a serenity is now flowing into his spirit. He is released from the plane he was in and before leaving, he sends the Vestige to the surface with his gratitude."}

Despite this, Fasendil feels Skyrim and its people are still a part of the Empire, and, as such, are entitled to the Legion's protection.\nEven though he is an Altmer, Fasendil has an outward disdain for the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. The origin of such stems from his station in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;'s city &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2042\"&gt;4E 42&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Green%20Fire\"&gt;Night of Green Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Thalmor Mages were sent there to capture Altmer dissidents who have escaped execution from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen he was on his way, a huge explosion of magicka erupted from the refugee sector of the city as the Thalmor Mages and the Altmer dissidents fought each other. When Fasendil arrived at the scene, the entire refugee sector had been destroyed as a result of the battle. \nAfter an unspecified amount of time after this incident, Fasendil was stationed in Skyrim by order of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; to keep an eye on the Thalmor.\nConversations.\nWhy did you join the Legion? \"My parents were traveling merchants eventually settling in Cyrodiil.

She was tasked with the recruitment of soldiers for the legion.\nBackground.\nThe parents of Legate Rikke were Legionnaires themselves, and Legate Rikke followed in their footsteps. She fought in many wars, including the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegate Rikke fought during the Great War, and was part of the Legions that reclaimed the capital. As she and Galmar were Nords from Skyrim, they presumably marched to Cyrodiil with the armies under the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded Nord Legions from Skyrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Skyrim Civil War, Legate Rikke served as the local recruiter of the Legion. People who wish to join the Legion usually go through a standard procedure, after which they have to take the Imperial Oath. Rikke states that the Stormcloaks are only weakening the Empire and keeping it from focusing on its true goal. When &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; got sent to Skyrim in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Legate Rikke gave advice to the General based on Nord tradition, which often led to discussions between the two. On the field, Legate Rikke gave orders to soldiers, anything from spreading misinformation to taking over forts, was directed by the Legate after discussing it with General Tullius.\nPost Civil-War.\nShould the Legion win the Civil War, Legate Rikke would be ordered by General Tullius to aid the new Jarls in learning how to govern, as the Legate is a native Nord who knows the Nordic culture better than the General does. Though Rikke says she is a soldier, and not a politician, she also says she is proud to play any role in rebuilding Skyrim."}

The Dragonborn can choose to exchange it for &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;, or one of the minor holds under Stormcloak control, though this leaves Rikke disappointed in the unfair trade if a minor hold is traded for The Reach.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;The Battle for Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;.\nRikke will be at the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Falkreath Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt; if &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; was given to the Stormcloaks during the meeting at High Hrothgar, requesting that the Dragonborn join the Legionnaires for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim it and the hold from Stormcloak control. Once that is done, Falkreath will be back under Imperial control, and &lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt; will be reinstated as Jarl in place of &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%20of%20Stuhn\"&gt;Dengeir&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;The Battle for Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf The Reach was given to the Stormcloaks during the meeting with &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, Rikke will be at the &lt;a href=\"Reach%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Reach Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt;, requesting the Dragonborn assault &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt; with her forces and place it back under Imperial control. Once the Stormcloak garrison is eliminated, The Reach will once again be in Imperial hands, with &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt; reinstated as Jarl. This removes the Stormcloak sympathizer &lt;a href=\"Thongvor%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thongvor Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Bloods\"&gt;Silver-Blood Family&lt;/a&gt; from the position, thus denying the Stormcloaks control of &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; within.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Fort%20Snowhawk\"&gt;The Battle for Fort Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Hjaalmarch was given to Ulfric during the negotiations at High Hrothgar, Rikke will be at the &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Hjaalmarch Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt;, asking the Dragonborn to assist with taking the hold back from the Stormcloaks by attacking the garrison at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Snowhawk\"&gt;Fort Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;. Once the fort is cleared of Stormcloak rebels, Hjaalmarch will return to Imperial control and &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20Ravencrone\"&gt;Idgrod Ravencrone&lt;/a&gt; will be restored to her position as Jarl.\nCivil War.\nImperials.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Imperial Legion, Rikke acts as their commanding officer in the field, and assigns the Dragonborn to recapture several of the major &lt;a href=\"holds\"&gt;holds&lt;/a&gt;. She, along with General Tullius, is present at the Imperial attack on &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and assists the Dragonborn in the final battle with Ulfric Stormcloak and Galmar Stone-Fist. She also attends the meeting at &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; when a truce becomes necessary so that the Dragonborn can capture &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt; and then deal with Alduin once and for all.\nStormcloaks.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the Stormcloaks, Rikke is killed while defending Tullius during the Civil War in their final stand in Castle Dour in Solitude. Later, she can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, where she laments that the Legion wished to protect Skyrim, but only succeeded in killing men and women from both sides who are now being devoured by Alduin. She also laments that this has made her unable to find the way to &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Shor's Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Her coffin can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; Catacombs, along with General Tullius'."}

Alongside his brother, &lt;a href=\"General%20Balreth\"&gt;General Balreth&lt;/a&gt;, Sadal suffered numerous defeats at the hands of the Nedic invaders and proved incapable of halting their advance by conventional means. In an act of desperation, the brothers lured the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s into a climactic battle amidst the ruins of a Daedric &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife%20%28Online%2C%20Location%29\"&gt;temple complex&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Zabamat\"&gt;central Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. While their soldiers defended the ruins against the Nedes, Sadal and Balreth sacrificed themselves in an arcane ritual that transformed them into the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Brothers of Strife&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a pair of powerful, flaming &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bone colossuses&lt;/a&gt;. These twin harbingers of destruction decimated both the Chimer and Nedic armies, laying waste to the surrounding area until mages from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; managed to confine them atop the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany centuries after their deaths, Sadal and Balreth were revered by the Chimer and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; as great military leaders. The brothers were immortalized with a &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife%20%28Online%2C%20Location%29\"&gt;pair of enormous stone statues&lt;/a&gt; that were erected at the site of their sacrifice. However, others viewed their actions in a harsher light, judging their participation in the ritual that created the Brothers of Strife as both dangerous and arrogant. In the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Vunal\"&gt;member&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; summoned Sadal from the afterlife in order to discover more information about the chain of events that resulted in the creation of the Brothers of Strife.\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nAlthough very little information exists regarding their childhood, Sadal and his brother &lt;a href=\"General%20Balreth\"&gt;Balreth&lt;/a&gt; were likely born to &lt;a href=\"Chimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; parents in either the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; or early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0During this time period, the fledgling Chimer kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; controlled large swathes of territory in the region later known as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, including parts of &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Most of this territory, however, remained vulnerable to attack by hostile neighbors. The most powerful of these neighbors were the agnostic and technologically advanced &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city-states, which regularly clashed with the Chimer over territory and religion. Other nearby enemies included the various &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; tribes of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014more commonly referred to as Orcs\u2014that migrated to northeastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to these more organized threats, the Chimer were also forced to contend with the aggressive fauna native to the region.\nBorn into this hostile environment, Sadal spent the majority of his life fighting against the enemies of the Chimer. His exploits against the Dwemer and the wild beasts of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; earned Sadal a reputation as one of the greatest Chimer military leaders in the First Era\u2014a distinction shared with his brother, General Balreth. As a result, Sadal progressed through the ranks of the Chimer military, eventually achieving the rank of legate. Despite these accolades, however, Sadal would ultimately prove ill-equipped in the face of a new threat looming on the horizon.\nIn the early First Era, a precursor race of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; suddenly invaded the Chimer kingdom of Resdayn. Elvish accounts depict these ancient ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; as savage barbarians that pillaged and burned throughout Stonefalls, massacring any &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; they encountered. These same accounts claim the Chimer initially hoped to resolve the conflict diplomatically, only to watch as their attempts were violently rebuffed by the Nedes.\nRegardless of the truthfulness of these claims, the Chimer eventually sought to expel the Nedic invaders from their territory. In order to accomplish this objective, the kingdom of Resdayn called upon its greatest generals\u2014Sadal and Balreth\u2014to command the Chimer armies. The brothers subsequently launched an offensive aiming to drive the Nedes from the Ashlands; however, their advance proved untenable and their armies were forced into defensive positions for the remainder of the conflict. Over the next several years, the Nedes gradually pushed the brothers and their forces deeper into the interior of Stonefalls. This incremental retreat stripped many Chimer villages of their defenses, forcing Sadal and Balreth to sacrifice large numbers of their warriors in an effort to acquire enough time to evacuate civilians stranded in the path of the Nedic invasion.\nAlthough they prevented their forces from suffering complete annihilation by retreating, the situation confronting the brothers and their armies grew grimmer with each passing year. The Nedes proved difficult to defeat by conventional means, reducing the Chimer to mere spectators as their isolated cities came under siege and their sources of food burned to the ground. Furthermore, a Nedic offensive in northern Stonefalls effectively severed the brothers from their connection to the Inner Sea, and thus, from any support arriving from Vvardenfell. In short, the Nedes now controlled the vast majority of Stonefalls and appeared on the brink of a decisive victory over the Chimer.\nDeath and transformation.\nWith their armies reduced to a small force of battle-hardened veterans, their supplies severely diminished, and their ability to stage further retreats denied by the Nedes, Sadal and Balreth found themselves surrounded in the mountainous and lava-covered region of Stonefalls known as &lt;a href=\"Zabamat\"&gt;Zabamat&lt;/a&gt;. From this foreboding landscape, permanently enveloped within a cloud of ash, a ray of hope suddenly emerged after a group of sorcerers under the brothers' command devised a desperate strategy they believed capable of winning the war for the Chimer. Facing the imminent destruction of their people, Sadal and Balreth agreed to this strategy despite the sorcerers' lack of clarity regarding its outcome. The brothers subsequently positioned their remaining forces among the ruins of a Daedric &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife\"&gt;temple complex&lt;/a&gt; located within a canyon and sitting atop a waterfall. These ruins served as a major source of Daedric energy, which the Chimer sorcerers required to power the arcane ritual at the center of their strategy to defeat the Nedes\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Calling\"&gt;Ritual of Calling&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, the brothers lured a Nedic army under the command of &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Ornskar\"&gt;Warchief Ornskar&lt;/a&gt; into a climactic battle within the ruins, setting into motion the series of events that ultimately determined the outcome of the &lt;a href=\"Nede-Chimer%20War\"&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt;. While Sadal and Balreth underwent preparations for the ritual at the central altar, their remaining soldiers engaged the Nedes with two separate objectives in mind. The bulk of the Chimer forces entered into a defensive posture along the river in front of the ruins, hoping to withstand the Nedic assault in a desperate ploy for time. This phase of the battle rapidly turned into a bloodbath as the Nedes overwhelmed and slaughtered the Chimer.\nIn the middle of the battle, however, the brothers also dispatched a champion to complete the second objective: assisting the sorcerers &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Nilae\"&gt;Nilae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Turoni\"&gt;Turoni&lt;/a&gt; in acquiring the two ingredients required to complete the ritual. The first of these\u2014Nedic blood\u2014the champion attained by killing Warchief Ornskar and several of her soldiers, carving out their hearts and bringing them to the central altar. In order to acquire the second ingredient, Chimer acolytes summoned a pair of powerful &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;flame atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, one containing an essence of fire and the other containing an essence of wrath, at altars on the outskirts of the ruins. The champion subsequently defeated both of the atronachs, collecting their essences and delivering them to the sorcerers.\nWith all of the ingredients acquired and the Nedes slowly advancing towards their position, the champion conferred with Sadal and Balreth in order to ensure their continued desire to participate in the ritual. After the brothers affirmed their dedication to the cause, Nilae and Turoni initiated the Ritual of Calling by ordering the champion to pray at the central altar. Invoking the name of &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the legendary prophet whose revelations from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; resulted in the Chimer exodus from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the Chimer, the sorcerers sacrificed the brothers in order to save their people from annihilation at the hands of the Nedes. The ritual resulted in the deaths of both Sadal and Balreth, transforming them into a pair of powerful and flaming &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bone colossuses&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Brothers of Strife&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost mortem.\nIn the aftermath of the arcane ritual performed within the ruins, the now-deceased legate appeared in the form of a bone colossus known as &lt;a href=\"Sadal\"&gt;Sadal&lt;/a&gt;, a towering amalgam of bones and flame welded together by Daedric energy. As the Brothers of Strife, Sadal and its brother\u2014the bone colossus referred to as &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;Balreth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014devastated the region of Stonefalls. The Brothers inaugurated their reign of terror by fulfilling the purpose envisioned for them by the Chimer, destroying the Nedic armies assaulting the ruins. Their incredible power, however, ultimately proved uncontrollable and the Brothers soon betrayed their former masters. Those Chimer that managed to survive the initial Nedic onslaught found themselves under attack once again\u2014this time by an enemy of their own creation.\nConsidered one of the greatest Chimer sorcerers of the First Era, &lt;a href=\"Mavos%20Siloreth\"&gt;Mavos Siloreth&lt;/a&gt; commanded an expedition of Chimer mages from Vvardenfell in a desperate attempt to end the devastation wrought by the Brothers of Strife. At great cost of life, these mages successfully imprisoned Balreth within the caldera of &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, one of two massive volcanoes that dominated the Stonefalls landscape. Sadal, however, proved more powerful, and thus, more difficult to imprison that its sibling. Eventually, Mavos Siloreth\u2014alongside &lt;a href=\"Genvis%20Faledran\"&gt;Genvis Faledran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Levisii%20Gilvayn\"&gt;Levisii Gilvayn&lt;/a&gt;, and dozens of other mages\u2014cornered Sadal at the peak of the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt;. With the assistance of three &lt;a href=\"focus%20stones\"&gt;focus stones&lt;/a&gt; imbued with Daedric energy, the Chimer mages opened a portal and banished Sadal to a pocket realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. This prison, eventually overseen by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, successfully contained Sadal for nearly a millennia.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the events of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; released the Brothers of Strife from their centuries long imprisonment. After the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; employed Balreth as a weapon of mass destruction during the defense of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Vunal\"&gt;Sorcerer Vunal&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt; sought to discover more information regarding the creation of the Brothers of Strife. Within the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife%20%28Online%2C%20Location%29\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; that first spawned the Brothers of Strife, the researchers summoned Legate Sadal from the afterlife and questioned him about the battle that ultimately claimed his life. Sorcerer Vunal subsequently conducted a ritual that enabled his assistant to travel through time, allowing the assistant to directly witness the creation of the Brothers of Strife.\nLater that year, the Ebonheart Pact attempted to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the death of &lt;a href=\"Garyn%20Indoril\"&gt;Garyn Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged by the death of his son, &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt;\u2014general of the Ebonheart Pact and grandmaster of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;\u2014viewed the bone colossus Sadal as a means of acquiring revenge against the Covenant. Tanval utilized the power of the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Heart\"&gt;Coral Heart&lt;/a&gt; to release Sadal from its arcane prison, and much like his Chimer predecessors, proved unable to control the powerful bone colossus. Regretting his decision, Tanval\u2014 alongside &lt;a href=\"Holgunn%20One-Eye\"&gt;Holgunn One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walks-in-Ash\"&gt;Walks-in-Ash&lt;/a&gt;, and an unnamed &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;hero of the Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;\u2014confronted Sadal atop the Tormented Spire. Ultimately, Tanval Indoril sacrificed himself in order to weaken Sadal during the final battle, allowing his companions to once again banish Sadal to a pocket realm of Oblivion."}

Of all Dorell's many sons and daughters, none shines as brightly as Dame &lt;a href=\"Marcelle%20Stenric\"&gt;Marcelle Stenric&lt;/a&gt;, the Knight of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nDame Marcelle was a mighty warrior, brave and pure. She was a model of knightly perfection, a niece and loyal supporter of Lord Aaric Dorell. Her exploits were legendary, even in her own day, as she defended Dorell holdings, battled brigands and monsters, and even negotiated treaties with neighboring domains.\nWhen a terrible &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; shambled out of the hills to threaten Shornhelm, Marcelle was there to challenge the foul creature. For a day and an hour, the two engaged in a violent dance that knocked down trees and leveled farm houses. As the battle wore on, both combatants were bloody and weary. It seemed like the fight would end when one of them fell over from sheer exhaustion. But then Marcelle called on an inner reserve. She severed the troll's head with one powerful swing of her sword, Dauntless. And all of Shornhelm cheered.\nAnother tale tells of the time of the Great Feud, when Berenda of &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; and Ailex of Dorell (who was Lord Aaric's younger brother) engaged in an exchange of insults, each more terrible than the last. Insults turned to violence, and the two houses came close to the brink of war. At the height of the feud, Lord Aaric's son Lanciot was taken captive by brigands loyal to House Tamrith. These brigands were members of the mighty Hammers of Umbrage, notorious for terrorizing travelers on the roads of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; until they were given letters of reprisal for pledging loyalty to the Tamrith lords.\nDame Marcelle, when she heard the fate that had befallen young Lanciot, never hesitated. She tracked the brigands to an isolated tower in the wilderness outside &lt;a href=\"Crestshade\"&gt;Crestshade&lt;/a&gt; and quickly took stock of the situation. A dozen brigands guarded young Lanciot, who was imprisoned at the top of the tower. Confident that the Dorell scion was safe and out of harm's way, Marcelle boldly strode into the brigands' camp and announced her presence. Just hearing her name was enough to rattle many of the brigands. Five of them dropped their weapons and fled as soon as they realized who she was. But that still left seven of the Hammers to deal with, including their leader, Rhyne Succoth.\nBrave Marcelle carried Dauntless with her, and she was confident &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; were behind her. Brigands fell with every swing of her mighty sword, until only she and Rhyne remained standing. Seeking a way to get the upper hand, the brigand leader grabbed young Lanciot and held him between his own body and Marcelle's sword. Dorell's most shiny knight smiled. It was hard, humorless. \"Release the boy and you get to live,\" Marcelle said coldly. \"Otherwise, you die on the count of three.\"\n\"Save your threat\u2014\" Rhyne began. But his words were cut as short as his life.\n\"Three,\" Marcelle called out. Dauntless flashed. Rhyne's eyes went wide. The brigand leader was dead before his body hit the ground.\n\"Next time you feel the need to travel, young Lanciot,\" Dame Marcelle said, a measure of warmth returning to her smile, \"please let me know and I shall gladly accompany you.\"\nAnd these were only two of the tales that helped create the legend of Dame Marcelle."}

Crafter to kings, manipulator of metals, Forgefire was known as the greatest blacksmith in all the land. &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;thanes&lt;/a&gt;, and anyone who could afford the exorbitant prices he commanded sought out Forgefire to create a precious dagger, a sturdy shield, a mighty warhammer, or a suit of finely wrought armor. After a time, Forgefire had to limit the number of commissions he accepted for any given period, as he refused to take on so much that the work would suffer.\nOther blacksmiths claimed that Forgefire could speak to the ore and charm the impurities away with a wink and a whisper. Most revered the man and were in awe of his skills. A few, however, were jealous of Forgefire's accomplishments. They tried to poison opinions against him, claiming that his methods involved nothing short of magic, and foul magic at that\u2014&lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; magic. Chief among the outspoken smiths was the armorer, &lt;a href=\"Gerhild%20Coldheart\"&gt;Gerhild Coldheart&lt;/a&gt;.\nColdheart was loud and vocal of her distrust of Forgefire and his methods. She wondered aloud, in whatever crowded and boisterous tavern she happened to be drinking in, what vile &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; the proud and boastful Haman Forgefire had pledged himself to in order to accomplish his miracles with metal. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Forgefire was simply brilliant. But that didn't stop Coldheart from spreading her rumors at each and every opportunity. Soon, her hatred of Forgefire was almost all-consuming and it began to affect her work, which had been impressive in its own right until it began to suffer as her jealousy grew.\nForgefire did his best to ignore the increasingly wilder tales, but commissions were becoming harder and harder to come by as Coldheart's rumors circulated. Haman couldn't understand why she insisted on saying such false and terrible things. He soldiered on as best he could, however, taking what work still came his way and praying that something would happen to reverse the downward spiral his fortunes seemed to be caught in. That's when the greatest commission of Haman's career appeared on his doorstep.\nThe mighty hero, &lt;a href=\"Kvenel%20the%20Tongue\"&gt;Kvenel the Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, was in the market for a new weapon. And not just any weapon. It had to be a weapon of excellent quality, something to match his beloved sword, &lt;a href=\"Eduj\"&gt;Eduj&lt;/a&gt;. For his next adventure, Kvenel wanted a hand axe. And he wanted it crafted by the legendary blacksmith, Haman Forgefire. Delighted at this opportunity and excited by the challenge, Haman began to work on his most spectacular piece ever\u2014the hand axe &lt;a href=\"Okin\"&gt;Okin&lt;/a&gt;.\nGerhild Coldheart, meanwhile, was furious. She had petitioned for the commission to craft Kvenel the Tongue's new weapon. And again, despite her best efforts, Haman was chosen instead of her. Enraged, she did the only thing she could think of. Coldheart embraced the very stories she had been telling about Forgefire and prayed to a Daedric Prince for aid and assistance. She prayed to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor five days and five nights, Coldheart remained at her own forge, begging Molag Bal to answer her prayers. On the morning of the sixth day, the Lord of Brutality answered her call. But it was never a simple matter to ask a Daedric Prince for a favor. Molag Bal, especially, requires that a cost must always be paid. For Gerhild Coldheart, that cost had to be paid in blood. \"Kill the smith with a blade crafted by your own hand,\" Molag Bal promised, \"and I shall make you more famous than Forgefire could ever hope to be.\"\nHaman Forgefire completed Okin, and it was spectacular. He delivered it to Kvenel just in time for his next journey. When Haman returned to his smithy, he saw Coldheart standing before his furnace, silhouetted in the glow of the fire. \"Did you enjoy the adoration of the great Nord hero, Haman?\" Coldheart asked. \"I do hope so. For it is the last honor you will receive in this life.\"\nColdheart spun and plunged her sword into Forgefire's heart. The master smith stumbled, falling into the intense fire burning in his own furnace. His body, engulfed in flames, burned for three days and was not consumed. During that time, Coldheart screamed that she could hear Forgefire's cries of pain no matter how far she ran. Kvenel proclaimed that Gerhild Coldheart was the worst villain of the age and brought her before the Thane of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to be executed for her crime. For that one moment, she had indeed become more famous than Haman Forgefire.\nWhen Coldheart's head was separated from her body, Forgefire\u2014smithy and all\u2014disappeared from Tamriel. To this very day, it is said that Haman Forgefire stalks the shadows of Coldharbour, seeking to finally get revenge against the jealous and traitorous Gerhild Coldheart. And anyone else who happens to get in his way."}

Shalug the Shark, that's who! In her own words, she leads the largest and strongest band of cutthroats in the city, and she isn't shy about tooting her own horn. But who is &lt;a href=\"Shalug%20the%20Shark\"&gt;Shalug&lt;/a&gt;? And who are the Shark's Teeth? Let me recount the legend of the Shark for all the world to marvel at.\nShalug is a humble &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; from humble beginnings. She fled the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; at the first opportunity, working her way south aboard whatever ship she could find passage on. Soon, Shalug earned the name, \"the Shark,\" as she jumped from one pirate crew to the next in order to find her fame and fortune. But despite her successes and her growing infamy, Shalug decided that a life on the sea wasn't in her best interests. \"Too many waves,\" Shalug told me. \"And too many captains.\"\nLooking to become her own boss, Shalug eventually found herself in Abah's Landing. Always the toughest one around, she soon attracted a growing number of followers to her side. In time, her little gang became a small army, and the Shark's Teeth was born. With a thriving business in protection and stolen goods, Shalug and her gang took control of an out-of-the-way grotto that had long ago been abandoned by the colonists who tried to make a home of the place. It wasn't long before the place became known as Shark's Teeth Grotto, a place feared by pirates and guards alike due to the power of Shalug's gang.\nWriter's Note: Shalug, while everything you've told me has a modicum of truth to it, I can't help but believe that you've exaggerated certain details to make yourself sound more prominent than you really are. The journalist in me cannot, in good conscience, continue to take your gold or put these fabrications to paper. I'm leaving you with what I've done so far. I'm certain you'll be able to find someone with fewer scruples who would be happy to complete it for you."}

He was a jovial and boisterous Nord, loved by the people and trusted for his wisdom and good cheer. As with most legends that start like this, the good times didn't last.\nFor Thane Icehammer, the change began when he returned from an extended hunting trip to th\n\"What has caused such change in my husband?\" Matron Icehammer demanded, and she turned to the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt; for advice and assistance.\nThe Keepers sent a young acolyte to investigate the situation.

She ripped away his shirt. A festering wound that would not heal was carved into his side, the glowing tip of a spear jutting from it. \"He said his name was &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Thane wailed. \"He said I should never have hunted the were-creatures, but how was I supposed to know what they were?\"\nThen, his anger overcoming him, Thane Icehammer struck out and killed &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;'s acolyte.

They call themselves Mabrigash. Unlike their &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; brethren, this tribe is not nomadic and appears to have settled in an isolated region of Deshaan, a location they call the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Ghost%20Snake\"&gt;Vale of the Ghost Snake&lt;/a&gt;. I believe they have concocted the story of the perilous Ghost Snake to discourage outsiders from lingering too long in their village. Although, frankly, their rudeness, which rivals that of any of the more civilized Dark Elves I have ever met, is more than enough to drive outsiders away. However, my curiosity about this isolated tribe steeled me against their attitude. I remained nearby for a time, watching them and recording my observations. Forthwith, here are my findings on the Mabrigash:\nThe Mabrigash do not welcome visitors.\nThe Mabrigash appears to be a matriarchal society, and their females are definitely more dominant than males. They also seem to outnumber the males by a factor of three or four to one. I wouldn't say this society hates males, but they certainly don't trust them or like them very much. At least as far as I can tell.\nThey claim a Ghost Snake gives them advice and watches over the Vale. I believe they use this so-called \"Ghost Snake\" to scare visitors away and to keep the village population in line.\nIt appears they sacrifice their own tribe members to this mythical deity. The tribal elders encourage trials to honor this \"Ghost Snake,\" and many of these end in the death of the participants.\nHere is the legend of the Ghost Snake, as it was told to me by a charming little lady of some six or seven years of age. She approached me with absolutely no fear or hesitation. She asked me why I was being so creepy and watching them all the time. At least, that was the gist of it. My understanding of the Mabrigash dialect is rudimentary, at best. I deflected her question with one of my own. \"What is this Ghost Snake I keep hearing about?\" I asked her.\n\"Follow the Coiled Path and you'll find out,\" she replied with a bat of her cute little eyelashes. \"The Ghost Snake offers advice and protection, as long as we care for the Vale,\" she continued. \"Everybody knows that.\" She went on to tell me that the Ghost Snake was the combined spiritual essence of the tribe's female ancestors, given spectral form by the belief and respect of the living tribe members. Or that it was a creepy dead snake that liked to haunt the Vale and eat innocent Mabrigash children. She spoke very fast, and as I've said before, my mastery of the dialect was far from perfect.\nFrom an economic perspective, the tribe crafts unique snakeskin leather. They use this leather for everything, from clothing to packs to a simple armor. They are, however, unwilling to sell or trade this wonderful material to outsiders\u2014or even to the men of their own tribe. Everyone involved could make a fortune if the Mabrigash could be convinced to open trade with the outside world.\nI met a Mabrigash scout on patrol. She threatened to \"toss me to the ghosts and serpents on the Coiled Path.\" Fortunately, my speed and tree-climbing skills far exceeded hers, so I was able to avoid this ceremonial rite. Additional observation leads me to the conclusion that the tribe subsists on a diet primarily consisting of snake meat. This may contribute to their uncontrollably hostile demeanor.\nAfter several days camping nearby and continuing my observations, a rather fearsome Mabrigash warrior visited me. He said he was the &lt;a href=\"Gulakhan\"&gt;Gulakhan&lt;/a&gt;. He said the only reason they had not simply tossed me to the serpents within the Vale was that the Farseer labeled me a hapless idiot. I am sure I missed something in the translation of the message. When I asked to meet with the Farseer, this Gulakhan's hand seemed to tighten on the hilt of the rather nasty-looking sword that hung at his side. It was then I decided that my time among the Mabrigash Tribe had come to an end.\nAnnotation from Nuros Raloro, &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; Scholar Priest, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;\nThis utterly ludicrous \"observation\" was found abandoned near the border to &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; some years ago. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; chronicler Bonorion does not appear to have the wit of a five-year-old child when it comes to accurately recording unusual events or peoples. He resorts to making things up or taking wild leaps of illogic to come to his so-called \"conclusions.\" This document has been preserved within the Tribunal library and copies have been distributed, as he did at least conduct some conversations with the Mabrigash, and information on this tribe remains scarce."}

We've collected these stories into this volume, writing down what was previously passed on by word of mouth and around Nord campfires in the dead of night.\nThe Voices in the Woods\n&lt;a href=\"Broggo%20the%20Small\"&gt;Broggo the Small&lt;/a&gt; wasn't a large &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;. He wasn't a fast Nord. He wasn't even a strong Nord. But Broggo made up for his shortcomings by being something that many Nords aren't. Broggo was smart. He took the time to consider everything he ever did, refusing to give in to the passions that drive most others of his kin. And that eventually saved his life.\nOne day, Broggo the Small happened to get seperated from his companions. He found himself and alone in the Haunted Wood. As he wandered along, becoming increasingly scared and hungry, Broggo stumbled into a clearing among the trees. He decided to rest for a bit, stretching out upon a relatively flat, smooth stone bathed in the afternoon sun. It didn't take long for Broggo to fall fast asleep.\nHe awoke later, opening his eyes to find that night had fallen across the forest. Something had pulled him from sleep: a sound. It was like the whispering of young women. And giggling. He was certain that someone or something had giggled, but he seemed to be alone in the clearing, illuminated by the pale glow of the quarter moon above. Broggo was straining to see into the darkness beyond the clearing when the whispers returned.\n\"Oh, look at his adorable roots!\" said a voice in the woods.\n\"And his golden leaves!\" said another.\n\"He's mine, sister. I saw him first.\"\n\"You got the last one! This one is for me!\"\nBroggo nearly fainted when the two ghostly forms materialized at the edge of the clearing near the large gorapple tree. A pair of forest spirits were arguing over him. He didn't know whether to be frightened or flattered, although he did know that mortals and spirits shouldn't mix. He didn't think he could get very far by running through the forest in the dark. He was certain he couldn't fight the spirits so Broggo had only one option.\n\"Hello,\" Broggo called to the spirits. \"Would you like to play a game?\"\nAt first, the spirits appeared shy and even a little frightened of Broggo. They weren't used to mortals talking to them directly, but they slowly began to engage with the Nord, sometimes while visibile and sometimes as disembodied voices in the darkness, Broggo described a wondrous game that used cards and dice and clay chips. It was like no game that either the spirits had ever heard of, or any Nord, for that matter. Broggo was making things up as he spoke.\nSoon, the forest spirits were huddled close to Broggo, listening intently to every word the small Nord said. Finally, they shouted in unison, \"We want to play!\"\n\"Alas,\" Broggo said with great disappointment, \"I don't have any cards or dice or clay chips. I left them in my wagon back with my traveling companions. And I don't know where the wagon is.\"\n\"No problem!\" said the first spirit.\n\"We can show you where the wagon has gone!\"\nAnd that's just what the spirits did. Of course, they weren't happy when Broggo, reunited with his companions, drove off the spirits. As the wagon rolled out of the Haunted Wood, Broggo pulled out a journal and started writing.\n\"What are you doing?\" asked one of his traveling companions.\n\"I had the best idea for a game this evening. I want to write it down while the memory is fresh.\""}

Spirit revenants like the &lt;a href=\"ancestor%20ghost\"&gt;ancestor ghost&lt;/a&gt;, wraith, and dwarven ghost, can only be harmed by weapons that are enchanted or made of refined substances such as silver. Ancestor ghosts, the most common spirit revenant, are harmless, apart from the minor curses they lay upon their victims. Wraiths are similar to ghosts, but they are capable of inflicting wounds to the careless explorer. &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spectre\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; are more dangerous still, but they generally appear only in &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20ruins\"&gt;Dwarven ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlesh revenants, or '&lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s' as they are often called in the West, are known as '&lt;a href=\"Bonewalker%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bonewalkers&lt;/a&gt;' in Morrowind. Magic preserves the bonewalker's fleshy remains along with the bones and spirit. Bonewalkers are readily identified by the sharp protuberances of bone and metal employed in the rituals that bind them to this plane. All bonewalkers are malevolent and dangerous, but the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bonewalker\"&gt;greater bonewalkers&lt;/a&gt; are far worse than the more common 'lesser' bonewalkers. Thankfully, normal weapons harm bonewalkers.\nIt is difficult to generalize about fleshless revenants, or &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. The agility and fighting ability of the animated remains may depend on the abilities of the revenant's former life, and may therefore be weak or strong, or more or less capable with weapons and shields. Fortunately, enchanted weapons are not needed to destroy skeletons. An exception is the &lt;a href=\"Bonelord%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bonelord&lt;/a&gt;, a peculiar form of revenant that seems to derive its powers more from its spirit energies than from the substance of its skeletal remains. Bonelords are very powerful, and very dangerous. &lt;a href=\"Immune%20to%20Normal%20Weapons\"&gt;Normal weapons do not affect&lt;/a&gt; them.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; were believed to be extinct in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; for centuries. &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; culture has a special hatred for vampires, and in earlier times the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; hunted them to extinction. In recent years, however, vampires have either begun to sneak into Morrowind, or long-dormant ones have been awakened. Vampires vary in their substance and power according to their age and accumulated lore, but even the weakest vampire is immeasurably stronger than most other undead. Note: &lt;a href=\"Ash%20vampire\"&gt;Ash vampire&lt;/a&gt;s are not vampires, and are not undead. Ash vampires are extremely dangerous. While their spirit and substance may indeed be preserved by some magical process, the holy warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; report that spell effects known to affect the undead have no effect on ash vampires."}

She is the head of the F'aashe clan.\nDescription.\nLesspa is described as a beautiful and exotic Khajiit. She had her face tattooed to the Khajiit style. From a distance she could be confused with merish-looking woman.\nF'aashe clan.\nLesspa had a sister called M'kai, a brother named Sha'jal and a maternal cousin named Taaj. S'enjara, Ahapa, J'lasha and M'qar were some of the Khajiit that were also part of the clan.\nBackground.\nDuring their journey to &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; came across a Khajiit caravan. Lesspa and other Khajiit approached the two wayfarers, and she offered them to scort them to &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. Sul and Attrebus were forced to accept their protection in exchange of buying &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt; in Rimmen for them. Once they made a deal, Lesspa offered both travelers some Khajiit cakes. Sul warned Attrebus to eat the cakes, since they could be dangerous for them. During their journey to Rimmen, Lesspa explained to Sul how Khajiit were not allowed to buy moon sugar in Rimmen. In fact, the Khajiit clans were forbidden to enter the city walls.\nOnce the caravan arrived at Rimmen, Lesspa provided Sul a plain leather bag with the gold to buy the moon sugar. They came back to the camp by sundown. When they approached Lesspa, they noticed something was wrong. The regulators of the Kingdom of Rimmen had followed them to the camp, and they had proof of illegally selling moon sugar to the Khajiit. In a desperate attempt to escape, Attrebus realised the regulators had served his father's army, so he revealed his identity to them. Attrebus convinced the guards to let them go away, even the Khajiit. Lesspa showed her gratitude to the prince, and she offered to further scort their saviour into the east.\nSul decided to stop at &lt;a href=\"Water%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Water's Edge&lt;/a&gt; in order to buy some materials to carry out a ritual and travel into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Attrebus visited his old friend &lt;a href=\"Florius%20Larsus\"&gt;Florius Larsus&lt;/a&gt; who was the captain of the garrison in Water's Edge. They agreed to meet at the The Gaping Frog inn. While Attrebus waited for Florius, some masked men attacked the prince. Lesspa and her cousins joined the battle, and they managed to defeat the attackers. Attrebus recognized &lt;a href=\"Riente\"&gt;Riente&lt;/a&gt; among the dead, and he suspected of Florious. Yet, when he arrived at his office he found Florius beheaded.\nOnce Sul came back, they headed into an Oblivion gate. Attrebus asked Lesspa if they really wanted to go to Oblivion with them, and she answered that their lances were with him. They ended up in the &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Hircine and his servants hunted them in a long chase. Lesspa wielded a lance in her left hand, and she gave orders to the other Khajiit. They managed to escape until they were fifty yards away from a new portal. However, it was too far to escape from their persecutors. Lesspa and the surviving Khajiit decided to sacrifice so that Sul and Attrebus could escape."}

By law, the only person who can arrest a captain is a captain, and even then nobody is willing to come forward to press charges.\nWalkthrough.\nStarting the quest.\nWhile exploring the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruslan\"&gt;Ruslan&lt;/a&gt; or his friend &lt;a href=\"Luronk%20gro-Glurzog\"&gt;Luronk gro-Glurzog&lt;/a&gt; may ask for a few &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; to hold them off until payday. Whether or not money is given to them, they will explain that while at &lt;a href=\"Jensine%27s%20%22Good%20As%20New%22%20Merchandise\"&gt;Jensine's \"Good As New\" Merchandise&lt;/a&gt; a captain of the city guard came in and accused them of theft. Despite their innocence and &lt;a href=\"Jensine\"&gt;Jensine&lt;/a&gt;'s defense of them, the guard told them to hand over their money or face time in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause they do not know what the captain's name is, they are unable to identify him. The only person who would know his identity would be &lt;a href=\"Jensine\"&gt;Jensine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must stop by her shop in the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; and talk to her. If her &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; is above 70, she will reveal that not only was it &lt;a href=\"Audens%20Avidius\"&gt;Audens Avidius&lt;/a&gt; that robbed Ruslan and Luronk, but that Audens has been shaking down the city's shop owners at least once a month each.\nFinding a captain to help.\nAfter giving up the name of the corrupt guard, she will add that she can't do anything because of his rank. She will state the only one who can arrest a captain is another captain, and they will not risk their jobs, much less lives, over this. She does give a suggestion that if any captain would be crazy enough to do it, it would probably be &lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Lex\"&gt;Hieronymus Lex&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Waterfront%20District\"&gt;Waterfront District&lt;/a&gt;.\nLex refuses to help saying he is too busy with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;, but believes &lt;a href=\"Servatius%20Quintilius\"&gt;Servatius Quintilius&lt;/a&gt; can help the Hero. He believes Servatius is new and brash enough to do something about it.\nIf one did the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;thieves guild&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Taking%20Care%20of%20Lex\"&gt;Taking Care of Lex&lt;/a&gt;\" the Hero will be directed to &lt;a href=\"Servatius%20Quintilius\"&gt;Servatius Quintilius&lt;/a&gt; by Jensine instead.\nServatius will also refuse to help, he was only recently promoted and doesn't want to risk getting in trouble with the other captains so soon. He believes the &lt;a href=\"Itius%20Hayn\"&gt;Itius Hayn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Gardens%20District%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elven Gardens District&lt;/a&gt; may be willing to help.\nBringing Audens Avidius to justice.\nGo and find Itius, during the day he is patrolling the streets. In the evening he can be found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Foaming%20Flask\"&gt;The Foaming Flask&lt;/a&gt; and later in his chambers in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Watch%20Tower\"&gt;Northwest Watch Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nItius Hayn will only listen to the crime if his disposition is at least 70. He will say that in order to arrest Audens, at least two eyewitnesses must agree to testify. Jensine will refuse to help out, stating that she would rather swim with &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; than risk angering Audens. Luronk gro-Glurzog and Ruslan will need convincing but will soon agree to testify if it means Audens goes to jail.\nConclusion.\nAudens: \"I'm surprised Itius. I didn't think even you would stoop to arresting a fellow Captain.\"Itius: \"Only those who break the law.\"\nThe next day, Ruslan and Luronk will go to Itius and press charges. Itius, now having everything he needs, will hunt down and confront Audens. When he finds him, he will arrest him for extortion and petty theft. Audens will surrender and allow himself to be taken to prison. At this stage there is no mapmarker so if one wants to see when he gets arrested, wait for Itius and follow him to see him arrest Audens.\nAfter this, &lt;a href=\"Carmalo%20Truiand\"&gt;Carmalo Truiand&lt;/a&gt; will take Audens Avidius' place as city watch captain, and Audens will be placed in a cell in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial City Prison&lt;/a&gt;. He will promise revenge for having his life ruined and swear to kill the person who put him in there.\nAbout ten days after being arrested he will escape and start his hunt for the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;person&lt;/a&gt; responsible. When he finds them he will attack, causing others in the area to attack him. On his body is a &lt;a href=\"Ramblings%20of%20Audens%20Avidius\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; that he wrote in jail, that explains how he escaped and began his hunt for the Hero. This post-quest drama can be avoided by sneaking into the Bastion in the prison and killing Audens there. He will be unarmed and unarmored."}

Many of the halls contained valuables, leading from gold to armor and weapons, which &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; stole from the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s coffers before &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;usurping the Imperial throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot well maintained, the sewers' mass infestation of animals made them dangerous. Many niches were carved within the walls, acting as safe haven from the fetid breezes and animals. Green moss and slime protruded from the walls, and drippings of water and other material leaked through the ceilings and floors.\nHistory.\nDuring the early stages of the Imperial Simulacrum, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned by Tharn after receiving a blow to the back of the head from one of his servants.

Magistrates also judge cases and determine prison sentences for crimes. Criminals may pay these fines to members of the law enforcement. If the criminal chooses to endure a jail sentence, they are tasked with doing heavy labor in workcamps. It is often expected that criminals who chose to follow a jail sentence lose some of their experience in skills as a result of physical, mental, or emotional punishment. Prisoners can be released from their jail sentence by a higher authority. In such an event, they are provided with a &lt;a href=\"Release%20Identification\"&gt;Release Identification&lt;/a&gt;, in which they must fill in their personal details. These papers must then be delivered to a local Imperial Legion Captain to formally authorize the release.\nPeople who are considered outlaws have no rights. As such, these people may be killed, or stolen from, without scandal or sanction. Officers in the line of duty are allowed to use deadly force in order to put down outlaws.\nUpon being caught, criminals are brought to a court where their verdict is announced. Criminals can go to jail and serve their time, or pay the court a fine and be let go. In both circumstances, criminals are searched of any stolen goods, which are taken from them and gathered as evidence. In rare cases, prisoners can also fight for their freedom in the Imperial City Arena.
