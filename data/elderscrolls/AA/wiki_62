Thieves are quick, agile and cunning. They are especially adept in bows and daggers to surprise an enemy from stealth or scout, or to deliver critical hits. Thieves typically develop skills more quickly than other character classes.\nTo maintain their nimbleness and stealth, thieves typically utilize &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, and use light shields. They are especially adept at using light weight weapons as the dagger, short sword, broadsword, sabre, war axe, and &lt;a href=\"short%20bow\"&gt;short bow&lt;/a&gt;. Due to this, a Thief is capable of switching to warrior or weak mage in higher levels.\nDescription.\nOblivion.\nThe Thief is the archetypal Stealth character, being adept in all seven stealth skills. This naturally makes them great at subterfuge and burglary. On the downside, they are less able in martial or arcane areas, lacking any innate Combat or Magic skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; is a core thief skill. When plying their shady trade in towns and cities, sneaking lets thieves avoid the attention of guards and house owners, as well as offering opportunities to pick a few pockets. When out adventuring, a sneaky thief can avoid dangerous enemies or deliver powerful &lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; sneak attacks. Security allows the thief to bypass locked doors, or to pilfer dungeon chests full of valuable loot right under the noses of their guardians.\nSneaky in social skills too, &lt;a href=\"Mercantile\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; comes in handy when a thief is selling off their (possibly ill-gotten) gains. &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; helps butter up merchants to get even better prices, but perhaps more importantly is also key to resolving some quests without confrontation.\n&lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; is the only offensive skill that the thief has. Fortunately it works well with their other skills; &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; is great for getting to safe sniping perches, Sneak provides a damage boost against unaware enemies, and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; provides some protection without slowing the thief down too much. Thieves prefer to fight using ambushes and evasion, placing guile above brawn. A thief is fast, agile, and highly mobile, and can make effective long range attacks with bows. However, they can find themselves in trouble if they let themselves get cornered by powerful melee opponents."}

In the land of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Sutch%20%28Hammerfell%29\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt; there lived a Baron who was quite wealthy. He was a noted collector of rare coins. The Baroness Veronique found the whole thing quite tedious. However, she did appreciate the lifestyle that the Baron's wealth provided.\nRavius Terinus was a noted thief. He claimed to be a master thief in the mythical guild of thieves. However, that was most like just braggadocio. The only known &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; was wiped out over 450 years ago.\nRavius decided that the Baron should share his wealth. Specifically he should share it with Ravius. The wily thief crept into the Baron's castle one night intending to do just that.\nThe walls of the castle were noted for their height and unscalability. Ravius cleverly used an Arrow of Penetration to affix a rope to the top of the battlements. Once on the battlements, he had to evade the Baron's guards. By hiding in the shadows of the crenelations, he was able to work his way to the keep undetected.\nEntering the keep was child's play for a thief of his caliber. However, a cunning lock with no less than 13 pins protected the private quarters of the Baron. Ravius broke only 9 lockpicks to open it. Using only a fork, a bit of string, and a wineskin, he disabled the seven traps guarding the Baron's coin collection. Truly Ravius was a master among thieves.\nWith the coins safely in his grasp, Ravius began his escape only to find the way blocked. The Baron had found the opened door and was raising the guard to scour the castle. Ravius fled deeper into the castle, one step ahead of the questing guards.\nHis only way out led through the boudoir of Baroness Veronique. He entered to find the lady preparing for bed. Now it should be said at this point that Ravius was noted for his handsome looks, while the Baroness was noted for her plainness. Both of these facts were immediately recognized by each of the pair.\n\"Doest thou come to plunder my virtue?\" asked the lady, all a tremble.\n\"Nay, fair lady,\" Ravius said, thinking quickly. \"Plunder be a harsh term to ply upon such a delicate flower as your virtue.\"\n\"I see thou hast made off with mine husbands precious coins.\" Ravius looked deeply into her eyes and saw the only path by which he would escape this night with his life. It would require a double sacrifice.\n\"Though these coins are of rarest value, I have now found a treasure that is beyond all value,\" Ravius said smoothly. \"Tell me, oh beauteous one, why doest thy husband set seven deadly traps around these tawdry coins, but only a simple lock upon the door of his virtuous wife?\"\n\"Ignace protects those things that are dearest to him,\" Veronique replied with ire.\n\"I would give all the gold in my possession to spend but a moment basking in your radiance.\"\nWith that Ravius set down the coins he had worked so hard to steal. The Baroness swooned into his arms. When the captain of the guard asked to search her quarters, she hid Ravius most skillfully. She turned over the coins, claiming the thief dropped them when he fled out the window.\nWith that sacrifice made, Ravius steeled himself for the second. He robbed the lady Veronique of her virtue that night. He robbed her of it several times, lasting well into the wee hours of the morning. Exhausted, yet sated, he stole away in the pre-dawn hours."}

Originally based off a guild from southern Hammerfell, the guild overtook the many unorganized outlaw groups across Tamriel, having them adopt a set of small rules and giving them order. The guild has ties to &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, the patron of thieves.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding.\nThe original Thieves Guild was founded in &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, a bustling located on the barren peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khefrem\"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The exact founding date is unknown, though it was a number of years before &lt;a href=\"2E%20549\"&gt;2E 549&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point during the sixth century of the Second Era, a member known as &lt;a href=\"Bright%20Ilmund\"&gt;Bright Ilmund&lt;/a&gt; took control of the guild. Under Ilmund's leadership, it was viewed that he ate any scraps the Abah's Landing merchant lords threw at him, all while he shook down any citizen for coin and could not plan a proper heist, causing many members to leave. After his death at around &lt;a href=\"2E%20556\"&gt;2E 556&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; became the guildmaster, and set down the three rules of the guild that remained for centuries. With this, the guild returned to its glory and made heavy profits from the fees given by the merchant lords.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Nicolas set out on a heist to &lt;a href=\"al-Danobia%20Tomb\"&gt;al-Danobia Tomb&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;, with his inner council of &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edda\"&gt;Edda&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daldur\"&gt;Daldur&lt;/a&gt;. After failing to bypass one of the tomb's traps, only Zeira made it out alive, becoming the guildmaster. &lt;a href=\"Magnifica%20Falorah\"&gt;Magnifica Falorah&lt;/a&gt; then hired the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt; after discovering the perpetrators, and sent them to Abah's Landing to hunt out guild members and find her dowry.\nSometime afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Quen\"&gt;Quen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; joined the guild after a heist of theirs at &lt;a href=\"Fulstrom%20Homestead\"&gt;Fulstrom Homestead&lt;/a&gt; was foiled by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Rhanbiq\"&gt;Chief Inspector Rhanbiq&lt;/a&gt;. After investigating the Iron Wheel's intentions, they discovered the merchant lord &lt;a href=\"Cosh\"&gt;Cosh&lt;/a&gt; was truly Nicolas, who had faked his own death. The guild infiltrated Falorah and Cosh's wedding, seeking to inform her of Cosh's intentions, though Rhanbiq arrested everyone of the guild at the wedding and captured Zeira, taking her to &lt;a href=\"No%20Shira%20Citadel\"&gt;No Shira Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. After Zeira was freed, the guild told Falorah of Nicolas having the dowry and Danobia's crown, and she then established connections with the guild.\nSpread.\nIn time, the guild spread across Tamriel, having a foothold in every province. &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, the queen of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, was known to have joined their ranks.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nVvardenfell Crisis.\nDuring this time, the &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; branch of the guild was headed by &lt;a href=\"Gentleman%20Jim%20Stacey%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gentleman Jim Stacey&lt;/a&gt;.

Prior to the events of 4E 201, the Thieves Guild in Skyrim has experienced a decrease in strength and luck due to &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt;'s theft of the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the Thieves Guild questline in , the Dovahkiin can become Guildmaster.\nOrganization.\nCulture.\nPurpose.\nMembers of the Thieves Guild protect each other and punish clumsy and greedy thieves. Kings depend on them to keep amateur thieves out of business.\nRegulations.\nDuring the Vvardenfell crisis, the rules of the Thieves guild are centered around the principle that there is honor among thieves. It is not allowed to attack or steal from another guild member. Everyone else is fair game.\nDuring the time of the Oblivion crisis, the Grey Fox had established three rules that guild members must follow: \nRecruitment.\nIn , the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can join the guild by stealing &lt;a href=\"Madesi%27s%20Silver%20Ring\"&gt;Madesi's Silver Ring&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Madesi\"&gt;his strongbox&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and planting it in &lt;a href=\"Brand-Shei\"&gt;Brand-Shei&lt;/a&gt;'s pocket in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Chance%20Arrangement\"&gt;A Chance Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSimilar organizations.\n&lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; and Thieves Guild are similar in that both are criminal organizations. One major difference is that the Camonna Tong are less honorable, functioning as more of a mafia compared to the Thieves Guild. They lack the code of honor that the Thieves Guild has, and are the native crime syndicate in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thieves Guild had a strong connection with the Dark Brotherhood, and despite their differences in purpose, ethics and ideas and policies, the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild have always had a good connection between each other. This is especially true with the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; of the Thieves Guild and &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; of the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim have had a good relationship with each other in friendship and in business.\nRed Asp.\nThe Red Asp was known to be the &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; Thieves Guild during the Second Era. It was run by &lt;a href=\"Ufa%20the%20Red%20Asp\"&gt;Ufa the Red Asp&lt;/a&gt; and had ties to Outlaw Refuges."}

It has some influence in official matters, and can \"clean\" its members' crimes for a payment from them. The Thieves Guild has spread across Tamriel and established branches in most of the provinces. However, it is not known if these branches even communicate with each other, as the Guild's methods differ heavily from province to province. Mostly, the Thieves Guild restricts its actions to avoid bloodshed and not to rob the downtrodden or those who cannot really afford it. In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; the local guild steward, &lt;a href=\"Gentleman%20Jim%20Stacey%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gentleman Jim Stacey&lt;/a&gt;, has resurrected an old society, the &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Molagmer\"&gt;Bal Molagmer&lt;/a&gt;, who see it as their duty to help the poor.\nIn the past, prostitution and drugs were a major part of Thieves Guild business, but this was almost entirely stopped due to the legality of prostitution and the presumability that the Guild could be found and known. This was unwanted. So, the doyens had a meeting and agreed that in order to preserve the Guild, and not so as to act upon the poor, they passed the law and allowed for the guild to end up safe.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, in the province of Morrowind, the Guild is run by Gentleman Jim Stacey, in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.

Founded by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; over 300 years before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the guild is essentially a network of communication between the thieves of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, tips on loot and jobs from important people are passed along through the &lt;a href=\"Doyen\"&gt;Doyen&lt;/a&gt; to the thieves, and &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fences&lt;/a&gt; will buy their stolen goods, unlike most merchants.\nOrganization.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the Thieves Guild works more secretly than in other parts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, due to extensive pressure from the &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;Imperial Watch&lt;/a&gt;, whose increased scrutiny had many secret organizations under pressure after the assassination of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. Its existence is officially denied by Imperial officials, although\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Lex\"&gt;Hieronymus Lex&lt;/a&gt; of the\u00a0Imperial Watch set out to destroy the Guild in the Imperial City by capturing its leader, known as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;, who has supposedly existed for over 300 years.\nIn ,\u00a0there are five different ways to locate the Guild. One of them, likely the most risky, is to be arrested and imprisoned for whatever reason. It is possible that during incarceration the thief will be able to contact fellow thieves imprisoned with him. If not, eventually one will contact them, handing the person\u00a0a note directing them to the location of the guild test.\nAn easier and less risky way of locating the guild is done by extensive questioning of beggars, who reveal\u00a0that in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt; there is a\u00a0small\u00a0garden\u00a0where one of the Guild's two Doyen may be interested in taking on new members if\u00a0they are able to pass a small test. Tests are almost always done solo although there have been instances when they were competitive. Once the test is complete the Thief is declared a member although they are not permitted to engage in official Guild activities until a certain amount of money has been donated to the Guild's coffers. This is done through selling stolen property to one of the Guild's five\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fences&lt;/a&gt; who are scattered across Cyrodiil but only revealed when a thief reaches a certain standing within the Guild. After a set amount is sold to a fence then the Thief will begin being invited to perform organized Guild thefts.\nThe Thieves Guild is a joinable &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; where those practicing &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;stealth arts&lt;/a&gt; may collaborate with each other.

It is one of several &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;factions&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can join in .\nBackground.\nBased in Skyrim and headquartered in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway\"&gt;The Ratway&lt;/a&gt; beneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Thieves Guild are renowned for causing trouble in the city and are held largely responsible for the corruption of the city's markets. Members of the guild specialize in &lt;a href=\"stealing\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt; objects of varying value or loaning &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; to potential entrepreneurs or to help someone pay off their debts, in hopes of a payback.

The guild has an uncanny luck due to certain members striking up a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; to serve as guardians to her temple.\nThe guild has a strong hold in politics and law enforcement due to their ability to bribe, intimidate, and extort the officials and guards of any hold by exploiting their greed or by threatening to reveal embarrassing and potentially damning secrets to the public.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nLittle is known about when and how the Thieves Guild of Skyrim was founded, but it is rumored to have been around as long as Riften has. As the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; continued, the Thieves Guild slipped further and further into obscurity and the members and regular clients began to leave (with the exception of Maven Black-Briar).\nThe guild was previously believed to be completely fictional; in , if asked about the guild, &lt;a href=\"City%20Guard%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; would simply state that there was no such thing. However, the Thieves Guild has become well known and, in fact, well renowned for their thievery and exploitation.\nThe guild has some close association with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; which becomes apparent in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Silence%20Has%20Been%20Broken\"&gt;The Silence Has Been Broken&lt;/a&gt;\" quest for the Dark Brotherhood, in which the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must bring an amulet given by &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Thieves Guild, to be revised on its value to cover payment of Motierre's several contracts that culminate in the murder of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;.\nFourth Era.\nSecond Century.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, which is twenty-five years before &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when the quests of the Thieves Guild in Skyrim take place, the Thieves Guild was in a golden age. Their headquarters was a palace, in which they had their own blacksmith, alchemist, traders, fences, and many associates throughout Skyrim. The Thieves Guild was very powerful and dominant and was feared and respected by most of Skyrim. Even with the Guild being in a Golden Age, the &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus Desidenius&lt;/a&gt; was slowly and carefully organizing and planning long-term heists which included heists on museums, art galleries, stores, and government treasuries in an effort to continue and strengthen the Guild's presence in Skyrim. One of these heists included the heist of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;Eyes of the Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, which required a deep understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, their language, and their writing system.\nThird Century.\nBy &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the Guild was on the brink of collapse, with the people of Skyrim becoming bolder and less fearful of the organization. The Guild had made plans to bring itself back to its former glory and establish itself as a major faction in Skyrim. A great number of small jobs were needed to be completed; this was followed by the completion of a contract by a notable person found in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; respectively. A special request was not needed to be completed in Riften, because the Thieves Guild already had a major presence in the city and was preeminently dominant throughout the area, especially with their ties to Maven Black-Briar.\nNocturnal's Curse.\nWhen the first group of Nightingales sought guidance from &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, she accepted, but in return, the Guild would have to keep the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; safe in its chamber. However, when &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt; secretly assassinated the current Guildmaster Gallus and took the key from its chamber, the Guild lost Nocturnal's favor. The curse was then activated, causing the Guild to go to a state of decay and ill-repute among their clients.\nShadowmarks.\nOne of the major aspects of the Thieves Guild in Skyrim is their use of a code the guild-members use to communicate with each other without speaking. This unique code is known as Shadowmarks. The code is composed of nine different symbols, each with their own meaning. These Shadowmarks are commonly placed on door-frames on the fronts of buildings which indicate to a Guild member if the building is safe, dangerous, contains important items or loot, houses another member of the Guild or another thief, as well as other important uses that could help a Guild member or other thieves.\nConnection with the Dark Brotherhood.\nThe Thieves Guild has a strong connection with the Dark Brotherhood, which is especially evident in the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their differences in organization, purpose, and policies, the Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood rely on each other for support. It is notable that &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; of the Brotherhood have had a good relationship, both as friends and as business associates.\nJoining.\nTo join the Thieves Guild the Dragonborn must enter &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and speak to &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt;, a red-headed Nord male, who can be found during the day in the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Marketplace\"&gt;Riften Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; between 8:00 a.m. \u2013 8:00 p.m or in &lt;a href=\"The%20Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;The Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt; at night. During the day, once the Dragonborn is within proximity, &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; will automatically attempt to strike up a conversation in which the Thieves Guild prerequisite quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Chance%20Arrangement\"&gt;A Chance Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;\" can be started. Alternatively, in the evenings past 8:00 p.m., the Dragonborn can encounter Brynjolf at The Bee and Barb inn, at which time he will tell the Dragonborn to speak with him during the day at his stall in the Riften Marketplace.\nBrynjolf, when encountered during the daytime, will give the Dragonborn instructions to steal &lt;a href=\"Madesi%27s%20Silver%20Ring\"&gt;Madesi's Silver Ring&lt;/a&gt; from the strongbox located under his stall and then plant it inside of the pocket of &lt;a href=\"Brand-Shei\"&gt;Brand-Shei&lt;/a&gt;, the local general stall owner. He is identified as the only male &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in the crowd. Brynjolf will start a distraction by calling everybody within the area to listen to the story of his latest product that he is selling, Falmerblood Elixir, which is obviously a ruse. During this time, carry out the plan as discussed with Brynjolf. Planting the ring will instantly end Brynjolf's tale he is telling to the crowd, thus dispersing it. He will now tell the Dragonborn to meet him in the Ragged Flagon down in the Ratway to discuss membership. Afterwards, a Riften &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt; will confront Brand-Shei, discover the planted ring, and arrest him, escorting him to the jail in &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Keep\"&gt;Mistveil Keep&lt;/a&gt; where Brand-Shei will remain in lockup for the rest of the game.\nEven if the Dragonborn fails to acquire the ring, joining the Guild is still possible because Brynjolf says he still believes the Dragonborn has what it takes, despite failure of the quest. However, it will initially make a few members of the guild treat the Dragonborn with more disdain.\nQuests.\nSmall jobs.\n&lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt; offer an unlimited number of radiant quests known as \"jobs.\" The target item and location for each are generated randomly within &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. Jobs can be accepted and denied at will. It is possible (and efficient) to run a job for Delvin and one for Vex simultaneously (the Tips section below has more information). The reward for each mission is leveled, between 50 and 800 . After performing five small jobs in a single city, excluding Riften, a special job will be unlocked for it, which upon completion will upgrade the appearances of both the Ragged Flagon and Cistern as the Thieves Guild regain their influence around Skyrim. Killing those crucial to the job results in a failure, and no payment is received. Since there are no count statistics provided for these jobs, the only ways to determine how many have been done are to go through the completed jobs in the quest log and read the objective for each, since they list the city in which the job was done, or to keep track manually.\nWith installed, jobs such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bedlam%20Job\"&gt;The Bedlam Job&lt;/a&gt;\" can also be generated in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, although there are no special jobs nor city influence quests on the island.\nCity influence quests.\nAfter completing five small jobs in a city (with the exception of Riften and Raven Rock), Delvin will offer a special job to restore Thieves Guild influence in that city. Note that even if five small jobs have been completed in multiple cities, Delvin will only assign one influence quest at a time. These quests can be taken in any order. The city influence quests are necessary in order to complete \"&lt;a href=\"Under%20New%20Management\"&gt;Under New Management&lt;/a&gt;\" and assume the title of &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt;. When they are all completed, the guild can return to its former glory. (However, before completing them all, see the bugs reported for \"Under New Management.\") Becoming Guildmaster allows access to the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Master%27s%20Tribute%20Chest\"&gt;Guild Master's Tribute Chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach city influence quest that is completed will add a merchant stall to &lt;a href=\"the%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;the Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the gold available to fences throughout Skyrim gradually increases as these quests are completed, up to a maximum of 4,000 . The third and fourth city influence quests will each add a new recruit to the Guild as well: first &lt;a href=\"Garthar\"&gt;Garthar&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"Ravyn%20Imyan\"&gt;Ravyn Imyan&lt;/a&gt;. The Cistern will also be upgraded with new stuff as the city influence quests are completed, such as Thieves Guild banners, improved furniture, and other things.\nWhile related, \"&lt;a href=\"Deliver%20Moon%20Sugar%20to%20Ri%27saad\"&gt;Deliver Moon Sugar to Ri'saad&lt;/a&gt;\" is not itself a city influence quest. It is given by Tonilia rather than Delvin Mallory, and is not a prerequisite for \"Under New Management.\"\nMerchants.\nAlthough these unlocked merchants work for the guild, they do not act as fences and therefore do not buy goods marked as stolen. (Note: If the Windhelm quest is completed before all others, Herluin Lothaire may move instead of Syndus.)\nTips.\nThe fastest possible method for completion is to disable automatic saves (on Travel, on Character Menu), take Numbers jobs from Delvin and take Burglary jobs from Vex. These are the two fastest respective job types to complete. Once one has factored in time lost from repeated saving and reloading the latter tip actually takes longer than speedrunning.\nAlternatively, one can save before getting a new job, then ask for \"Bedlam Jobs\" from Delvin and \"Sweep Jobs\" from Vex (Hint: to avoid going through the conversation again, it is best to save once the dialogue is finished, but before the quest objective appears). As long as they are in the same city, once the Sweep Job is done, \"The Bedlam Job\" will be completed as well, essentially completing two tasks at once. If it is in a city whose influence quest has already been completed, quick loading and trying again is suggested.\nAnother way is to quit the job Delvin and/or Vex assigned, then ask for the job again. Generally, there are no negative repercussions for quitting jobs, excluding the multiple failed missions in the quest log and the short disapproving dialogue after each quit job. However, if the Dragonborn quits a \"Sweep Job\" in one place and then gets that job again later, they risk having difficulties stealing the items since the new/latest rendered item could spawn inside the old item that is left from the first job. For example, the Dragonborn could get a jeweled pitcher inside another jeweled pitcher. On PC this can be resolved by using the console and simply codice_1 the outer/old item from the previously quit job.\nIt is also very helpful to keep track of how many jobs have been done in each of the four holds that matter (Whiterun, Haafingar, Eastmarch, and the Reach). This makes it easier to choose the jobs to be kept or dumped to keep the relative numbers balanced. For example, if jobs are done in three holds, and yet all five jobs are left to do in the other hold, then it can be tedious to wait to be given jobs in that hold.\nOn PC, it is also possible to avoid doing the jobs altogether as city influence quests can be started using the codice_2 console command. Each quest can be started by using the appropriate quest ID and setting the stage to 10. Conversely, because of variable setting in addition to quest stages and all jobs of a time having the same quest ID, it is not easily possible to start a job in a particular city.\nTrophy cases.\nVarious unique items can be stolen during the Thieves Guild quests and sold to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin&lt;/a&gt;. As each is collected and sold to Delvin, they will be displayed on the shelves behind Mercer's Desk where they can freely be taken or left as decoration. By following the quest line, the items appear in the following order:\nTrophies also appear for completing a certain number of jobs assigned by Vex and Delvin:\nFinally, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Crown of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; is placed on the bust between shelves upon completion of the mission \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Stone%20Unturned%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;No Stone Unturned&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMembers.\nFences.\nFences buy &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;stolen goods&lt;/a&gt;. There are a total of nine different fences throughout Skyrim, including each Khajiit caravan:\nArmor sets.\nAfter completing various quests in the Thieves Guild questline, the Dragonborn can obtain five different armor sets.\nExpulsion from the guild.\nThieves caught attacking other guild members or one of their associates are removed from the guild and none of the members speak to them. To rejoin the guild, speak to &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt;, who will charge a fee of 1000 ."}

The &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; ruled the Third Empire during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, but the bloodline was extinguished in the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; rose to power in the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; and has held the Imperial throne ever since.\nAt its height, the Third Empire spanned across the entire continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and small colonial territories on &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; and the island nations of &lt;a href=\"Cathnoquey\"&gt;Cathnoquey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt;, it administered feudal control through the nine provinces, with an &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; or Empress acting as supreme ruler.\nThe Empire's prosperity was the driving force behind the ushering in of the Third Era. Through &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; conquering all of Tamriel, the continent was able to achieve unity and peace.\nBolstered by centuries of relative peace on the continent of Tamriel, a developed and robust military, and thriving commerce between ethnically diverse provinces, the Third Empire was a leading political, economic, and cultural force on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; during its time.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nThe Third Empire was founded through a series of wars in the late-Second Era. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;, Talos, also known as Hjalti Early-Beard, was called by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, who told him he was destined to rule all of Tamriel.\nFollowing the Battle of Old Hroldan, an alliance of Skyrim and High Rock attempted to prevent Hjalti's king, &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, from creating another Empire by taking over &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a fort in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"County%20Chorrol\"&gt;County Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. Following their defeat, the Nordic army deserted the alliance, and joined Hjalti's army, with the aid of which all of Cyrodiil was conquered. After the unification of Cyrodiil, Cuhlecain was murdered, either by a &lt;a href=\"Reachman\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; assassin as a result of the Battle of Sancre Tor, or by Hjalti himself as a means of becoming Emperor. Whatever the case, in the aftermath Hjalti was crowned Emperor, and took on himself a Cyrodiilic name, Tiber Septim.\nAfter Septim was crowned, he would slowly invade, conquer, and persuade the other provinces of Tamriel to become part of his Empire. Skyrim and High Rock were the first provinces to be conquered, followed by Black Marsh, Hammerfell, and the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, for which Septim used the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeptim Dynasty.\nWhen Tiber Septim finally conquered all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, he declared that the following year a new era should begin, thus beginning the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim's thirty-eight year reign was described as a \"lawful, pious, and glorious age.\" As well as initiating governmental reforms, he is credited for reviving the Cult of the One and erecting &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;a Temple&lt;/a&gt; for it in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. After Tiber Septim's death in &lt;a href=\"3E%2038\"&gt;3E 38&lt;/a&gt;, he was succeeded by his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Only a few years into his reign, Pelagius was assassinated while praying in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius died with no heir, and so Tiber Septim's niece &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Kintyra Septim&lt;/a&gt; became Empress. Following her death in &lt;a href=\"3E%2048\"&gt;3E 48&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim\"&gt;Uriel Septim&lt;/a&gt; succeeded her, increasing the military and founding the many guilds, such as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Uriel's death, his son &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Uriel Septim II&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him. Uriel II's reign ended the brief period of peace founded during Tiber Septim's reign and his reign was \"cursed with blights, plagues, and insurrections.\" &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius II&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his father, and inherited his massive debt. To fix this, Pelagius dismissed all members of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; and only let them retain their seats if they payed large sums of money. He encouraged his vassals to do likewise, and during his 17 year reign, the empire returned to prosperity.\n&lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his father, but he had little intention of running the empire, and instead spend most of his time with his many mistresses. His reign was rife with civil wars, even more so than his grandfather's reign. He only barely defeated the armies of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. He was succeeded by his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt;. Kintyra II was captured in a coup staged by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; began. &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; won the war, and became the next emperor. \nCephorus' grandson, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, was mentally unable to rule and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, ruled in his stead. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, an event with the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; occurred. After Chephorus II died, he was succeeded by his son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;.\nUriel V was regarded as the greatest conqueror emperor since Tiber Septim himself. Uriel would conquer several kingdoms including &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cathnoquey\"&gt;Cathnoquey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt;. He would also invade &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, but it ended in a complete disaster and Uriel's death. Uriel's son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VI\"&gt;Uriel Septim VI&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him at the age of just five years old. When he eventually did become old enough to rule, he died in a horse accident. Uriel V's sister, &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt; succeeded her nephew. She would slowly begin to quell the riots and civil wars that have been happening since the days of &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Chephorus II&lt;/a&gt;. Angered by the slow progress, she was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"3E%20339\"&gt;3E 339&lt;/a&gt;. Her nephew, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Pelagius Septim IV&lt;/a&gt; succeeded his aunt after her assassination. Pelagius would continue his aunt's work and unified the empire once more, saying that the empire was closer to unity than it had during the days of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim\"&gt;Uriel I&lt;/a&gt;. When Pelagius died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20368\"&gt;3E 368&lt;/a&gt;, his son &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him.\nOblivion Crisis.\nUriel VII's reign was an overall stable one, but was dotted with occasional strife and near-catastrophe. His &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, possibly at the urging of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, imprisoned him and ruled in his stead for several years. The Emperor escaped just in time to thwart an attempt by the King of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; to conquer &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. By the time &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; threw Morrowind into crisis, there was talk of the failing health of the Emperor, and concerns over the future of the Empire. During this time &lt;a href=\"Wulf\"&gt;Wulf&lt;/a&gt;, an avatar of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; appeared and spoke about the Empire's rulership needing a change, only a few years later would Wulf's words turn into reality.\nAs it turned out, the Emperor's health was not an issue, until an assassin prevented him from fleeing from the Imperial City after learning of the murder of every known heir to the throne. Their murderers, a cult called the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; that served Mehrunes Dagon, were preparing Tamriel for an invasion by the Daedra Lord. Septim's sole, albeit illegitimate heir, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;, closed shut the jaws of Oblivion by metamorphosing into an avatar of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and defeating Dagon, sacrificing himself for the Empire.\nThe Empire was left without an heir once more, but this time, with no remaining legitimate Septim heritant. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, which had essentially ruled during the periods of the weakest emperors, assumed absolute authority. Many provinces whispered rumors of dissolving the Empire; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; being the first.\nMede Dynasty.\nEver since the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Third Empire has undergone heavy changes, both culturally and politically. The death of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the Oblivion Crisis marked the end of the Septim Dynasty, only to be led by the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The Elder Council continued to rule for fifteen years before the death of &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, igniting a sanguinary &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil. It ended when Colovian warlord &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; conquered the Imperial City and took over what was left of the Empire.\nWhen Titus Mede I took the throne, the Empire was nothing like what it used to be. The province of Black Marsh seceded from the Empire following the Oblivion Crisis, and Morrowind was largely destroyed, with only the most western portion being ruled by the Dunmer and the south being taken over by the now-independent Argonians. In the wake of the Oblivion Crisis, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; convinced the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; that they were their saviors from the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; invasion and consolidated their power. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;, the government of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; was overthrown by Thalmor collaborators and a union with Alinor proclaimed. Thus was the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; reborn. &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; had become independent city-states, and were constantly at war with one another. &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; had declared independence and turned into the ancient kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire's ineffectual protection and seeming indifference to Morrowind's plights made them reviled by the Dunmer. After the Empire \"released its grasp\" on Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, the last Imperial ally in the province, was ousted from the Grand Council, and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; left the Empire, as had &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, it is implied that &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; had also left the Empire, leaving it with &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and most of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the rule of Titus Mede I, &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; were reclaimed. Hammerfell was also reconquered, and, if High Rock did leave the Empire, High Rock was also reclaimed. Under his leadership, rebels in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; were also supplied by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;. Under later Emperors, Elsweyr was presumed to have been reclaimed, though Elsweyr was lost again following the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt;. The status of Morrowind's affiliation with the Empire is questionable as they have full autonomy and appear to have little love for the Empire. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Morrowind during the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; prevented the Empire from reclaiming Morrowind. During the Void Nights, the Thalmor claimed that they had restored the moons using previously unknown Dawn Magicks, but it is unclear if they truly restored the moons or just took advantage of foreknowledge that they would return.\nRegardless of whether the Thalmor spoke truly or not, the Khajiit credited the Thalmor as their saviors. Fifteen years after the occurrence of the Void Nights, Imperial influence in Elsweyr had diminished so much that the Empire was unable to stop the coup of 4E 115 which dissolved the Elsweyr Confederacy and recreated the ancient kingdoms of Anequina and Pelletine as client states of the Aldmeri Dominion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire was only a shadow of its former self. Only by signing the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; was the Empire able to survive the Dominion's onslaught and thus end the Great War. The concordat led to the loss of Hammerfell, the southern part of which would have been handed over to the Dominion if not for the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; uprising (though most of the demanded territory was already conquered by Dominion forces). The northern portion of Hammerfell had been warring with the Dominion-held southern portion until the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, which declared a truce between the Dominion and Hammerfell, resulting in the former's forces withdrawing. Included within the White-Gold Concordat was an immediate and thorough banishing of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship, which would later result in the forming of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; (though many Talos worshipers now simply worship in secret). After the signing of the White-Gold Concordat and the events of the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmeri Dominion's &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; agents established an &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to Skyrim to enforce the White-Gold Concordat and make sure that the Empire doesn't break it again. However, the Justiciars are also known to secretly capture and imprison any &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who question their doctrines or beliefs. Furthermore, the book known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Talos%20Mistake\"&gt;The Talos Mistake&lt;/a&gt;\" was published by an Imperial Liaison to the Aldmeri Dominion. This supposedly details Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;'s personal belief that worshiping Talos is morally wrong and that the decision to ban Talos worship was a decision of his own making and was in no way coerced by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. According to the publication, the Emperor, and indeed the Empire itself, recognizes that allowing the worship of Talos was a mistake and publicly declares its support of removing Talos worship from Tamriel. Most of this book is, however, contradicted by several high ranking Imperial officials, as well as members of the Thalmor, making the reliability of the book questionable. All that is left of the Third Empire are the provinces of High Rock, a recovering &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; which took the brunt of the Great War, and the war-torn Skyrim that was ungoing both a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;province-wide civil war&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment.\nUltimate power in the Third Empire is vested in the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, but the day-to-day running of the Empire is overseen by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;. The Council is devised by the Emperor to help keep the empire running by taking charge of the operations across the Empire, their responsibilities consist of administrating and overseeing provinces, advising the Emperor, and creation of laws (over which the Emperor still holds a veto). While the Emperor and the Elder Council rule over the entirety of the empire, power is also invested in smaller rulers such as the &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Counts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Jarls\"&gt;Jarls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to rule over their respective regions.\nMilitary.\nThe armed force of the Third Empire are the Imperial Legions. The Legions are considered one of the most disciplined and effective fighting forces Tamriel has ever seen. Consisting of a wide selection of units, its soldiers are tasked with upholding the law, defending the citizenry, and waging war against enemies of the Empire. Imperial Soldiers patrol the roads of the Imperial provinces, engaging in combat with any threat to the traveler on the road.\nThe naval force of the Third Empire was the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;. The Navy was utilized by the empire during a number of wars such as the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt;'s conquests. During the Tiber Wars, the main fighting was during the conquest of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. During the Great War, the Navy fought against the &lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Navy\"&gt;Dominion Navy&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;, but these clashes ultimately ended in failure as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; eventually fell to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire suffered from a military weakness, the cause of this possibly being the many wars the Empire waged before the Great War broke out. After the Great War with the Aldmeri Dominion, the Empire has stationed the bulk of their Imperial forces on the Cyrodiilic-Aldmeri border and is rebuilding its army in order to win the next war."}

The &lt;a href=\"Septim%20family\"&gt;Septim family&lt;/a&gt;, occasionally inclusive of adopted and married members, has ruled ever since.\nWithin a few generations, however, the family had begun to develop rivalries and jealousies which exploded into a civil war in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; ended with the death of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt; and his mother &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Potema\"&gt;Queen Potema&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, but its reverberations may still be felt today. The unity of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; was never again to be assumed.\nThe Emperors who followed, such as the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;-kissed Pelagius Septim III, yielded to the authority of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; to keep some semblance of order in the land. It was only too evident what occurs when the Empire tried to maintain unity without a strong leader. In the most horrible example, the people of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; suffered under the depredations of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"daedric\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt; hordes ravaged the land for nearly twenty years before his defeat in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Morihatha\"&gt;Empress Morihatha&lt;/a&gt; brought a change in the rulers of Tamriel, who ever since have been notably stronger and more capable. This strong central power has not meant that the last one hundred and twenty years have been the most peaceful in Tamriel's history, utterly devoid of bloodshed, but merely that the wars and troubles of the recent past are tame in comparison to the utter violence and wreckage of the past.\nThe most famous trouble of recent years came early in the reign of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. By wile and sorcery, his trusted battlemage &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned and impersonated his liege. The ten years that Tharn reigned, the so-called &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, was a time when old troubles resurfaced, forgotten grudges rekindleded, and wars flared throughout the land. In the east, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;; in the north, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; battled &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;; in the south, &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; took arms against &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;; and in the west, Valenwood lost land to its former ally Summerset in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet all of these troubles, and even more recent bizarre circumstances in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, paint only a picture of blood. In the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20422\"&gt;3E 422&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire stands strong and united."}

While fighting the Moth Rebellion, the green recruits earned the Legion the sobriquet\u00a0\"The Faithful\" while besieged in the &lt;a href=\"Hesod%20Barracks\"&gt;Hesod Barracks&lt;/a&gt; by the Cultists. The Legion marched with Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s honor guard during his re-entry into the capital.\nThe Third saw action in every corner of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;expanding Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and is known to have stormed &lt;a href=\"Tarak%20Shan\"&gt;Tarak Shan&lt;/a&gt; and pursued kidnappers into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20861\"&gt;2E 861&lt;/a&gt;. When the city of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; refused to surrender to &lt;a href=\"General%20Pottreid\"&gt;General Pottreid&lt;/a&gt;, he ordered the legion to sack the city, killing &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i men, women, and children.

But their happiness was short lived, and the settlers soon learned that not everyone celebrated the construction of Thirsk. As the mead hall was being erected, so too was the noise and commotion of construction disturbing an ancient creature that lie dormant under the ice.

Any warrior, regardless of race or sex, could claim leadership of the mead hall by displaying the most impressive battle trophy on the great hall's pedestal. So long as the spirit of Hrothmund the Red consented, that warrior would be named chieftain.\nHrothmund's Bane:.\nFor twenty-one years Hrothmund the Red ruled over Thirsk and its residents as chieftain. With his soft voice and great axe -- which was said to be the largest weapon of its kind ever wielded by a Nord -- Hrothmund brought peace and prosperity to Thirsk. But peace proved to be Hrothmund's undoing, for the mighty Nord grew restless in the warmth and safety of the mead hall. He longed for battle and adventure, to feel the frost in his veins once more, and could ignore the call of valor no longer. When word spread of a giant, bloodthirsty white wolf terrorizing travelers in the Moesring Mountains, Hrothmund took up his great axe and set out to defeat the beast alone. The men of the mountains named him Ondjage, the Fell Wolf. The beast measured as large as an ox, with fur as white as new-fallen snow, and it was said no man or woman alive could bring Ondjage down. The words of the mountain folk proved true, for while Hrothmund did hew one leg from the Fell Wolf, Ondjage devoured the mighty Nord whole, leaving only his great axe as a grim reminder of man's failure against beast. Filled with sorrow and rage, the residents of Thirsk marched to the mountains in search of the wolf, called by them Hrothmund's Bane. Only together did they manage to slay Ondjage, and as family they feasted on his roasted flesh.\nThe following is a list of Thirsk's chieftains, since Hrothmund first ruled:.\nHrothmund the Red. Nord male. Slew Drengr Bronze-Helm and presented his head as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for twenty-one years. Slain and devoured by Ondjage, the Fell Wolf.\nIsgeror White-Wave. Nord female.

Slew the wizard Griss the Yellow and presented his head as a battle trophy. Ruled over Thirsk for three years thus far, and still chieftain as of the writing of this work.\nExpansion:.\nThe Thirsk mead hall is nearly the same today as it was over a hundred years ago, a testament to the quality of its construction. But while Thirsk itself did not grow, its inhabitants did, and before long the grand mead hall could not house all who wished to dwell within. So, over the years, many Nords have left Thirsk to establish their own private dwellings out in the wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, relying on the island's many caves and natural shelters. But those who left are always welcome back at Thirsk, and many return frequently to enjoy the mead hall's hospitalities. It is also important to note that although over a hundred years have passed since the group first left the Skaal village, the Skaal and Thirsk Nords have always remained civil to one another, and even trade resources on occasion.\nRelationship with the Empire:.\nThroughout the years, the Thirsk Nords and the Empire have entered into a simple but effective relationship: they leave each other alone and everyone is happy. Soon after arriving on Solstheim, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; realized that their authority on the island was limited to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; and vicinity. Solstheim was, is, and probably always will be a savage and frozen wasteland more suited to ancient Nord custom than conventional Imperial law. As long as the residents of Thirsk leave Fort Frostmoth in peace, the Imperials at Fort Frostmoth will reciprocate. In fact, the relationship between the two locations is fairly civil, and the Thirsk Nords gained considerable favor with the Empire when they delivered the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; fugitive Alain Montrose to the garrison at Forth Frostmoth, after he attempted to hide out in Thirsk.\nLaw and Order Within Thirsk:.\nWithin the Mead Hall, the Chieftain serves as judge, jury and executioner if necessary. The reality is that Thirsk has always been a fairly peaceful place, with camaraderie and goodwill the norm. &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; can be a harsh home, and the Nords of Thirsk have long realized that fighting each other isn't nearly as productive as battling the island's bears, wolves, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;draugrs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt;, and whatever other fell creatures may roam the land. Still, there is the occasional disagreement - which more often than naught ends in bloodshed - and every few years someone gets it into his head to challenge the chieftain to a blood duel to try to gain possession of Thirsk. Generally speaking, the Nords of Thirsk are one big, happy barbarian-like family. And, like any family, they have their squabbles."}

But nothing within that span of time could compare to the terror of the Udyrfrykte, that ancient beast who ravaged the great hall during the time of Hrothmund. The Udyrfrykte was driven away, and sealed inside his lair for what all hoped was an eternity. In time, the beast was forgotten, but the beast himself did not forget. When the lake of ice caught fire and the entrance to that long-sealed lair lay open, the Udyrfrykte walked once more upon the land. He came back to Thirsk to seek his vengeance, and vengeance he found. The fell creature killed all he could, and tore the mead hall asunder. The Udyrfrykte was driven from the mead hall, but all knew it was just a matter of time before he returned to finish the job he had started \u2014 the complete destruction of Thirsk and all who resided within. It was then he came, a stranger to the land of Solstheim and savior to the Nords of Thirsk. His name was %PCName of the %PCRace race, and he did what even the mighty Hrothmund could not. This brave warrior strode into the lair of the Udyrfrykte, faced the ancient beast, and slew him as a butcher slays a sheep! The mighty %PCName then claimed the heart of the Udyrfrykte as a battle trophy, where it remains to this day on the pedestal of Thirsk. For the %PCRace known as %PCName was named chieftain of the mead hall, and is revered by his people as both leader and warrior.\nThe following is a list of Thirsk's chieftains, since Hrothmund first ruled:\nHrothmund the Red.

Rules Thirsk as of this writing.\nExpansion.\nThe Thirsk mead hall is nearly the same today as it was over a hundred years ago, a testament to the quality of its construction. But while Thirsk itself did not grow, its inhabitants did, and before long the grand mead hall could not house all who wished to dwell within. So, over the years, many Nords have left Thirsk to establish their own private dwellings out in the wilderness of Solstheim, relying on the island's many caves and natural shelters. But those who left are always welcome back at Thirsk, and many return frequently to enjoy the mead hall's hospitalities. It is also important to note that although over a hundred years have passed since the group first left the Skaal village, the Skaal and Thirsk Nords have always remained civil to one another, and even trade resources on occasion.\nRelationship with the Empire.\nThe Thirsk Nords hold the same relations with Raven Rock that they once held with the Empire when its presence was more known on Solstheim: a deliberate disinterest and lack of complication. Both sides remain happy if they can plausibly believe the other doesn't exist. Which is not to say there is any cause for enmity; rather, there is simply no cause for fellowship among these two very differing cultures.\nLaw and Order Within Thirsk.\nWithin the Mead Hall, the Chieftain serves as judge, jury and executioner if necessary. The reality is that Thirsk has always been a fairly peaceful place, with camaraderie and goodwill the norm. Solstheim can be a harsh home, and the Nords of Thirsk have long realized that fighting each other isn't nearly as productive as battling the island's &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;, wolves, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugrs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt;, and whatever other fell creatures may roam the land. Still, there is the occasional disagreement \u2014 which more often than naught ends in bloodshed \u2014 and every few years someone gets it into his head to challenge the chieftain to a blood duel to try to gain possession of Thirsk. Generally speaking, the Nords of Thirsk are one big, happy barbarian-like family. And, like any family, they have their squabbles.\nThe Ashtimes.\nSince the eruption of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the southern portion of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; has been lost to waste and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; occupation. Thirsk sits just above the desolated area, though, and happily escaped the destruction that fell over much of the land. In the years since, Thirsk has taken its role as \"haven\" all the more seriously. They focus on hospitality, and on welcoming outsiders whether they seek respite from the southern &lt;a href=\"ashlands\"&gt;ashlands&lt;/a&gt; or the northern chill."}

Thirsk is one of the few &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic settlements, and was founded by a tribe that strayed away from the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; tribe of Nords.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Thirsk Mead Hall is located on the eastern coast of Lake Fjalding, one of the largest lakes on Solstheim. The lake is the source for all sorts of creatures in the area, even &lt;a href=\"the%20Udyrfrykte\"&gt;the Udyrfrykte&lt;/a&gt;, a mystical &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt; of unbeknownst powers. The Mead Hall is isolated and is far from other settlements; the closest ones are the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt; in the northern cliffs and the town of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;, on the southern coast. The hall is located on a large opening on the lake and is ripe with the hunt, which is how the Thirsk Nords survive.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thirsk Mead Hall was founded by a sub-section of &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; Nords that rejected the strict worship of the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt; and yearned for the days of a hardy Nord lifestyle found back in their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling southwards, they found an open clearing located on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding\"&gt;Lake Fjalding&lt;/a&gt; where the Mead Hall is currently located. The foundation of Thirsk Mead Hall is roughly hundred years before the events on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and several years before the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;. The construction of Thirsk resulted in an ancient beast to wake up in anger, &lt;a href=\"the%20Udyrfrykte\"&gt;the Udyrfrykte&lt;/a&gt; lived in an alcove located around Lake Fjalding. The monster arose from his cave and destroyed the Thirsk Mead Hall, bringing the Thirsk Nord numbers down by half. All hope was lost until a powerful sorcerer named &lt;a href=\"Eldrid%20Ice-Light\"&gt;Eldrid Ice-Light&lt;/a&gt; used his magic to defeat the Udyrfrykte and to seal him in his home. Thirsk was reconstructed in the span of two months, but the work was tiring and tedious.\nAfter completing Thirsk, tension arose between the Thirsk Nords on who should be the leader of the group. Many considered &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%20the%20Red\"&gt;Hrothmund the Red&lt;/a&gt; to head Thirsk considering his preexisting seat of leadership, but &lt;a href=\"Drengr%20Bronze-Helm\"&gt;Drengr Bronze-Helm&lt;/a&gt; disagreed and saw himself more capable of being the leader, a sentiment he shared during a feast in Thirsk. Hrothmund reacted by decapitating the man and displaying his head to his fellow nords as a sign of his undisputed leadership. This inspired a new tradition among the nords of Thirsk: anyone could claim leadership of Thirsk Mead Hall so long as they had a prized trophy they could mount and consent from Hrothmund's Spirit. Hrothmund ruled Thirsk for several years but yearned for the days of war and conflict; he could no longer ignore the call of valor. There was news of a mighty wolf that the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Ondjage\"&gt;Ondjage&lt;/a&gt;, the Fell Wolf. Hrothmund took his axe and traveled to Moesring, to slay this beast. He, however, failed in his mission and was devoured by the Fell Wolf, leaving only his axe in the snow. Enraged and mourning, the Thirsk Tribe traveled to the north to &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hrothmund's Bane&lt;/a&gt; and slew the creature with their combined strength. That night, the Nords feasted on the wolf's flesh and honored their fallen leader.\nAmidst the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Prophecy\"&gt;Bloodmoon Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the Thirsk Mead Hall was prospering, with no signs of the Udyrfrykte for several years. However, a flame erupted from the depths of Lake Fjalding, and the beast emerged from his frozen prison. The Udyrfrykte ransacked the Mead Hall and left very few survivors. Rumors soon spread across Solstheim, reaching as far as the &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; on the southern shore. A &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;traveler&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the ruins of Thirsk and spoke to &lt;a href=\"Svenja%20Snow-Song\"&gt;Svenja Snow-Song&lt;/a&gt;, a young Nordic woman of Thirsk. She told the traveler about the recent attack and sent them to the lair of the Udyrfrykte, somewhere around Fjalding. The warrior returned to Thirsk with the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Udyrfrykte\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; of the beast and presented it to Svenja; she felt that the warrior was capable of being the new chieftain. She sent the traveler to &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%27s%20Barrow\"&gt;Hrothmund's Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, to communication with the spirit of Hrothmund about the position, only to return with his consent. The traveler would become the New Chieftain of Thirsk. This period would be unrecorded for unknown reasons. Several Chieftains other than the Slayer of the Udyrfrykte would rise and fall throughout the years.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmidst the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the Thirsk Mead Hall came under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Riekling\"&gt;Riekling&lt;/a&gt;s of Solstheim, the original leader of the Hall, before their squatting was &lt;a href=\"Bujold%20the%20Unworthy\"&gt;Bujold the Unworthy&lt;/a&gt;, who had questionable leadership. During her rule, the Nords did not fight. Instead, they drank their nights away, telling drunken stories. After the Rieklings took the Hall, the Nords escaped to a clearing along the southeastern coast, near the village of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;traveler&lt;/a&gt; found their little camp, and Bujold asked them to walk with her to Hrothmund's Barrow, located north of the Lake. There, Hrothmund's spirit spoke to Bujold and told her that she is not worthy of the leadership of Thirsk. Despite this, Bujold wanted to continue to rule Thirsk, leaving her fate to the traveler. Her fate was left unknown; some say she continued to rule Thirsk, while others have said that she retaliated and was killed in the process."}

The mead hall is just east of the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Beast Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe book \"&lt;a href=\"Thirsk%2C%20a%20Revised%20History\"&gt;Thirsk, a Revised History&lt;/a&gt;\" describes the founding of the Mead Hall. The following is a summary:\nThird Era.\nRoughly a hundred years before the book's publication (probably sometime around &lt;a href=\"3E%20320\"&gt;3E 320&lt;/a&gt;, seeing as the book first appears in ), a small group of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; decided to break away from their brethren and live independently. They looked for a new location to settle, and found Lake Fjalding after migrating some distance south. Construction began, and after roughly a month, the new Mead Hall was completed, also serving as a hunting lodge.\nDespite the great achievement, the settlers' celebrations were short-lived. The construction of the Mead Hall had awakened an ancient creature which had lain dormant beneath the ice nearby. Its name was &lt;a href=\"the%20Udyrfrykte\"&gt;the Udyrfrykte&lt;/a&gt;, and it wrought death upon the settlers at Lake Fjalding in revenge for disturbing its sleep, reducing their numbers by half. A sorcerer managed to drive the Udyrfrykte back to its lair, sparing them from further carnage, but not destroying the beast.\nAfter peace had returned, tensions grew over who would be the Mead Hall's new leader. Many settlers believed &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%20the%20Red\"&gt;Hrothmund the Red&lt;/a&gt; to be the most worthy candidate, but &lt;a href=\"Drengr%20Bronze-Helm\"&gt;Drengr Bronze-Helm&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, stating himself superior to Hrothmund. They fought a duel to resolve their differences, which ended when Hrothmund beheaded Drengr Bronze-Helm where he stood. His battle-prowess earned Hrothmund the title of the Mead Hall's first chieftain. To serve as a reminder, Drengr Bronze-Helm's head was placed on a pedestal in the middle of the Hall for all to see.\nThis set a tradition that every new leader of the Mead Hall follows. After receiving the consent of Hrothmund the Red's spirit in &lt;a href=\"Hrothmund%27s%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hrothmund's Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, they display their most prized battle trophy on the pedestal within Thirsk Mead Hall.\nMany years later, a fire on the lake freed the Udyrfrykte and it again massacred the residents of the hall. The sole survivor, &lt;a href=\"Svenja%20Snow-Song\"&gt;Svenja Snow-Song&lt;/a&gt;, asked the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down and destroy the beast once and for all; offering leadership of the hall in return.\nFourth Era.\nThe warriors of Thirsk bought mead from Skyrim and had it shipped over by the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;. After the prices began to rise, they started to brew their own mead.\nSometime before &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the hall was overrun by &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;rieklings&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;their chief&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bujold%20the%20Unworthy\"&gt;Bujold&lt;/a&gt; and the other warriors fled the hall and headed down the hill. They, then, set camp along the beach, while the rieklings took over the hall.\nLater, during the events of , the Last Dragonborn visits the hall and could either help &lt;a href=\"The%20Chief%20of%20Thirsk%20Hall\"&gt;the chief of the Rieklings&lt;/a&gt; by killing Bujold and her warriors, or accompany Nords as they &lt;a href=\"Retaking%20Thirsk\"&gt;retake Thirsk&lt;/a&gt; Mead Hall.\nInterior.\nWhen the Hall is overrun with Rieklings, the interior is a mess. Tables and chairs are overturned, and the skulls and painted bones characteristic of Riekling lairs litter the place. A throne sits at the far back of the hall, where the chief sits.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; undertakes the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Retaking%20Thirsk\"&gt;Retaking Thirsk&lt;/a&gt;,\" after the Rieklings have been eradicated, the Hall is refurnished. New wall hangings, lighting, &lt;a href=\"barrels\"&gt;barrels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20Place\"&gt;cooking fires&lt;/a&gt; and furnishings are added, and new sleeping quarters are installed at the back. The improved lighting shows off the Nordic woodwork and architecture. The mead bottles and drinking vessels that adorn the tables are, in many places, knocked over and many of them litter the floor. If the Dragonborn undertakes quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chief%20of%20Thirsk%20Hall\"&gt;The Chief of Thirsk Hall&lt;/a&gt;,\" or does not undertake either quest, the Hall remains as it was when the Dragonborn first encountered it.\nQuests.\nSide quests.\nThe two quests are opposed: if the Dragonborn completes one of them, the other is automatically failed.\nMiscellaneous quests.\nThe following miscellaneous quests become available after the quest \"Retaking Thirsk.\"\nCharacters.\nAfter completing \"Retaking Thirsk\" the former members of Thirsk Mead Hall will move back in.\nEnemies.\nThe quest \"Retaking Thirsk\" involves the slaying of a band of rieklings that have taken over the Hall, including their chief. These Rieklings are not hostile before undertaking the quest. After completing said quest, the Hall will occasionally be attacked again by a group of Rieklings."}

Speaking to him after investigating &lt;a href=\"Hroggar\"&gt;Hroggar&lt;/a&gt;'s house will take \"Laid to Rest\" to the next step. Following the quest line will reveal Laelette was turned into a vampire by &lt;a href=\"Alva\"&gt;Alva&lt;/a&gt;, a woman who was turned into a vampire by &lt;a href=\"Movarth%20Piquine\"&gt;Movarth&lt;/a&gt;. Alva seduced Hroggar, a widower whose wife and child, &lt;a href=\"Helgi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Helgi&lt;/a&gt;, were victims of a house fire. Laelette attempted to turn Helgi but failed, and Helgi was left to burn in the house.\nAfter Laelette dies, Thonnir denies that Alva could have turned her, stating that Lalette must have \"met her fate out in the marsh.\" Towards the end of \"Laid to Rest\" Thonnir will aid the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; in killing the master vampire while the rest of his companions will cower away.\nIf the Dragonborn asks Thonnir to aid on the quest, but does not complete it, Thonnir will join the Dragonborn as an immortal helper.

The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Thormar%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Thormar&lt;/a&gt; had occurred on the outskirts of Thormar and had lasted for a day, in the victorious hands of the Wood Elves.

The city of Thorn is located very close to the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; border and more so, to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, the center of the &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; trade in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Thorn is located near the Black Marsh - Morrowind border, next to the metropolis of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, the center of the Great House Dres, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; market. This makes Thorn, a target to the Dres Slavers since it is a heavily populated Argonian city. Thorn itself, is situated on the northeastern coast and was once an area populated by the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, a sub-section of &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Elves\"&gt;Heartland Elves&lt;/a&gt; that live very primitive lifestyles. This territory stretched across the border and coastal areas, from as far as &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;, to even far away &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;. The name of Thorn likely comes from the region it inhabits, the &lt;a href=\"Thornmarsh\"&gt;Thornmarsh&lt;/a&gt; region.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Barsaebic Ayleids' migration into Black Marsh.\nBefore the Argonian city of Thorn, the general area of Thorn, as well as the Eastern Black Marsh coast was once territory occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, a sub-section of &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Elves\"&gt;Heartland Elves&lt;/a&gt; that lived very primitive lifestyles. This region is said to reach as far as Archon to Gideon, from &lt;a href=\"Arnesia\"&gt;Arnesia&lt;/a&gt; to Stormhold. These Ayleids were originally from the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, before being driven out by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; worshiping Ayleids, the ones that people commonly known as Ayleids. Eventually, these Ayleids vanished either through deadly diseases from the Deep swamps or like other surviving Ayleids in the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, were likely integrated into the Elven culture of the north. As time went on, these settlements would become populated by Argonians; this included Thorn.\nThe Raid of Thorn &amp; the Founding of House Dres.\nThe city of Thorn was well-established, long before the rise of House Dres as a Great House, in fact, Thorn was what paved the way to have Dres became a Great House, amidst &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. What made Dres the superpower it is today is because of a slave-raid made on the denizens of Thorn that was led by &lt;a href=\"Thalthil%20Dres\"&gt;Thalthil Dres&lt;/a&gt;. Not much is known about the raid on Thorn, however, according to the paintings depicting the event, it was heartbreaking and abhorrent to watch. If more info was to appear, then the Raid of Thorn could be considered one of Morrowind's greatest atrocities.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeita-Meen's Rebellion &amp; Glathis' Demise.\nThe region of Thornmarsh was under the control of the Great House Dres, situated in the city of Thorn. The leader of the Dres Council in Thorn was a mer named &lt;a href=\"Glathis%20Dres\"&gt;Glathis Dres&lt;/a&gt;, a possible descendant of Thalthil, the Bane of Thorn. It was here, one of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest warriors would be subjugated by the Dres Slavers. &lt;a href=\"Heita-Meen\"&gt;Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, several other Argonians escaped the &lt;a href=\"Saltrice\"&gt;Saltrice&lt;/a&gt; fields and into the depths of Thornmarsh. There they uncovered a village occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt;s, a group of Argonians that support the foreign influence the Marsh was subjugated to in the past. The &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; in the village, spoke to Heita-Meen as she and her followers were taken back to Thorn. She was to be executed by Glathis Dres, until the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; were called to arms by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;i of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; invaded Morrowind and the Northern world.\nHeita-Meen &amp; the Shellbacks; the Ebonheart Pact.\nHeita-Meen killed Dres before he could whip her a second time. Meen would then challenge the Centurion of the Archeins for her position, the battle was brief, and Meen would become the leader of an Argonian militia consisting of Archeins and Slaves. She would then travel to &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; with an Argonian Pyromancer named &lt;a href=\"Walks-in-Ash\"&gt;Walks-in-Ash&lt;/a&gt; and joined with the &lt;a href=\"Shellbacks\"&gt;Shellbacks&lt;/a&gt;, an elite army of Stormhold. This grand army of Argonians traveled north to the region of &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and joined the fight with the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; was fierce, but in the end, the army prevailed. This combined force proved to be very powerful, managing to defeat a strong force from the realms of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. These three factions would band together to form the first iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; with Heita-Meen becoming a high-ranking member of the Army.\nOf course, there was a lot of controversy between the alliance with Black Marsh and Morrowind, two provinces with very graphic history coinciding with each other. Because of this, many regions in Black Marsh, as well as Morrowind, would not become a part of the Ebonheart Pact. The areas that joined the alliance was the regions of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, Thornmarsh, and &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are connected to the border. Stronger cities such as &lt;a href=\"Helstrom\"&gt;Helstrom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt; were not a part of the alliance, only the cities of Stormhold, Thorn, and &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fall of Thorn &amp; Avumar's Endeavor.\nThroughout the years, there have been many foolish souls that tried to enter the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, the hellish plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; belonging to &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Revolution and Change. One of the people that tried to enter the realm was a &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Avumar\"&gt;Avumar&lt;/a&gt;. Avumar would be the only one to succeed in this endeavor. Since creating a rift causes the flames of the Deadland to come out, she would have to develop a way to quench them before, speaking to a &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;. Avumar used an earthen vessel to convert the deadly flames into steam, once her boiler reached a certain temperature, she was able to speak to a Dremora. However, she would make a very grave decision. She hastily accepted the Dremora's contract which caused the city of Thorn to burn to the ground, making her a casualty in the wake of the flames. She would be the last one to make this attempt, at least until the last year of the Third Era, where an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; wizard named &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; would contact Mehrunes Dagon and begin the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThorn during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Thorn in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Thorn was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Tibus\"&gt;King Tibus&lt;/a&gt;."}

Not one conjured from sleep or stupor, but sight and sense. I now hold in my possession a lump of amber shaped like the Mad God himself. When I placed my hand upon it for the very first time, I stepped into the world of Mania. My mind was truly clear and my eyes forever open. \nBut as all dreams come to pass, so too did my time in Bliss. With a single step I found myself back in the wilderness, far away from my lovely Mania. Gone were the golden hills, luminous stalks and whimsical fragrances, and in its place the stink of flora and fools unbothered by the gloom.\nI have set about making a connection with the artifact once more, and to the wonderous land it has revealed to me.\n4th of First Seed, 4E 200\nCurses!\nAfter two days of constant focus, I finally connected with Mania once more. Or, it may be more accurate to say that Mania connected with me, in this secluded camp near Solitude. A powerful daedra took shape before my eyes: a Golden Saint, with armor gleaming and eyes burning with surprise and fury. To my dismay, my ordinary methods of bending daedra to my will were of no use. As it began to raise its weapon against me, I fled.\nWhatever power was left in the amber, it lies dormant now. I must find other artifacts like it, and through their magic forge a connection to the world I lost."}

I am sure to be undisturbed here while I continue my work.\nIt pains me to work with these bandit imbeciles, with their heads made of cheese. Or was it brains made of yogurt? I suppose the distinction is irrelevant. They are clumps of aged dairy, left out in the sun. Each one far too stupid to know the worth of their plunder, and for that reason they themselves are given worth.\nMuch as our Lord would do, I have split them into two groups to cover the caravan trade routes therein. The armors I've collected from these tunnels will serve some use here. Perhaps I will make it a competition. The group that retrieves the most artifacts will be rewarded with a bar of soap.\n28th of Rain's Hand, 4E 201\nThe more artifacts I gather, the more in tune with our Lord I become. I can feel his wisdom coursing through me, informing my every move. Yet there is something lacking, as nothing I have retrieved thus far has allowed me to return to my blessed Mania. I have even turned to using tokens from Dementia out of desperation.\nWith every failed attempt, my patience continues to thin. I may need to strangle a bandit or two or twenty to calm my frazzled nerves.\n15th of Midyear, 4E 201\nOur Lord Sheogorath must be pleased. Very, very pleased. This new artifact is a truly remarkable find. Yes, truly, truly remarkable. To think that it was nearly dismissed as an ordinary claymore, when it was in fact the Sword of Jyggalag, the weapon wielded by the Prince of Order. \nIt's the craftsmanship that betrays its truth. Perfect symmetry on both sides, its angles matching ten numerals beyond the decimal. Perhaps twenty, or even forty numerals. I will make an effort to count them tonight.\nYet its true power is held in its enchantment. For when I look upon its crystal edge, I see more than my reflection. I begin to see time the way a cloud sees the river. It has a beginning and an end, but they exist in concert. The past, present, and future flow as one.\nI spoke to a cloud the next day, and it confirmed this to be true. Through the sword's visions, I know what is to come. The sewers beneath the city is where the path will open. The sword will serve as the bridge.\n22nd of Midyear, 4E 201\nThe Sword of Jyggalag reveals much beyond my intent. It has a logic that seems familiar, but at the same time repels me. It desires Mania as I do, but its goal is that of destruction. \nWorse yet, our Lord's voice feels distant, muted even. I find my thoughts being short, and my words moreso. \n30th of Midyear, 4E 201\nI need to keep my writings separated. I am beginning to suspect my journals are speaking to each other. No, not suspect. I have proof. \nBut I can't write it here, lest my future self speak more lies. Each thought, past and present, must remain pure."}

A long march through the gray. Crackle of boots, pressed on misshapen throats. In the fog, a whistle, marking time.\nThe sword is planted in the earth. Chaos screams, bleeds. Through its heart, roots are nourished. From the wound, a tree blooms. A path opens.\n1st of Last Seed, 4E 201\nScar tissue hardens, roots thicken. The wound bleeds, but the path is blocked. A fish swimming upstream. \nPerhaps the path is not for me. The path is for it. The river must flow from source to mouth, to fill the mind's cup. \n16th of Last Seed, 4E 201\nTemporary hearing loss. Bread, baking in a hearth. We reach out and grasp the abyss, only to let go. Face first into the mud with gritted teeth. Light bending through a glass eye. How easily we are lost! Revelations soaring on red wings above the dark. Rain running down the side of every window pane.\nI will not go manic.\nI will bring Mania to me."}

This first generation analysis model factotum specializes in counting births and deaths, tracking residents and registered visitors, and recording illnesses, wealth, and social factors necessary to predict trends in the settlement.

This factotum could take the data collected by the analyst and use that information to make accurate predictions concerning the wants and needs of the citizens. In this way, Sotha Sil could anticipate the needs of his guests and satisfy them before they ever realized they had any outstanding wants to gratify.\nDuring the process, however, a flaw developed in the prognostication model's sequential analytical processor assembly. The predictions it provided regarding certain individuals went far beyond mere statistical analysis and ventured into the realm of actual prophecy. This flaw was first noticed after the Magus himself tinkered with the mechanism, so we cannot be certain that this was not what Sotha Sil intended. But the Master has vanished again. I shall store the prognostication factotum in the valley outside the Brass Fortress and lock this prophetic mode with the pass phrase:\n\"Prime sequence eleven, thirteen, seventeen.\"\nThat should keep unauthorized prophesying to a minimum until the Master returns and I can ask for guidance regarding his intentions."}

{"id": "2771", "revid": "4984687", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2771", "title": "Thras", "text": "Thras, also known as the Coral Kingdom, or the Coral Kingdom of Thras, is a partially-submerged archipelago in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt; that has been a powerful, antagonizing power against the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; since before recorded time. The &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; may at one time have even called Summerset part of Thras. For millennia, the hulking, slug like creatures, notorious for their &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; mastery, terrorized the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, conjuring sea monsters along the coast and laying siege to &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;. But for all of the attacks, horror, and devastation coming from Thras, very little is known about the land itself.\nGeography.\nThras has a very moist climate. The Sload live in both the waters and islands of Thras, growing in the water during their youth before moving onto the land when they mature.\nThe first maps that were made by cartographers, who sailed to Thras and lived to tell the tale, show a group of sixteen islands in a semicircle, like a partially submerged coral atoll. Over the centuries, other maps have been charted by spies and the number and size of the islands have varied, suggesting that the amphibious Sload have a volatile kingdom which fluctuates in land mass, either by the tides or some other, less natural means.\nThras is found southwest of the Chain and near Summerset, in the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Sea\"&gt;Cursed Sea&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Pearls\"&gt;Sea of Pearls&lt;/a&gt;. The largest of the islands, &lt;a href=\"Agonio\"&gt;Agonio&lt;/a&gt;, seems the most stable, though later maps show it considerably larger than earlier maps. Thras is much too small to be considered a continent on its own, and is not part of Tamriel in any kind of political or cultural way. Descriptions of the Sea of Pearls place it in the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Pankor\"&gt;Pankor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Systres\"&gt;The Systres&lt;/a&gt;, but whether these islands are considered part of Thras or not is not stated.\nThe true and permanent aspect of Thras, however, is not something mapmakers would know merely by looking at the land above the surface. Many Altmer\u00a0have been captured by the Sload, but a few were able to escape to tell of the brackish lagoon in the center of the island chain. There, the buoyant creatures move about with relative quickness and grace through an intricate network of coral formations and ancient shipwrecks.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nMuch like the beastfolk being the aboriginals of Tamriel since the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;early Merethic&lt;/a&gt;, the Sload are the tribe of beastmen native to Thras. The Sload of Thras may have been original inhabitants of Summerset as well, as the oldest of all the ruins there are made of coral, thought to have been carried a great many miles away from the sea. The material and the style of the ruins strongly suggest that the Sload may have once counted Summerset as a part of their kingdom of Thras.\nThe Sload used necromantic magic and infernal machines to attack the Altmer since before recorded time, conjuring sea monsters along the coasts and capturing many Altmer, though they have never succeeded in reclaiming Summerset. During the first of the Altmeri &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Manifest%20Metaphors\"&gt;formwars&lt;/a&gt;, some Altmer took on aquatic forms to become dreughs and sieged the necromantic \"meatmerchants\" of Thras back into their misdesigned corals sandboxes. An unnamed ship of Topal's fleet travelled north-west Summerset, towards Thras and Yokuda. It is thought that this ship and Pasquiniel may have perished at the hands of the ancient Sload, as they did not return.\nThe first maps from cartographers who sailed to Thras and returned to tell the tale showed a group of sixteen islands, and over the centuries other maps with a different number of islands and layouts have been charted by spies, suggesting that the region is a fluctuates its landmass. Agonio has been shown to be getting bigger as the years go by. The sload visited horrors upon Summerset during the Sack of Skywatch in &lt;a href=\"1E%201301\"&gt;1E 1301&lt;/a&gt;, capturing some Altmer to bring them back to Thras. The few Altmer that escape mention being kept in a lagoon at the center.\nThrassian Plague and Fall of the Sload.\nThe Sload unleashed the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2200, which decimated more than half of Tamriel's population, particularly the western coastlands closest to Thras. In an event known as the Fall of the Sload, Bendu Olo, the Baron-Admiral of the All Flags Navy, led the largest allied naval force in Tamrielic history to Thras, slaughtered all the Sload they could find, and sunk their coral kingdoms into the sea with great unknown magicks. While it's unknown when the disease fully subsided, cases of the Thrassian Plague were still being reported near &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; over four hundred years after its initial outbreak. The effects of the Plague and the Fall were very impactful; Olo was thereafter known as the \"dealer of swift justice\" to the Foul Spot of Thras, and the glory of the Cyrodilic people became known throughout the world. Elsweyr was reduced from 16 down to 2 kingdoms, Valenwood later fell to the Empire from being weakened by the plague, and Hammerfell was on friendlier terms with its neigbours, all as a result of the Fall.\nPost-Sinking and Rise.\nThe Sload were long presumed extinct after the Fall. They recovered by the end of the era, and waged the War of the Uvichil from &lt;a href=\"1E%202911\"&gt;1E 2911&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1E%202917\"&gt;1E 2917&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as one of the most terrible events in Tamriel's history.\nBy &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, Thras was considered a \"free\" or \"wild region\" by the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and it was reported that it had risen again. Imperial authorities encouraged citizens to report the existence its masters, the Sload, if seen in the various areas of Tamriel. The Sload &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt; resided on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20N%27Gasta\"&gt;an island&lt;/a&gt; west of Stros M'Kai at this time.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;, maps of lands beyond Tamriel, including Thras, could be seen in the Map Room of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;. By the waning years of the Third Era, from &lt;a href=\"3E%20402\"&gt;3E 402&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, the western seas were very quiet and &lt;a href=\"Agonio\"&gt;Agonio&lt;/a&gt; had become considerably great in size, giving hope to Tamriel that the Sload had retreated back to Thras for good.\nCulture.\nAll their heroic myths from Thras are about individuals who \"sit around and think for years\" on end, consulting cautiously with wise Sload, until finally they act with deliberation, always successfully. All their mythic villains act quickly, and always fail. Though a godless people, the Sload Priests commune with the God of Worms following the Warp in the West.\nThe Sload sacrifice victims atop the Pillar of Thras, where some are killed by the fall, while some vanish before being dashed on the rocks. The sload do not seem certain why some were taken and some died, or even care regardless. When mummifying corpses in Thras, a higher amount of salt is needed for them to be saturated due to the region's moisture. It is uncertain whether Sload only practice Necromancy on other races in Thras, like they do in Tamriel, or if they practice it on each other in their homeland.\nTransportation.\nYounger adults lack essential surface survival skills, and are rarely seen on land. All land-traveling Sload know the Recall spell, and use it casually and frequently as the default mode of travel around Thras. Sload floaters are a type of &lt;a href=\"Airships\"&gt;airship&lt;/a&gt; that run off a type of intestinal gasbags for mass transit across Thras, along with carrying slaves from &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; and corpses from &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;. Abecean sailors commonly have sload-clusters barnacled to their ships, and beat sloadbags so that the \"Thras gas\" can steer them farther. The buoyant native creatures may move about with relative quickness and grace in the brackish lagoon at the center of the island chain, through an intricate network of coral formations and ancient shipwrecks.\nEnvironment.\nThe Sload are native to Thras. They are known to conjure \"sea monsters\" to attack Summerset."}

It is seen as the most effective of the many attacks of its population, the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, on Tamriel.\nThe exact time of occurrence is unclear, as the sources contradict each other. While some sources date it to the year of &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, others name the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202260\"&gt;1E 2260&lt;/a&gt;, maybe simply being more accurate about the date.\nSymptoms.\n&lt;a href=\"Kinlord%20Nemfarion\"&gt;Kinlord Nemfarion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Corgrad%20Wastes\"&gt;Corgrad Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, a survivor of the Thrassian Plague, described its symptoms in :\n\"It was ever present, ever penetrating. It seeped into every person, every creature, every drop of water, seeking to be quenched. The afflicted drank themselves to corpulence with each passing day, until their bones cracked under their bulging flesh.\"\nThe plague caused those afflicted to drink until vomiting. Such was the disfigurement it caused that the sick in Corgrad barely passed for Mer by the time they died.\nImpact.\nThe impact on Tamriel's population was devastating: More than half of the continent's population are believed to have died from the Thrassian Plague, the western coastline closest to the island of Thras being particularly affected. Also more than half of the population of &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; was lost to the plague.\nIt had also political consequences: The plague weakened the population of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; so much that it subsequently fell to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;. For the province of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, it was also the beginning of the road which finally led them under the control of the Empire, as the plague destabilized the delicate balance of different tribes. It also diminished the importance of the previously powerful city of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nAccused of being the source of this plague, the Thrassians were subsequently defeated by the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;.

I know there's no honor among thieves, and there never was, but there used to be some pride, some skill, some basic creativity. It really makes those of us with a sense of history despair.\"\nImalayn sneered, slamming down his flagon of greef violently on the rough-hewn table. \"B'vek, what do you want us to say? You asks us 'What do you do when you see a guard?' and I says 'Stab the fetcher in the back.' What d'you prefer? We challenge 'em to a game of chits?\"\n\"So much ambition, so little education,\" said Lledos with a sigh. \"My dear friends, we aren't mugging some Nord tourist fresh off the ferry. The Cobblers Guildhall may not sound intimidating but tonight, when the dues collection is housed there before being sent to the bank, the security's going to be tighter than a &lt;a href=\"kwama\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt;'s ass. You can't just stab at every back you encounter and expect to make it to the vaults.\"\n\"Why don't you explain specifically what you'd like us to do?\" asked Galsiah calmly, trying to keep the tone of the group down. Most locals at the &lt;a href=\"Plot%20and%20Plaster\"&gt;Plot and Plaster&lt;/a&gt; cornerclub in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; knew enough not to listen in, but she knew better than to take any chances.\n\"The common thief,\" said Lledos, pouring himself more greef, warming to his subject. \"Sticks his dagger in his opponent's back. This may slay the target, but more often gives him time to scream and drench the attacker with blood. Not good. Now a good throat-slashing, properly excecuted, can both slay and silence a guard and leave the thief relatively bloodfree. And after all, after the robbery, we don't want people seeing a bunch of blood-soaked butchers running through the streets. Even in Tel Aruhn, that's likely to warrant suspicion.\"\n\"If you can catch your victim lying asleep or resting, you are in an excellent position. You place one hand over the mouth with your thumb over his chin, then you use your other hand to slit the throat, and quickly turn the head to one side so the body bleeds out away from you. There is a risk here of becoming blood stained if you don't move quickly enough. If you're unsure, strangle the victim first to avoid the blood that tends to spurt out in three foot jets when someone is stabbed while alive.\"\n\"A very good friend of mine, a thief in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; whose name I won't mention, swears by the strangle-and-slash technique. Simply put, you grab your victim's throat from behind and while throttling him, you batter his face againt the opposite wall. When the victim is thus rendered unconscious, you slash his throat while still holding him from behind, and the risk of staining one's clothes with blood is practically nonexistant.\"\n\"The classic technique, which requires less grappling than my friend's variation, is to place one hand over the victim's mouth, and then saw through the throat in three or four strokes rather like playing a violin. It requires little effort, and while there's quite a lot of blood, it all jets forward away from you.\"\n\"There's no reason when one knows one is going to be slitting some throats not to take some precautions and bring some extra equipment. The best neck-hackers I know generally carry a bit of wadded cloth on the aft-side of their knives to keep blood from getting on their cuffs. It's impractical for this sort of assignment, but when you're only anticipating one or two victims, nothing beats throwing a sack over the targets head, drawing the string tight, and then supplying the killing blow or blows.\"\nImalyn laughed loudly, \"Can I see a demonstration sometime?\"\n\"Very soon,\" said Lledos. \"If Galsiah has done her job.\"\nGalsiah brought out the map of the guildhouse, freshly stolen, and they began to detail out the strategy.\nThe last several hours had been a whirlwind to all. In less than a day, the three had met, formulated a plan, bought or stolen the necessary ingredients, and were about to execute it. Not one of the three were sure whether confidence or stupidity were driving the other two, but the fates were aligned. The guildhouse was going to be robbed.\nWhen the sun set, Lledos, Galsiah, and Imalyn approached the Cobblers Guildhouse on the east end of town. Galsiah used her cachous of &lt;a href=\"stoneflower\"&gt;stoneflower&lt;/a&gt; to mask their scent from the guard wolves as the three passed over the parapets. She also acted as lead scout, and Lledos was impressed. For someone of relative inexperience, she knew her way through shadows.\nLledos's expertise was demonstrated a dozen times, and the guards were of such a diverse variety, he was able to demonstrate all the means of silent assassination he had developed over the years.\nImalyn opened the vault in his unique and systematic method. As the tumblers fell beneath his fingers, he softly sang an old dirty tavern song about the Ninety-Nine Loves of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. He said it helped him focus and organize difficult combinations. Within seconds, the vault was open and the gold was in hand.\nThey left the guildhouse an hour after they entered. No alarm had been raised, the gold was gone, and corpses lay pooling blood on the stone floors within.\n\"Well done, my friends, well done. You learned well.\" Lledos said as he poured the gold pieces into the specially designed compartments in his tunic's sleeves, where they held fast with no jingling or unusual bulges. \"We'll meet back at the Plot and Plaster tomorrow morning and split up the bounty.\"\nThe group parted ways. The only person who knew the most covert route through the city's sewer systems, Lledos, slipped in through a duct and vanished below. Galsiah threw on her shawl, muddied her face to resemble an old f'lah fortune-teller, and headed north. Imalyn headed east into the park, trusting his unnatural senses to keep him away from the city watch.\nNow I teach them the greatest lesson of all, thought Lledos as he sloshed through the labrinthine tunnels of sludge. His &lt;a href=\"guar\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; was waiting where he left it at the city gates, making a laconic lunch of the &lt;a href=\"chokeweed\"&gt;chokeweed&lt;/a&gt; shrub to which it had been leashed.\nOn the road to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, he thought of Galsiah and Imalyn. Perhaps they had been caught and brought in for questioning already. It was a pity he couldn't see them undergoing interrogation. Who would break under the pressure first? Imalyn was certainly the tougher of the two, but Galsiah doubtless had hidden reserves. It was merely intellectual curiosity: they thought his name was Lledos and he was meeting them at the Plot and Plaster. The authorities wouldn't therefore be looking for a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named Sathis celebrating his wealth miles and miles away in Vivec.\nAs he prodded his mount orward and the sun began rising, Sathis pictured Galsiah and Imalyn not undergoing interrogation, but sleeping the good sleep of the wicked, dreaming of how they would spend their share of the gold. Both would wake up early and rush to the Plot and Plaster. He could see them now, Imalyn laughing and carrying on, Galsiah hushing him to avoid bringing undue attention. They would take a couple flagons of grief, perhaps order a meal\u2014a big one\u2014and wait. Hours would pass and so would their moods. The chain of reactions that every betrayed person exhibits: nervousness, doubt, bewilderment, anger.\nThe sun was fully risen when Sathis reached the stables of his house on the outskirts of Vivec. He reigned in his guar and filled its feed. The rest of the stalls were empty. It wouldn't be until that afternoon when his servants returned from the east of St &lt;a href=\"Rilms\"&gt;Rilms&lt;/a&gt; in Gnisis. They were good people, and he treated them well but from past experiences he knew that servants talked. If they began to connect his absences with thefts in other towns, it was only a matter of time before they would go to the authorities or blackmail him. After all, they were human. It was best in the long run to give them a week off with pay whenever he was out of town on business.\nHe slipped the gold into the vault in his study, and went upstairs. The schedule had been tight, but Sathis had given himself a few hours to rest before his household returned. His own bed was wonderfully soft and warm compared to the dreadful mattress he had to use at the canton in Tel Aruhn.\nSathis woke up some time later from a nightmare. For a second after he opened his eyes, he thought he could still hear Imalyn's voice nearby, singing the Ninety-Nine Loves of Boethiah. He lay still in his bed, waiting, but there was no sound except the usual creaks and groans of his old house. Afternoon sunlight came through his bedroom window in ribbons, catching dust. He closed his eyes.\nThe song returned, and Sathis heard the vault door in his study swing open. The smell of stoneflower filled his nose as he opened his eyes. Only a little of the afternoon sunlight could pierce the inside of the burlap sack.\nA strong, feminine hand clamped over the mouth and a thumb jabbed under his chin. Just as his throat opened and his head was shoved to one side, he heard Galsiah in her typical calm voice, \"Thanks you for the lesson, Sathis.\""}

The Throat of the World is the highest peak in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Throat of the World is the highest peak in all of Tamriel, rivaling the likes of Red Mountain in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The Throat of the World is situated on the eastern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, though it is accessible through &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Along the mountain is a path that spirals all the way up to the summit, beginning at the village of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, near &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Geir\"&gt;Lake Geir&lt;/a&gt;. People from all over Skyrim travel to Ivarstead to begin a pilgrimage following the path. The path, called &lt;a href=\"the%20Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;the Seven Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt;, will eventually take the pilgrim to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient monastery that houses &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, who practice the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;. Very few have traveled to High Hrothgar, considering the harsh weather. Only adventurers and locals that feed the Greybeards have been to High Hrothgar. Beyond the monastery, there is another path that leads to the summit. However, it is inaccessible, due to the harsh snowstorms that blow along the path. Legend has it that on the top of the Throat of the World is the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt;, a ripple in time that has been there since the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Throat of the World has held an abundant amount of significance to the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim. According to legend, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;the sky&lt;/a&gt; exhaled from the mountain onto the land, creating modern-day &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt;. This legend has the Nords believe that Skyrim was their original home and that leaving &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; from the far north was meant to happen. Beyond that, the Throat of the World referred to as the Snow-Tower, is one of &lt;a href=\"the%20Towers\"&gt;the Towers&lt;/a&gt;, a metaphysical concept relating to the foundation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. The Snow-Tower is not a literal tower; it is an actual mountain. The Towers refer to various structures that are tower-esque (i.e., &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Green-Sap\"&gt;Green-Sap&lt;/a&gt;).\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; migrated to the province of Skyrim where they would be revered as god-kings by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragons would live as royalty as the Dragon Cult governed the land. They were given power in exchange for undying loyalty. The Nordic people were subjugated as slaves by the Dragon Cult. Of the Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; was the leader. Feeling pity for the Nords, &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; had begun teaching the Nords the power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this point the Nords toppled the Dragon Cult and began the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, with Alduin's forces facing Paarthurnax's rebellion. The War had reached its climax at the summit of the Throat of the World, where three companions, &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; had fought Alduin. The battle was relentless, and Alduin was unstoppable. In a last-ditch effort, the three warriors used the power of &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; to bring Alduin to the ground. Felldir used an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; to send Alduin forward in time. It was that spot where the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt; was created. Paarthurnax remained atop the summit, meditating and waiting for Alduin's return.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic forces under &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; were utterly defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; when the Voice had failed them. One of the few veterans of the conflict was &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, who reflected on the loss of not only Morrowind, but the philosophy of the Voice. After the event, Jurgen traveled to Throat of the World to begin his seven-year meditation, on how the Voice could fail them. He began to realize that the Voice should be used to worship and honor the Gods, as a way of attaining enlightenment. It was at the Throat of the World where Jurgen Windcaller created the monastery of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, followers of his path.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; was sacked by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; swept across northeastern Tamriel. The newly crowned High King, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Throat of the World to meet with the Greybeards, seeking their help against the Akaviri invasion force. Instead of helping outright, the Greybeards summoned &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth%20the%20Ash-King\"&gt;Wulfharth the Ash-King&lt;/a&gt;. Wulfharth would travel with Jorunn to &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, where they amassed a grand army of angry Nords who were inspired by Wulfharth's presence. The army of Nords followed the Akaviri to &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, where Wulfharth would meet &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, who had defeated Wulfharth years ago. Both fought alongside each other, driving the Akaviri out of Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; ended with the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; had revealed themselves to the Greybeards when they defeated the Dragon &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;. By the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Balgruuf\"&gt;Jarl Balgruuf&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn traveled to the base of the Throat of the World, where they meditated on the Etched Tablets and met the Greybeards, led by &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;. It was here; the Dragonborn became something of a disciple of the Way of the Voice. When the time came to meet with Paarthurnax, the Dragonborn continued scaling the Throat of the World, where they arrived on the summit and spoke with Paarthurnax. By order of Paarthurnax, the Dragonborn retrieved the Elder Scroll that Felldir used from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn entered the &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt; and learned Dragonrend, being able to defeat Alduin."}

When Alduin reappeared at the summit in the Fourth Era, he began to resurrect fallen dragons and started the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the summit to ask Paarthurnax for a means by which to defeat Alduin. This led the Dragonborn to obtain an Elder Scroll from an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;.

Subsequently, Alduin was drawn to the site. Together with Paarthurnax, the Dragonborn bested Alduin in battle. The black dragon Alduin fled to &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; and opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, afterlife of the Nords, where ultimately the battle between Alduin and the Dragonborn takes place.\nTiber Septim.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, then known as Hjalti Early-Beard, was summoned to the Throat of the World by the Greybeards after his victory over the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimbing the mountain.\nMost of the enemies who reside on the path to the mountain are &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;.

After the End of Harvest festival that year, Tharn asked the council for relieve of his duties, secretly to plan his coup of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;throne&lt;/a&gt;, claiming he wished to study other circles of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. He then advocated his apprentice, Ria Silmane, to resume his duties as Imperial Battlemage of the Empire, and head of the Elder Council. The council fully approved.\nJagar Tharn returned, and usurped all Imperial power in &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt;. Silmane attempted to warn the Elder Council of his treachery. Before she could, however, Tharn used the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed her corporeal form.\nUsing her powers as a sorceress, she fought the pull of the afterlife. She instead appeared to the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dungeons\"&gt;Imperial sewers&lt;/a&gt;, as an incorporeal spirit. She would have gone to the Elder Council instead, but that would have taken far too much of her energy to appear to so many.\nShe told the Champion of Tharn's betrayal. She then used magic to connect herself to them, so that she may appear in their dreams, and freed them from the cell\u2014setting them free to obtain the eight shattered pieces of the Staff of Chaos.\nThe more she used her powers after that, the shorter she could remain in the world, so every encounter with the Champion became shorter and shorter. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal Champion finally obtained all eight pieces of the Staff of Chaos. Ria Silmane then sacrificed what little energy she had left to cast an Illusion spell, changing the Champion's appearance so they may infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial palace&lt;/a&gt; undetected.

The Riddle'Thar's rules state that a true cat has to be curious so as to avoid &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;'s machinations, clever to escape life's cruel maze, kind so as to make life liveable for others, pious to reach the &lt;a href=\"Sands%20Behind%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Sands Behind the Stars&lt;/a&gt; and avoid &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt; and wary of the hateful eyes of Lorkhaj and Namiira.

Some of the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; believe that the Rieklings are actually descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; that degenerated, due to their poisoning by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; into a feral state. However, their claims are mostly built off of speculation, as there is no known source of this being true.\nCulture.\nRieklings live in a tribal structure where certain members hold specific tasks such as hunting, scouting or open combat. Strength is highly respected among the tribes, as the strongest of a tribe is typically chosen to lead as chief. The succession of leadership often occurs from a fight to the death, though non-Rieklings may assume the chiefdom as well if they have the support of the tribe and are able to defeat their predecessor.\nRieklings ride on &lt;a href=\"Bristleback\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt;s, large boars which they have seemingly domesticated; most Rieklings have also been seen riding them into battle. Rieklings communicate in their own language, which is spoken in hoots and grunts, though at least one &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;Riekling Chief&lt;/a&gt; was able to speak the common tongue, albeit in a broken turn of phrase.\nRieklings live in small huts in and appear to have rudimentary yet simple crafting skills of making clothing and weapons. They are known to hoard items such as empty bottles, broken armor, etc. As such, some Riekling tribes are known to live in and/or near the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; ruins on Solstheim.\nA few elements of Riekling religion have been mentioned including a ritual known as the Godspeak dance, a fragment of the Godpeak Song, and the construction of shrines. The Godspeak Song goes as follows, \"Hawala faaaakara. Baaaa rakhee kaloo. Pooja kan faroo kee jaa. Goora! Goora! Goora!\" In the \"Dragonborn \"add-on, the Rieklings occupying &lt;a href=\"Frossel\"&gt;Frossel&lt;/a&gt; are observed appearing to worship a crude representation of a horse-drawn carriage. However, no known religious leaders, such as shamans, have been seen. \nBehavior.\nRieklings are generally hostile to the inhabitants of Solstheim as they attack any that come near their settlements. In combat, they use their large numbers to kill their foes, often using ambush techniques against unwary prey. Their main weapon is a spear, which they often throw at their enemies, though they also are known to use lances and swords.\nBecause of the inherent tribal culture, even if a non-Riekling is accepted by one tribe, even becoming their chief, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;' tradition of Blood-Kin, other Riekling tribes will remain hostile, even to their own kind in the friendly tribe."}

They are native to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and tend to live in small tribes in caves, ancient ruins and even mountain peaks. They are hostile in nature, but individually pose a minor threat. They typically rely on strength in numbers and a small group can quickly overwhelm an enemy.\nCulture.\nRiekling society has a tribal structure, with tribal members holding specific occupational positions such as hunters, scouts and warriors. Strength is highly respected: the strongest member of a tribe typically assumes the rank of chief, and succession is often determined by a fight to the death between the incumbent chief and a challenger claiming to be of greater strength. This bears similarities to elements of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; culture, especially that of &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Khazgur%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mor Khazgur&lt;/a&gt;. A non-Riekling may assume the position of chief if they have the support of the tribe, but this is exceptionally rare.\nRiekling settlements give insight into their level of intelligence, which corresponds roughly to a stone age society: they have developed simple tool-crafting and elements of rudimentary language and religion, and have domesticated &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;bristlebacks&lt;/a&gt;, which they raise for food and use as mounts. Characteristics of Riekling religion include the \"Godspeak Song\" and the construction of shrines, but there do not appear to be any shamans or other religious leaders. At least &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;one Riekling&lt;/a&gt; is known to have learned to speak the common tongue.\nThey are known to hoard seemingly random items, from empty bottles and platters to armor and weapons, which they have stolen or scavenged from the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. They also occupy settlements such as halls and mines after driving out or killing the previous inhabitants, and make use of non-Riekling items such as barrels for shelter and storage.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Chief%20of%20Thirsk%20Hall\"&gt;The Chief of Thirsk Hall&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this quest, an intelligent &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;riekling chief&lt;/a&gt; is encountered in &lt;a href=\"Thirsk%20Mead%20Hall%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Thirsk Mead Hall&lt;/a&gt;. He asks the Dragonborn to perform a series of favors that culminates in an attack on the former owners of the mead hall. After completing the quest, the Riekling tribe of Thirsk Mead Hall recognizes the Dragonborn as their leader, and several members will become available as followers. In addition, upon finishing the quest, groups of three Rieklings of any rank may be randomly encountered throughout Solstheim and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; either in the open world or within dungeons, aiding the Dragonborn in combat.\nPotential followers.\nOnce the Dragonborn becomes an honorary Riekling Chief by finishing the above quest, the Rieklings from Thirsk Mead Hall can be recruited as &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;. They can follow basic commands and their inventory can be accessed, but they are still considered pets and therefore may be hired alongside a humanoid follower(s). Thus, they are useful as pack mules, and can be given equipment to be more efficient in battle than other pets such as &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Troll\"&gt;Armored Troll&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dogs&lt;/a&gt; (though they will still not use &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;healing potions&lt;/a&gt;). They are more proficient in &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, but equipped apparel are not visible on their bodies.\nRieklings recruited at Thirsk Mead Hall have different ranks and will appear depending on the level of the Dragonborn. Common Riekling, Scout, Hunter and Warrior can be differentiated by the amount of clothing and facial hair they have. These Rieklings prefer ranged combat and will equip bows and arrows given to them. They will have &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Spear\"&gt;riekling spears&lt;/a&gt; as their default weapon when first recruited, and will resort to unarmed combat if ammo is depleted. With a bow equipped, arrows and spears will be depleted but they will do more damage. When equipped with a single arrow without a bow, they will generate infinite ammo but will not do as much damage as they would with a bow. In battle, they will utilize spear animations, meaning they hold a bow in one hand, and \"throw\" arrows with their other.\nOther Rieklings that show up to aid the Dragonborn in random encounters can be recruited as well; they will wear feathered headdresses regardless of their rank. As followers, they will instead equip Greatswords (also utilizing spear animations while held) and may be able to mitigate damage by blocking attacks.\nCombat.\nRieklings are rarely found alone and tend to rely on superior numbers to overpower foes. They use &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Spear\"&gt;spears&lt;/a&gt; as their primary weapon in both melee and ranged combat.\nSome Rieklings fight while mounted on bristlebacks, which are also used to charge at their foes. They also use ambush tactics to surprise an unsuspecting enemy by bursting out of barrels and other objects used for storage. Despite their small stature, Rieklings are fierce combatants and will rarely retreat from combat.\nNote that since the spears the rieklings throw are technically arrows, any arrows the rieklings acquire may be equipped instead of the spears and thrown at the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nRieklings can be found in the following locations.

Their leader, Orgotha, will tell you that they were attacked by a riekr raiding party. The riekrs kidnapped two of her fellow tribesmen, and a rescue party went after them. Orgotha will suggest that you kill their chief and take his totem. \nHead east to find Murukh, the leader of the rescue party. He will be lying injured among the bodies of dead riekrs. Talk to him and he will tell you his comrades Avreg and Zhasim went into &lt;a href=\"Bonerock%20Cavern\"&gt;Bonerock Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. He would have followed, but one of the riekrs hit him hard on the head. Head for the cavern and proceed inside. Near the entrance, you will find Avreg. He has been bit by one of the riekrs, and will agree to go back to camp. He will ask you to go and help his brother Zhasim and his cat. \nZhasim can be found in the first room; he is actually not an Orc but a Khajiit. His pet cat has run off, so he suggests that you look for the kidnapped hunters while he looks for his cat. Proceed onward to the next room. Here, you will find an old pack that will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Khajiit%27s%20Tale\"&gt;A Khajiit's Tale&lt;/a&gt;\". That quest takes place in the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously. Either way, head deeper into the ruins and to the northeastern room. \nThere, you will find an injured &lt;a href=\"Thereg\"&gt;Thereg&lt;/a&gt;. He will agree to go back to camp, but he will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Zubesha\"&gt;Zubesha&lt;/a&gt; is deeper in the ruins, and that the riekr chief may well do something nasty to her if he is left alive. Proceed westward into the big room, then further west into the throne room. You will hear Zubesha's voice calling for help. Kill the chief, then take the totem. Behind the throne, you will find Zubesha in chains. Free her, then proceed on to the bac exit. Once you are outside, give the totem to Orgotha to finish the quest."}

It has two sublocations, Rielle and Rielle Crypt. It is a faithful reproduction of the interior layout and design of the location previously seen in \"Oblivion\".\nRielle.\nRielle consists of a series of chambers flanked and connected by parallel hallways. There are many dead &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Explorer\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Explorer&lt;/a&gt;s here and the area is patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Wight%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Wights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wight%20Lord\"&gt;Wight Lord&lt;/a&gt;s. On the body of one of the explorers, &lt;a href=\"Janus\"&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt;, is \"&lt;a href=\"Janus%27%20Journal\"&gt;Janus' Journal&lt;/a&gt;\". Reading it starts the new objective to find four Ayleid Elemental Shards. Three of these are in Rielle and the fourth is in Rielle Crypt.\nAfter returning from the crypt, Rielle will be repopulated with &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; fighting explorers and wights. One will have the \"&lt;a href=\"Vigil%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Vigil's Orders&lt;/a&gt;\" on her body, the reading of which is required to advance the quest. There is also a dead &lt;a href=\"Vigil%20Enforcer\"&gt;Vigil Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; slumped against an &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid casket&lt;/a&gt; who carries \"&lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Enforcer%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Vigilant Enforcer's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" on their body.\nRielle Crypt.\nImmediately after entering, a Wight Lord in the room on the right will emerge from its sarcophagus and attack. Looting it gains the fourth shard and the new objective to find the shard holders. Proceeding to the quest marker, there is a dead explorer lying on top of a rising floor trap that will trigger even if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has the &lt;a href=\"Light%20Foot\"&gt;Light Foot&lt;/a&gt; perk. \nFurther on is the shard holder room. Per the journal, place air in north, earth in south, light in east, and water in west. When done correctly, the wall to the northwest will slide down, revealing a passage with a floor switch. There are also lootable &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Welkynd stones&lt;/a&gt; here.\nIn the last room is the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt; itself, the goal of the Mythic Dawn expedition. Taking it will cause &lt;a href=\"Norion%20the%20Undying\"&gt;Norion the Undying&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;, to rise and attack. Note that on the two upper levels flanking the room are a sleeping wight on each side. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, they are immune to damage until they rise when Norion does.\nBefore returning, find the wall switch in the nook to the west of Norion's room. Pushing it once opens the gate in the passage west of the floor trap room that leads to the shortcut door back to Rielle.\nGallery.\nThe most striking features of Rielle in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; are the recreation of Oblivion style interior elements including containers such as Ayleid caskets, traps such as falling blade and rising floor traps, &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd stone&lt;/a&gt; sconces that are high up and require archery or kinetic spells to dislocate, floor switches, wall switches and doors inlaid with the Ayleid Life-Tree."}

While he waited for Larsus, he was attacked by four masked men. If it hadn't been for &lt;a href=\"Lesspa\"&gt;Lesspa&lt;/a&gt;, Attrebus wouldn't have defeated the attackers. Attrebus ordered the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0to remove the masks of the attackers, and he distinguished Riente's face.\nAttrebus suspected he was sent by Larsus, but when he returned to the garrison he found Larsus decapitated. Attrebus then understood that someone in the Imperial City wanted him dead. It is later revealed that minister &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; plotted against the Emperor."}

Riften is built along the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;, made from wooden platforms and serving as a main hub of trading throughout the Rift and the Southern &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The lower canals are used as ports for skiffs moving throughout the lake.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nRiften is situated in the heart of the Rift, the southeastern forest of Skyrim. It is on the eastern shore of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;, in the minor region of the &lt;a href=\"Smokefrost%20Peaks\"&gt;Smokefrost Peaks&lt;/a&gt; located on the base of the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The Riften outskirts are primarily farmland, utilized mainly by the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Snow-Shod%20Clan\"&gt;Snow-Shod Clan&lt;/a&gt; and other ancestral families of the Rift. The city limits in the north are mostly used for this purpose, as it is covered in a natural barrier that divides the North Rift. Local militias of the Rift have also used this area as an encampment. &lt;a href=\"Merryfair%20Farm\"&gt;Merryfair Farm&lt;/a&gt; is one of the more well-known farms to use this district. The north road that leads into &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt; has been used by Riften as another line of defense after Greenwall. The southwest road is not as heavily used in Skyrim, with only other settlement in that direction is the townships of &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;. To the road to the east goes into &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to the settlements of &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiften city itself is somewhat small, for the layout is limiting. It is centered around a stone foundation where the market square is located. A canal runs around the square, where fishing skiffs use to dock their ships and sell their produce. Larger vessels utilize the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Docks\"&gt;Riften Docks&lt;/a&gt; on the outside of Riften walls. On the docks are the &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Fishery\"&gt;Riften Fishery&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the city's produce comes from this area, where they would be distributed to surrounding areas. The greater city surrounds the canal in Riften, and the main street runs through it. Between the north and south gates are the Riften chapters of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, the &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Keep\"&gt;Mistveil Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the current seat of power for Riften. The back streets run along the eastern wall, with a small graveyard and a secret entrance to &lt;a href=\"the%20Ratways\"&gt;the Ratways&lt;/a&gt;. The Ratways are the local sewers of Riften, more commonly known by the population of the Empire as the Riften Outlaws Refuge. The &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim supposedly operate in the Ratways.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nJorunn the Skald-King &amp; the Second Akaviri Invasion.\nAmidst the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-Prince\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-Prince&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to Riften with his entourage, the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20of%20Bards\"&gt;Pack of Bards&lt;/a&gt;, during their travels throughout the continent, visiting cities such as &lt;a href=\"Sutch\"&gt;Sutch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. When news of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;'s fall had reached Riften, Jorunn and the Pack of Bards cut a bloody swath to the city-state of Windhelm, where he and his brother, &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Strong-Prince\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt; fought against the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;i under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. They were unable to save their mother and sister, as the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; was razed. In the end, Dir-Kamal's forces moved south towards Morrowind and Jorunn was proclaimed &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; through a &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Nordic%20Duel\"&gt;Traditional Nordic Duel&lt;/a&gt; over his brother.\nWulfharth the Ash-King &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nSeeking aid, Jorunn traveled to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, where he was given the Ashen Familiar of &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, to aid him in his fight against the Akaviri. Jorunn and Wulfharth rallied their forces at the city-state of Riften, where Wulfharth's presence inspired the Nords. As Dir-Kamal saw Riften in the horizon, he witnessed waves of Angry Nords, and promptly avoided them, advancing into Morrowind through Virak Pass. The Nordic Army followed suit, where they joined the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; in their fight at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. After a cunning victory with the Dunmer and &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; was formed, and Riften was integrated into their forces, along with Eastern Skyrim.\nIn his Wake; the Worm Cult &amp; Sinmur the Terrible.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Riften was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Viri\"&gt;Thane Viri&lt;/a&gt;, who was forced to rebuild her beloved city after the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Sinmur%20the%20Terrible\"&gt;Sinmur the Terrible&lt;/a&gt;. The ghostly spirit of the Giant Chieftain had demolished Riften, leaving the northern wall open to the environment. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Viveka\"&gt;Captain Viveka&lt;/a&gt; of the City Guard helped survivors while the Temple of Mara healed them. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; had made their presence fully-established in the region, waging a minor war with the Ebonheart Pact. Sinmur was ultimately brought back at &lt;a href=\"Arcwind%20Point\"&gt;Arcwind Point&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Thallik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thallik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt; was killed and fused with Sinmur's spirit. In response, the Pact had resurrected ancient members of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakra\"&gt;Hakra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valdur\"&gt;Valdur&lt;/a&gt; to combat this apparition. As the Pact rebuilt Riften, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Pact investigated the city for activity from the Worm Cult. It was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Garmar\"&gt;Anchorite Garmar&lt;/a&gt; of the Worm Cult, had founded a shard of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; on the shores of Riften, attempting to recover it in the Cult's plot. He was swiftly defeated, and the shard was given to &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt;, who operated in &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Hall\"&gt;Fallowstone Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Riften became the staging grounds for the final battle at the peaks of &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta\"&gt;Trolhetta&lt;/a&gt; in the south.\nThe Young Barenziah &amp; General Symmachus.\nThe young &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; had escaped her home at &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt;, eventually traveling to the east with her friend, the stable boy, &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;. After talking up the job of caravan guard, the two arrived in the city-state of Riften at sixteen, where they met a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i thief named &lt;a href=\"Therris\"&gt;Therris&lt;/a&gt;, who eventually brought Barenziah into the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Therris proposed a heist, where they would break into an Imperial Commandant's estate, by the request of a traitor to the Empire. This failed as the Imperial Commandant was &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, who recognized the young Barenziah. After disposing of Straw and Therris, Symmachus took Barenziah into Morrowind, via the &lt;a href=\"Silgrod%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrod Tower&lt;/a&gt; checkpoint on the border. The two returned to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, where Barenziah inherited the throne of Mournhold after several years of being away.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiften during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Riften in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Riften was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Bjis\"&gt;King Bjis&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crossed-Daggers of Riften.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hosgunn%20Crossed-Daggers\"&gt;Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers&lt;/a&gt; became the Jarl of Riften after the previous one had been assassinated through unknown means. Many believed that Jarl Hosgunn was responsible, and so many took to the streets and protested, to which he took immediate action. The Jarl utilized the City Guard and issued a curfew, much to the dismay of the people. If anyone broke it, then they were jailed, should it happen again, they would be executed. Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers ruled for forty years with an iron fist, and a blackened heart, imposing ridiculous taxes on anyone who tried to make business in Riften. Ultimately in &lt;a href=\"4E%20129\"&gt;4E 129&lt;/a&gt;, the people were at their breaking point, as they overwhelmed the city guard, hungering for blood. The Jarl took refuge in his castle, which was built within seven years with lavishing accessories. The riot had burned down the castle, with both the Jarl and the city destroyed. It took five years to rebuild Riften, but it was a shadow of its former self, a shanty town of filth. But for many years, hope for the prosperous Riften was still in the hearts of the people, even now.\nRiften during the Skyrim Civil War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Riften was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Laila%20Law-Giver\"&gt;Laila Law-Giver&lt;/a&gt;, who was in competition for power with the Thieves Guild of Skyrim, who held significant power in Riften, albeit not as much as it did prior. With the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; waging war with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Jarl Law-Giver, and by extension, the city-state of Riften allied with &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, she does not have a lot of faith in Ulfric's movement, with her son, &lt;a href=\"Saerlund\"&gt;Saerlund&lt;/a&gt; having a great dislike against the Stormcloaks. While the Stormcloaks operated out of Windhelm, the group in the Rift worked in &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Keep\"&gt;Mistveil Keep&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Gonnar%20Oath-Giver\"&gt;Gonnar Oath-Giver&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond the capital city, the Stormcloaks utilized &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt; in the northern pass near Riften. &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt;, the matriarch of the Black-Briar Clan has massive control over Riften, with strong ties to the Thieves Guild.\nThe Thieves Guild &amp; their Rise to Glory.\nAt the same time, the Thieves Guild of Skyrim, whose presence in Riften has existed since the second era, has lost a significant amount of their influence but has retained their holdings in Riften through their friends of the Black-Briar Clan. Their guildmaster, &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt;, was once a member of the &lt;a href=\"Nightingales\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt;, a group of highly-skilled thieves that worship &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Shadows. Frey had murdered the Guild's previous leader, &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus Desidenius&lt;/a&gt; and framed the death of his associate, &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of Barenziah herself. Karliah worked in the shadows to defame the Thieves Guild until Karliah was proven innocent and Mercer was killed deep in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since, the Thieves Guild had expanded their influence, as far as, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. This renaissance had ushered a new era for the Thieves Guild in Skyrim."}

Many poor residents frequent the less desirable areas and thieves, both Guild and freelance, take advantage of the frequent mist, dark alleys, and the Canal, preying on travelers and citizens alike. Such conditions reflect on the city; deaths are common and people will often fight in the street over dropped items.\nDryside.\nThe northern, eastern, and southern edges of the city, built on the shore of Lake Honrich, are called Dryside. The bulk of the town's residence sits on Dryside, and is split from the western edge known as Plankside, by the Riften canal. Most of the more affluent homes are located on the eastern edge of Dryside, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, while the southern portion of the city holds the &lt;a href=\"Honorhall%20Orphanage\"&gt;Honorhall Orphanage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Keep\"&gt;Mistveil Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlankside.\nThe western edge of the city is known as Plankside, built on the waters of Lake Honrich, and serves as the city's business district. The market, shops, meadery, fish hatchery, and the &lt;a href=\"Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt; Inn are all located on Plankside; essentially Dryside is residence while Plankside is business. The buildings on Plankside have been built atop of wooden docks, and the district is old and ramshackle. There are three main docks projecting from Plankside onto the lake, one owned completely by the Black-Briar Meadery and the other two used for commerce and fishery.\nThe Riften Canal is the lower level of the city; small residences and an alchemy shop are built into the moisture ridden stone. Dark and traversed only along rickety catwalks, the canal is avoided by the more affluent citizens of Riften, as it is commonplace for muggings and foul play. It also contains the entrance to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway\"&gt;The Ratway&lt;/a&gt;, the city under the city.\nThe Ratway.\nRiften is notorious for being the home of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and residents urge travelers away from the sprawling tunnel system. If successfully navigated, one might find &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;, the headquarters of the Guild, home to a tavern and several shops of its own. However, that would mean crossing the dark, tight tunnels and avoiding those too dangerous or outcast not to warrant residency in Riften proper or membership in the Guild, leaving them to try and survive on their own wherever they can in the Ratway.\nFirst visit.\nUpon approaching the city gates, the Riften guards attempt to make the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; pay a \"visitor's tax,\" which varies according to level. With a high enough Speech skill, however, they can persuade or intimidate the guard. If recognized that \"this is obviously a shakedown,\" the guard tells the Dragonborn to \"keep this quiet,\" and go on ahead after unlocking the gate for them. It is, however, possible to get into the city without using the main gate, by using the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt; on the docks, then going through the meadery into Riften.\nThese guards are suspected to be accomplices of &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt;, as he later addresses the Dragonborn with full knowledge of the scam call out. To avoid the situation entirely, one can have themselves arrested and jailed in Riften, or sneak in through the meadery, or by pickpocketing the guard's gate key. Also, if a dragon attacks while talking with the guards, they will run to attack the dragon and the Dragonborn can get inside after the fight while the guards are walking back to their posts to resume their duties.\nThere are also town guards guarding the docks. These guards cannot be persuaded or even bribed to be let in, directing the player to the north gate.\nAfter entering the city, the Dragonborn will be greeted by &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt;, who will say \"I don't know you, you in Riften lookin' for trouble?\" If the Dragonborn replies with \"I'm not scared of you,\" Maul will tell them \"That's the wrong answer,\" followed by instructions to keep out of the Black-Briar business. Once Maven become Jarl, Maul serves as her bodyguard.\nPurchasable property.\nThe house in Riften (&lt;a href=\"Honeyside\"&gt;Honeyside&lt;/a&gt;) costs 8000 and can be bought from the steward, &lt;a href=\"Anuriel\"&gt;Anuriel&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Laila\"&gt;Jarl Laila&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; approves. This approval is gained by &lt;a href=\"I%20Done%20Got%20Thaned%21\"&gt;performing deeds for Riften's citizens&lt;/a&gt;."}

She will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Blackroot%20Clan\"&gt;Blackroot Clan&lt;/a&gt; have risen from the dead; they were nasty in life and are even nastier now. Once you are done talking. &lt;a href=\"Indaenir\"&gt;Indaenir&lt;/a&gt; will show up; talk to him and he will tell you that of course you need to find a way to put the clan back to rest, but that this is also an opportunity to learn what happened to the clan so long ago. \nBesides the clan, there are also other spirits here, who wish to show you what happened in the past. There are five of these scenes in total, spread around the area. You will learn that a village sacrificed themselves to ensure their sister villages were safe from the Blackroot Clan, that they poisoned themselves before battle in order to poison the Blackroot Clan when they feasted on them. The Blackroot Clan went to the Nereid Temple for a cure after this. The final vision will show that the leader of the clan had his bow stolen, and the Right of Theft was invoked to get him to march against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead for the Nereid Temple, which is near the location of the final vision. Speak with Indaenir there and he will speculate that it was a &lt;a href=\"Servant%20of%20Naemon\"&gt;Servant of Naemon&lt;/a&gt; that stole the bow from &lt;a href=\"General%20Malgoth\"&gt;General Malgoth&lt;/a&gt;. The way to put the clan back to rest is to get this bow back, so Indaenir will send you into the Neried Temple for clues. Head inside and search for the General's remains; you will find them in the southeastern room, on a pedestal. Upon searching the remains, you will be taken into the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wood\"&gt;Shadow Wood&lt;/a&gt; by Naemon's Servant, and he will taunt you to come and take the bow from him. \nHead out of the temple and you will find Indaenir there; speak with him and he will tell you that the spirits that showed you the visions earlier are trapped in this realm. To free them, you must close the rifts throughout the area; they are in the same places where you found the spirits back on Tamriel. Closing the rifts is optional, but it will weaken Naemon's grip on the area. Your real task right now is to take the bow from the Servant of Naemon in the northwest of the area. If you do close all the rifts though, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Elphirion\"&gt;Elphirion&lt;/a&gt; will appear to thank you, and you can persuade her to grant you a shield that will protect you while you are in the Shadow Wood. \nOnce you have killed the Servant of Naemon and taken the bow, you will be transported back to Valenwood. Speak with Indaenir there and he will tell you that since you stole the bow from Naemon, you can now invoke the Right of Theft against General Malgoth. The general will be standing next to Indaenir; you can either release him or you can compel him to fight against Naemon and his forces. Either way, talk to Indaenir again to finish the quest."}

During the great war her father, Ragnar of Bruma was fighting in the war against the Dominion. After Titus Mede II signed the White-Gold concordat, Ragnar took his men \"The Sons of Talos\" to aid the Redguards during the war. A few years later, The Thalmor invaded the house of Ragnar and quickly captired him and sent him to Alinor, enslaving and seperated his wife Siguun and only child Rigmor. When Ragnar was in his chains he was paraded around the streets of Alinor as the people spat upon him and he was executed by the Dominon for war crimes he did not commit.\n\"4E 201\" The day Alduin attacked Helgen, Rigmor had fled to Skyrim after assaulting the Thalmor embassy near Bruma and was severely wounded. As the Last Dragonborn made his way to Riverwood, a young girl called out for help. She was called Rose and she was guarding Rigmor as the Thalmor was looking for her. With the help of the Last Dragonborn, Rigmor made a full recovery, after adventuring around Skyrim, Rigmor learned where her mother was being held captive. Diamond Ridge mine was the name and she was determind to free her mother. But a reunion short lived as Tilar Aedreath, a General of the New Order had ambushed Rigmor and the Dragonborn, Rigmor was taken and the Dragonborn left to die. Azura protected the Dragonborn from the cold so he can find Rigmor. After many tasks the Dragonborn went to the Altar of Trinimac and saw Rigmor to be a sacrafise. He went and entered the portal and closed it to save RIgmor. As she was recovering she was a shadow of her former self. She no longer lifted a blade and it worried her friends. The Dragonborn had a battle to fight and had to leave Rigmor with her mother so she didnt get hurt. During the battle of Whiterun though is when she returned sword and all. They fought on and had to go to Blacklight Tower and killed Tilar Aedreath.\n\"4E 205\"\nYears passed and the Last Dragonborn and Rigmor were never seen together again since she lect for Bruma. But one day an old friend came to visit the Dragonborn with a letter from Bruma which was Siguun asking him to visit Bruma so they can talk. Without a second thought the Dragonborn made his way to Bruma to discuss matters as he learned Titus Mede II was missing/dead and a bandit king by tue name Ariel Sethius seized the Imperial Throne wuth his Bandit Army and trashed Leyawiin in the process. He summoned Rigmor to the Palace to sign the Noble Decree which brings Bruma back into the fold of Cyrodiil. After Rigmor signed the Decree, the son of Leyawiin, Robere de Medalius proposed to Countess Rigmor and she did accept not knowing the betrayal that would come.\nMorag Sethius found out about Rigmor's ancestral ties to the Mede Dynasty and called her out as a Pretender to the Imperial Throne and she got exiled to Roscrea for 25 years. But this didnt sit well with the Dragonborn as he was gonna go to Roscrea and save her. But the Prison was on fire, fearing Rigmor was trapped within the Dragonborn didnt hesitate and went in. The Dragonborn was lured into a trap by Morag Sethius and Robere, which he planned to kill her and make Leyawiin's army spread all over Cyrodiil. The Dragonborn found a way out where he found the last livin Minotaur and he wanted the Dragonborn to kill him so they both can be freed, reluctantly the Dragonborn agreed and killed the Minotaur and his eyes now set for Roscrea. As he arrived on Roscrea the ancient Akaviri was attacking the Garrison but he pushed on to save Rigmor. \nRigmor who's hair was now gone was happy to see the Dragonborn and they made their way across Roscrea, during an encounter of the Akaviri, Rigmor was infected with living death and once again the Dragonborn came to the rescue listening to an old.crone he gathered the ingredients and saved her life. Rigmor also hained a hair tonic to restore her hair. As they arried in Falkreath they saw Yngol Stormblade on the throne and wasnt happy of the need to bring Sorella in the chaos but he expected it. With the return of the Countess in Bruma they learned of the seige Leyawiin had against her city. Rigmor and the Dragonborn sat in the tap and tack alehouse and she asked about Robere and the Dragonborn said \"He wanted to punch you in the mouth for constantly complaining\" which made Rigmor emotional but the Dragonborn comforted her. As they made their way to Hammerfell after they broke thebseige of Bruma, they met up with Quintus who told them about Table Mountain and what Morag Sethius was doing there and all was good until the Thalmor arrived which enraged Rigmor but she used their forces anyways. \nAs they scaled Table Mountain for the Dragonborn he knew it was only the beginning of the end. When they confronted Morag Sethius she had something on the Dragonborn which made him kiss her as much as he didnt want to. She infected him with the Kiss of Death but it didnt show just yet as he had to defeat Molag Bal. After that battle he made his way back to the camp where Rigmor was furious at him and mistakenly thought he cheated on her. Sethri said he looked bad but had a visitor. After the meetings the Dragonborn then passed out as all his friends were worried about him. He woke up in a strange Aylied like ruin to a girls sob. He found the girl and freed her and told him what he needed to do and he did that where he met Alessia. After all of that he woke in the middle of battle and helped Rigmor win and they went to the Imperial Court the next day where they were to be killed but the Legion didnt listen. As a result of his death, the Dragonborn became the Emperor of Cyrodiil and the Empire with Rigmor as the High Queen of Cyrodiil and the Empire. Month's pass and Rigmor gave birth to a Dragonchild namde Kintyra as the Dragonborn fended off assassins that wanted to end the prophecy of the Chosen Queen of Tamriel"}

From the distance it seems to be a golden gleam. It is said that the Akaviri built a magnificent shrine there, the Tonenaka, which houses ten thousand statues. Rimmen also has stunning canals.\nBuildings and walls in Rimmen have elegant bones of ivory colored stone, with few towers but many domes. The market is a bustling, colorful plaza empty in the middle, but girdled by tents and stalls and bounded by canals. The palace is an ancient-looking structure raised up on a high, tiered stone substructure.\nHistory.\nWhen humans were still in a primitive state, &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; caravans already reached as far as what is Rimmen today. During the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; refugees fled to and possibly founded Rimmen from Attrebus, a short-lived pretender to the Imperial throne. As they were settled at the border of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, those people became known as the \"Rim Men.\" Later they allied with the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;ics in a war against the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Demons%20of%20Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to reunite the Empire, but eventually they had to submit to the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; again. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20812\"&gt;2E 812&lt;/a&gt; they seceded yet again, only to resubmit yet again later as a vassal kingdom.\nIn 2E 576, Rimmen was conquered by &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Euraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of the noble &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;House Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Frostfall%20Coup\"&gt;The Frostfall Coup&lt;/a&gt;. She would later seek the \"&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Demon Weapon&lt;/a&gt;,\" hidden in &lt;a href=\"The%20Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;The Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt; for many years, to help her expand her kingdom but first she needed the Wrathstone to help her find it. Eventually, when she finds it, she releases the Demon Weapon: dragons.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; annexed a swath of Elsweyr border land, including Rimmen, and cleared it of all Khajiit. Near the city he built The Halls of Colossus in order to assemble &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the area is said to be \"poisoned glow-rock.\" Also during the Second Era, it was known that a group called the &lt;a href=\"Jovial%20Lambasters\"&gt;Jovial Lambasters&lt;/a&gt; worshiped the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; from this city.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, a song about a ball given by the Queen and Rimmen and her consort is sung.\nIn the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, following the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Rimmen declared its independence from the Elsweyr confederacy. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2040\"&gt;4E 40&lt;/a&gt;, it enjoyed relative stability under the rule of a Potentate, despite civil war breaking out in Elsweyr. It is also the only place in eastern Elsweyr friendly to men and mer. In fact, fewer than half of the people living in Rimmen are Khajiit. The potentate forbids the nomad Khajiit clans inside the city, and illegally selling them &lt;a href=\"moon-sugar\"&gt;moon-sugar&lt;/a&gt; is fined triple the worth of the sugar. Selling more than two pounds is punished with execution."}

That's about the only thing they agree on.\nI bet if I defeated a bandit or killed a wolf or something that would show them! Then they would have to let me join up with the Legion.\nPa always tells me to stay away from the old well, the one toward the tall monument, out by the tree sitting on a rock. Wolves like to hunt out there, he says. So that's where I'll go. I'll kill a wolf and bring home its head and that'll prove that I'm a man and not a baby.\nI'm tired of listening to Ma and Pa yell at each other anyway."}

Some Daedra cannot be harmed by lower level (such as &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Weapons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Weapons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;) and unenchanted weapons. Inside the shrine, Rethelas is the first character the Nerevarine will encounter. Although hostile, he likely will not present much of a challenge compared to other enemies. After retrieving the ring from him, it is possible to return to Eno Hlaalu in Vivec, but if the Nerevarine proceeds further into the ruins, they will encounter &lt;a href=\"Mindeli%20Saren\"&gt;Mindeli Saren&lt;/a&gt;, a hostile &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, who carries the &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20Sanguine%20Stolid%20Armor\"&gt;Belt of Sanguine Stolid Armor&lt;/a&gt;, another Thread of the Webspinner.\nWhen the Nerevarine is done in Yasammidan, they should return to Eno Hlaalu to hand in the recovered Threads. Other than improved reputation with the Morag Tong and disposition towards the Nerevarine from Eno Hlaalu, there is no reward from this quest."}

The crew of Sadon Reyth joined shields with the crews of &lt;a href=\"Kaal%20Kaaz\"&gt;Kaal Kaaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgermet\"&gt;Ylgermet&lt;/a&gt; to battle &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; in the area later known as &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the captain of Ylgermet, legendary &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; himself, started the building of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the crew of Sadon Reyth split off, never to join shields again."}

Sadrith Mora is a city of absolute wonder as the spiraling mushroom towers kiss the skies above.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSadrith Mora occupies one of the many islands that inhabit the &lt;a href=\"Zafirbel%20Bay\"&gt;Zafirbel Bay&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and it occupies one of the bigger ones located in the east. Sadrith Mora is only accessible by the sea, so a boat is required to enter Sadrith Mora unless you are willing to swim all the way there. This can be quite tedious as the closest settlements on land would be the towns of &lt;a href=\"Vos\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;. Sadrith Mora itself is surrounded by the Telvanni Mushroom Tower residing in the middle, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt; is the original settlement as everything else was most likely built after Tel Naga's growth. Tel Naga is the biggest structure in Sadrith Mora and is the home of the Archmagister of the Vvardenfell Telvanni Council.\nHouse Telvanni is infamous for rejecting foreigners from their compounds such as Sadrith Mora and &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt;. This is evident in Sadrith Mora with the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Inn\"&gt;Gateway Inn&lt;/a&gt;, a large inn built on the western wall of Sadrith Mora, as a lounging area for foreign visitors and is usually where many Non-Dunmer people are found. South of the city is &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Hall\"&gt;Wolverine Hall&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; fortress designed to protect Sadrith Mora from incoming invaders and to host the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapters in Sadrith Mora. Upon entering Sadrith Mora via the Gateway Inn, you are introduced to the Market Square, bustling with local fisherman and artisans that pay tribute to the leaders of Sadrith Mora.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; refused to join the other Great Houses in the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, this was done to keep the slave trade flowing within in their territories. This included Sadrith Mora and the settlements of Azura's Coast.\nHistory was made in Sadrith Mora when an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slave named &lt;a href=\"Sun-in-Shadow\"&gt;Sun-in-Shadow&lt;/a&gt; was freed by an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. Sun-in-Shadow was the first Argonian to become initiated into the ranks of the Great House Telvanni. While she and Vestige tried to maintain her freedom as well as ensure her success, her fellow slave, &lt;a href=\"Eoki\"&gt;Eoki&lt;/a&gt; planned to escape back to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Ropefish%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Ropefish Gang&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vassamsi%20Grotto\"&gt;Vassamsi Grotto&lt;/a&gt;. Sun-in-Shadow wanted to have Eoki stay with her, but that would continue to make him slave while, Eoki wanted Sun-in-Shadow to leave with him to Black Marsh, their ancestral home. Eoki's fate was left unknown, but Sun-in-Shadow remained. She resided in the newly constructed &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; until her final days.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Sadrith Mora prospered along with the other three cities in Vvardenfell. The city was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Neloth\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt;, an arrogant young mer that is capable of doing anything to achieve a higher status. In the same year, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition, and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; roamed Vvardenfell to fulfill their destiny of uniting the people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to oppose the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. The warrior traveled to Tel Naga of Sadrith Mora to convince Neloth to give them the title of &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of the Great House Telvanni.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the center of Vvardenfell, had erupted after years of remaining dormant throughout Dunmeri history. The resulting explosion caused the destruction of virtually all of Vvardenfell's settlements including &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, Sadrith Mora, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. Very little life remained in the now endless sea of ash formerly known as Vvardenfell. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; Councilman from &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; issued a relief effort to rebuild the cities of Vvardenfell from the ground up. As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown whether the effort reached Sadrith Mora and the city was rebuilt.\nPrior to the eruption, Neloth left the city of Sadrith Mora to establish his private tower on the southern coast of the &lt;a href=\"Hirstaang%20Forest\"&gt;Hirstaang Forest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt; was built after the eruption had devastated Southern Solstheim and ravaged &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Neloth dedicated his life to researching the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt; being created from the Red Mountain's mystical ash. He eventually became interested in &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifact\"&gt;Daedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt;s affiliated to &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Knowledge. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Books\"&gt;Black Books&lt;/a&gt; were sought out by Neloth and he even discovered the lost &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt;."}

Others consider them to be the finest magical minds in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; (though many of my brethren would contest that statement). They are the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;, the sages of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; and the instructors of the heirs to the royal throne of Summerset. A few of the greatest mages of the age can be counted among their numbers, but in general they are scholars of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al and esoteric knowledge, each devoted to a specific and singular topic of study.\nThe Sapiarchs serve as the keepers of the Crystal Tower, also called the Lawful Crystal and the Crystal-Like-Law. The tower is so named not because it is constructed of crystal, but because it houses &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt;, a magical crystal that rests at the top of the tower.\nA handful of sages live within the tower, tending to its needs and guarding its secrets, while others come and go as their studies dictate. Of course, getting into the tower isn't as simple as walking up and opening the door. The way is hidden and guarded by powerful wards, and the only method for gaining entrance requires the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Sentinels\"&gt;Tower Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. This pair of specially attuned Sapiarchs each bear an object needed to access the tower\u2014one of the two &lt;a href=\"Resolute%20Diamond\"&gt;Resolute Diamond&lt;/a&gt;s. When properly attuned and used simultaneously by both the Tower Sentinels, the azure diamonds open the path into the Crystal Tower. Only two such Sentinels are ever activated, for each must undergo a long and extensive ritual to link them to the diamonds they bear. Sentinels keep their charge for eleven years before a new pair take up guardianship of the diamonds.\nThe rest of the sagely order is organized into the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Sapiarchs\"&gt;College of Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;, with each member dedicated to and responsible for a specific field of magical or esoteric scholarship. &lt;a href=\"Larnatille\"&gt;Larnatille&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lillandril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;, Sapiarch of Arcanology, leads the college, which consists of two-hundred-and-twenty-three distinct disciples assigned to a Sapiarch and his or her assistant. Spread throughout Summerset, the Sapiarchs work individually or in small groups on independent studies or to research specific topics for the college as a whole. Some research can be conducted at the Crystal Tower or at the College of Sapiarchs in Lillandril, but otherwise the sages travel the lands as necessary or lock themselves in their own libraries to ponder the complexities of the world's greatest mysteries.\nAs the interpreters of the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20Praxis\"&gt;Scrolls of Praxis&lt;/a&gt;, the precedents by which the rulers of the Summerset Isles govern their domain, the Sapiarchs play a vital role in the maintenance of the &lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;Ceremoniarchy&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the Scrolls of Praxis are said to have foretold that &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Princess Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; would reflect the restless and turbulent times she was born into and would eventually rule over. When the time is right, heirs to the throne come to the Sapiarchs to study &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Regal%20Praxis\"&gt;Altmeri Regal Praxis&lt;/a&gt; and for a requisite 3,555 days prior to receiving the crown. Afterward, the College of Sapiarchs serves as a powerful resource for the new ruler, offering advice and counsel when called upon.\nFor all their professed learning and scholarly pursuits, the Sapiarchs seem overly interested in signs and portents. They attribute deep and significant meaning to the movements of the constellations, the positions of the moons, the disposition of animals, and even the swirls of foam atop a bowl of century soup. This tug of war between intellectualism and superstition may seem like a contradiction to you and me, but the Sapiarchs see them as two sides of the same coin. And, as with a coin, you need both sides to pay the cost of admission, or so the Sapiarchs say.\nSome of the leading Sapiarch fields of study include &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; Studies, Indoctrination, &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; Heritage, &lt;a href=\"Enchant\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt;ment, Mythohistory, &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Fallacies, Selenology, and Divine Orthodoxy. To indicate their office and field of study, each carries a title such as Sapiarch of Altmeri Arts of Assistant Sapiarch of Naval Excogitation. A Sapiarch holds the title for life or until he or she petitions to change their area of scholarship. The Tower Sentinels, however, carry out their responsibilities regarding the Resolute Diamonds for a period of eleven years before passing the tower keys to the next Sapiarchs in line and returning to concentrate on their particular fields of study."}

He promised himself to revive these martial traditions, but when he failed to do so he shaved his head and served as a warrior in Tamriel's battlefields until he met Varen Aquilarios, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n military leader.\nDuring the war with the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; before Varen became Emperor of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, Sai rode at the head of a column of mercenary soldiers tasked by Varen to assist in the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out that then-Emperor &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt; employed those mercenaries as double agents. When Sai came before the gates of Leyawiin with the mercenaries, they turned on him, hoping to deliver the severed head of Varen's legendary Dragonguard Commander to Emperor Leovic. Rumors say Sai cut through two armies of the would-be assassins bent on killing him. When he returned to Varen's rebellion base at &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; weeks later, he did so with the scalps of eighty-six men and the news that Leyawiin had been freed.\nAfter Varen deposed Leovic and proclaimed himself as Emperor, Sai Sahan helped him to find the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0for a ritual to make Varen into a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, thus fully legitimizing his claim to the throne. However, the ritual was actually a dark trick by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0used to weaken the veil between\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and thus begin the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. In the chaos after the ritual, Sai took the Amulet of Kings and fled, managing to hide it in the depths of the ancient, ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, only to be captured and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; later on.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; first finds out about the Five Companions during &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Varen's flashback&lt;/a&gt;, depicting Sai Sahan as one of the loyal bodyguards who protected Varen. It is later revealed that during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, Sai Sahan fled with the Amulet of Kings and managed to hide the amulet within the Sancre Tor.\nSai was captured and brought to the Halls of Torment for his captors to obtain information, but he was stubborn, refusing to let out one word. He was &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;rescued&lt;/a&gt; by the Vestige and either &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; in 2E 582.\nPersonality.\nSai Sahan is unyielding, honorable, patriotic and loyal, fiercely protective of those he considers friends especially to his &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Sai understands duty and dedication, serves those he knows to be his betters, and hones his craft with singular dedication. Some say he is also burdened with a great deal of suppressed anger and blood-lust, savoring the heat of battle and insurmountable odds and relishing the act of killing his enemies. He has strong feelings for &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, his so-called \"Snow Lily,\" while taking to heart much of Abnur Tharn's snide comments.\nHis greatest regret was not being able to revive the ancient &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n traditions of the sword-saints, wiped out by the Yokudan Emperor many centuries ago. Abnur considered this a blessing considering these same traditions might have been the reason for the destruction of Yokuda.\nConversations.\nLyris: \"Sai! What's happened to you? What have they done?\"\nSai: \"Lyris! Lyris, I can see you! Are you really there?\"\nLyris: \"Sai, it's me! We're seeing some kind of vision of you. Do you know where you are?\"\nSai: \"I ...

Never!\"\nVaren Doppelganger: \"You failed me, Sai. Why didn't you protect me? I should have never trusted you.\"\nSai Sahan: \"It is strange to return to these mountains.

We will make them pay, I promise you!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"What do you think? Trap?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"It's only a trap if you don't know about it. I assume everything is a trap.

Be safe in the coming days, my friends. I look forward to your return.\"\nSai Sahan: \"The Abbey of Blades will rise from these ashes. If I survive the dark path we must walk, I will return to help Kasura shape a new generation of blademasters.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You could have hidden that amulet anywhere in Tamriel, and this was your first choice?\"\nSai Sahan: \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Brilliant. Why is it that the people with the most ridiculous ideas are always the ones who are most certain of them?\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Shut up, Tharn.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Shut up, Tharn.\"\nMannimarco: \"What brings you to Sancre Tor, old friends? Looking for an amulet, perhaps?\"\nSai Sahan: \"Mannimarco?

We are like mountain bamboo: far stronger and more flexible than we might appear.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"I find it hilarious that Mannimarco chose such a massive projected appearance. He's obviously overcompensating for something.\"\nMannimarco: \"Persistent, aren't you? Do you really think you can keep me from acquiring the amulet?\"\nSai Sahan: \"The Amulet of Kings is under the protection of Stendarr's ward! It will never be yours!\"\nMannimarco: \"Ah, Sai. You still don't understand, do you? My plan will succeed because of your ward of Stendarr! It will prevent Molag Bal from observing or interfering. By the time the ward is down and the amulet is mine, it will already be too late!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You're insane if you think you can betray the God of Schemes!\"\nMannimarco: \"\"Naive child! You know nothing! Chim-el Adabal, the red diamond at the center of the Amulet of Kings, is the most powerful Soul Gem ever created! With the amulet in my possession, I will absorb Molag Bal's power, reducing him to an empty husk of ethereal flesh. Then I will trap his essence within the gem! In time, the name Molag Bal will be forgotten! In time, all of Tamriel will bow down before me! Soon, the God of Schemes will have a new name: Mannimarco!\"\nSai Sahan: \"I do not like Mannimarco as a mortal. I think I will like him even less as a god.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Please.

So you can keep your mouth shut and still keep breathing.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Well played, Titanborn. Well played.\"\nSai Sahan: \"My lord, with your permission.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"You needn't call me that anymore, Sai Sahan. We are equals now.\"\nSai Sahan: \"All those years ago, when we fought beneath our lord's banner to free the Empire from the Longhouse Emperors, we did so with a dream of freedom and peace in mind\u2015not just for the Empire, but for all of Tamriel. Together we forged a fellowship stronger than any blade, only to see it shattered upon the rocks of deceit by one of our own. That fellowship is no more, yet we four have assembled here, united by a single purpose. It is not vengeance that drives us, but truth and loyalty and justice. I, Sai Sahan, steward of the Abbey of Blades, call for the Five Companions to be reforged this day. By the light of Stendarr, and the heart of Lorkhan, may our blade fellowship be forged anew. And may the Vestige, our mutual friend and ally, become its tip, that we may thrust it straigt into the heart of a Daedric Prince.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai Sahan is right. You are the member that we should have had all those years ago.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"It is as the Scrolls foretold. The soulless one will become the brightest of five stars, and they shall guide us to the coming dawn.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Oh, please. You melodramatic sots! Fine, fine. If seeing one of your foolish prophecies come true will help to ensure the safety of the Empire, I'll play along.\"\nSai Sahan: \"We stand united once more\u2015the Five Companions are reforged, and together we will strike down the God of Schemes!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Come here, my friend. I've got a few things I want to say before you go.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Of course it is. The fact of the matter stands, however. One of the Five will need to give their life to fuel this attack, when the time comes.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"So you said before the Vestige arrived. And I've already thought over it. I'll do it.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Snow Lily, no! You should not need to give your life this way. This is my duty\u2015penance for my numerous failures. This is my chance to make things right.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"The Scrolls said nothing of this moment, and so I am not bound to their dictates. Vestige, I ask that you let me do this one thing. All that has happened was because of my hubris. I shall be the one.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sire, you've done enough. This was Mannimarco's doing, not yours.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"As the one who will fight the Daedric Prince, the Vestige should decide.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"I don't see you leaping to volunteer, Tharn. Saving your own backside again?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Hard as it may be, Lyris, don't be an idiot. I am the only one who knows the ritual and we don't have time to teach anyone else.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"That's enough. It won't be decided here and now. Vestige, come here. I have some final words for you.\"\nThe Prophet: \"This place is alive with pain and suffering. This must be where Molag Bal torments those who displease him.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Look there! Is that Mannimarco?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Mannimarco! He was a back-stabbing hypocrite with delusions of godhood. The fool got precisely what he deserved!\"\nIf Mannimarco is released:\nMannimarco: \"You actually released me? Naive fool! Future generations will pay for your weakness!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Are you insane? That worm didn't deserve your mercy!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Why do I get the feeling we're going to regret this?\"\nThe Prophet: \"There. That place should serve us well. Let us assemble and prepare the ritual.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"What do you suppose this place was?\"\nSai Sahan: \"A temple of some kind. The Dark Anchors may have pulled it into Coldharbour. Or, perhaps it was created by the Daedra to mock the Divines.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"What does it matter? We can't wait any longer. We must perform the ritual. Vestige, it is time for you to make your decision.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Position yourself over there, Vestige. And brace yourself.\"\nIf Lyris Titanborn is the sacrifice:\nSai Sahan: \"Snow Lily, no... don't do this. Please.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Death is simply life's next great adventure, and I am prepared to make the journey. I hope to see you all again one day, in Sovngarde. Until then, it has been my greatest honor.\"\nIf Sai Sahan is the sacrifice:\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai, I... I'll never forget you. And we'll finish this, I swear it.\"\nSai Sahan: \"\"I am honored to make this sacrifice.

I am finally free of him!\"\nSai Sahan: \"My Lord Varen, are you injured?\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"I'm fine, Sai. But where is Tharn? I do not hear his steps nor his breath.\"\nCadwell: \"He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him.\"\nSai Sahan: \"I cannot believe Snow Lily is gone. Why did she do it, My Lord?\"\nCadwell: \"Here now, my good man! Lyris Titanborn is a good hero! She gave her life for a noble cause!\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Sir Cadwell is right, Sai. We will all mourn her, but it was her choice. her sacrifice to make.\"\nIf Varen was sacrificed:\nLyris Titanborn: \"What... what happened? How did we get here? I remember being overwhelmed, but then...\"\nCadwell: \"Right. Sorry about that. I called in a bit of help to pull you out of there. I do hope I didn't overstep my bounds.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Snow Lily, I...\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"I know, Sai. It's over. It's all over.\"\nCadwell: \"Well then! Happy endings all around! Smashing! Who's got the brandy?\"\nSai Sahan: \"Wait, where is Tharn? Did he survive?\"\nCadwell: \"He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him.\"\nVahlokzin \"Visitors?

It consists of the following pages found throughout the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;:\nContents.\nI am a hunter. I am a redeemer. I am &lt;a href=\"Jiub%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Jiub&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tale of my rise to glory begins in the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;ash wastes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. I rode alone, weapon at my side and the burning wind stinging my face. My quest was arduous, but necessary to ensure the survival of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people. A pestilence was creeping across the ashlands, a menace with an insatiable hunger that plagued innocent travelers simply trying to get home. It was my self-sworn task to hunt them down one-by-one and drive them from the skies. Their fury knew no bounds and their war cry resonated across the land. They were the notorious &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer\"&gt;cliff racers&lt;/a&gt;, and they had to be destroyed.\nOn a particularly hot day during Sun's Height, I was tracking what I called a Lingerer... a cliff racer without a nest. He was a particularly feisty one too, leading me on a merry chase across almost three miles of ash dunes. I had managed to take a piece out of one of his wings in an earlier scuffle so he couldn't maintain much of a climb, but he still had quite a bit of stamina left and he was trying to make me tire of the chase. Almost two solid hours passed and my &lt;a href=\"silt%20strider\"&gt;silt strider&lt;/a&gt; was tiring, but I couldn't give up... I had sworn to eliminate the foul beasts to the last and I wasn't about to let it go. If I was going to stop the thing, I'd have to do it fast.\nI pulled my longbow from my back and nocked my last arrow. I took a deep breath and pulled, trying to keep the cliff racer in my sights. It was literally a longshot with the beast gaining distance and the silt strider bouncing me around at full gallop. Finally, with a silent prayer, I released the string. The arrow sang through the air like a howling demon as it sliced its way towards its target. Finally, just as it crested the lip of a foyada, the arrow struck it in the midsection. It let out a horrible cry and fell out of sight.\nMy cries of triumph were quickly stifled by the sound of over a hundred wings. Rising from the foyada was an entire colony of cliff racers and they were out for blood. The blasted thing had led me right to their nest and sacrificed itself with the intent of feeding me to its brood. It was a trap. The damned things had become much too clever. Knowing this was likely the end, I jumped down from the silt strider and hit the back of its leg with the flat of my glass blade. There was no need for the innocent thing to die here today because of my stupidity. As the ash cloud cleared from being stirred up by its massive legs, the cliff racer brood approached. I held my sword high and prepared for the worst.\nThe battle lasted two full days. I was beaten, clawed, bitten and knocked down more times than I care to remember. In the end, seventy-six cliff racers were slaughtered. I was knee-deep in their corpses and my body on the verge of collapse. But I had survived. I smiled to the heavens and all went black.\nWhen I awoke, all I felt was my back on a cold stone floor. Every muscle in my body was on fire, and my vision was blurred. Slowly, I tried to climb to my feet. It took several agonizing minutes, but I finally managed to do it. As my eyes adjusted to the dim light of my new surroundings, I realized that I was standing before &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; himself. He was simply staring at me... floating above his throne and staring at me with his piercing eyes. When I began to prostrate myself as a sign of respect, he held up one of his hands as if to say it wasn't necessary. Was I dead? Was Lord Vivec pleased with me? Was he about to strike me down in anger for my somewhat sordid past?\nSuddenly I understood everything. Suddenly I realized that I was brought here for a reason. I should have died in those ash wastes, but Lord Vivec must have seen something inside me that he hadn't seen in millennia and decided to spare me from my fate.\nThus began my ascent to &lt;a href=\"Canonization\"&gt;Sainthood&lt;/a&gt;. Thus began the rise of Jiub!"}

Not long after, people began saying that while they prayed at his tomb they saw visions of the Mace at the other end of a large chasm. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knight of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Ralvas\"&gt;Sir Ralvas&lt;/a&gt; went the Chapel in the hopes of recovering the mace and saving his dying order. He spent months with little food and rest praying at the altar and trying to reach the mace with no success. He noted that while he felt like everything in the Chasm was real, the priest said he never moved. Soon Ralvas gave up and left the Chapel broken and in despair.

Now their madness poses a significant threat to the Clockwork City.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Asylum%20Sanctorium\"&gt;Asylum Sanctorium&lt;/a&gt;, talk to Alienist Llandras. He will tell you that the sants to which &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; has given mechanical bodies have slowly been going insane over time. He will ask for your help in stopping these creatures before they become too powerful and break free from the Asylum. \nYou can either choose to fight all three saints at once, or you can fight them one at a time. If you opt to fight them all at once, . If you opt to fight them one at a time, head up to the atrium using the ramp to Llandras's left, then continue down the hall until you hit a split path. Each of these paths will take you to one of the saints. \nIf you head to the left, you will be facing Saint Llothis the Pious. Llothis likes to shoot poison at a player, which will give them a serious debuff. He also likes to teleport around and leave poison where he was; get out of this as quickly as possible or you will die. He will also summon robots to aid him in battle; killing these is optional. \nIf you head to the right, your opponent will be Saint Felms the Bold. This boss likes to teleport around the room; do not follow him, as this can cause the fight to reset. He also will throw energy balls at the group; make sure to dodge these, as they will likely kill you. \nOnce both Llothis and Felms are dead, only one saint remains. Head back to the split and proceed through the door there to reach the arena where you will fight your final opponent, Saint Olms. Olms has several tricks up his sleeve. From time to time, he will spawn protectors that must be destroyed before you can damage the boss himself again. He also has a tendency to go jumping around the room; when he does this, block so that you will not die if he targets you. He also has a deadly lightning attack where he will shoot four area of effect spells at every player. When he does this, back off and make sure you do not cross paths with anyone else. The best way to do this is by having everyone stand in a semi-circle around the boss while a tank diverts its attention to the other side.

It is by no means intended to serve as the authoritative work on the matter; rather, it is a personal effort on the part of the author to better understand these unique creatures.\nIn the Service of the Lord.\nIt is beyond the scope of this work to determine the origins of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;. They are &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and as such their base existence is a mystery to those mortal-born. The commonly held belief that all Daedra are incapable of Creation suggests that even Lord Sheogorath himself is not responsible for the genesis of these races. Yet, it is worth noting that the Prince of Madness has motives and powers that none may guess; to attempt to do so would only confuse the subject further.\nIt is enough, then, to see that they exist and know that it is so. Beyond this knowledge, however, it is curious that the Saints and Seducers serve Lord &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; unerringly. This allegiance is ultimate and eternal, from all indications, but its source is unknown. Could it be that they themselves were tricked into service by the Madgod? Or do they simply ally themselves with the greatest power in the realm? Previous literary works suggest that Daedra choose to serve their masters so they might find protection and safe harbor. Clearly the Saints and Seducers have this in the Shivering Isles; indeed, they have fortresses which few not of their race are allowed to enter. They have power in the realm, acting as guardians of those who serve Lord Sheogorath. Constantly they vie for the favor of Our Lord, fighting any who oppose him and, at times, even each other. It is reasonable to assume, then, that they have made a willing choice to take up their role in the Isles.\nCharacter and Society.\nThe immediate image called to mind when hearing the name \"Golden Saint\" suggests an angelic figure, elegant and benevolent. It is ironic then, that while the Golden Saints embody this image in form, their behavior is in stark contrast to it. The Saints are a proud, arrogant race, quick to anger and cruel in their punishment. There is no question that they view all in the Isles as inferior, and make no effort to hide this in their interactions.\nDark Seducers also exhibit little beyond their appearance to match their names. While they too assert their superiority over all others in the realm, they appear to have a more patient, introspective nature about them. They often appear humble in their dealings with mortals, and are known to be patient with the \"lesser races.\"\nIn fact, the terms \"Golden Saint\" and \"Dark Seducer\" are external constructs. While the two groups recognize and respond to these names, they have their own names for their races: The Aureal and the Mazken, respectively. It is possible the Daedra simply have no concern for the names and titles given to them by lesser beings, or perhaps they find amusement in the names. Further research into this subject is necessary but daunting, as the Saints and Seducers do not freely offer personal information about themselves.\nOther information can be gathered from observation. It is easy to see that the two groups are strongly militaristic in their societal structure; one's strength and discipline determines one's place in society. Military commanders, for example, are revered by their subordinates. With further observation, a second distinction becomes apparent: both societies are Matriarchal in nature. Females lead the guards within &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth\"&gt;New Sheoth&lt;/a&gt;, and have the highest positions of power. Males, while not openly denigrated, are clearly subservient to their female superiors. It is unclear where this practice began, but has been wholly integrated into the daily lives of both races.\nConflict and Conquest.\nAny resident of the Shivering Isles can confirm that it is unwise to provoke the Golden Saints and Dark Seducers. They thrive on conflict and warfare, and are quick to punish any and all who disobey. Acting in their capacity as guardians of the realm does not satisfy them, however, and so they often engage in combat with one another, despite being garrisoned in areas where they are unlikely to interact. It is possible that this is more than an outlet for aggressive behavior; repeated engagements between the two races may be an effort to gain favor with Lord Sheogorath. If one can triumph over the other, it would prove superiority and a right to gain sole control over the realm. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Cylarne\"&gt;Battle for Cylarne&lt;/a&gt; is of particular interest, as both sides have been locked in combat with no hope of resolution for time beyond memory. Does this combat serve to sharpen the skills of the two sides, or weaken them when they could be directed elsewhere? If the conflict cannot be resolved, why then does Lord Sheogorath not step in and settle it himself?\nReligion and Ceremony.\nLittle is known about the private customs of the Golden Saints and Dark Seducers. They are reclusive when it comes to matters specific to their race, particularly regarding the mysterious process by which they return to the realm in the unlikely event of their death.\nIt is common knowledge that Golden Saints and Dark Seducers, as &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, cannot be killed. The Animus of the Daedra is cast back into the darkness of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and can return to the realm to take form once more. But reports of the time it takes for a Daedra to return to the realm from the &lt;a href=\"Waters%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Waters of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; are anecdotal and inconclusive; the process by which this return occurs remains shrouded in mystery. Based on behavior patterns and strength of numbers, it can be deduced that the stronghold for each race plays some major part in this process. Common phrases in language (such as \"May the chimes call you home\") suggest that rather than merely a metaphor, sound may play some role in the sequence of events. It is believed that the chimes referenced by Saints and Seducers do indeed exist and are considered almost holy relics. Attempts to gain information about these chimes, or the process by which they are used, has been met with exceptional hostility and so have been abandoned.\nAny and all information regarding the Golden Saints and Dark Seducers, particularly relating to private customs and origins, should be brought to the attention of the author immediately. The greater the scope of our knowledge, the better our ability to understand these compelling creatures."}

Mucianus, seeing the threat in this occurrence offered to go under cover and report the actions of the necromancers to the mages guild.

However, soon after sending them, Hannibal feared that the mages would mistreat Mucianus or see him as a necromancer and kill him. In order to try and prevent this he sent a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;newer member&lt;/a&gt; to the guild he felt he could trust to find Mucianus and safely return him home.\nBy the time the new recruit arrived, only one of the battle-mages, &lt;a href=\"Fithragaer\"&gt;Fithragaer&lt;/a&gt;, were left, and despite their effort to save Mucianus, it was too late. All that was left of the former informant was his reanimated body wandering around the small room the necromancers had left him in.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberation%20or%20Apprehension%3F\"&gt;Liberation or Apprehension?&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraven asks that an informant, Mucianus Allias, in the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nenyond%20Twyll\"&gt;Nenyond Twyll&lt;/a&gt; needs to be found and rescued.

Delitian, as an agent to the throne, sends the Nerevarine to find the anonymous writer of the leaflet, and make him stop his activities.\nWalkthrough.\nTienius Delitian suggests that the Nerevarine speaks to less-reputable citizens in order to obtain information. After talking to any citizen with a high disposition towards the Nerevarine, they are directed towards the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Classes%20%28Morrowind%29%23Pawnbroker\"&gt;pawnbroker&lt;/a&gt; Ten-Tongues Weerhat, that can be found in his shop in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bazaar\"&gt;Great Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;. With a high enough disposition, Weerhat tells the Nerevarine that he knows that Trels Varis is the anonymous writer of \"The Common Tongue\". He does not know him, but has heard his name in the &lt;a href=\"Craftsmen%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Craftsmen's Hall&lt;/a&gt;, and suggest beginning their search there.\nWhen arriving at the Craftsmen's Hall the Nerevarine may find a &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;locked door&lt;/a&gt; labelled \"Stay Out!\" Behind that door a trapdoor leads into a &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Office\"&gt;Secret Office&lt;/a&gt;, where Trels Varis and three of his employees reside. There are multiple possibilities how he can be stopped from further printing his leaflet: The Nerevarine may pay him 3000 for the Orphans and Widows fund. Trels Varis is ready to give up his leaflet to do something good for those poor people. The gold will be covered by Tienius Delitian as expenses. Another possibility, if they have previously spoken to his parents, is to threaten to kill them. Trels Varis prefers to protect his elderly parents. A last option would be to simply kill him.\nAfter the Nerevarine has stopped Trels Varis' activities, they should return to Tienius Delitian to collect their reward.\nReward.\nThe reward depends on the way the quest was solved, and also in one case on Tienius Delitian's disposition towards the Nerevarine. They are given...\nAs can be seen from the above list, threatening Trels Varis is the most lucrative option. If choosing it, Tienius Delitian is most impressed with their \"fine judgement\" and \"light touch.\""}

While unremarkable in most provinces, the creature has gained a large fascination in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; near the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced in . It is a fairly common pastime for Cyrodiillic people to express their dislike for the appearance of a mudcrab to each other. Occasionally, when Cyrodillians are in battle, they throw the taunt, \"I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you!\" at their opponent. This could be taken as a serious insult, as mudcrabs are very weak.\nSpecies of Mudcrab.\nMorrowind Mudcrabs.\nThis species of mudcrab resemble large, brown stones. They use this disguise to both avoid predators and fool prey before attacking with their powerful jaws and pincers, which can transmit &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Fever\"&gt;swamp fever&lt;/a&gt; to their victims.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; Manor District and Council halls in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; are located in a massive shell that once belonged to a mudcrab of incredible size.\nCyrodiilic Mudcrabs.\nThis type does not possess the ability to camouflage itself as a rock. It is also much more crablike in appearance compared to its &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; cousin, in that it has pincer arms instead of jaws. Its back is covered by rock-like bulbs. It can &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;infect&lt;/a&gt; its victims with &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Fever\"&gt;swamp fever&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkyrim Mudcrabs.\nSkyrim mudcrabs look like crabs, like their Cyrodiillic cousins, but are also capable of pretending to be a rock like their Morrowind relatives. They are greyish in color and their back looks like a rock. They often attack in a group of two or three. They burrow themselves in the ground so only their backs are visible to fool potential enemies. Young mudcrabs have flat carapaces. Another remarkable thing about Skyrim mudcrabs is that they are a lot stronger and more aggressive than those from Morrowind and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nHowever, in contrast to them, the Skyrim mudcrabs do not infect other creatures with diseases. Mudcrabs prefer to stay near the water and will not follow their enemies too far away from its home. There also appears to be two distinct genders, or possibly a sub-species, with specimens of differing sizes. Upon visiting the &lt;a href=\"Fossilized%20Giant%20Mudcrab\"&gt;fossilized giant mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;, various sized mudcrabs can be seen at this location. Though weak and easily killed by those with even a low &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt; skill, &lt;a href=\"arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; will not penetrate a mudcrab's shell, instead bouncing back towards the archer, still inflicting damage.\nUnique mudcrabs.\n&lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20Merchant\"&gt;Mudcrab Merchant&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mudcrab living on an island in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He has no physical differences from a regular mud crab, prompting many to attack him. However, it is possible to talk or trade with him, and he has 10,000 gold to spend.\n&lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Mud%20Crab\"&gt;Spectral Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;.\nA spectral mudcrab can be found in &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;. It appears to be a ghostly version of a mudcrab, and can only be killed with &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt;, or magic weapons.\nKing Mudcrab.\nA giant mudcrab, (roughly the size of eight mudcrabs although no stronger), can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Greenmead%20Cave\"&gt;Greenmead Cave&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;cave&lt;/a&gt; halfway between &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;. It guards multiple treasure chests. Other than its size, the giant mudcrab has the same amount of health, damage ratio and &lt;a href=\"Crab%20Meat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;crab meat&lt;/a&gt; as any regular mudcrab. Because of its incredible size, the crab moves far faster than a normal one.\n&lt;a href=\"Fossilized%20Giant%20Mudcrab\"&gt;Fossilized Giant Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;.\nFound in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; at a small pond between &lt;a href=\"Swindler%27s%20Den%20%28Cave%29\"&gt;Swindler's Den&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Fang%20Cave\"&gt;Broken Fang Cave&lt;/a&gt; is the carcass of a giant fossilized mudcrab, approximately the size of the King Mudcrab. It is surrounded by regular mudcrabs of different sizes. This dead giant crab cannot be reanimated by using conjuration spells, as it seems to be only the shell of the gigantic mudcrab.\nGuardian Mudcrab.\nA spectral mudcrab is fought during &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials\"&gt;Kyne's Sacred Trials&lt;/a&gt; and only shows up during this quest. It is apparently the spirit of the Fossilized Giant mudcrab.\nPincer.\n&lt;a href=\"Pincer\"&gt;Pincer&lt;/a&gt; is a small mudcrab in . If an adopted child may bring Pincer home with them and ask if they can keep it. If permission is given, it will stay in the house as long as it lives.\nOld Salty.\nOld Salty is a giant mudcrab, found in . It is a newly introduced giant creature, along with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Tusk\"&gt;Lord Tusk&lt;/a&gt;, a giant &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horker&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearances.\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nOblivion=\nSkyrim=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;"}

With a base casting cost of 144 &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;, casting the spell renders the caster's footsteps completely silent. The spell lasts for 180 seconds (396 seconds when &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;dual-cast&lt;/a&gt;).\nInvisibility.\nBecause the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; footfall can be heard by enemies while &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt;, Muffle is useful when combined with it. Using both spells while sneaking makes the Dragonborn almost impossible to detect by others, unless they bump into them or perform an action. The Dragonborn may also be detected when entering a scripted scenario, such as meeting with a &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt; or any other character that engages in dialogue with them.\nEnchanting.\nThis effect also appears as an enchant capable of being obtained by disenchanting apparel with the effect. This effect is only available with randomly generated vendor items and found items and does not include unique items. Muffle as an enchantment always possesses the full magnitude of the effect, so using the smallest &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; available when applying it to an item is advised. Boots are the only items that can be enchanted with this effect at an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\nUniques.\n&lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Boots\"&gt;Shrouded Boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Shrouded%20Boots\"&gt;Ancient Shrouded Boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Predator%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Predator's Grace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cicero%27s%20Boots\"&gt;Cicero's Boots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Boots\"&gt;Nightingale Boots&lt;/a&gt; are all unique items which come with a special unique variant of the Muffle spell. These passive enchantments bear half the effectiveness of the spell version or normal enchantment, reducing sound from armor by 50%.\nLocation.\nItems with the Muffle enchantment are random and can appear on any vendor that sells boots. It is, however, unleveled and extremely rare. More enhancements become available as the Dragonborn levels, giving Muffle greater competition, and thus, making the chances of finding Muffle increasingly rare at higher levels.\nThere are no fixed locations for a disenchantable item with Muffle. However, after completing the last special job given by &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanryth%20Gatharian\"&gt;Vanryth Gatharian&lt;/a&gt;, will appear in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt;. His shop has a counter with pieces of equipment: enchanted armor (owned) and enchanted boots. There is a chance for the enchantment on the boots to be muffle. If the enchantment is not muffle, it will change when the cell is reset."}

Their bodies are preserved during a burial ritual.\nDescription.\nThe Mummy were originally nobles and leaders during life, and the process of mummification was practiced by both the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. To the former, the process of mummification was a sacred ritual to the Yokudan God of Souls, &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;, when the soul had already left for Tu'whacca in &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. The first step is that the corpse is given various blessings of Tu'whacca, as well as, oils and leaves. Second, they must remove all the internal organs before they decay and cause unsightly stains. This is done so by cutting the head and torso carefully so that they could drain the blood and extract the organs without any mess. Then the third step is the removal of the brain tissue, which is done through the nose via hook-spoons. The fourth step is bathing the body in parch-salt to dehydrate it, followed with the fifth step of replacing the lost volume with an inert material to restore places like the face. Next is wrapping the body in linen wraps, coating the linen in Juniper resin, three times. Then there is the final two, which is adorning the body in jewelry and placing them in a sarcophagus, where they would remain since. Mummies are, unfortunately, resurrected either because of a restless spirit or through the process of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes they are only in their linen and jewelry, but they are sometimes kept in their traditional armor and weaponry."}

It is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and Oblivion is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Land%20Between\"&gt;The Land Between&lt;/a&gt; separates Mundus from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrigin.\nFor all intents and purposes, \"Mundus\" refers to these heavenly bodies alone, as they themselves float in Oblivion. The Mundus is a collaborative construct created by many divine beings. It was first conceptualized by &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who then convinced other &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; (except the &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;-aligned et'Ada, i.e. the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;) to assist him in its construction. Of these et'Ada, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; became the Architect, who drew up the plans for Mundus.\nSome of the et'Ada gave parts of themselves entirely to the creation of Mundus. These became the eight planets of Mundus (not including Nirn); they are also identified as the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, or Aedra. Some Aedra gave themselves completely to their creation and became the &lt;a href=\"Earthbones\"&gt;Earthbones&lt;/a&gt; (Ehlnofey) that form the substance and life of the final planet: Nirn (a.k.a. The Arena). Soon after the planets had formed, Magnus became disgusted at what Mundus was, and so left for &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, his passage ripping a hole in Oblivion (the realm of Daedra that surrounds Mundus and covers it from Aetherius). This rip is viewed as the sun and is responsible for much of Mundus' magical energy. Others soon followed after Magnus; these et'Ada, known as &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;, left smaller holes, which became the stars. Some et'Ada did not manage to escape or chose to stay on Nirn as spirits. These et'Ada changed into the Earthbones or simply wasted away into nothingness.\nTamriel is sometimes known as the \"Arena\"; \"for forces are eternally at struggle. Wealth and subjugation, love and loss, life and death and undeath, inviolate laws of nature, and conversely, magical means of breaking those laws. There are some who even speak of good and evil, but these concepts are subjective and not spiritual. Still, they suggest one more of the many struggles in the Arena of Mundus.\" - &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Geographic%20Society\"&gt;Imperial Geographic Society&lt;/a&gt;\nIt is suggested by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; that Mundus is actually the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of Oblivion, and he was banished from it by mortals.\nInhabitants.\nSome of the Ehlnofey managed to create a stabilized realm in the destabilized Nirn, where they could live like they lived when they were godlike. However, there were still Ehlnofey who wandered the world, hardened and tempered by the harsh world. The Wandering Ehlnofey found the hidden land of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; and expected to be warmly welcomed by their kin. They were not and a war broke out. In the end, the entire world was reshaped and the result of the conflict resulted in at least four continents we know today \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldmer claim another continent, &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;, is the former Old Ehlnofey kingdom, whilst others believe Aldmeris is either ancient Tamriel or a myth. Atmora and Akavir are considered to be, or at least to have at one time been, &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Wandering&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; lands, whereas Yokuda is known to have been cohabitated by &lt;a href=\"Sinistral%20Elves\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Wandering Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; before a great war broke out between its inhabitants. Merkind descends from the Old Ehlnofey, and mankind from the Wandering Ehlnofey. Beastfolk may be found on Akavir and Tamriel, but whether or not they are related to the Ehlnofey is a topic of contentious debate."}

It is located along the south-central coast of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, around the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; on the west side of the &lt;a href=\"Oliis%20Bay\"&gt;Oliis Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The region has different breeds of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and various creatures, including the little-known &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;. It was released as part of its own DLC on October 22nd, 2018 for PC and Mac, and November 6th, 2018 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4.\nBackground.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Vicecanon%20Heita-Meen\"&gt;Vicecanon Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;, Murkmire was one of three regions in Black Marsh to join the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; at its founding in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thornmarsh\"&gt;Thornmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, but this statement has been interpreted to be \"more aspirational than descriptive\" as Murkmire remains an autonomous region with no central authority. Murkmire's environment is uniquely dangerous insofar as much of the land is home to dangerous flora such as &lt;a href=\"Gas%20Blossom\"&gt;Gas Blossom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Static%20Pitcher\"&gt;Static Pitcher&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Catapult%20Cabbage\"&gt;Catapult Cabbage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Lantern%20Mantis\"&gt;Lantern Mantis&lt;/a&gt;es. Six tribes of Argonians inhabit Murkmire: the &lt;a href=\"Bright-Throat\"&gt;Bright-Throat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20People\"&gt;Ghost People&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black-Tongue\"&gt;Black-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Root-House\"&gt;Root-House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miredancer\"&gt;Miredancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dead-Water%20Tribe\"&gt;Dead-Water Tribe&lt;/a&gt;s; each of which are varyingly receptive to the non-native Argonians and other races based out of the city of Lilmoth. While some tribes like the Bright-Throats are hospitable and peaceful, others, like the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; of the Dead-Water Tribe, are aggressive and unwelcoming.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, with financing from &lt;a href=\"Kassandra\"&gt;Kassandra&lt;/a&gt;, a wealthy Argonian noble from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and former slave, the treasure hunting and antiquarian group &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Collections%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic Collections&lt;/a&gt; began organizing expeditions into Murkmire to recover relics from the pre-&lt;a href=\"Duskfall\"&gt;Duskfall&lt;/a&gt; era of Argonian civilization, intending to open a museum in Black Marsh to preserve Argonian history and allow it to be appreciated by the modern Argonians.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Murkmire and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nMurkmire features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSix Skyshards can be found in Murkmire totaling in two &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Murkwood can be considered the most dangerous and inhospitable part of Black Marsh, where many would surely be killed by the noxious air.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nMurkwood is located inside the deep Black Marsh, with the nearest city-state being &lt;a href=\"Blackrose\"&gt;Blackrose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helstrom\"&gt;Helstrom&lt;/a&gt;. The riverways of the province will eventually lead into Murkwood, from the &lt;a href=\"Oliis%20Bay\"&gt;Oliis Bay&lt;/a&gt; to the north. Murkwood is a sprawling forest, with several hedgerows throughout the land. It is heavily misty and is nigh impossible to traverse. The inner sanctum of the first level is a maze of hedgerows that eventually led to the second level, which is merely a small room.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited Murkwood in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion had retrieved the sixth piece of the staff from the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, continuing their quest throughout Tamriel. In their sleep, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; came to the warrior through a dream, telling them where the next piece is, which was Murkwood in Black Marsh. The Champion had then traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, to get an idea on Murkwood's location, and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Idolan%20Lancaster\"&gt;Idolan Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Baal\"&gt;Conclave of Baal&lt;/a&gt;. Before they were given the whereabouts of Murkwood, the priest gave the Champion a proposition: if they retrieved a stone tablet from the &lt;a href=\"Vaults%20of%20Gemin%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Vaults of Gemin&lt;/a&gt;, he will give them what they need. And so, the Champion was able to get the coordinates for Murkwood and retrieved the seventh piece of the Staff of Chaos. The Champion would then set their sites for the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;."}

In this quest, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; finds the seventh piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nMurkwood.\nRecommended effects:\nMurkwood is located close to the center of Black Marsh. It is a large and dark agonizing forest surrounded by fog whose description says that \"screams of lost souls can be heard from the mist.\" This dungeon is composed of two levels; creatures encountered inside it include &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homonculi\"&gt;Homonculi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daemon\"&gt;Fire Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Medusa%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Medusas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Level.\nThe First Level is the Forest itself. This zone is different from any other in the Main Quest, as it does not have fixed paths nor well defined walls. It is a large area surrounded by fog and is inhabited by Wolves, Wraiths, and Homunculi. After the Eternal Champion enters this zone, they must find the door to the Second Level, which is located right in the center of the Forest. Getting lost without a map is extremely easy.\nThe mist of Murkwood is a pervasive problem, as it disturbs the vision and prejudice identification of enemies. Caution should be taken, as the creatures inside the mist can be identified by their auditive signatures\u2014the Wolves will emit a howling sound; Wraiths are identified by their deep moan; and Homonculi make an air-swooshing noise with their wings.\nThe center of the forest is distinguishable from other areas as it is possible to notice several walls which makes the path to the door of the Second Level. When approaching the center of the forest, the Eternal Champion may encounter stronger creatures than those in the larger area. Fire Daemons will be encountered close to the center, while the more dangerous and rare Medusas may be found while walking among the walls to the Second Level.\nThe door to the Second Level is protected by a gate, which shall provide a riddle in order to be opened when reached.\n\"\"To pass this portal, answer my riddle:\"\n\"I tie and hold, capture and bind,\"\n\"yet both knights and knaves doth crave me.\"\n\"I faithfully enslave all within my grasp,\"\n\"whether or not they seek me.\"\n\"Yet those who have never felt my unmerciful hand,\"\n\"are pitied by their fellow Man...\"\"\"\nThe answer is \"Love.\"\nAs the gate opens, the Eternal Champion must proceed to the Second Level.\nSecond Level.\nThe Second Level is nothing more than a little area in which the Seventh Piece of the Staff of Chaos is protected inside a room. The room in which the Staff Piece remains will provide another riddle. If the answer is not correct, several Iron Golems will exit their cages and attack the Eternal Champion, so once more caution should be exercised.\n\"\"A simple riddle for some,\"\n\"A trap of eternity for others,\"\n\"I run smoother than any rhyme,\"\n\"I love to fall but cannot climb.\"\n\"I tremble at each breath of air,\"\n\"And yet can heaviest burdens bear...\"\"\"\nThe answer is \"Water.\"\nThe Eternal Champion can now conquer the Seventh Piece of the Staff of Chaos and get away from the lost forest.\nAmbush.\nOnce more, &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; will send his servants to defeat the Eternal Champion, trustful that his opponent will never complete the Staff of Chaos. After Tharn's subordinates are defeated, the Eternal Champion can now start &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Ur%20%28Arena%20Quest%29\"&gt;their quest to conquer the eighth and final piece of the Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;."}

Even in the egg, she is old and wise. You, too, must become old if you wish to hunt her.\"\nThis is a common theme in &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; culture and folklore, the idea of aging backward or aging prematurely. It can be a confusing concept for outsiders to fully grasp. This isn't surprising. For men and mer, the experience of life happens somewhere between the past and the future. For Argonians, time is much more fluid.\nThis makes the existence and primacy of the Jekka-Wass cultural calendar all the more confusing. Wasseek Saxhleel and many of their regional neighbors place great emphasis on the passage of months and the circular, recurring nature of the Tamrielic year. Some scholars contend that the calendar is just a holdover from the ancient days of the great Argonian stone sculptures. According to the theory, the calendar is a vestigial tail that's lasted through tradition even though it's totally inconsistent with present-day Saxhleel values. I'm not so sure.\nI recently asked a Jekka-Wass elder how they can see time as fluid and murky while maintaining an elaborate and surprisingly accurate calendar. He sat quietly for what seemed like an eternity. Eventually he spoke:\n\"[The calendar] is like a bowl of water. The day and the night swim in the bowl.\"\nI could tell that he wasn't very happy with this answer, but he was resigned to it. His frustration was rooted in both his limited grasp of Cyrodilic and the shortcomings of his native tongue. You see, as far as I can tell, Jel has no tenses; at least nothing that we'd recognize as a tense. The closest substitution I've heard interpreters use is \"old\" and \"new.\" They talk a great deal about \"changing\" and \"becoming\"\u2014words that imply forward motion. But again, these words are obfuscated by all manner of arcane terms and concepts that even I can't decipher.\nI will do my best to understand\u2014but I doubt the murky water will ever become absolutely clear."}

By asking citizens around town of him, the Nerevarine will discover that Flaeus has a \"hidden\" chest within the town, which can be unlocked to obtain the money owed. An alternative to this is to speak to Flaeus, whom, if his &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; is above 90, may give the Nerevarine the key to his chest.\nOnce either method has been pursued, the Nerevarine must return to Arethi to complete the quest. Arethi will take 400 to cover the debt, allowing the Nerevarine to keep whatever is left."}
