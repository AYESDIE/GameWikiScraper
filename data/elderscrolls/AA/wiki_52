For though we are anxious and troubled, we are proud and we are fierce, for we are the Dunmer, and for us, trouble is a gift from the gods.

Secretly, he is also a member of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Attack on the Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; by the Order, he served as an invaluable mole and later as one of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;'s chief lieutenants.\nBackground.\nThe exact time at which Falcar joined the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; is unknown, as is when he joined the Order of the Black Worm. He seemed to develop a particular interest in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;black soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, keeping several in his quarters at the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point he did extensive research on the soul gems at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, leaving behind notes that would be used against the necromancers later on. Eventually, he achieved the Mages Guild rank of &lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, and with it, stewardship of the Cheydinhal Guild. It is known that he was not highly thought of by the other members of the Guild, and often came into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; trainer, &lt;a href=\"Deetsan\"&gt;Deetsan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Guildmaster, Falcar was cold towards his fellow Guild members, and downright cruel to new Associates seeking his recommendation to access training at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. One such Associate, &lt;a href=\"Vidkun\"&gt;Vidkun&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by an impossible test Falcar gave him during his time in Cheydinhal. Frustrated with the fact that Vidkun was not the brightest of mages, Falcar instructed him to retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Burden\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; from within &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20Well\"&gt;the well behind the guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ring was created by Falcar as a means of disposing of Vidkun, who was &lt;a href=\"Burden%20%28Effect%29\"&gt;burdened&lt;/a&gt; upon putting the ring on, and subsequently drowned in the well. &lt;a href=\"Deetsan\"&gt;Deetsan&lt;/a&gt; confronted Falcar about the affair, threatening to report him to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council of Mages&lt;/a&gt;. Citing his hatred of the Guild, Falcar left. The Council formally expelled Falcar and named Deetsan the new Head of the Cheydinhal Guild. Falcar himself reunited with the Order of the Black Worm, which was preparing to make its strike against the Mages Guild.\nAs one of Mannimarco's chief lieutenants, he was tasked with the construction of a &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Black%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Colossal Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;. Traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; ruin and necromancer base of &lt;a href=\"Silorn\"&gt;Silorn&lt;/a&gt;, he and his command began creating the soul gem that would be used to hold the soul of Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;, whose power Mannimarco would siphon into himself.\nIt was decided that Falcar himself would carry the item to Mannimarco in &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Cave%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Echo Cave&lt;/a&gt;, far to the north from Silorn. He and his necromancer guards had barely left the ruin when they were caught in an ambush. Through intelligence channels, the mages had learned of the Colossal Black Soul Gem's construction and had sent a task force of &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s to retrieve it. During the battle that followed, Falcar was killed.\nPersonality and traits.\nFalcar was a rude, abrasive, snobbish member of the Mages Guild, a trait often observed by his fellow Mages. His murder of Vidkun revealed the depths of his cruelty. He had what appeared to be fascinated with black soul gems, researching them at the University, and keeping some in his quarters.\nPowers and abilities.\nFalcar was an Altmer mage, and thus a powerful spellcaster. In addition to his repertoire of Mage spells, he also employed the skills of the Necromancers in his arts. He was also very skilled with a dagger; in his duel with the Champion, he displayed this skill, moving quickly and providing a powerful challenge for the hero. He was also, unsurprisingly, adept at the creation of black soul gems, and also seemed to have some great experience with &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, as shown in his creation of the Ring of Burden, though this may have been a one-time project as a means of killing Vidkun.\nDialogue.\n\"Did you want something? You're not here to join the Mages Guild, are you?\"\n\"What is it, Associate? Don't tell me you're here for a recommendation.\"\nIf approached again:\n\"I find it surprising that you're speaking to me again without having completed your task.\"\n\"What's this? Is this the best your pathetic guild could do? If so, our work will be easier than I suspected. And to think, Traven has sent you to defeat us? I should've killed you outright when I had the chance. Well, life is all about second chances, isn't it? I won't waste this one.\""}

The Forsworn can hide and ambush every assault.\"\nRaerek: \"The safety of the city and our settlements must be our only concern, Igmund. The rest of the Reach is on its own.\"\nIgmund: \"Cowards, the both of you. My father would not sit idly back and wait while evil men take over his lands. We're done discussing this for now.\""}

Falinesti is known as the Walking City, because it moves throughout Valenwood depending on the seasons. It is the seat of power for the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, who have reigned over Valenwood since the beginning of the first era.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nFalinesti is one of the graht-oak, which means that they move accordingly to the seasons. Falinesti has four sites, each located in the four regions of Valenwood. The &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Winter%20Site\"&gt;Winter Site&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Tarlain%20Heights\"&gt;Tarlain Heights&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, between the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gil-Var-Delle\"&gt;Gil-Var-Delle&lt;/a&gt;. Falinesti Winter is situated atop of ancient ruin known as &lt;a href=\"Nairume%27s%20Prison\"&gt;Nairume's Prison&lt;/a&gt;, a frozen ruin that is connected with &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;, the Khajiiti God of Thievery. The site overlooks the southern cliffs towards the sea. The &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Spring%20Site\"&gt;Spring Site&lt;/a&gt; is situated within the depths of the forests in &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;, along the northern road between &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;. Falinesti Spring is in the heart of Greenshade, connecting all three corners of the region. The site has been occasionally been used by &lt;a href=\"Lhurgash%20Clan\"&gt;Lhurgash Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Wood Orcs, but since this was when it disappeared in the second era, it is likely that the Lhurgash did not inhabit the area, most likely until it rooted. The &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Summer%20Site\"&gt;Summer Site&lt;/a&gt; is where the city-state of Falinesti is currently rooted, amidst the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Velyn%20Harbor\"&gt;Velyn Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;. The site in itself is in a stretch of road, that divides the coast and the interior forest. On the outskirts of the city are some rather notable settlements, &lt;a href=\"Deepwoods\"&gt;Deepwoods&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Ladies&lt;/a&gt; that serve &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; are from, and the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Dra%27bul\"&gt;Dra'bul&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent Wood Orc settlement in Valenwood. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Autumn%20Site\"&gt;Autumn Site&lt;/a&gt; is on the edge of the provincial border of Valenwood, just before the trading town of &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha\"&gt;Rawl'kha&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20River\"&gt;Crescent River&lt;/a&gt;. Underneath the ruins is the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Ichor\"&gt;Halls of Ichor&lt;/a&gt;, which contains a temple to &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. Falinesti Autumn is somewhat close to &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; country, near cities of Colovian influence like &lt;a href=\"Greenhill\"&gt;Greenhill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe graht-oaks of Valenwood are large trees with streets and platforms made out of the large branches of the Elden Tree. The people take &lt;a href=\"Platform%20Ferries\"&gt;Platform Ferries&lt;/a&gt; between each of the branching districts, which are connected through a writhing root system that elevates people all throughout the city. Groups of people pull them. One of the more notable districts is &lt;a href=\"Havel%20Slump\"&gt;Havel Slump&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the lower areas of Falinesti. The people of Havel Slump have weekly parties on Morndas. &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Pascost%27s%20Tavern\"&gt;Mother Pascost's Tavern&lt;/a&gt; is located here. Another area is &lt;a href=\"Western%20Cross\"&gt;Western Cross&lt;/a&gt;, which is riddled with the &lt;a href=\"Hoarvor\"&gt;Hoarvor&lt;/a&gt;s of the lowlands. It is near Havel Slump along a bend. At the pinnacle of the tree lies the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Throne\"&gt;Camoran Throne&lt;/a&gt; in Falinesti, the literal seat of power in all of Valenwood. From the outskirts of the city, Falinesti is described as having groves of smaller trees surrounding it, as well as, a gnarled and twisted crown of green and golden leaves, with lengths of vines and shining sap.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Perchance Acorn &amp; Green-Sap.\nFalinesti is one of the Graht-oaks of Valenwood, which all derive from the original Elden Tree, the one seen in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;. The original Elden Tree was grown from the &lt;a href=\"Perchance%20Acorn\"&gt;Perchance Acorn&lt;/a&gt;. The story of the Elden Tree relates to the story of &lt;a href=\"the%20Towers\"&gt;the Towers&lt;/a&gt;, structures that stabilize the barrier between the planes of Nirn and Oblivion. The tower of &lt;a href=\"Green-Sap\"&gt;Green-Sap&lt;/a&gt; is located in Valenwood, but it is not a single structure, rather it is the culmination of each Graht-oak, including Falinesti. The Perchance Acorn had grown into Elden Root, and it moved between the seasons. Falinesti, like the other walking cities, moved between the realms in accordance to the seasons. While the other cities, Elden Root and &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; rooted themselves, Falinesti continued migrating across Valenwood in the four sites we know today, as the Wood Elves took refuge in the branches.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camoran Dynasty &amp; the Second Empire.\nThe city-state of Falinesti had been the capital fo Valenwood for many years, being the seat of power for the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, who began their movement during &lt;a href=\"1E%200\"&gt;Year Zero&lt;/a&gt; with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"King%20Eplear\"&gt;King Eplear&lt;/a&gt;. Eplear united the divided kingdoms of Valenwood under the banner of the Camorans, issuing the First Era as it was unanimously agreed upon. The denizens of the forest took refuge in Falinesti, not just the Wood Elves. Most notably are the &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Apes of Valenwood, and the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orcs\"&gt;Wood Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, variations of the Orsimer that migrated to the forests of Valenwood instead of the northern mountains. The &lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt;s are also known to live Falinesti, alongside the other races. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Valenwood was conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; after their combined force with the &lt;a href=\"Colovians\"&gt;Colovians&lt;/a&gt; of Western Cyrodiil and the abrupt arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; had lost a substantial amount of power. To prevent an uprising, the Empire had given independent power to the &lt;a href=\"Treethanes\"&gt;Treethanes&lt;/a&gt; of Valenwood, turning them into fully-fledged powers from simple trading posts. Falinesti was one of these cities, with the Camorans still residing in the city. At this time, the people of Valenwood were obedient members of the Empire but were not entirely loyal.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Disappearance of Falinesti; Tamriel's Greatest Mystery.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Falinesti had disappeared on its way to the Autumn Site. The once important capital had disappeared for quite some time, leaving the sites available to the wilds. Amidst the city's disappearance, a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Faithful\"&gt;Falinesti Faithful&lt;/a&gt; had begun to appear in the sites, waiting for the city's arrival and pondering its location. Many have theories on why it is no longer in Valenwood, and quite possibly Tamriel, some include the \"Daedric Interference Conjecture\", the \"Accelerated Invisibility Theory\", and the \"Chicken Nonconformity Detonation\". But with Falinesti gone, so is the &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Apes of Valenwood. Most of the Imga population in Valenwood were in Falinesti and were no longer in the province with the city's absence. Humorously enough, the subject of Falinesti's absence has created the vastly popular board game, \"Where's Falinesti?\", Which contains a leather board and pieces made out of turquoise. Many people from the Mages Guild, to the Falinesti Faithful, had tried to uncover the secret, but it remained a great mystery.\nThe Mantle of Rajhin &amp; the Seasonal Sites.\nIn 2E 582, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; had arrived onto the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, with the intent of entering &lt;a href=\"The%20Orrery%20%28Elden%20Root%29\"&gt;the Orrery&lt;/a&gt; and proving her worth as the leader of the Dominion. One of the components to operate the Orrery is a divine spark, and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Nairume%27s%20Prison\"&gt;Nairume's Prison&lt;/a&gt; in the Winter Site, contains &lt;a href=\"Rajhin%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Rajhin's Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact of &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;, the Khajiiti God of Trickery. And so, the Dominion ordered the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Dragoons\"&gt;Jade Dragoons&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"General%20Endare\"&gt;General Endare&lt;/a&gt; to dig up the site for the ruins, much to the dismay of the Faithful. As Endare encountered the mantle, she had become deranged, forced to be stopped by an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion. In the end, the curse on &lt;a href=\"Nairume\"&gt;Nairume&lt;/a&gt; was lifted and the mantle was retrieved for the Dominion. As time went on, the other sites were still doing research, all the while being interfered by groups of the surrounding region. The Spring Site had been overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Lhurgash%20Clan\"&gt;Lhurgash Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Wood Orcs, while the Summer Site was overrun by &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. The Autumn Site had been working alongside the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Telenger%20the%20Artificer\"&gt;Telenger the Artificer&lt;/a&gt;. Although, the site had been overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Arbordawn%20Cult\"&gt;Arbordawn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; herself appearing the Artificer. With gods such as Mephala and Rajhin having a connection to the sites, one can assume that Falinesti is no longer in Nirn.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camoran Usurper; The Rise and Fall.\nSometime in &lt;a href=\"3E%20249\"&gt;3E 249&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; had usurped the throne at Falinesti over his brother, &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Kaltos\"&gt;Camoran Kaltos&lt;/a&gt;. Haymon would conquer the entire province of Valenwood, and amass an army of &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries at the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, eventually moving across Western Tamriel. The Camoran Usurper's onslaught had left many people, including Kaltos in shock, and by the time the Usurper destroyed &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dragontooth\"&gt;Battle of Dragontooth&lt;/a&gt;, support for him had dwindled. By the time he reached the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, his army had weakened substantially, losing at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The aftermath back home is unknown; it was likely that Kaltos inherited the throne. While the Usurper died in vain, his legacy continued through his child, &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, who would go on and initiate the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalinesti during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Falinesti was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Elisgorn\"&gt;King Elisgorn&lt;/a&gt;."}

He agrees to cure their condition if one filled Black Soul Gem is brought to him. The Black Soul Gem must be filled with the Grand Soul of a dead humanoid mortal; anything else will not work. Upon doing so, he leads the vampire to the Summoning Stones where their affliction is cured. The ritual can be performed an unlimited number of times to cure a vampiric condition.

However, I fear General Tullius is underestimating the Stormcloaks. Too often the general has lost good soldiers because he did not take Ulfric and his men seriously. If this continues, and the worst comes to pass, Solitude will pay the price. The Empire is headquartered here, after all.\"\nFalk: \"We don't have the luxury of hanging back to see who wins before choosing our friends, Bryling. You know this. And besides, no Nord with a shred of honor would consider it. We're no cowards. Have faith, Bryling. When this war is over and Ulfric is dead, you'll see that you were jumping at shadows, and nothing more.\"\nBryling: \"Falk, you shouldn't have come. You know what'd happen if people found out about us.\"\nFalk: \"I know, my lady. I just needed to see you outside of court, away from all of the politics.\"\nBryling: \"I'm serious. If Erikur knew about us, he'd force you to resign from your position. And without you, he'd have the Jarl bent around his little finger.\"\nFalk: \"You're right, of course. But when this war is over, I'll gladly resign and we can stop sneaking around like this.\"\nBryling: \"One more reason to pray for the fighting to end then, my love.\"\nFalk: \"It's nearly time to collect taxes on your properties here in the city, Bryling.

He can't simply cancel an appointment with the Jarl! He serves in my capital city!\"\nFalk: \"\"I'm afraid he can. His authority comes from the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;, whom you also serve, technically.\"\"\nElisif: \"He uses all of Haafingar's resources, and doesn't answer to me in the slightest? This hardly seems fair.\"\nFalk: \"\"\"Fair\" is a word rarely applied to politics, my grace. I'm afraid you must learn to accept this.\"\"\nElisif: \"\"Steward, I have an idea that might help to bolster the morale of our people in this difficult time. I think we shall have a grand parade, and let General Tullius march his troops from the Blue Palace to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt; in all their finery.\"\"\nFalk: \"What a... fine idea, my Jarl. However, I would suggest we wait until the war has ended. After all, the General needs his soldiers out in the field, fighting battles against the Stormcloaks.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Bolgeir%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Bolgeir&lt;/a&gt;: \"I must protest, my Jarl. A parade would make you an easy target for a Stormcloak assassin. You're safer here in the palace.\"\nElisif: \"Oh, very well. I can see there's no changing your stubborn Nord minds. But when this war is won, I will have my parade!\"\nFalk: \"Yes, my Jarl.\"\nElisif: \"Steward Falk, I have a task for you. I want to begin stockpiling food and water in the event we come under siege, and I would like you to oversee this work personally.\"\nFalk: \"A wise course of action, my Jarl. However, we have little food or water to spare.\"\nErikur: \"General Tullius will never allow that. He's ordered all surplus food to be given over for the war effort.\"\nFalk: \"General Tullius does not run this city, Thane Erikur. Or have you forgotten your oaths of fealty?\"\nErikur: \"My apologies, Jarl Elisif. I was thinking only of the importance of the war effort.\"\nElisif: \"There's no need for an apology, and you're right about the war. Perhaps this is a matter best discussed with the general in person.\"\nFalk: \"I will make the arrangements, my Jarl.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Varnius%20Junius\"&gt;Varnius&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"I swear to you, unnatural magics are coming from &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;that cave&lt;/a&gt;!

Thank you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sybille%20Stentor\"&gt;Sybille&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"Your eminence, my scrying has suggested nothing in the area. &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is under imperial control. This is likely superstitious nonsense.\"\"\nFalk: \"Perhaps a more... tempered reaction... might be called for?\"\nElisif: \"\"Oh. Yes, of course you are right. Falk, tell &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aldis\"&gt;Captain Aldis&lt;/a&gt; I said to assign a few extra soldiers to Dragon Bridge.\"\"\nVarnius: \"Thank you, Jarl Elisif. But about the cave...\"\nFalk: \"I will have someone take care of the cave as well Varnius, you can rest easy. You're dismissed.\"\nErikur: \"I've heard the Empire plans to levy a tax on our trading ships. Falk, you've got to do something about this.\"\nFalk: \"General Tullius needs more money for the war effort. We need the funds to arm and provision more troops.\"\nErikur: \"Then let's increase the taxes on the farms and merchants. We can't afford to lose the loyalty of the ship captains.\"\nFalk: \"\"We know full well about your investment in shipping ventures, Erikur. I've also heard troubling rumors about dealings between you and the crew of that pirate ship, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wave\"&gt;Red Wave&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, Jarl Elisif cares far less about your lost profits than she does about winning the war!\"\"\nErikur: \"The Jarl would be wise to remember that it is her Thanes\u2015and my profits\u2015that are paying for this war.\"\nSybille: \"Steward, I will need the following reagents for my studies. Please see to them.\"\nFalk: \"Miss Stentor, these are quite expensive. I trust you know how limited the Hold's funds are at this time?\"\nSybille: \"Yes, and I'm also aware of how necessary my divinations and wards have been in the city's defense. My experiments are all I ask for in return.\"\nFalk: \"Very well. But I suspect her grace will not be pleased.\"\nSybille: \"And? I've seen Jarls come and go. This one only became Jarl because her husband died. She'll be replaced in a matter of months.\"\nFalk: \"Miss Stentor, watch your tongue in the Jarl's court!\"\nSybille: \"On threat of what, exactly?

This may well be my final report, but I will not fail my king!\nMy mission was to track a band of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; marauders troubling our borders. The Reachmen fled west past &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt;, then turned north. I followed them into the mountains, but was thwarted by a blizzard. When I tried to take shelter in a cave, the ground collapsed beneath me.\nI have waited two days for rescue, and now my provisions are running low. While I have found a door in this , I cannot open it. My compass still works, so I will head west and scout for high ground. Maybe I'll be able to spot another way out.\nI leave this report here in case I fail to find my way out. If you find it, know that Falkfyr Snowmason did not abandon his duty!\nDay 4: This cavern seems endless. Worse, it is infested with &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant bugs&lt;/a&gt;! Grandpa Isrig used to tell me tales of giant bugs in the &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;swamps&lt;/a&gt; when I was growing up, but I never believed him. Now l know where the bugs come from.\nMy food is gone, but most importantly, I'm out of water. A week's supplies for a four-day scouting mission aren't enough after you fall down a hole. I can see an underground stream from here, though. I have no choice but to sneak past all the giant bugs if I want to refill my canteen.\nIf I succeed, I'll leave another note by the stream. If I fail, know Falkfyr Snowmason died fighting with an axe in each hand!\nDay 5: I know the truth now. This giant cavern is &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;, the underworld from the old tales. I, Falkfyr Snowmason, am the first man to set foot here!\nA giant bug found me while I was filling my canteen. After I slew the beast, I hit upon a ruse. I smeared the bug's ichor all over myself. The others have left me alone since. They hunt by smell, just as I suspected!\nI think I can actually survive down here. When I return to Solitude, I'll be a legend. They will build statues of Falkfyr Snowmason, the scout who discovered Blackreach!\nI will rest now. Tomorrow I will search the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven ruins&lt;/a&gt; above for food. I don't want to risk sampling the mushrooms growing everywhere until I must. I've come too far to give up now.\nDay 6: Those damned &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; left their city locked up tight. I have no way in and nothing to pick their locks. If there's food inside, it's not for me.\nThis morning I ate one of the grayish-white mushrooms. It tasted like undercooked meat. I'll rest today and see if it kills me. If it doesn't, I'll have all the food I need!\nDay 7: The mushrooms aren't poison\u2014I can forage for everything I need. I'm going to live! My tale of survival in the depths of Blackreach will become the stuff of legends!\nI can see a grove of tree-like fungus across the river to the south. I'll try that way next.\n9 Yad Day 9\nMushrooms mushrooms good to eat\nBig and gray they taste like meat\nSmall and blue a tasty treat\nGlowing green they sing so sweet\nI can eat all the mushrooms down here. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Oom\"&gt;Great Oom&lt;/a&gt; says so. The Great Oom wants me to go south. I think I blink I sink I'll go south.\nThere was something I was supposed to be looking for but I don't remember what it was. It doesn't matter. All the roots know my name now.\nDay ?\nI am chosen. The Great Oom will make me a spore, and I, Snowfalk Masonroot, will live forever. The roots know the truth. The roots, the ooms, the singing, they're all connected. It runs so deep!\nThere is a door below but that way is not for me. The Great Oom tells me about the north now, a home both fetid and warm. I can leave my treasures there because I won't need them anymore. I am a spore and soon I will be an oom. I will be all ooms.\nFind my home and spread my roots.\nDay ? Doesn't matter.\nThe air sings of purple and blood waters the stone. The spores of the Great Oom take root. It will not be long now.\nI eat of the dirt and drink of the dark. I am home now. We are home.\nThe shell crumbles but the skitters take no notice. It is inside and it is ready.\nSpeak, Great Oom! Speak of the Rootmason! Speak to me once more of the buried dream!\nIt is time for me to grow."}

The name comes from the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, who made a great many elven ruins in the area. Falkreath is known for its death and melancholy themes as it is the home of Skyrim's vast graveyards, holding the remains of many fallen warriors from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. Falkreath is considered a part of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nFalkreath is situated on the southernmost roads in Skyrim and is not far from the borders leading into the city of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; wastes, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Falkreath itself is a relatively small town compared to the likes of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. In its prime, Falkreath was a well-guard stronghold that was able to withstand the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; from the west and even the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the besieged &lt;a href=\"First%20Orsinium\"&gt;First Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalkreath generally has a straight path that goes through the city from the east and west. The middle of town is vast and houses a single water well in the middle. East of the Southern Gate leads up a hill to the Jarl's Longhouse, which overlooks the rest of the city. West of the Southern Gate leads into the Hall of the Dead, which goes deep into the ground, there is a chamber dedicated to Falkreath's founder, &lt;a href=\"Bjarfrud%20Skjoralmor\"&gt;Bjarfrud Skjoralmor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area of Falkreath once had many &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;Snow Elf&lt;/a&gt; ruins, and they gave the city its name, which came from the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Language\"&gt;Falmer Language&lt;/a&gt;. The Men-of-Kreath were herded by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s from the north down to &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Legend of Lord Skjoralmor &amp; Falkreath.\nThe city of Falkreath was founded by &lt;a href=\"Bjarfrud%20Skjoralmor\"&gt;Bjarfrud Skjoralmor&lt;/a&gt;, the origins of Falkreath is widely unknown, only told through legends passed down for generations. According to legend, Bjarfrud drove the dangerous beast out of the forest and chopped the trees down with ferocity. Falkreath was founded from the trees he had harvested. Eventually, he was crowned the first &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Falkreath after driving out the beasts and building the city. His descendants would rule for a very long time, even into the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Western Skyrim and King Svartr.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt;, who was a close ally of Versidue Shaie and was unfortunately assassinated around the same time in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;. Eyes were looking towards &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, Logrolf's daughter, assuming she would become the next High Queen leading Skyrim into the future. Controversy would soon arise from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; would claim that Freydis was illegitimate for the throne and that a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt; was required to determine the new leader. The Moot had spoken, and the leaders of Skyrim voted for Svartr to become the High King. However, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;, the one that has chosen the High King for generations since &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; had chosen Freydis to become the High Queen. The province became divided, the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; followed Freydis while the Nords of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; followed Svartr. Skyrim had split into two separate kingdoms which would later affect the province for the next few years. The city of Falkreath, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; region, would join the Western Skyrim Kingdom.\nThe War on Falkreath; Yashnag &amp; the Orcs of Skyrim.\nThe province of Skyrim has been inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; for several years, with strongholds ranging from the great fortress of &lt;a href=\"Cradlecrush\"&gt;Cradlecrush&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; to the rigged fort of &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Khazgur\"&gt;Mor Khazgur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;.

The Orcish Warrior named &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%20gro-Yazgu\"&gt;Yashnag gro-Yazgu&lt;/a&gt; traveled with his people across the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the forest of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Falkreath\"&gt;Western Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, where they established a chiefdom under Yashnag. &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%27s%20Chiefdom\"&gt;Yashnag's Chiefdom&lt;/a&gt; was a pox on the people of West Skyrim, causing strife on High King Svartr's Army and the people of Falkreath. Yashnag would eventually murder the Jarl of Falkreath during his conquest over the Hold. The Jarl's son, &lt;a href=\"Hakkvild\"&gt;Hakkvild&lt;/a&gt; would seek out Yashnag for vengeance. Hakkvild challenged Yashnag in his home and defeated him in a battle of brawns. Hakkvild would become known as Yashnag-Slayer and would become the next Jarl of Falkreath. Yashnag's Chiefdom was burned down in &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;2E 467&lt;/a&gt;. The Orsimer would evacuate back into the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; would come to creation under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Siege of Falkreath Hold; Enter Domihaus.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Falkreath was under the rule of Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hjurgol%20Skjoralmor\"&gt;Hjurgol Skjoralmor&lt;/a&gt;, who coincided with the other regions in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, under the control of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Svargrim\"&gt;Jarl Svargrim&lt;/a&gt;. News would spread throughout the Hold about an impending invasion conjured by the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; from the west. Hjurgol had denied the rumors, which proved to be his downfall. The &lt;a href=\"Dreadhorn%20Clan\"&gt;Dreadhorn Clan&lt;/a&gt; would invade the city of Falkreath using powerful necromancy and the sheer force of the &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s. The Dreadhorn Clan, under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Domihaus%20the%20Bloody-Horned\"&gt;Domihaus the Bloody-Horned&lt;/a&gt;, would overwhelm the fortress city on all fronts and would raid the Hall of the Dead. &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eerika%20Skjoralmor\"&gt;Eerika Skjoralmor&lt;/a&gt; would lead the defense against the Reachmen, but the siege had dwindled their numbers considerably. It was not until a mysterious traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and their band of warriors arrived was when the battle shifted to Falkreath. Eerika led the remaining survivors to the Hall of the Dead, to evacuate them to a nearby settlement, ideally &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige's entourage defeated the siege from the east, by slaying &lt;a href=\"Morrigh%20Bullblood\"&gt;Morrigh Bullblood&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Mammoth\"&gt;Siege Mammoth&lt;/a&gt;. By advancing into the central square, the group was able to kill a triad of necromancers and their hulking &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus\"&gt;Bone Colossus&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Cernunnon\"&gt;Cernunnon&lt;/a&gt; before reaching the Hall of the Dead. Jarl Hjurgol was residing in his Longhouse, located on the southern hill, overlooking his city as it was being besieged. When the Vestige and Eerika arrived into the Jarl's Hall, he would quickly be killed by Domihaus. The Vestige fought the Minotaur with ferocity. Domihaus was a master in both &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; Magic, utilizing the Minotaurian Magma destruction magic as well as the elemental atronachs and the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Atronach\"&gt;Stone Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Domihaus was defeated, and the city of Falkreath was saved. Eerika Skjoralmor would be named the Jarl of Falkreath soon after.\nCuhlecain of Colovia; The Rise of Tiber Septim.\nThroughout the years, the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; has changed. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; had gone for several years; the power shifted in between the Alliances until the war ultimately gave way. The city of Falkreath was integrated into the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, a separate government consisting of the kingdoms of Colovia. The once proud kings of Colovia became Thief-Barons and forming forgotten covenants. The city of Falkreath was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;King Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, who envisioned a united Colovia under his reign but to do this, he needed to secure the Falkreath Hold border to the north, where Nords and Reachmen always fought. Cuhlecain amassed an army with his allies in Skyrim with his prized general, &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt; leading the helm. Hjalti was a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic warrior from the island fiefdom of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Hjalti was a shrewd tactician and utilized an ancient art of Nordic Warfare known as the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to burst open the impenetrable gates of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;. Hjalti would then be known as &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; and would unify the continent of Tamriel under the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; as Tiber Septim.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalkreath during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Falcrenth was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Bjeld\"&gt;King Bjeld&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skyrim Civil War and Jarl Siddgeir.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Falkreath was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Siddgeir\"&gt;Jarl Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt;, who had recently inherited the throne from his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%20of%20Stuhn\"&gt;Dengeir of Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign, Siddgeir was aloof and had very little involvement in the politics of Falkreath. The one who was actually in charge was his steward, &lt;a href=\"Nenya\"&gt;Nenya&lt;/a&gt;, who served Dengeir and the Jarls before him. Falkreath was in support of the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the Civil War, much to the dismay of Dengeir. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; were stationed in the Jarl's Longhouse with &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Skulnar\"&gt;Legate Skulnar&lt;/a&gt; controlling the Falkreath Chapter. Dengeir is a staunch supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, a rebellious faction from the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, under the control of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. Dengeir believed that Siddgeir used his influence in the Imperial Legion to secure his role as the Jarl of Falkreath. However, Dengeir has been known to be quite the loon."}

It is the capital of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The town lies in the southwest of the province of Skyrim, near the borders of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. At one period in history, Falkreath was part of Cyrodiil. Later, the town became a settlement in Skyrim. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the events of take place, the Jarl of Falkreath is &lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt;, having succeeded his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%20of%20Stuhn\"&gt;Dengeir of Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is famous for its large graveyard, in which many &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; are buried. The main stronghold that defends Falkreath, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;, is located on the opposite side of the hold, near the border with the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; and the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;. The name comes from the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Language\"&gt;Falmer Language&lt;/a&gt;, who made a great many elven ruins in the area.\nGeography.\nThe city lies in a valley near the center of Falkreath Hold, in the low-lying forest area some distance west of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;. Like many of Skyrim's woodland settlements, Falkreath's economy is heavily reliant on the production of lumber. It is one of the smaller major cities, with no real walls surrounding it and not many buildings. The town is far more similar to a small farming village rather than a major city. The Hammerfell border can be accessed by road a short walk west of the city. The graveyard of Falkreath contains many famous Nords who requested to be buried in Falkreath, next to the other honored dead of past battles. Since they were constantly living alongside the dead, the people of Falkreath gave many of their shops and other buildings names related to death. As told by the residents, Falkreath was the place of many battles in the past, being the main reason for the large graveyard.\nHistory.\nPre-Alessian era.\nEarly Nords, called Men-of-'Kreath, were a tribe mentioned in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adabal-a\"&gt;The Adabal-a&lt;/a&gt;\" that migrated from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; to Skyrim, as the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s moved to the ice island from &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. While part of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; conglomerate, the Men-of-'Kreath were an independent tribe on their own; it is also possible that the Colovians too were a group of separate tribes who later found the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, before the unification of Cyrodiil. Thus, they were most likely a North Colovian tribe living in the area of modern Falkreath. This is likely, as Falkreath has been historically considered a part of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, not Skyrim. The Men-of-'Kreath evidently spoke a Colovian dialect unique from the other tribes, believed to contain some &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; words. But, many Nedic tribes, especially in Cyrodiil and Hammerfell, were &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTime of Tiber Septim.\nDuring the time of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Falkreath in West &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, was in a bad situation. To make any bid at unifying the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, he needed to secure his northern border, where the Nords and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; had been fighting for centuries. He allied with Skyrim at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hrol%27dan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hrol'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Leading his forces was Hjalti Early-Beard. Hjalti was from the island kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and would become Tiber Septim, the First &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Daedra%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;A Daedra's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must assist &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, the hound of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, in returning to his master's shrine in &lt;a href=\"Haemar%27s%20Shame\"&gt;Haemar's Shame&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Speak%20to%20Lod\"&gt;Find the Dog Outside Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Daedra%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;A Daedra's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn can speak to &lt;a href=\"Lod\"&gt;Lod&lt;/a&gt;, who asks them to find his dog.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter%20and%20Hunted%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Hunter and Hunted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must assist &lt;a href=\"Valdr\"&gt;Valdr&lt;/a&gt; by recovering the bodies of his friends after they were killed by &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ill%20Met%20by%20Moonlight\"&gt;Ill Met by Moonlight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must assist &lt;a href=\"Sinding\"&gt;Sinding&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, by gaining Hircine's favor.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Liberation of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn has completed \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Stormcloaks%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; asks them to conquer all holds in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Reunification%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Reunification of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn has completed &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Imperial%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; asks them to conquer all holds in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20Falkreath\"&gt;Thane of Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy talking to Jarl Siddgeir, the Dragonborn can gain the title of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of Falkreath Hold."}

According to legend, there is an ancient temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; located deep within in the forest.\n&lt;a href=\"Central%20Falkreath\"&gt;Central Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral Falkreath is the epicenter of the region, regardless of the name. The capital of Falkreath Hold is located here; the city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; is home to one of the largest gravesites in Skyrim, due to the widespread acts of war throughout the region. Falkreath was once a part of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, a separate government from the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which dates back to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the biggest lake in Skyrim and takes a vast majority of Central Falkreath, and has a wide variety of fish and other aquatic creatures. The center of the Ilinalta has the &lt;a href=\"Lover%20Stone\"&gt;Lover Stone&lt;/a&gt;, one of the many guardian stones that inhabit Skyrim. The southern roads lead into &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Falkreath\"&gt;Eastern Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;.\nEastern Falkreath is more mountainous than the other regions of Falkreath Hold, due to its proximity to the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The region has a clear border between the evergreens of the forest to a thicket of snow covering the valley. Several &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; strongholds exist in the region, as the area is close to the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the road that leads into the Imperial Province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. The town of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; is one of these strongholds and it just so happens to be one of the latest ones, as the others have been used by either &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt;s or even &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s. To the northwest is the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, a large river that starts from the Ilinalta and ends at the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt;, near the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. This is one of the larger rivers in Skyrim, equaling the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;. Several other landmarks such as the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Den\"&gt;Steelheart Cleft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt; exist across Eastern Falkreath.\nFauna.\nSlaughterfish and Ilinalta fish.\nLake Ilinalta is home to multiple creatures found across Falkreath Hold and even the northern &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; region. This is due to the fact that the Ilinalta is one of the biggest water sources in Skyrim. Many inhabitants, including the Nords of Falkreath, benefit from the lake. The lake hosts a wide variety of fish found exclusively in the Ilinalta, ranging from the &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty\"&gt;River Betty&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Spadetail\"&gt;Cyrodilic Spadetail&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Barnacle\"&gt;Nordic Barnacle&lt;/a&gt;, which are found in the depths of the Ilinalta. One of the common most predators in Tamrielic waters is the &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt;; a large fish with sharp teeth and a long snout. Swimming in the water can be quite dangerous since the Slaughterfish can be as formidable as a &lt;a href=\"Shark\"&gt;Shark&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The Slaughterfish tends to travel and hunt alone but can be found with one or two in large bodies of water, like the Ilinalta. Regardless of their danger, the scales of a Slaughterfish and the eggs are sought out by &lt;a href=\"alchemists\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; since they can Fortify Stamina and give Resistance to Frost and Poison. Slaughterfish can also be made into a Slaughterfish fillet, which requires &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Salts\"&gt;Fire Salts&lt;/a&gt;, ground black pepper, vinegar, and an alder wood plank. A Slaughterfish is commonly paired with the &lt;a href=\"Trodh\"&gt;Trodh&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpriggans.\nFalkreath's Pine Forest is home to all sorts of strange creatures that harness the power of the Green to kill those that enter their territory. One of these creatures includes the &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s. Over time, the Spriggan has changed appearance to resemble a feminine-esque creature with a body made out of wood and flowers. During the Second Era, the Spriggan had this form except with a spider-like lower torso. But by, the Third Era, their legs resemble that of a human, albeit with the same wooden hollow body. Spriggans are found mostly in groves and clearings in the forest. Places such as &lt;a href=\"Moss%20Mother%20Cavern\"&gt;Moss Mother Cavern&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Peak%27s%20Shade%20Tower\"&gt;Peak's Shade Tower&lt;/a&gt; are notable for their Spriggans. The Spriggan has a tendency to utilize the animals of the Forest such as &lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat\"&gt;Sabre Cat&lt;/a&gt;s to help fight against an invader, but without them, the Spriggan can be a tough prey to kill since they instantly restore their health in a near-death status. Spriggans are not widespread in Skyrim, they are mostly found in Falkreath Hold and &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;, but they can be found in pockets throughout Skyrim, in places such as &lt;a href=\"Shadowgreen%20Cavern\"&gt;Shadowgreen Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Eldergleam Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolves.\nOne of the most common predators to roam Tamriel, in general, is the &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. Wolves tend to come in packs of three or four and can attack a passerby all at once or one at a time. Many areas in Falkreath Hold are used as wolf dens, such as &lt;a href=\"Brittleshin%20Pass\"&gt;Brittleshin Pass&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Southfringe%20Sanctum\"&gt;Southfringe Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Hold is very close to the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, a sub-species of wolves called the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wolf\"&gt;Ice Wolf&lt;/a&gt; inhabit the southern mountains; they are stronger than the regular wolf found in the Pine Forest. When attacked by a wolf, be sure to keep your guard, since, as mentioned before, they tend to come in packs. A wolf would attack by pouncing on their prey and overwhelming them with their massive weight. Defeating a wolf would require steady footing and a sharp weapon that can cleave through them. Wolves are usually hunted for their pelts and their piercing fangs. Hunters from Falkreath and even &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; hunt in the Pine Forest and even as far as the mountains. Falkreath is considered to be a part of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, and because of that, there are sightings of the &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Wolf\"&gt;Dire Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. The Dire Wolf is ideally a super wolf that is large enough to be mountable. Dire Wolves are used as mounts from places as far as Falkreath Hold to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nGhosts.\nThe region of Falkreath Hold is one of the most ominous places in Skyrim, with the Dark Brotherhood having a presence in the area and the massive graveyard located in Falkreath City. The merchants of Falkreath have used the historical significance of the war-torn region to reflect the themes of death and mortality in their business. This has given Falkreath a unique identity that differentiates itself from the rest of the Nine Holds of Skyrim. Of course, with a ravaged region such as Falkreath, there are bound to be a few &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s to inhabit the area. The Ghosts of Falkreath remained in the forest throughout history from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Zombies, of course, take on an ethereal form of their former physical body and float in the air like a gust of cold wind. Since the Dark Brotherhood lives within the forest, many vengeful spirits seek their killers. Ghosts tend to remain on Nirn, rather than moving on into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, usually because they have unfinished business and as a result, are bound to the physical world. Ghosts are found deep in the forest, but can be found roaming crypts or even &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;Nordic Tombs&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Shriekwind%20Bastion\"&gt;Shriekwind Bastion&lt;/a&gt; or ruined structures like &lt;a href=\"Ilinalta%27s%20Deep\"&gt;Ilinalta's Deep&lt;/a&gt;.\nWerewolves.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20cult\"&gt;Daedric cult&lt;/a&gt;s have had cells located throughout Falkreath Hold. They range from a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampiric&lt;/a&gt; cult of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern mountains in &lt;a href=\"Haemar%27s%20Shame\"&gt;Haemar's Shame&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Nightingales\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt;, a trio of highly skilled thieves dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;. Because of Falkreath's abundance in hunting game, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Hunt, has significant influence throughout the region. As a result, several Nords contracted &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;. Werewolves are large bipedal wolves that are bigger than any creature that roams the Pine Forest. They have gnarly fangs that can chew through an Iron Shield, and large claws that can cut a thick Pine tree in the forest. Many followers of Hircine see Lycanthropy as a blessing from their Daedric Prince and utilize the ability to slay their enemies when they are out numbered. Those who want to prove themselves to Hircine would travel across Falkreath Hold to hunt a mythical creature called the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stag\"&gt;White Stag&lt;/a&gt;, slaying the beast would reveal the Aspect of Hircine. &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Man%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Bloated Man's Grotto&lt;/a&gt; is where many go after killing the White Stag in cold blood.\nFlora.\nFalkreath Hold can be quite mountainous, from the north in the &lt;a href=\"Brittleshin%20Pass\"&gt;Brittleshin Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, to the east with the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, and to the south in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"Alchemists\"&gt;Alchemists&lt;/a&gt; travel to Falkreath to search for alchemical ingredients to make the best potions and poisons. Falkreath Hold grows a vast amount of &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;Mountain Flower&lt;/a&gt;s; the Mountain Flower is the best ingredient to make reagents such as a Potion of Health or a Potion of Stamina. What makes the Flower distinct is that they come in four different colors, they come in Blue, Red, Purple, and Yellow. The &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;Blue Mountain Flower&lt;/a&gt; rejuvenates the consumer's health and fortifies their &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; skills. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;Red Mountain Flower&lt;/a&gt; gives the user a boost in &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, but can be harmful to their health. The &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;Purple Mountain Flower&lt;/a&gt; rejuvenates the consumer's stamina and fortifies their sneaking skills. They also give the consumer resistance to frost, making them the perfect ingredient to travel in Skyrim. The &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Mountain%20Flower\"&gt;Yellow Mountain Flower&lt;/a&gt; is the rarest one in Skyrim, only found in certain clearings and the &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Glade\"&gt;Ancestor Glade&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden grove in the Jerall Mountains. The Yellow one gives the consumer resistance to diseases and fortifies their health.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nightshade\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt; of Falkreath Hold has been associated with death and more so with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Those who perform the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;, use Nightshade petals in the ritual as a way to give a contract. Nightshades are also employed in sacrifices for &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, full Nightshades and several other ingredients to send a soul to &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightshade is a thin flower with dark purple leaves and dark green stem; they are commonly associated with the Dead, which plays into the themes of Falkreath. Nightshades can be used as a basic poison since it can ravage Health, it can also be a burden to stamina, causing the strength to drain away. They can also give a boost in the &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; school of magic. Nightshades are found around areas with the dead such as the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Falkreath%29\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Graveyard\"&gt;Falkreath Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Brotherhood grows Nightshades to make poisons for their targets. Nightshades are also considered a bad omen to the Nords of Skyrim, and they usually stay away.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thistle%20Branch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thistle Branch&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most common flowers to be found in Falkreath Hold, but as much as the &lt;a href=\"Tundra%20Cotton\"&gt;Tundra Cotton&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The Thistle is located along the mountain ranges in Eastern Falkreath, in the area in between the Pine Forest and the Snowy Mountains. The Thistle is particularly thorny, throughout the stem and it has thin purple petals on the top. This plant has excellent alchemic properties because the plant gives good resistance to both poison and frost, as well as enhancing the Heavy Armor skill. Thistle Branch can also be grown underground, places such as &lt;a href=\"Embershard%20Mine\"&gt;Embershard Mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shriekwind%20Bastion\"&gt;Shriekwind Bastion&lt;/a&gt; have been documented with increasing patches of Thistle throughout the caverns. The Thistle, of course, has adverse effects, the Thistle can be ravaging to the Stamina, making it useful for stamina draining poison.\nGovernment.\nThe city of Falkreath is the capital of the entire region, which is, of course, the case. Falkreath in itself is a small settlement, larger than other cities such as &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;, but not as big as cities like &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of Falkreath govern smaller settlements by opposing taxes and giving them representation in the Court of Falkreath; these settlements include the towns of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neugrad%20Watch\"&gt;Neugrad Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Falkreath Hold is a vast region, much larger than the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; region in the northeast and greater than the &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; Hold in the north-northwest.\nFalkreath Hold was once a part of an alliance with the western holds, that has diminished for some time, but has spiritually remained into modern times. The Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; was an alliance with the regions of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; that was separate from the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; in the east. This alliance was led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Svartr\"&gt;King Svartr&lt;/a&gt;, who fought for the position of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm. The alliance lasted for several years and was ruled by Svartr's descendant, &lt;a href=\"Svargrim\"&gt;Svargrim&lt;/a&gt;. The West Skyrim alliance faded away sometime before the rise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, but it remained embedded in the hearts of the western holds, keeping them close together as the Old Holds with each other. Skyrim was divided in the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; was murdered by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. The holds of West Skyrim, except for &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, was with the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraditionally, the head of Skyrim's Holds are called &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s. Jarls are sovereign kings that gain their status through honorable acts such as defending the Hold, sometimes, they are given by birthright, this was the case for the Fourth Era Jarl of Falkreath, &lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt;, who inherited the throne from his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%20of%20Stuhn\"&gt;Dengeir of Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;. The Jarl lives in a large keep called the Jarl's Longhouse, which is sometimes built like a Mead Hall, like with the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; in Windhelm. The Jarl's Longhouse in Falkreath is located in the center of the city, surrounded by the local shops and inns. The Jarl is not the only to govern the Hold; they have several assistants that serve different roles. The &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;Court Wizard&lt;/a&gt; is the local wizard that serves the Jarl in magical and other occurrences in their domain. Ranging from learning the magical abilities of a spell or researching ancient tablets dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Court Wizards can even sell spells and incantations to passersby coming into Falkreath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt; is the Jarl's assistant, their second in-command. They tend to help the Jarl in maintain the Hold and to deal with mundane everyday things. Stewards organize bounties in the Hold, and have the local &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt; distribute them among the local gathering spots such as the Inn and the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. They also gather the townsfolk for meetings and organize events such as holidays. The &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of a Hold is a champion to the people of a Hold, generally given to those, who have helped the people from a threat or has had enough wealth to win the title. The Jarl and Thane are given a bodyguard called the &lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt;, they are sworn protectors of both the Jarl and Thane.\nReligion.\nFalkreath Hold, along with the other holds in Skyrim, was once a part of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and were given one of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Falkreath is one of the few cities in Skyrim not to have a temple dedicated to a divine. The only divine with a shrine in Falkreath is &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, the god of the circle of life. Arkay is worshipped throughout the Empire in places such as &lt;a href=\"County%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;County of Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20the%20Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Barony of the Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Arkay is the patron of life and is related to the seasons. His followers are commonly used in funerals or burials, to have Arkay help pass the deceased's soul into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. Falkreath's theme of death goes well with Arkay's ideals; the graveyard is tended by priests of Arkay. The &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic version of Arkay is the God of Mortality, &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, whose priests are commonly the caretakers of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. The Hall of the Dead is an underground sub-section of a city where many of the city's residents are buried, along with family and friends. Arkay has a shrine in a house located on the northwestern end of town.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Western Skyrim.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt;. Not much is known about his reign, other than that he was assassinated by an unknown assailant. Many eyes were looking at &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to be the next High Queen of Skyrim and this was to be true when the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; chose her to be the next leader. However, the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Freydis was not a legitimate heir to the throne and a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt; was required to determine the next High King/High Queen. The Moot had chosen Svartr to become the High King of Skyrim and was selected so by the Kings of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. As mentioned before, the Crown of Verity chose Freydis to become High Queen, and she has been selected so by the Leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. It was at that moment, the province of Skyrim was split into two separate kingdoms, one controlled by High King Svartr and one controlled by High Queen Freydis. The Kingdom of Western Skyrim would monitor the cities of Solitude, &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim would control the cities of Windhelm, &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;. These two kingdoms would remain divided for quite some time.\nYashnag and the Orcs of Skyrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Orsinium was besieged by the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in the attempt to destroy the rising Kingdom of Orcs in &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Remnants of Orsinium traveled all across &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; from places as far south as &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; and as far east as Falkreath Hold. An &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish chieftain named &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%20gro-Yazgu\"&gt;Yashnag gro-Yazgu&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Western Falkreath to reclaim the land originally stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Falkreath Hold. Yashnag swept through West Skyrim like the plague, causing trouble for the Court of Solitude and High King Svartr. Svartr's men were unable to hold back the growing force of &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%27s%20Chiefdom\"&gt;Yashnag's Chiefdom&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; was dealt worse by the Orcish berserkers; the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Falkreath was murdered by Yashnag during a battle, resulting in the Jarl's son to assume the throne of a weakened kingdom. &lt;a href=\"Hakkvild\"&gt;Hakkvild&lt;/a&gt; challenged Yashnag to a duel, to avenge his father and his land. Yashnag accepted and was ultimately defeated by Hakkvild. Hakkvild received a new nickname, dubbing him, Hakkvild Yashnag-Killer. The new Jarl burned down Yashnag's Chiefdom in &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;2E 467&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Orcish Kingdom in Falkreath. Yashnag had a legacy that inspired many Orcs to follow in his footsteps. One of these notable Orcs was &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;, who brought together the Orsimer in Wrothgar and established the second Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Siege of Falkreath Hold.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the region of Falkreath Hold was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hjurgol%20Skjoralmor\"&gt;Hjurgol Skjoralmor&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the Kingdom of Western Skyrim was under the sovereignty of &lt;a href=\"Svargrim\"&gt;High King Svargrim&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of Svartr and leader of Solitude since &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt;. Svargrim was in his twilight years but remained the leader of Western Skyrim through sheer determination. West Skyrim was not involved with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; that swept across Tamriel like the plague since both kingdoms have split since the Akaviri Potentate. West Skyrim, including Falkreath Hold, was not a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, nor their competitors.\nAround the same year, the city of Falkreath was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"Dreadhorn%20Clan\"&gt;Dreadhorn Clan&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Domihaus%20the%20Bloody-Horned\"&gt;Domihaus the Bloody-Horned&lt;/a&gt;. Domihaus had fronts surrounding the city and simultaneously attacked the gates. The defense was led by &lt;a href=\"Eerika%20Skjoralmor\"&gt;Eerika Skjoralmor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of Falkreath and the daughter of the Jarl. The eastern front was led by &lt;a href=\"Morrigh%20Bullblood\"&gt;Morrigh Bullblood&lt;/a&gt;, and she used a &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Mammoth\"&gt;Siege Mammoth&lt;/a&gt; to break down the gate. Her efforts were halted when a group of warriors led by a traveler named the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; killed her and defeated the eastern front. Eerika tasked the travelers to help her in the conflict by bringing the survivors to the Hall of the Dead on the southeastern portion of town. With the survivors secured, the group was sent to the Jarl's Longhouse on the hill to find Jarl Skjoralmor, to protect him from the Dreadhorn Clan. He was, however, murdered by Domihaus. The group defeated Domihaus and saved the city of Falkreath from the Reachmen.\nCuhlecain and the rise of Tiber Septim.\nFalkreath Hold was once a part of the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, a separate government in Cyrodiil that takes up a significant portion of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of Falkreath was a man named &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;. Cuhlecain wanted to unite the Kingdoms of Colovia but need to secure the northern borders where many &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; have fought for centuries. Cuhlecain and his allies led a force at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt; with his prized general from &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;. The walls of Hroldan were impenetrable, and he was not expecting reinforcements from the city of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. At one moment, Hjalti used the power of the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt; to break down the walls of Hroldan and defeated the Reachmen in the region. The Nords present in the battle began to call him Hjalti Talos, or Stormcrown.\nCuhlecain utilized his general to unite the Colovian Estates and to reclaim the Eastern &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt;. Before Cuhlecain would be crowned &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, he would be assassinated by Hjalti, leaving Talos to become the Emperor of Tamriel. The assassination was blamed by warriors from the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Hjalti Talos would be crowned Emperor by &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; and be renamed to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim would soon unite the provinces of Tamriel by ending several wars through intervention and utilizing an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim ended the civil war in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; by having his navy defeat &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and using Numidium to besiege the province of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalkreath Hold and its cities during the Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and casted both him and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn had a mighty staff called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which was the key to releasing Uriel and Warhaft from the Deadlands. To secure his control, he broke the Staff of Chaos into several pieces and hid them across the provinces in Tamriel. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and planned to tell the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tharn killed her with his vile magic. Ria Silmane's spirit sought the aid of a warrior also kept imprisoned by Tharn. Silmane help the warrior escaped and tasked them with finding the pieces of the Staff of Chaos throughout Tamriel. At one point, this warrior traveled to the city of Falcrenth during their quest to gather the pieces. The warrior defeat Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed both Uriel VII and Talin Warhaft, this young warrior was named the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region of Falkreath Hold was undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. The city of Falcrenth was located on the southernmost edge of the Skyrim border. Smaller towns such as &lt;a href=\"North%20Hall\"&gt;North Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neugrad%20Watch\"&gt;Neugrad Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Oakwood\"&gt;Oakwood&lt;/a&gt; existed in the area. Falcrenth at the time was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Bjeld\"&gt;King Bjeld&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Land Divided; The Skyrim Civil War.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;. The two ruled from the city of Solitude after the former capital, &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Collapse\"&gt;Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;. Torygg has ruled the Imperial Province of Skyrim in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, which was considered the catalyst of the coming &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; believed in the independence of Skyrim in a way that is just shy of treason. In the old ways, when one considers themselves a good High King, they would challenge the current one in a duel for the title. Ulfric traveled to Solitude to seek an audience with Torygg, to challenge his title. Before Torygg could react, Ulfric used the power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to shatter Torygg, killing him in the process. Ulfric escaped to Windhelm, and soon the Civil War commenced.\nFalkreath Hold along with the rest of West Skyrim joined the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude. The leader of Falkreath Hold for a while was, &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%20of%20Stuhn\"&gt;Dengeir of Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;, current a senile old man who lives in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. His nephew, &lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt; took his place as the Leader of Falkreath. Many consider Siddgeir as unqualified for the position and that he abuses his power as the Jarl, he left many of the towns duties to his steward, &lt;a href=\"Nenya\"&gt;Nenya&lt;/a&gt;. Siddgeir can be considered a jack of all trades, dealing with the likes of local merchants to the bandits of the Hold.\nUlfric Stormcloak and members of his &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak Militia&lt;/a&gt; were captured near the mining town of &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the Imperial Fort Town of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, located in Eastern Falkreath. He, along with the Stormcloaks accompanying him would have been executed on the chopping block, with Ulfric's head being taken to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy to the Emperor. Things, however, took a turn for the worst and the city of Helgen was destroyed, but not by the Stormcloaks.\nThe Destruction of Helgen; enter the Dragon Crisis.\nThe Skyrim Civil War had the potential to end in the same year, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; ambushed Ulfric Stormcloak's group near the mining town of Darkwater Crossing. Ulfric along with several Stormcloak soldiers were taken to the town of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, located on the edge of Eastern Falkreath, not far from the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was to execute the warriors and eventually claim the Stormcloak Territory in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. Among the prisoners was a &lt;a href=\"Lokir\"&gt;horse thief&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; trying to escape to the Imperial Province in the south. Before Ulfric could be executed a &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; destroys the city with its terrifying flames and its screeching roar. Many notable figures were present on that day including Ulfric Stormcloak, &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ambassador Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to several records, the Dragon attacked Helgen to kill the Last Dragonborn in his most vulnerable. The Last Dragonborn miraculously survived the destruction of Helgen and eventually traveled the reaches of Skyrim to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; appearing across the province and to slay &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; the World-Eater. The city of Helgen was abandoned after the attack, and it served as a reminder of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; for both sides of the Skyrim Civil War.\nFrom within the shadows; the Dark Brotherhood.\nThroughout the Fourth Era, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; was slowly dying as their many sanctuaries throughout Tamriel were being raided and the Brotherhood being killed. Several different sanctuaries were either destroyed in an attack or were forced to relocate into other sanctuaries. The &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; for example, was razed in a &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Corsair Invasion&lt;/a&gt; that was caused by &lt;a href=\"King%20Barynia\"&gt;King Barynia&lt;/a&gt;, who let the docks of Wayrest open to anyone, even Corsairs. Eventually in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Falkreath Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few remaining hideouts that were active. It was a small community of assassins, one of which, was one of the last &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s. The leader of the Falkreath Chapter was a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic woman named &lt;a href=\"Astrid\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt;, she believed in her own code of conduct rather than the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Tenets\"&gt;Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt;. It soon led to her downfall when the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; razed the sanctuary burned the remain members of the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood was given the contract to assassinate several key political figures in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;Gaius Maro&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;. Each assassination led to the murder of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, who was visiting the province on a political mission. Titus Mede II died on his ship, &lt;a href=\"the%20Katariah\"&gt;the Katariah&lt;/a&gt; one night.\n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt; tracked the Dark Brotherhood for several months and was able to locate their sanctuary in Falkreath Hold. Maro and a platoon of Penitus Oculatus agents traveled to Falkreath and burned down the sanctuary with barrels of oil. Several assassins died in the fire except for three of them. They took the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; with them and traveled elsewhere. Claims say that the brotherhood moved to an abandoned sanctuary near the city of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; took refuge in ruins. From there the Brotherhood grew and slightly gained prominence in the region, with a shared alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; Chapter in Skyrim. The Brotherhood murdered both Commander Maro and the Emperor after the destruction of their former base."}

Within the last few decades, their order has gone from one of the largest, most influential criminal organizations in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to a small group of stragglers barely able to wreak havoc in their home city of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. Although evidence that could explain this rapid decline has never surfaced, speculation has run rampant.\nOne theory holds that the Guild suffered a loss - it's strongly believed that their &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Master\"&gt;Guild Master&lt;/a&gt; was slain by one of their own. This Guild Master, known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus&lt;/a&gt;,\" maintained strong ties with many of the influential families in Skyrim. When he perished, those bonds perished with him. Without these bonds, the Guild could no longer safely operate within Skyrim's holds.\nA second theory suggests that the Guild is experiencing some sort of mystical \"curse\" causing normal activities for its members to become exceedingly difficult. While there is no solid evidence to support this theory, the last two decades have seen an unusual rise in failed attempts by the Guild to execute highly lucrative heists. Reasons for the presence of this supposed curse is being attributed to everything from the aforementioned murder to &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; interference.\nIn order to solve this mystery once and for all, I've spent the last two years infiltrating the Thieves Guild. Initially making contact with them in Riften proved difficult, as they're quite wary of outsiders, but through repeated efforts I was able to gain their confidence. It's my hope that once I've gained access to some of the guild leadership, I can learn more about their decline and publish a second volume of my work.\nAlthough helping the Guild perform their petty crimes brands me a criminal, I feel that it's a burden worth bearing. The mystery of the Thieves Guild's fall from power needs to be solved once and for all as a matter of record and as a footnote to Skyrim's history."}

Nearby tribes of Fanatics were united as vassals to protect his lands and line, and thus the Count lived out his days in the Isles. He and his Countess &lt;a href=\"Mawean\"&gt;Mawean&lt;/a&gt; bore &lt;a href=\"Csaran\"&gt;Csaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nweala\"&gt;Nweala&lt;/a&gt;, the first son and daughter of Vitharn.\nCsaran's mother and father believed that with the proper political influence, Csaran could certainly usurp &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; and carry the Shivering Isles into a prosperous age. For his part, Count Vitharn refused even to acknowledge Sheogorath, thinking himself and his heirs irrefutable rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis, of course, amused the Madgod to no end, and so he allowed the marriage of Csaran to Sheen-in-Glade, daughter of an Argonian midwife who believed that the mortal sphere would afford her daughter nothing but hatred and oppression.\nSheen-in-Glade was as excellent a Countess to Csaran as any in the Isles could ask for, wanting nothing but to bring pride and honor to her adopted house and Court. For years her mind was untouched, even living as she did in the heart of Dementia. Alas, none may reside too long in the Isles without the blessing of Lord Sheogorath, and so Sheen-in-Glade was finally pushed to the brink by the infidelity of her Husband, the Count.\nCsaran was obsessively nepotistic, and distrustful of anyone with whom he shared no blood relation including his bride. Though Sheen-in-Glade bore a son by the Count (who disappeared from the Isles in his twentieth year), it is known that the two shared their bed with decreasing frequency as Csaran's paranoia grew, and he found himself in the arms of his birth-sister Nweala, who bore of their incestuous affair the heir apparent, Cesrien. There are those of us who remember personally the reign of Cesrien, and his contribution to the fall of Vitharn.\nChapter II.\nIn which the birth of Count Cesrien heralds a glorious, bloody, and brief age for Vitharn.\nViolent-natured and quick of temper, Cesrien sought enemies where there were none. His early days on the seat of Vitharn saw the extermination of every tribe of man, mer, or beast within sight of the keep, until none were left.\nDuring his brief reign, much of the southeastern coastline of Dementia was unsafe to travel, littered with the corpses of trespassers in the lands of Vitharn, staked to trees as territorial markers. Beside his sadistic temper, Count Cesrien of Vitharn was known also for his slow wit and ailing health.\nIndeed, Cesrien was born with legs that seemed mismatched in length, and breathed with a laborious rasp. As a youth, tutors were hard-pressed to school the dull boy. Midwives and nurses surrounded him, attending his every ailment with balms and vapors from every corner of the Isles, but when he came of age he sent them away, often becoming violent in their dismissal.\nPerhaps showing the influence of his father, Cesrien became increasingly introverted, allowing only a select few courtiers in his presence. He was seen in public only when organizing his vassal Fanatics for yet another raid on the countryside.\nAtypically adhering to the desperate counsel of his advisors, Cesrien paused in his plundering to take a wife and ensure the continuation of Vitharn's noble line. The increasingly ill Count chose a vibrant peasant women as his betrothed, from a Heretic Commune in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, Countess &lt;a href=\"Jideen\"&gt;Jideen&lt;/a&gt; could not have been any more his opposite. Vassal Fanatics, long loyal to their ancestral agreement with Count Vitraen, were inflamed by this heresy, and tensions grew as the health of Cesrien finally failed, and his young son, Cirion, ascended the throne of Vitharn.\nChapter III.\nIn which conflict besets Vitharn and the Irenic Count Cirion is overwhelmed.\nYoung Count Cirion had scarcely been seen in public before his hasty coronation in the bailey of Vitharn Keep. Some say he still bore bruises from beatings at the feeble hand of his father during his final hours during the ceremony. Had Cirion been old enough to govern, his gentle, reserved demeanor may have been enough to ease the seething tension among the Vassal tribe, but his mother, Countess Jideen was forced to assume many of the duties her husband had so long ignored.\nBy all accounts, Jideen was a fit Countess; loved by her people -- but the leaders of the Vassal Fanatics could not contain indefinitely their personal sentiments of outrage at her Manic heritage. Despite her exceedingly tactful attempts at diplomacy, the animosity against her was deep-seated, and grew over the years. It is perhaps admirable that the Vassals remained true to the oaths so long.\nWhen Cirion finally came of age to rule, the sheepish boy-Count tried in earnest to ascend gracefully, but his fear of the world was so great that even the shadow of a passing bird would startle him visibly. He was all but unable to address the people publicly, and when he attempted to placate the Vassals -- still outraged by his Mother's heritage -- he could scarcely contain his fright, and some say that he even soiled himself before fleeing the throne chamber.\nCertain as the march of fate, the tolerance of the Vassal Fanatics snapped, and warriors encircled Vitharn. The Count's personal guards were ill-suited to repel the attack and the siege lasted a single day. Since the day of that battle, no living soul has wandered away from Vitharn. Local myth tells of a tireless struggle between the spirits of the Fanatic vassals and Vitharn's meager defenders, damned by the treachery of Fanatics and the cowardice of Cirion to replay their final moments in perpetuity."}

The forces of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; had been bolstered by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thousand-Strong%20of%20Sedor\"&gt;Thousand-Strong of Sedor&lt;/a&gt; who had been freed by &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; from their bondage to the Ayleids.\nIn preparation for the assault on White-Gold Tower, the Ayleids had made a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; who sent the &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s and other &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to support the Ayleids in their struggle against the Nedes and Nords. &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; was appointed by the Ayleid kings who still survived as their champion, and he issued a challenge to &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. Umaril also sent &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s and Aurorans to harry Whitestrake and the Imperial forces on their approach to the tower.\nUpon their arrival outside of the walls of the White-Gold Tower, &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; convened the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Skiffs\"&gt;Council of Skiffs&lt;/a&gt; to decide upon their course of action. The Nedes and Nords feared to attempt to storm the White-Gold Tower, and Alessia decided to wait before attacking. Whitestrake refused to accept this course of action, called the Nords and Nedes cowards, and travelled to White-Gold Tower by himself.\nBattle.\nMaking his way to the White-Gold Tower, &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; single-handedly defeated many &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Whitestrake eventually reached the throne room where Umaril, the Ayleid kings, and assorted Daedra had gathered, and challenged &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; to single combat. Umaril sent the Daedra to attack Pelinal, and they managed to pierce his armor multiple times, injuring him and slowing him down.\nSeeing Whitestrake bleeding, Umaril finally rose to his challenge, bathing himself in the light of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; and listing his lineage in &lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleidoon&lt;/a&gt; as was the Ayleid custom before duels. Whitestrake finally laid Umaril low during the duel, denting Umaril's angel-faced helmet so badly that it made him laugh and cutting off Umaril's wings, despite being injured and frothing at the mouth due to his madness. After his victory over Umaril, Whitestrake insulted Umaril's lineage and the lineage of all &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, enraging the Ayleid kings who, ignoring the rules of duels, set upon Whitestrake and cut his body up into eighths. Whitestrake's death roars could be heard by the Council of Skiffs all the way outside of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the next morning, &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic forces into the city. The Imperial forces cut down the remaining Ayleid forces who were in overabundance. Morihaus shook the White-Gold Tower by bashing it with his horns, forcing out the remaining Ayleid kings and their Daedra, many of which the Imperial forces promptly slew during their flight. Upon his entrance to the White-Gold Tower, Morihaus discovered Whitestrake's head and spoke with it.\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath of the Fall of White-Gold Tower, the Nedes consolidated their power over &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; with the unification of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; into a new &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Alessian Empire, or First Empire as it would later be known, began expanding in several directions.\nHowever, despite the victory of the Nedes, Ayleid power and influence was not entirely broken, as several Ayleid kings became the vassals of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and her successor &lt;a href=\"Belharza%20the%20Man-Bull\"&gt;Belharza the Man-Bull&lt;/a&gt; until the coming of the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20of%20the%20High%20Fane\"&gt;Cleansing of the High Fane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Malada\"&gt;Malada&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fall of White-Gold Tower was largely seen in later years as the turning point in the struggle for supremacy between the &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt;, giving the ultimate advantage to men who would continue to dominate &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; even into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "11104", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11104", "title": "Fall of the Snow Prince", "text": "Fall of the Snow Prince is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in , , and .\nContents.\n[An account of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt; as transcribed by &lt;a href=\"Lokheim\"&gt;Lokheim&lt;/a&gt;, chronicler to the chieftain &lt;a href=\"Ingjaldr%20White-Eye\"&gt;Ingjaldr White-Eye&lt;/a&gt;]\nFrom whence he came we did not know, but into the battle he rode, on a brilliant steed of pallid white. &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt; we called him, for Elf he was, yet unlike any other of his kind we had ever seen before that day. His spear and armor bore the radiant and terrible glow of unknown &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;, and so adorned this unknown rider seemed more wight than warrior.\nWhat troubled, nay, frightened us most at that moment was the call that rose from the Elven ranks. It was not fear, not wonder, but an unabashed and unbridled joy, the kind of felicity felt by a damned man who has been granted a second chance at life. For at that time the Elves were as damned and near death as ever they had been during the great skirmishes of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. The Battle of the Moesring was to be the final stand between &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and Elf on our fair island. Led by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, we had driven the Elven scourge from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and were intent on cleansing Solstheim of their kind as well. Our warriors, armed with the finest axes and swords Nord craftsmen could forge, cut great swaths through the enemy ranks. The slopes of the Moesring ran red with Elf blood. Why, then, would our foe rejoice? Could one rider bring such hope to an army so hopeless?\nTo most of our kind, the meaning of the call was clear, but the words were but a litany of Elven chants and cries. There were some among us, however, the scholars and chroniclers, who knew well the words and shuddered at their significance.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt; is come! Doom is at hand!\"\nThere was then a great calm that overcame the Elves that still stood. Through their mass the Snow Prince did ride, and as a longboat slices the icy waters of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding\"&gt;Fjalding&lt;/a&gt; he parted the ranks of his kin. The magnificent white horse slowed to a gallop, then a trot, and the unknown Elf rider moved to the front of the line at a slow, almost ghostlike pace.\nA Nord warrior sees much in a life of bloodshed and battle, and is rarely surprised by anything armed combat may bring. But few among us that day could have imagined the awe and uncertainty of a raging battlefield that all at once went motionless and silent. Such is the effect the Snow Prince had on us all. For when the joyous cries of the Elves had ended, there remained a quiet known only in the solitude of slumber. It was then our combined host, Elf and Nord alike, were joined in a terrible understanding \u2014 victory or defeat mattered little that day on the slopes of the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The one truth we all shared was that death would come to many that day, victor and vanquished alike. The glorious Snow Prince, an Elf unlike any other, did come that day to bring death to our kind. And death he so brought.\nLike a sudden, violent snow squall that rends travelers blind and threatens to tear loose the very foundations of the sturdiest hall, the Snow Prince did sweep into our numbers. Indeed the ice and snow did begin to swirl and churn about the Elf, as if called upon to serve his bidding. The spinning of that gleaming spear whistled a dirge to all those who would stand in the way of the Snow Prince, and our mightiest fell before him that day. &lt;a href=\"Ulfgi%20Anvil-Hand\"&gt;Ulfgi Anvil-Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strom%20the%20White\"&gt;Strom the White&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freida%20Oaken-Wand\"&gt;Freida Oaken-Wand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heimdall%20the%20Frenzied\"&gt;Heimdall the Frenzied&lt;/a&gt;. All lay dead at the foot of the Moesring Mountains.\nFor the first time that day it seemed the tide of battle had actually turned. The Elves, spurred on by the deeds of the Snow Prince, rallied together for one last charge against our ranks. It was then, in a single instant, that the Battle of the Moesring came to a sudden and unexpected end.\n&lt;a href=\"Finna%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Finna&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Jofrior\"&gt;Jofrior&lt;/a&gt;, a lass of only twelve years and squire to her mother, watched as the Snow Prince cut down her only parent. In her rage and sorrow, Finna picked up Jofrior's sword and threw it savagely at her mother's killer. When the Elf's gleaming spear stopped its deadly dance, the battlefield fell silent, and all eyes turned to the Snow Prince. No one that day was more surprised than the Elf himself at the sight that greeted them all. For upon his great steed the Snow Prince still sat, the sword of Jofrior buried deeply in his breast. And then, he fell, from his horse, from the battle, from life. The Snow Prince lay dead, slain by a child.\nWith their savior defeated, the spirit of the remaining Elven warriors soon shattered. Many fled, and those that remained on the battlefield were soon cut down by our broad Nord axes. When the day was done, all that remained was the carnage of the battlefield. And from that battlefield came a dim reminder of valor and skill, for the brilliant armor and spear of the Snow Prince still shined. Even in death, this mighty and unknown Elf filled us with awe.\nIt is common practice to burn the corpses of our fallen foes. This is as much a necessity as it is custom, for death brings with it disease and dread. Our chieftains wished to cleanse Solstheim of the Elven horde, in death as well as life. It was decided, however, that such was not to be the fate of the Snow Prince. One so mighty in war yet so loved by his kin deserved better. Even in death, even if an enemy of our people.\nAnd so we brought the body of the Snow Prince, wrapped in fine silks, to a freshly dug barrow. The gleaming armor and spear were presented on a pedestal of honor, and the tomb was arrayed with treasures worthy of royalty. All of the mighty chieftains agreed with this course, that the Elf should be so honored. His body would be preserved in the barrow for as long as the earth chose, but would not be offered the protection of our Stalhrim, which was reserved for Nord dead alone.\nSo ends this account of the Battle of the Moesring, and the fall of the magnificent Elven Snow Prince. May our gods honor him in death, and may we never meet his kind again in life."}

If left alone and not two bears, they may attack each other. The troll is much tougher than the bear, but if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; adds to the troll's damage (by shooting it with an arrow, for instance), the cave bear may win, in which case it is much more easily dispatched.\nAn apprentice-locked &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; is on a ledge facing the first waterfall.

{"id": "976894", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=976894", "title": "Falmer", "text": "The Falmer, also known as the Ice Elves, or Snow Elves, were an elven race, whose Empire held a portion of Skyrim. They were said to be a proud and united people before their downfall. Their society was considered very wealthy and prosperous, and possibly rivaled the culture of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagic.\nThe Falmer are implied to have had some affinity towards magic, the Snow Prince is recorded to have been able to make ice and snow swirl and churn around himself, as if called upon. The Falmer also taught &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt; their arts during his travels around Tamriel.\nOther magics the Falmer held was the ability to create Wayshrines with the ability to teleport its users. The Falmer also had portals which were created through the usage of &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Other Falmer magic appears to be a great affinity to ice magic.\nArmor.\nAncient Falmer armor was a white armor with a number of embellishments. The armor itself is similar in appearance to regular elven armor, excluding some small details.\nModern Falmer have two kinds of armor, both vastly different from their ancient armors. The &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Armor\"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; is an armor with rags, which covers part of the skin, but not all. The second is an armor which fully covers the body, and is considerably stronger. Both of these armors are made from a creature known as the &lt;a href=\"Chaurus\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following are the parts of the Chaurus used in the creation of Falmer Heavy Armor. The chest piece is made from the breastplate of a dead Chaurus, boots are made from the leg chitin of &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and the gauntlets are made from Chaurus mandibles. The helmet and shield are made from regular Chaurus Chitin.\nReligion.\nThe Falmer religion consisted of the following deities, each having their own temples.\n&lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the Chantry of Auri-El, many dedicated Falmer used to commit themselves to a journey through the Chantry to the Inner Sanctum. These Falmer held a great desire to become one with the god Auri-El, but the trials on the way to the chantry were heavy. Pilgrims struggled against both natural elements as well as a number of tests upon both their faith and loyalty. Within the Chantry were Wayshrines. These shrines were used for meditation and transportation when the Chantry was still in use. Prelates of Auri-El would stand by the shrine, teaching the mantras of Auri-El to their Initiates.\nMany could not continue on the path for long before giving up and returning, giving them great shame. Those who did make it to the Inner Sanctum, also had their share of woes. Upon arrival at the Inner Sanctum, they had been greatly weakened due to sleeplessness and starvation. The last testament of their dedication to Auri-El was carrying the &lt;a href=\"Initiate%27s%20Ewer\"&gt;Initiate's Ewer&lt;/a&gt; up the last steps leading to the chantry. Upon emptying the ewer, they were blessed and relieved, and were permitted to speak to the Arch-Curate of Auri-El.\nThe chantry itself served as the epicenter of the Falmer religion, and was constructed in the early First Era. While some other temples existed for the other deities worshipped by the Falmer, none were as grand as the one dedicated to Auri-El. The Chantry would eventually meet its end when the devolved kin of the ancient Falmer discovered the Chantry and slaughtered those who inhabited the location.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Falmer first settled Tamriel is unknown. The records of the Falmer that exist come from the Nords who came from Atmora. The Nords settled in Skyrim, and for a time, were said to have lived peacefully alongside the Falmer and prospered because of it. As their society grew, they built Saarthal, and the Falmer grew fearful. The Falmer were said to have been constantly at war with the Nords, who claimed the land as their ancestral home.\nWar with the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; settlers.\nWhen the Men from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; started immigrating to Skyrim, one of the first cities they built was known as &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, and served as their capital city. At the city, the Falmer tried to drive the Atmorans out of Skyrim, and upon doing so, razed the city to the ground. It has been suggested that the Elves of the Merethic Era held some power beyond the expectations of the time, implying something greater was at work at Saarthal, leading some to believe the war was not just about territory, or control of Skyrim, but something greater. The Men were said to have found &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt;, and the Elves, upon learning of the item, desired it for themselves. As such, they assaulted the city to obtain the item, but not to drive the Nords out. Another theory claims that the Falmer attacked the Atmorans due to their growing culture, while their own was stagnant. A few men managed to escape the razing of Saarthal, however. Amongst them was the warrior &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his sons, and the aspiring magician &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;. Angered over what had happened, both sought out revenge against the Falmer. Ysgramor and his sons returned to Atmora and gathered an army by telling tales of the Elves' treachery, while Ahzidal went on a journey around Tamriel to seek out powerful magic that could give an edge against them.\nWhen Ysgramor and his army, known as the Companions, returned to Skyrim, they were contacted by Ahzidal, an Atmoran who had studied with all the elven cultures and learned their magics. He offered his aid against the Falmer, who had fortified themselves at Saarthal. The steel of the Atmorans, imbued with Ahzidal's experience with magic, provided them with victory, and Ahzidal with revenge. Under Ysgramor's command, the Companions would then continue on with their battles against the Falmer, being ordered not to show any kindness towards their enemy. The Companions marched throughout the land, killing the native elves whenever they found them. They eventually arrived at a statue of an Eagle which would become the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;. Their elven captives who still had their tongues, spoke in fear of the statue, stating it was older than even they themselves were, and so, the Companions started the construction of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; around the statue. Another battle was fought at a pass close to &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Yngol Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, where the Falmer suffered another defeat. The Falmer captives were then forced to start construction on a city which would become &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous Falmer died both during the construction of the city, as well as on their way to the building site, being killed by their captors. The invasion of the Rift would occur at a later date, being performed by new clans. Pillaging and burning Falmer villages, the Snow Elves eventually grouped up to face the Atmorans in battle. A bloody battle was fought, once again resulting in a Falmer defeat, and the Falmer losing most of their control over the Rift.\nThe Falmer would meet their end with the death of the Snow Prince during the Battle of the Moesring. Around this time, many Falmer had died during the great skirmishes of Solstheim, and this battle was to be their last stand. The battle was fierce, and just when the tide of battle seemed to be turning, the Snow Prince was killed. The remaining Falmer were either slain trying to hold their ground, or scattered. The Snow Prince was given an honorable burial by the Nords, as he was so loved by his kin and so honorable in war.\nUpon this defeat, the Old Ones of the Falmer concluded that too many of their warriors had fallen to continue the fight, and while the young Falmer spoke out against this, their voices were ignored. The Old Ones decided, after the fall of the Snow Prince, that they would have to move to the Dwemer. The Atmorans, coming out victorious, eradicated all signs of Falmer society that they could find.\nDwemer.\nMany of the surviving Falmer fled to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, and asked them for protection. They fled underground, to &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwemer, who did not fully trust the Falmer, forced them to consume the toxic fungi that \"once grew deep underground.\" This, alongside years of living underground, eventually rendered the Falmer blind. Those Falmer who did not flee to the Dwemer, fled elsewhere. Their spirits becoming lower over time, as they were forced to hide and could only think of the happy times of old. But most of these groups would, over time, either vanish, be killed, or give up and accept the bargain of the Dwemer.\nThe Falmer, after living underground and eating the fungi, became powerless and turned into the servants of the Dwemer, and later on, their slaves. The fungi became a major part of the Falmer diet, resulting in both the current Falmer slaves, as well as their offspring, being blind and weak. In this time of servitude, the Falmer sunk into madness.\nAt some point, the Falmer rebelled against their Dwemer overlords. They overthrew the Dwemer and fled deeper into Blackreach. For decades, the two sides were at war, known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Crag\"&gt;War of the Crag&lt;/a&gt;, a bloody conflict taking place beneath the soil of Skyrim, with the Nords, the descendants of the Atmorans, remaining blissfully unaware of the bloody conflict that raged beneath them. The war would come to an end when the Dwemer vanished as a result of &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; tampering with the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;. With the Dwemer gone, the Falmer spread throughout Blackreach, but the War of the Crag had left the Falmer feeling a need to conquer and kill. The Falmer started to raid the surface of the land, killing cattle, travelers, and stealing babies.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the majority of the Falmer were kept out of Skyrim's boundaries during the original onslaught of the Atmorans, they would not be entirely removed from Skyrim's surface until the ruling of King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome Falmer sightings exist during the Second Era. During the Second Era, any misfortune or disaster was attributed to the Falmer, ranging from crop failure to travelers getting lost crossing a high pass. At the time, little evidence existed of the Falmer existing at all, and they were said to have resided in remote mountain regions, or other cold and remote regions. A record of possible Falmeri boundary runes implies that the original Falmer that did exist during the Second Era, were wary and withdrawn.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Fourth Era, sightings of Falmer have increased, with their raids being more organized and their attacks more brutal, leading one scholar to theorize that the Falmer could be ready to reclaim their long-forgotten glory. The goal of the Falmer is to destroy the surface world, including all who dwell above. Attacks by the Falmer are not uncommon during the late-Fourth Era. Outside of Windhelm, a Khajiit caravan was ambushed by a group of Falmer, leading to its destruction. Caravans are also ambushed by the Falmer, with its merchants being torn limb from limb. On one occassion, the Falmer even took out the residents of a lighthouse.\nThe present day Falmer also appear to have tamed the Chaurus to do their bidding. Chaurus can often times be found in company with their Falmer masters, who breed them for both their raids as well as their chitin. Modern Falmer can be found throughout Skyrim in numerous locations, from Skyrim's Dwemer ruins to smaller caverns scattered around the province. They also attack locations inhabited by the human settlers of the province.\nRace.\nBeing an Elven race, the Falmer originally held Black &lt;a href=\"Souls\"&gt;Souls&lt;/a&gt;, which belong to the higher creatures of Tamriel. Their elven status appears to be revoked, however, as since &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, most Falmer souls are White Souls, rather than Black, with the exception of ancient Falmer, like &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;. A visual representation of what the Falmer looked like was created at &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt;, before the Falmer changed into their blinded form. This statue held the &lt;a href=\"Left%20Eye%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;Left&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Right%20Eye%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;Right Eye of the Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, which was built in secret by the Falmer during their slavery under the Dwemer. These eyes were flawlessly cut, and as big as a man's head. They were said to burn into a person, making them able to see them forever.\nWhile the Falmer changing back into their original forms is said to be unlikely, their intellect is also said to have been increasing. Leading &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; to believe that perhaps one day a line of communication could be established with them, enabling them to learn that they were once a proud and prosperous race."}

They are a race of Mer formerly known as &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, who have devolved into primitive creatures inhabiting the dark underground and remote areas of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nSenses.\nThe Falmer are blind but have a stronger sense of hearing and smell than many other creatures, which means Falmer can detect the Dragonborn even if they use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Muffle\"&gt;Muffle&lt;/a&gt; and a high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; level work much better. For a low level Dragonborn, it is advised to use a bow and shoot them at a distance.\nTypes of Falmer.\nThere are several different types of Falmer, from the basic foot soldier to the considerably more powerful &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Warmonger\"&gt;Warmonger&lt;/a&gt;. All types, however, possess extremely sensitive hearing and will investigate even the slightest noise without hesitation. Some Falmer are mages who mainly specialize in frost and shock spells and can also cast healing spells.\nLoot.\nFalmer are known to carry weapons and armor they craft. Falmer craft a full range of &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Sword\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20War%20Axe\"&gt;war axes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Bow\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;. Higher-level individuals may carry the honed version of the edged weapons. They also carry Falmer shields and helmets, which seem to be made from Chaurus chitin. Full &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20armor\"&gt;Falmer armor&lt;/a&gt; exists, however there is only one known set, which is located within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt; ruins. In addition, Falmer carry &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, random &lt;a href=\"Ingots%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20ear\"&gt;Falmer ear&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Official%20Add-ons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Hardened%20Armor\"&gt;Hardened&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Heavy%20Armor\"&gt;Heavy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Falmer%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Falmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Sets%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor sets&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalmer helmets are especially valuable as they may be worn along with a &lt;a href=\"Circlets\"&gt;circlet&lt;/a&gt;. Any enchantments on both will have full effect, allowing the production of stronger potions, for instance.\nChaurus Chitin can be harvested from Chaurus and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Reaper%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus Reapers&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, which is used to upgrade &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20weapons\"&gt;Falmer weapons&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20armor\"&gt;Falmer armor&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20heavy%20armor\"&gt;Falmer heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWeaknesses.\nSneaking is very effective against Falmer, as they are completely blind and light will not be a factor. Carrying a torch too close to them, however, may catch their attention due to the sound and heat. If the Dragonborn can move silently while sneaking, they are effectively rendered invisible to the Falmer. This means that &lt;a href=\"Muffle\"&gt;Muffle&lt;/a&gt; will be more useful than the spell &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; against the Falmer. An accomplished archer can be a Falmer's worst nightmare, as Falmer cannot possibly detect them from a distance. However, repeated misses with projectiles can reveal the archer's location remarkably quickly.\nHabitats.\nFalmer live strictly underground in caves and Dwarven ruins. They do, however, make forays to the surface."}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; needs to convince &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Pascal\"&gt;Constable Pascal&lt;/a&gt; to release her.\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Dame%20Dabienne\"&gt;Dame Dabienne&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found in the stocks in the &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Town%20Square\"&gt;Town Square&lt;/a&gt;, asks the Vestige for help. She is upset; Constable Pascal put her in the stocks, yet she claims she has not committed any crimes. The town was attacked by slavers, and he is accusing her of being involved. However, she is a &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Knight of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and was sent to help the village. A messenger was sent prior, supporting her claim, but Pascal claims that he did not receive anything. She will tell the Vestige that he is by the docks and that they should go speak to him.\nThe docks.\nUpon attempting to speak with Pascal, he will try to dismiss the Vestige, saying that he is busy with the aftermath of the slaver's attack. He also makes a statement that people he had trusted were helping them. He explains that he never received a message, and that Dame Dabienne only claims to be a Knight of the Flame as a disguise. The messenger, Messenger Cordier, has apparently been taken captive, and never said anything about a message being sent. Constable Pascal will tell the Vestige that Cordier can be found in the warehouse, if he has not already been killed.\nFollow the marker to the warehouse to find the missing messenger. Outside are a few guards, who are being held back by the slavers located inside. Once inside, go downstairs; the messenger can be found alone here. He will ask the Vestige to untie him. However, when spoken to, he will tell the Vestige why he came to Koeglin Village. He will explain that he had a message for the constable from &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hughes\"&gt;Sir Hughes&lt;/a&gt; of the Knights of the Flame, but will say that it is information meant for the constable only. If the Vestige threatens him, he will tell them that Dame Dabienne was indeed coming to help them with security, and that he never got the chance to tell Constable Pascal. He promises to inform him at once if he is untied.\nAfterwards, go back outside and talk to Constable Pascal. The Vestige will need to convince him that Dame Dabienne is not a spy. He will refuse this attempt, saying that he will not release her yet, as he still believes she is part of the threat. He will go on to say that he is also too busy dealing with his ship, which is being overrun by slavers. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Currod\"&gt;Captain Currod&lt;/a&gt;, the captain of the ship, claims that he is not involved with the slavers' attacks, but Pascal refuses to believe otherwise. He says that he will not be sending any guards to help clear below decks, as he believes that it is a clear trap.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tava%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;The Tava's Bounty&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOffer to talk to the captain and board the ship. Captain Currod, who can be found on the main deck, is upset, as he explains that he has never received this kind of treatment in a friendly port. Currod will point out that his men are being harmed, yet are being refused help by the constable. He explains that, When they docked the night before, the slavers came in longboats and attacked. Many of his men were killed, but they managed to lure the slavers below decks and seal the hatch, locking them in. Unfortunately, the proof needed to prove their innocence, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Tava%27s%20Bounty%20Ledger\"&gt;The Tava's Bounty Ledger&lt;/a&gt;\", is locked below deck as well.\nThe Vestige must go below deck and retrieve the ledger, which can be found lying on a table. Afterwards, return it to Constable Pascal and show it to him. Despite this evidence, he will remain unconvinced, and now believes that &lt;a href=\"Sabyssa%20the%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Sabyssa the Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; is involved. He is upset over his suspicions, as he has known her for years. He will then begin to doubt the Vestige's intentions, and will ask them to leave.\nThe smith.\nThe Vestige will then need to go over to &lt;a href=\"Sabyssa%27s%20Blacksmithing\"&gt;Sabyssa's house&lt;/a&gt; and speak with her. She will be surprised upon hearing that that Constable Pascal is close to arresting her for not opening the forge. She mentions that she had seen cult members, the &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers%20Camp\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt;, leave his house, and suspects that his sudden distrust is a result of a curse brought upon by them.\nConstable Pascal's house.\nInvestigate &lt;a href=\"Constable%20Pascal%27s%20House\"&gt;Constable Pascal's House&lt;/a&gt; to find more evidence. Once entered, go upstairs. The Vestige will be attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; immediately after ascending the stairs. After it has been defeated, check Pascal's bed; underneath the pillow is a Daedric symbol. This will be proof that Daedra are the reason for his nightmares and dreams about others being involved.\nOnce spoken to, Sabyssa will express her sympathy for Pascal, and says that he will likely have to be restrained. She will also say that Dame Dabienne must be released from the stocks.\nTown square.\nSabyssa will take the evidence found in the constable's house and notify the town of the situation. The crew of \"The Tava's Bounty\" will later be able to come ashore and receive aid. Dame Dabienne will also be set free from the stocks. She is happy to be free, and tells the Vestige that she will need to take over the security in Koeglin Village, as Constable Pascal has been put in the stocks."}

If you go to &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; you can still see what remains of the village, a run-down testament to the hubris of one woman, &lt;a href=\"Faltonia%20Salvius\"&gt;Faltonia Salvius&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike many &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faltonia%20Salvius\"&gt;Faltonia Salvius&lt;/a&gt; saw an opportunity to extract great wealth from &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, she sought rich veins of &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; from the nearby hills. She trusted diviners and alchemists of the lowest order, false advisers who were happy enough to tell her what she wanted to hear as long as their own purses grew fat.\nThe more she paid them, the more willing she was to believe their lies. When one lone voice, the alchemist Flavius Antonius, argued that the samples of soil from the area were insufficient to predict large deposits of gold, she had him arrested and beaten. From that point, he was unable to walk and was forced to beg for his supper for the rest of his miserable days.\nFaltonia traveled to Grahtwood in springtime with a band of Imperial guards numbering four-and-twenty, and proceeded to conscript local Wood &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; as labor in the fulfillment of her grand vision. By midsummer, a village had been constructed on her chosen site, called Faltonia's Promise, and the Orcs were set to work in the mine.\nHow the gold flowed! How quickly eager prospectors flooded Faltonia's Promise, dreaming of riches! How forcefully their dreams were dashed, when within the year the mine was played out. \"Faltonia's Promise\" became the punchline to a bitter joke told in taverns by out-of-work miners.\nHumbled but undaunted, Faltonia fought to save the settlement. Seeking to turn the mining operation into a quarry, she haggled and negotiated with nearby &lt;a href=\"Haven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; to supply stone for the reconstruction of their crumbling buildings. But just as the deal was about to be completed, a smooth-talking &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"canonreeve\"&gt;canonreeve&lt;/a&gt; convinced the governor to supply Haven with stone from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the superior style and durability of island stone.\nBroken, and having spent the last of her fortune in a failed attempt to bribe the officials in Haven and secure the stone deal, Faltonia left the village that had been named for her. Many who had settled there in pursuit of riches soon followed, dispersing to other settlements in Grahtwood, or leaving entirely. So it was that Faltonia's Promise came to be referred to, far and wide, as Goldfolly.\nThe Orcs who remained eked out a living as hunters and grew into a stubborn stock, the sort who saw it a badge of honor that they persisted in a place that had driven so many away. On their lips, the name Faltonia's Promise once again took on positive connotations, of persistence, strength, and an indomitable spirit, thought the village would never reach the heights of Faltonia's foolish dreams."}

Many quests, in particular the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main story line&lt;/a&gt;, raise fame by a few points. Fame is necessary to purchase the &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;houses&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on a character's responsibility trait, fame and infamy can raise or lower their disposition. For low responsibility characters, infamy raises their disposition and fame lowers it and vice-versa for high reputation characters. For most characters, this determines whether they will attack the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; on sight, but for merchants it mainly affects their haggle percentage. A Hero who has previously sold at a given rate may find that the same merchant will no longer accept that rate after increases in infamy.\nRenown is the effective total value of the Hero's good and bad deeds, calculated as the number of Fame points plus number of Infamy points. Renown is checked when the player wants to activate a &lt;a href=\"Doomstone\"&gt;Doomstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nFame points.\nMiscellaneous Quests.\nNote that one may lose fame points or gain Infamy points if a quests NPC dies prematurely or another condition is not met.\nInfamy points.\nAt low levels, infamy reduces the haggle amount merchants will accept. At very high infamy e.g. above 600 Infamy, &lt;a href=\"marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; will stop fighting you and greet you like any other NPC in the game. This can be quite useful for quickly going through &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;forts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is the exception of Orc Marauders which will attack you if you have any fame, regardless of your infamy.\nOne can avoid Infamy by committing crimes with no witnesses, but Infamy can be gained by accidentally attacking allies.\nRemoving infamy.\nBy completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Pilgrimage%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Hero can reset their infamy to 0. This can be completed and repeated any time as long as the user has either the standard PS3 version or (Plug-in) or the Knights of the Nine (Expansion).\nGuilds &amp; Daedra.\nQuests from the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to raise the player's fame alongside with &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; Matches. Infamy will come to players while working for the Thieves Guild or the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;."}

Mara's heart, I'm getting ahead of myself again.\nOnce again, Cyrodilic Collections' &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;newest member&lt;/a&gt; proved instrumental. Acting in concert with Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn, they discovered that essential information about the Remnant of Argon was tucked away in ancient relics belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Bright-Throat\"&gt;Bright-Throat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dead-Water\"&gt;Dead-Water&lt;/a&gt; Tribes. Each tribal relic provided one half of a riddle\u2014a riddle I managed to solve! From what I can tell, we must travel to the Swallowed Grove and conduct something called a \"dream-wallow\" ritual. I have no idea what this ritual will teach us. I can only hope that it directs us to the Remnant itself. We'll learn soon enough, I guess. I can hardly wait!"}

After inhaling a potent alchemical smoke, our new friend drifted into vivid visions of the past and learned that the Remnant was actually the creation of a lost Argonian tribe. Long ago, a band of &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; raided the tribe's village, threatening to wipe out the Argonians who dwelt there, and consume their souls for good measure! Fortunately, the Argonian elders managed to create a vessel to store and protect the souls of their tribe\u2014the Remnant of Argon.\nNo sooner had we learned this truth, than &lt;a href=\"Kassandra\"&gt;Kassandra&lt;/a&gt; betrayed us! She filched a magic staff that manifested during the ritual, and ran off (with me in tow!)\nThe next few hours were pure horror. Her spooky henchman, &lt;a href=\"Whiptail\"&gt;Whiptail&lt;/a&gt;, proved even worse than I thought. He even tried to sacrifice me to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;! Thank goodness, my new friend intervened just in time, and rescued me from that Blackguard brute.\nAfter a number of unexpected turns, and a lengthy chase, my friend and I caught up with Kassandra. Alas, too late to save her from herself. She touched the Remnant, and found herself bound to a massive &lt;a href=\"Mireguant\"&gt;Mireguant&lt;/a&gt;. She gained control of the creature for a time, but our hero still managed to defeat her. I remain dreadfully conflicted about the whole thing. Kassandra clearly had to be stopped, but I can't help but feel that I failed her in some way. Had I only recognized her madness beforehand, she might still be alive. It's a sad business.\nIn any event, once Kassandra fell, I took up the Remnant and urged Xukas, Jaxsik-Orrn, and our hero to reach inside it. Truthfully, I barely remember it. Something in the Hist took hold of me. It was not painful, but nor was it comfortable. A person like me isn't meant to hold something like that for long!\nI wasn't privy to all that happened inside the Remnant, and I'm still reeling from the loss of a friend. But it buoys my spirits to know that their sacrifice was not in vain. The Root-Whisper Hist just burst into full bloom, and a new tribe gathered beneath its branches. A new beginning\u2014even for me. Without Kassandra's support and leadership, Cyrodilic Collections will not be what it was. But after all I've seen and been through, I'm more confident than ever that we can make it something even greater than before. I can't wait for our next adventure!"}

It is the final main quest for Balmora. You must find out what exactly happened to &lt;a href=\"Ulran%20Releth\"&gt;Ulran Releth&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually stop Veya from making rash decisions.\nWalkthrough.\nVeya wants to find out what soldiers were at Ulran's trial. You tell her &lt;a href=\"Vatola%20Telem\"&gt;Vatola Telem's&lt;/a&gt; team were there, at &lt;a href=\"Hlormaren%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hlormaren Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. Once you meet Veya by the Stronghold, look around for clues as to where the soldiers may be. You'll find &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Darvel\"&gt;Corporal Darvel&lt;/a&gt; impaled behind a building. When you enter, you find Vatola Telem, who is trapped in a cage. Veya has a chat with him whilst you go look for the key to the cage, but when you return, Veya is gone.\nVatola tells you that he told Veya the truth about Ulran's trial, and she ran off to &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;. Go there, and ask Naryu what the uproar in town is. Once you talk to her, you find out that Veya is after Captain Brivan, and killed every &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Soldier\"&gt;Redoran Soldier&lt;/a&gt; in her way, leaving the innocents unharmed. Investigate the &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Kinhouse\"&gt;Redoran Kinhouse&lt;/a&gt;, in which Brivan was absent, but a &lt;a href=\"Small%20Note\"&gt;Small Note&lt;/a&gt; was. Go outside and speak to Naryu, after you've spoken to Brivan's wife.\nYou must now find your way inside the Redoran Garrison, and fight your way through &lt;a href=\"Warclaw%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Warclaw Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Warclaw%20Ferhara\"&gt;Warclaw Ferhara&lt;/a&gt; at the end. Captain Brivan will appear, demanding an explanation. Once you speak to him, you find out that Veya's Father had the lead roll in Ulran's death, which leads to Veya assassinating Brivan, and chasing after her own father to kill him in a moment of madness. After reaching Veya, she'll have already killed her father, and now you must defeat her. Once you defeat Veya, High Cancellor Meriath will enter, and allow you and Naryu to escape the scene, creating an alibi for all the deaths.\nVeya, defeated, looked dead to the Chancellor, but was still breathing. It's now your choice to let Naryu kill her swiftly, or take her to the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Cellar\"&gt;Abandoned Cellar&lt;/a&gt; and send her far away after she's healed. Go to the Abandoned Cellar, and speak to Naryu. This will let you finish the quest."}

Place it between your faces, staring deep within its folds. By the time you next blink, you shall possess Advisor Imrasah's face.\nThis is where time is most crucial. The effects of the fan will be slow, but constant. You'll immediately feel a discomfort that your training should allow you to overcome. Slowly though, as the night continues, your true self shall fade away. You will begin to think as Imrasah does, begin to believe you are her. Before morning's light the transformation will be complete. You cannot let that happen.\nPoison the drink, hand it to Nadbushar, and leave the banquet. Return to Imrasah and use the fan once more. Only this will allow you to keep yourself. Otherwise, you shall be lost forever within the body of a royal's advisor. A fate worse than death, in my humble opinion."}

Fang Lair was constructed as a Dwarven mine in the Dragon's Teeth, but it was abandoned. A great beast is known to inhabit the ruins.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nFang Lair is located in the Dragon's Teeth Mountains, a mountain range which encompasses the other mountains from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; (although based on the map, Fang Lair is built on the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in the Hammerfell side). The Dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Kragen\"&gt;Kragen&lt;/a&gt; had used Fang Lair to excavate various minerals including Gold and Mithril, the latter being a very scarce and versatile material. Fang Lair descends far into the ground, the second level has pools of lava, that the Dwarves have most likely used for their smithing and mining. The area around Fang Lair is infamously known as wild country, with tricky canyons and hidden valleys. The Dwarves had built a castle above the mines of Fang Lair, with narrow towers and arched bridges. There is a large gate in front of Fang Lair, with a stone dragon perched over it. The entrance was massive, but the doors had disappeared. Down the main hall is a balcony, which looms over an open pit, presumably the beginning of the mine.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; had yearned to leave from the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, desiring to build beyond the province. It is because of the Rourken Clan; there are various Dwarven Cities throughout Hammerfell and the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Rourken Clan had created a trail which caused the Dwarves of Kragen to follow the Rourken Dwemer to the western desert and built their settlements, with Arkngthamz-Phng being one of them. Before this city was built in the Dragon's Teeth, the Kragen Clan had created the Dwarven city-state of &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Arkngthamz inspired more Dwarven clans in Morrowind to expand to the west, in Skyrim and Hammerfell. Arkngthamz was built for mining &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful mineral with magicka properties. Because of this, Arkngthamz allied with other Dwarven city-states (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt;). Eventually, the Kragen Clan moved into Hammerfell, in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where they established Arkngthamz-Phng. The city-state of Arkngthamz-Phng would prosper amidst the Dragon's Teeth.\nOn one fateful day, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;Thurvokun&lt;/a&gt; had fled the province of Skyrim several years prior, and eventually found Arkngthamz-Phng. With his immense power, Thurvokun had driven the Kragen Clan out of Arkngthamz-Phng, claiming the ancient Dwarven city as his nest. Because of living in the city, the ruins were renamed into Fang Lair, known for being a Dragon Lair. Before living in Fang Lair, Thurvokun was prominent during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of choosing a side, he remained neutral and fled his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;. Because he was not given an &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;eternal soul&lt;/a&gt;, he was slowly dying of age. In the late first era, an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i warrior named &lt;a href=\"Caluurion\"&gt;Caluurion&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to Fang Lair with his three companions, &lt;a href=\"Ulfnor\"&gt;Ulfnor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sabina%20Cedus\"&gt;Sabina Cedus&lt;/a&gt;, to subdue the beast. It was at this point, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Emperor Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; had already called an end to hunting Dragons. In the end, both Thurvokun and the three companions were killed, with their remains staying in Fang Lair, untempered for years.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the tale of Fang Lair had faded to obscurity, beckoning the typical adventurer to seek the ruin's treasures. &lt;a href=\"The%20Blackmarrow\"&gt;The Blackmarrow&lt;/a&gt; group of necromancers had traveled to the ruins of Fang Lair, to seek the remains of Thurvokun. The leader of the Blackmarrow, &lt;a href=\"Orryn%20the%20Black\"&gt;Orryn the Black&lt;/a&gt; had resurrected the corpse of Thurvokun, which had lost the flesh, leaving nothing but the bones. The Blackmarrow had revealed themselves to the world, posing a serious threat to the people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. This prompted the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; to take action, to deal with the threat. The Undaunted had sent &lt;a href=\"Yisareh\"&gt;Yisareh&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon's Teeth Mountains, where she encountered the Blackmarrow. The power of the necromancers was too much for Yisareh, so she utilized the help of a group of adventurers, led by a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious warrior&lt;/a&gt;. The warriors had defeated the Blackmarrow, all throughout the dungeon, eventually defeating Orryn the Black, who had used the skeletal dragon, Thurvokun. The Blackmarrow was dealt with and the threat was vanquished.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the ruins of Fang Lair in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion had escaped the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dungeons\"&gt;Imperial Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; through a magical portal, dropping them somewhere in Tamriel. In their sleep, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; came to the warrior through a dream, giving them the quest to reassemble the Staff of Chaos and to begin their search in the province of Hammerfell with Fang Lair. The Champion had then traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;, to get an idea on Fang Lair's location, and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Blubamka\"&gt;Queen Blubamka&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Rihad. Before they were given the whereabouts of Fang Lair, the Queen gave the Champion a proposition: if they retrieved a parchment from &lt;a href=\"Golthog\"&gt;Golthog&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stonekeep%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stonekeep&lt;/a&gt;, then she will give them what they need. And so, the Champion was able to get the coordinates for Fang Lair and retrieve the first piece of the Staff of Chaos. The Champion would then set their sites for the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;."}

This latter area appears to have been constructed to guard the second floor.\nThe second floor is much smaller than the first, only containing a hallway with three Skeletons that leads to a small room that has an inner room inside of it. Open lava pits dot the floor of the outer room. Inside the inner room, there are two &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s guarding the first piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; must retrieve.\nHistory.\nThe Fang Lair was originally a mining fortress, ran by the Dwarves of Kragen. During the Dwarves' habitation, a Great Wyrm rose to the gates of Fang Lair, forcing the Dwarves to permanently retreat from the mine.\nBy the time of the Third Era, when the Eternal Champion of Tamriel ventured into the mine to discover the first piece of the Staff of Chaos, the Wyrm had apparently left the mine. Many foul creatures took its place within the mine's corridors and mine-shafts.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nFang Lair is the second half of the second subquest of the main quest of \"Arena\".

The Champion then leaves to claim the first piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"The ruler of Rihad has marked your map to show the mines of Fang Lair in the province of Hammerfell...\"\nWalkthrough.\nPreparation.\nAfter returning Queen Blubamka's &lt;a href=\"Blubamka%27s%20Parchment\"&gt;parchment&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal Champion should proceed to the Fang Lair. This dungeon is far more difficult than &lt;a href=\"Stonekeep%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stonekeep&lt;/a&gt;, so more thought should be given to preparations.\nIn particular, buying &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt; of Resist Fire are recommended as the final chamber of the Fang Lair holds &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s, who cast &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;s. Potions of Healing, or Potions of Heal True should be bought as well, due to the lack of resting spots within the Lair. Re-raiding &lt;a href=\"Stonekeep%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Stonekeep&lt;/a&gt;, and raiding other randomly generated wilderness dungeons may help with expenses.\nOnce the comfortable with their preparations, the Champion shall proceed to Fang Lair at the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; border, a nineteen-day journey from &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe closest town to Fang Lair in Hammerfell is &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20Guard%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Belkarth Guard&lt;/a&gt;, a two-day journey. In Skyrim, the neighboring province, &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20Hall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Karthwasten Hall&lt;/a&gt;, an eight-day journey.\nFirst Floor \u2013 The Mines.\nFang Lair is complex, and consists of multiple series of underground tunnels and intertwining hallways.\nFang Lair is an ancient Dwarven mine, now infested with &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;minotaurs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe overall goal is to reach the second floor, which holds the first piece of the Staff of Chaos. The room with the ladder that descends to the second floor is in the southwestern-most portion of the Lair, where six spiders are caged. Upon entering, a narration appears:\n\"You stand in Fang Lair. It's Dwarven hewn passages run for miles under the earth...\"\nThe provided map displays the shortest route to the prisons. This does not provide an abundance of experience and loot. Another disadvantage of this path is that it maximizes the time spent in mine shafts, occasionally making fighting difficult if an enemy sits on a ledge. Taking a more circuitous path will provide the opposite: more time spent in the Lair, but more earned experience and loot.\nSpider Prisons.\nEntering the prisons, the Champion hears the mass hissing of giant spiders. When entering further, a narration appears on-screen:\n\"You come upon a strange sight. A room with cells down either side. In each cell seems to be a hungry spider. You see three more cells along the southern wall. Next to them stands a dark portal...\"\nAt the south end of the room's cages, there are three doors, all three of which contain separate &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt;.\nCell 1 and 3 hold steel keys, and Cell 2 holds the golden key. If the Champion approaches the southeastern door, it will speak to them:\n\"Thou must prove thy worthiness to proceed to the Underdark. The correct answer will open the cell to the gold key, which will open the portal.\"\n\"Rush not to answer mortal. The wrong choice will open the cell doors to the spiders...\"\nIf the puzzle is solved incorrectly, five spiders will be released on the Champion. Upon approaching closer, the puzzle will speak again:\n\"As you near, the door itself speaks:\"\n\"Listen to my puzzle, foolish mortal and prove that you are worthy of my service...\"\n\"If Cell 3 holds worthless brass, Cell 2 holds the gold key.\"\n\"If Cell 1 holds the gold key, Cell 3 holds worthless brass.\"\n\"If Cell 2 holds worthless brass, Cell 1 holds the gold key.\"\n\"Knowing this brave fool, and knowing that all that is said cannot be true, which cell contains the gold key?\"\nThere are multiple correct answers to the door's riddle, though they all are variations of each other:\nWhen responding to the door, capitalization doesn't matter. Anything other than the six answers will open the cage doors for the spiders. If the Champion responds with a correct variation, the door will speaks once more:\n\"Thou art correct mortal. The key within cell 2 is yours...\"\nThe door to Cell 2 will unlock and open. Retrieve the golden key from the cell and use it on the puzzle door to reach the ascending ladder to the second floor of Fang Lair.\nSecond Floor \u2013 Staff of Chaos.\nThe second level of Fang Lair is linear. Enter the hallway ahead and defeat the three skeletons. The hallway empties into a small square room with lava flowing in the floor. In the center of the room lies an inner room made of black rock that contains the first piece of the Staff of Chaos.\nIf the Champion is concerned about falling into the lava pools, drinking a Potion of Resist Fire beforehand will completely negate fire damage from the lava.\nSaving is recommended. Approach the door to the central chamber and the Champion will hear the growling of the Hell Hounds behind it. Now is the recommended time to drink a Potion of Resist Fire. Approaching the door, the Champion will be asked another riddle:\n\"A simple question for thee,\"\n\"What is neither fish nor flesh, feathers nor bone,\"\n\"But still has fingers, and thumbs of its own?\"\n\"What is thy answer, mortal?\"\nThere are two different acceptable answers (gauntlet or glove), though a number of variations of either work:\nThe Champion will not be harmed if they fail the question. When a correct variation is chosen, the door comments on the Champion's wit, and open:\n\"Thou hast truly the wit to continue. Thou may proceed...\"\nAfter the door opens, two Hell Hounds will attack the Champion.\nWhen the hounds are defeated, the first segment of the Staff of Chaos floats over a pool of blood in the center of the chamber. It is a golden, harpoon-like spike doused in red fire with an angelic choir singing in its area.

Read, now, and let the light of knowledge free you of your fear.\nTheir ancient history is well known across the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, and not worth recounting in detail here. Suffice to say that the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;arch-mage&lt;/a&gt; known as \"King\" &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; has long led the outcasts of the &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;shrouded isle&lt;/a&gt;. He uses foul spells, rituals and sacrifices to continually renew his youth and vigor.\nOther rumors you have heard are true, as well. The rituals of Orgnum allow the Maormer to control sea serpents. Some have mastered the art of riding the beasts among the waves, while larger and less docile beasts swim in support of their largest fleets.\nThe fleet that now threatens &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, we have learned, calls itself the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Viper\"&gt;Sea Viper&lt;/a&gt;. Recent events in the Three Banners War have driven the Vipers into the seas around Auridon and the mainland. The opportunistic Maormer now seek their own victories in the war between the alliances.\nThe &lt;a href=\"First%20Auridon%20Marines\"&gt;First Auridon Marines&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Navy\"&gt;Dominion Navy&lt;/a&gt;, and others now stand ready to halt the advance of the Maormer. If you see signs of the Vipers, report them at once to your &lt;a href=\"Canonreeve\"&gt;Canonreeve&lt;/a&gt; or the nearest Dominion officer.\nEagles, know that the viper will not take our nest. Be wary, but have courage."}

He flew and flew and finally came upon a creature that he found very strange.\n\"Friend!\" he called as he flew by the creature. \"Friend, what is it that you are? I have never seen a flying beast such as you!\"\n\"They call me a netch,\" the good netch replied.\n\"A netch! A netch! That's quite the catch!\" the crow cackled. \"Tell me, netch, how is it that you fly?\"\n\"I've flown these shores since I was born,\" the netch replied. \"I do not know how.\"\n\"Don't know, don't' know, oh what a show!\" the crow called out. \"Where are your glossy feathers that help you glide?\"\n\"I have no need of feathers to glide,\" the netch explained, \"but I have a strong, thick hide to protect me.\"\n\"A hide! A hide! Oh, what a find,\" the crow mocked. \"Tell me netch, where are your eyes?\"\n\"I need no eyes to sail the skies, as you can plainly see,\" the netch once more replied.\n\"No eyes, no eyes, to sail the skies!\" the prideful crow continued. \"But it makes you far uglier than I!\" And he began to laugh at the netch's misfortune.\nThe crow's laughter grew louder and louder, eventually attracting a nearby &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cliff-racer&lt;/a&gt;. The beast swooped down upon the crow, swallowing him whole, and he could mock the netch no more.\nThe netch simply sighed and said, \"Mocking others is for naught, for none can change their own weakness.\"\nThe Gifted &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt;\nOne day a farmer decided to give his daughter a gift. She had started a family of her own, and he wished good fortune for her. He chose his finest guar and brought it to his daughter's new home.\nHis daughter was delighted at this gift, but her husband only glared.\n\"You didn't even let us choose?\" the husband asked angrily. \"What if this guar is sick, or old, or weak? I must at least inspect it before it's left in our care!\"\nThe daughter tried to calm her husband, but the farmer simply nodded and said, \"You may examine this guar as you see fit.\"\nThe husband inspected every inch of the guar, even forcing the beast to open its mighty jaws to look at the state of its teeth.\n\"Well, it will have to do,\" the husband conceded, though he knew it was a fine guar indeed.\nThe farmer stroked his chin. \"You know, I think you're right. You should be able to pick whichever guar you wish. I know there's plenty for sale in the local market.\"\nThe husband simply gaped as his father-in-law walked back home, guar in hand.\nHis wife slapped her husband's arm and told him, \"You fool! Never look a gift guar in the mouth!\"\nThe Child of the Councilor\nOne summer's day, a councilor was walking along the market in her splendid regalia, attended by her many servants. She was so splendid that a small mer in the crowd told his mother, \"I wish my mother was a councilor, instead of you!\"\nThe little &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; never expected the councilor to hear him, nor did he expect her to turn toward him in the crowd.\n\"I have heard your wish, little one, and I accept,\" she told the open-mouthed little mer. \"You will be my child, and you will have all that you wish.\"\nThe little mer was immediately taken to the councilor's manor and placed in a room with toys and sweets. He laughed and clapped his hands, playing and eating all he wished. But soon he grew bored and went to speak to a servant.\n\"It's no fun playing by myself,\" he told the servant. \"Can I have someone to play with?\"\n\"The child of the councilor has no equal,\" the servant told him. \"There is none worthy to play with you.\"\nThe little mer had little time to think on this when a scholar came to his room. The scholar looked upon the little mer with scorn and said, \"Your lessons should have begun hours ago! The child of the councilor must know many great things.\"\nThe little mer was made to listen to the scholar's lectures for hours and hours, and soon his head ached with all that he was to know.\nEventually it was time for dinner, but the little mer's troubles were not over.\n\"In those clothes? In that state?\" cried his servant, horrified. \"You must be washed and clothed if you are to be presented as the child of the councilor!\" And so the little mer was scrubbed roughly and forced into very uncomfortable clothes.\nBy this point the little mer was almost in tears. He missed his home, and his clothes, and his friends. But most of all he missed his mother, who he had never gone a day without.\nWhen the little mer was finally sent to the dining hall, he was met with a surprise. Seated at the dining table was his family, all laughing and smiling. He ran to his mother arms and cried, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I want you to be my mother after all!\"\nThe councilor, who was seated at the head of the table, smiled and told the little mer, \"You have learned a very important lesson, my child. We often forget to be thankful for what we have, when thinking only of what we want.\""}

Driven by his great love of maths, his mind turned to counting. \"I shall count every star and give each a name!\" he resolved. For hours he counted and named until, at length, his eyes tired and he drifted off to sleep.\nWhen morning came, Sotha Sil woke with a start and looked up at the sky. Alas, all the stars had vanished. He buried his face in his hands and began to weep, for he had learned a harsh lesson. You see, child, time cages all tasks.\nThe Strongest &lt;a href=\"Nix-Ox%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nix-Ox&lt;/a&gt;\nA great nix-ox trumpeted to its herd, \"None of you love the master more than I! Do you see what great burdens I bear?\"\n\"But you are twice our size!\" the lesser nix-oxen grumbled. \"Better for us to carry four bales of saltrice than struggle with six and risk great injury.\"\n\"Bah!\" the mighty nix-ox snorted. \"It's hard work you fear, not injury.\" The great beast took up its yoke and trudged out into the field.\nThe lesser nix-oxen gathered by a fence and watched their mighty brother take up two bales of saltrice, then four bales, then six, eight, ten! Until at last, the great nix-ox was laden with twelve full bales. \"Do you see?\" it said, straining for breath. \"None of you love the master more than I!\"\nJust then, the nix-ox's shell began to crack under the weight. It let out a painful bellow and collapsed under the bales\u2014crushed to death.\nThe lesser nix-oxen sighed and shook their heads. \"Poor fool. He learned too late that there is no mortal strength without limits.\" \nThe Tale of the Frozen &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt;\nA lonely guar struggled through the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; on a cold, moonless night. The wind was frosty and bitter and chilled the animal to the bone. \"Alas!\" it cried, \"I will die here, alone in the cold.\"\nJust then, the guar caught sight of a faint orange glow in the distance. \"A campfire?\" it barked hopefully, \"It must be! It must be!\"\nThe guar raced toward the light, its feet growing warmer with every step. Soon, the cold gave way to a sweltering heat. The air grew thick and acrid, searing the guar's nostrils and lungs. But still, it hurried on, barking, \"It must be a campfire! It must be! It must be!\"\nFinally, the guar reached the orange glow. Alas, it was not a campfire, but a great flow of lava. The guar, so seduced by the warmth, gave this truth no heed. It sprinted to the lava's edge and tripped on a loose stone. With one last joyful bark, the beast landed headfirst in the fiery liquid and died.\nSo you see, child, a fool's thirst for safety carries its own risks.\nThe Most Beautiful ]&lt;a href=\"Netch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Netch&lt;/a&gt;\nA netch mother once said to her calf, \"You, my darling, are the most beautiful netchling in all these isles. No bull is worthy of you!\"\nFor years the netch's vanity grew. Many worthy bulls approached her with loving intent, but she rebuffed them all, saying, \"Do you not know that I am the most beautiful netch in all these isles? None of you are worthy of me!\"\nAt length, the netch grew old and weary. \"Alas, I shall die alone!\" she cried.\nA young netch couple passed her by and sighed at her wretched condition. \"We must be cautious with our calves,\" the betty said. \"Smothering a child with praise does nothing but harm.\" "}

It gazed out over the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; and cried, \"Ha! There is no shroom beetle taller than I! There is nothing I cannot see!\"\nJust then, a &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cliff racer&lt;/a&gt; swooped down and plucked the beetle from its perch. The beast grinned a wide toothy grin and said, \"Had you stayed on the ground, I never would have seen you. Is it not better to be short than dead?\"\nAlas, the beetle learned too late that forsaking one's nature brings nothing but ruin.\nThe Tale of Two Herders\nTwo &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; herders met in the market square, preparing to sell their stock. The shorter of the two laughed at the other and jeered, \"You bring only one guar to market? Look upon my herd! I have brought ten and twenty and stand to make a fortune!\"\nThe tall herder merely shook his head. \"You may have ten and twenty guars, but they are scrawny and frail. Better to have one steady beast than a hundred sickly ones.\"\nThe short herder released an oafish chuckle and prepared to usher his beasts into the pens. Just then, a great ash storm arrived and pummeled the market with howling winds and choking fumes.\nEventually, the storm relented. The tall herder and his great, strong guar were unharmed, but the short herder's guars were thrown this way and that, and not one of them had survived.\n\"Do you see now, my friend?\" the tall herdsman said. \"Numbers are no substitute for quality.\" \nThe Friendly &lt;a href=\"Alit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alit&lt;/a&gt;\nA jovial alit pranced across the Ashlands, ever watchful for a beast it could call \"friend.\" Presently it came upon a &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nix-hound&lt;/a&gt; who was preening itself in an ashpit. The alit smiled a great smile and cried out, \"Greetings, friend!\" The nix-hound, seeing the alit's huge teeth, panicked and dashed under a rock. The alit sighed and pranced on.\nIn due course it came upon a &lt;a href=\"vvardvark\"&gt;vvardvark&lt;/a&gt; rooting through a beetle-nest. \"Hello!\" the alit shouted, smiling widely and revealing its huge, sharp teeth. The vvardvark squealed in terror and scampered off into the bushes. The alit released another mournful sigh, and trundled on toward the shore.\nFinally, it spotted an &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Hopper%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ash-hopper&lt;/a&gt; rolling in the sand. The alit summoned up its widest, most cheerful smile and said, \"Hail, ash-hopper!\" The ash-hopper leapt back in horror and sprung away as fast as it could.\nThe alit was heartbroken. \"I will never have a friend as long as I have these terrible teeth!\" it hissed. The beast resolved to be done with them altogether. It took a huge rock in its mouth and bit down hard\u2014knocking out all its teeth like a box of loose nails. \"Finally,\" it sighed \"other beasts will no longer be afraid!\"\nJust then a great &lt;a href=\"Kagouti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kagouti&lt;/a&gt; arrived, stomping its feet and preparing to pounce. The alit growled and opened its wide jaws to frighten the predator away, but the kagouti just laughed. \"You fool! You've no teeth left in your head!\" The alit realized its folly too late. The kagouti lunged and swallowed the cheerful beast in one huge gulp.\nSo you see, child\u2014that which we hate in ourselves is often our greatest gift.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and the Cripple\nLord Vivec, while walking down a road, came upon a cripple with a gnarled and withered hand. \"Young bravo!\" the cripple cried, \"Will you not help an oathman in need?\"\nVivec stood before the cripple and furrowed his brow. \"What is wrong with you, old mer?\" he queried.\nThe cripple lifted his hand and replied, \"Do you not see my withered hand? It is twisted as old roots and pains me greatly when the storms roll in. Women shun me because of its ugliness, and children run at the sight of it. Please, have pity!\"\nVivec stood quiet for a moment, then drew his bright sword and severed the &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;'s hand in one clean stroke. The cripple howled in pain as the warrior-poet dressed the wound.\n\"Do not bawl so, old mer,\" said Vivec. \"Do you not see that I have done you the greatest kindness? Better to be done with an evil than to carry it on for pity's sake.\" "}

Central to this spell is a specific enchanted item, which must be destroyed during the ritual so that the Coven will be 'blessed by its ruination'. Fortunately, this item has already been obtained by a Contact of the Coven, meaning the Agent simply has to head to the town in which they reside and obtain the item.\nCasting Costs.\nWith the Contact's name in hand, the Agent simply has to travel to the town identified by the Beldam and ask around for their location. Once that has been revealed the Agent must find the Contact and speak with them, only to be told:\n\"I ain't givin' up this [enchanted item] for less than 1000 gold pieces. And I'm only willin' ta do that for [Coven name].\"\nThe Agent must therefore pay the Contact 1000 in gold pieces, not a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Credit%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Letter of Credit&lt;/a&gt;, to get hold of the item. Once the money has been handed over the Agent will receive the item, and must take it back to the Beldam before the time limit expires to complete the quest successfully.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt; from the Beldam for successfully completing the quest, as well as a boost in reputation by with that specific Coven.\nConversely, failing the quest will see the Agent lose reputation with the Coven:"}

He gives her some of his power and orders her to defile the shrines, then move on to &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"Torinaan is a holy site dedicated to the Divines. It's been corrupted by Daedra. The loyal clergy there want my aid in cleansing the area.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest starts after the Vestige speaks to &lt;a href=\"Aldarch%20Colaste\"&gt;Aldarch Colaste&lt;/a&gt; in ruins of &lt;a href=\"Torinaan\"&gt;Torinaan&lt;/a&gt;, west of &lt;a href=\"College%20Wayshrine\"&gt;College Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. She informs them that Torinaan is infested with Daedric beings and energies. To stop them, the shrines that fuel them must be cleansed and that is what Aldarch Colaste asks of the Vestige.\nThere are four shrines that need to be restored, each having their own rooms. Each room bears two shrines for different set of Divines.\nThe first shrine room is for &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Each shrine is guarded by Daedra which have to be killed in order to cleanse them. Next is for &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. To restore Stendarr's shrine, one has to light all four braziers before the first brazier goes out. The same drill applies to Mara's shrine. Next is &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;' shrines. To restore Trinimac's shrine, the Vestige must take the Rod of Divine Flame found on nearby corpse, stand behind a brazier in the corner and face towards the altar. Using the rod there will cleanse the shrine. To restore Xarxes' shrine, the Vestige must stand behind a brazier directly right from the entrance to the room to light up the middle brazier and then stand behind that middle brazier to light up the shrine. The last shrines belong to &lt;a href=\"Auri-el\"&gt;Auri-el&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;. To restore Auri-el's shrine, the Vestige must pick up the Chalice of Holy Waters, stand in the water and face the shrine. Same thing with Y'ffre's shrine.\nAfter restoring all four shrines, the Vestige must enter the central shrine to put an end to this corruption. There, a Daedra by the name of &lt;a href=\"Vregas\"&gt;Vregas&lt;/a&gt; will be waiting for them near the portal. Defeating him the portal will close and Aldarch Colaste will invite the Vestige to speak with her. She will say that the Divines have more to say to them and asks the Vestige to follow her. The Divines will show them the vision of &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt; communing with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric prince of destruction. The prince will tell her to corrupt the shrines at Torinaan and then move out to &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. Aldarch Colaste will thereafter will reward the Vestige and ask them to stop the blasphemer."}

These storms are reddish dust storms that carry the blight and have extremely high winds associated with them. Due to the danger of infection and belligerent creatures, residents of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; often advise against travelling during an Ashstorm.\nSymptoms.\nThe Ashblight has several separate symptoms, depending on who is unfortunate enough to contract it. The creatures of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; are also affected by this affliction. The disease causes uncommon aggression in normally peaceful creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Kwama&lt;/a&gt;. These symptoms could be alleviated by obtaining &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Blight%20Potion\"&gt;Cure Blight Potion&lt;/a&gt;, but as some store owners indicated (or wished the townspeople to believe), this potion was difficult to obtain (see \"&lt;a href=\"Cure%20Blight%20Potion%20Notice\"&gt;Cure Blight Potion Notice&lt;/a&gt;\").\nOrigin and elimination.\nThe Ashblight (along with &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt;) was created by &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. According to him, the Ashblight was used to help gain converts to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House cult&lt;/a&gt;. As Dagoth Ur resided in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; stronghold in Red Mountain, the Ashblight spread through the Red Mountain Ashstorms. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, the reincarnation of an ancient warrior named &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, killed Dagoth Ur, and in so doing, cut the source of the Ashblight, effectively eliminating it. Afterwards, the ashstorms lost their red tint and became simple ashstorms again. Even though the Blight was eliminated, a few \"blighted\" creatures remain. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; were known to make an extract called \"&lt;a href=\"Ash%20Salts\"&gt;Ash Salts&lt;/a&gt;\" with the ash of Red Mountain to cure the disease. The ash has a healing property which transformed &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; to live without light during the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;."}

This is a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; Dungeon, which is divided into three areas: Cave, Towers and Bastion. It is located east of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lover%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lover Stone&lt;/a&gt; and northeast of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. If approached from the top of the mountain, there is a small opening in both towers that allows access to the Bastion without going through the cave.\nSummary.\nCave.\nThe cave is a small vertical dungeon. There are six Forsworn there. The Dragonborn may dispose of or sneak by them to gain entrance to Towers.\nTower.\nTowers is an outdoor section similar to many towers across Skyrim. The lower tower has a ground level window that allows entry without going through the cave. If the lever is pulled, the gate opens. There are three Forsworn in the area. On the other side of the bridge, there is a locked gate that cannot be opened yet. The upper tower also has a ground level window which allows entry without going through the cave or lower tower.\nBastion.\nBlind Cliff Bastion is a small dungeon. In the beginning, there\u00a0is a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Melka\"&gt;Melka&lt;/a&gt; in a cage. She will ask the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to free her, and kill her sister &lt;a href=\"Petra\"&gt;Petra&lt;/a&gt;, who has taken over her Bastion. She can be freed by pulling the chain near the cage. Melka will not turn hostile and will even assist/tell how to get past the various traps in this section. There are five Forsworn in the dungeon and the hagraven Petra. When all of them are dead, Melka rewards the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Melka\"&gt;Eye of Melka&lt;/a&gt;, a unique staff. There is an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; past the swinging blades.\nJust before arriving to the alchemy lab is a hidden door, opened by activating a handle next to it. It leads back to the cage portion where there is a chest, two urns, two &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ingot\"&gt;corundum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Refined%20Moonstone\"&gt;moonstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quicksilver ingot&lt;/a&gt; each. In the last room is a barred door that leads to the extreme top of the upper tower which has two &lt;a href=\"burial%20urn\"&gt;burial urn&lt;/a&gt;s. The Dragonborn may drop down into the tower to find two chests."}

He and a few of his troops managed to escape, but others were taken captive inside the walls. He remarks on the peculiarity of the Stormfist presence in the area, as he hasn't seen the clan in this part of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in decades. Lieutenant Koruni has sent word to the Captain that she aims to retake the fort, and is trying to sneak into the central barracks. He requests the Vestige liberate the captured defenders, and afterwards report to the Lieutenant to provide assistance. Inquiring about the relevance of the fort reveals its primary purpose is to defend the burial chambers beneath it, where most of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords'&lt;/a&gt; departed rulers are buried, including &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Nurnhilde\"&gt;Queen Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;, the deceased sister of &lt;a href=\"King%20Jorunn\"&gt;King Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fildgor\"&gt;Fildgor&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe captured Morvunskar soldiers are kept at various locations throughout the fort, with each of them being guarded by a detachment of various Stormfist troops. After dispatching the Stormfists and freeing the soldiers, the Vestige must make their way to the central barracks of the fort where they will encounter Lieutenant Koruni. Alternatively, the soldiers can be persuaded to join the Vestige if the Persuasion perk is unlocked. Lieutenant Koruni will say the following.\n\"You rescued my soldiers. For that, you have my thanks.\"\nI'll deal with Halskar and find his orders. \"I had a feeling about you! Glad to see that I was right. Now follow us!\"\nUpon entering the barracks, the Vestige will have to make their way through the Stormfists to the second floor of the building. Once there, they must confront and defeat Warlord Halskar, who guards a strongbox. Opening the strongbox reveals his possessions, which include his orders and a collection of relics from the crypts beneath the fort. Upon closing the strongbox, the spirit of Queen Nurnhilde will appear, who tells the Vestige the following.\n\"\"I am Nurnhilde, Queen of the Nords. I come to you from &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; with an urgent demand.\"\"\nThe Vestige must now head down to the first floor of the barracks to report to Lieutenant Koruni. Upon informing her they have defeated Halskar, she will read Halskar's orders, which reveals Stormfist troops assaulted the fort through the crypts and surprised the defenders. They weren't after the fort itself though, their true prize is inside the crypts. Koruni will reward the player and the quest will be complete."}

Together we hope to stop Mercer Frey from stealing the Eyes and escaping from Skyrim with the Skeleton Key of Nocturnal.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon arriving at Irkngthand, be wary of the &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; who have set up camp here. It will be necessary to fight a way up to the top to gain entry to Irkngthand.\nIrkngthand.\nOnce inside, go across the hall and grab the loot in the &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; by the fire and bodies. On both sides of the fire are two Dwemer chests, one with an adept lock and the other a master lock. Continue on up the stairs. Make a right, then move forward, down the hallway. Go past the water and through the gates into the next hall. To the right at the end of the ledge is an unlocked chest, and another one can be located down near the patrolling sphere. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt; patrolling at the bottom of the stairs. If detected, more of them will come out the holes in the walls, so dispatch them as quietly as possible. (One way is to use a &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; attack and kill them one by one.) It is also possible to sneak past the spheres without being noticed. Go to the left of the gate and jump over the fence, then go into stealth and sneak past the one sphere that deployed. In the next room, rotating flame towers will activate. Move around these without making too much noise. The towers are slow enough to sneak through them if timed well. At the final flame tower, go around it to the left and then open the gate to the right of it. Move up the stairs until the master locked gate is reached. In front of the Dragonborn, there will be a ramp with a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt; on top. Kill it and hop over the rubble pile to find a hidden chest. Opposite of the master locked gate is a lever. Pull it, and it will open a new area where Karliah and &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; are waiting. Speak to Karliah, and she will explain about the &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; that Mercer may have left.\nThere will be a trap trigger on the bottom left of the doors in front. Disarm the trap, or open the doors and avoid the flying mace ball trap. On the small table is a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Reserve\"&gt;Black-Briar Reserve&lt;/a&gt; (presumably a calling card from Mercer Frey), and three &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;. Turn left and head down the stairs; there will also be an expert locked gate full of loot to the left. Karliah will spot Mercer and a short scene will take place. Afterward, follow the path around and open the door, then down until the next hall is reached.\nUpon entering the next hall, turn right and collect the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; chest on the right side next to the Falmer hut, then turn around and head over a small mound to find the lever for the gate below. There is a second lever on the right side, across the large set of facing stairs that must be activated quickly after the first, or it will reset and the door will not open. Once the door is open, travel down the stairs, watching for the spinning blades in the ground, and go through the door. Move through the large area, killing the small groups of enemies. Once at the other end, a collapsed tower can be seen, and it is necessary to go up the spiral ramp and through the door at the top. Before leaving the room, make sure to stop and collect the loot that is in the Falmer chest, which is located next to a Falmer tent to the left on the way to the ramp out.\nGo down the stairs, carefully avoiding the bear traps. Grab the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Detect%20Life\"&gt;Detect Life scrolls&lt;/a&gt;; there is one near the table on the floor and two in the room to the right. In the room with the two Detect Life scrolls, there will be writing on the walls from Mercer Frey that says, \"One Step Ahead - Mercer.\" The writing, however, is backwards. Travel through the other gate (be cautious for more bear traps), then through the door at the end of the corridor, which leads to a large hall. Brynjolf will explain that the options are to either sneak around or take on the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. The level of this enemy is determined by the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;Character Level&lt;/a&gt;: 10\u201315 will face a regular Centurion, levels 20\u201330 will most likely be a Centurion Guardian, and levels 45+ will face a Centurion Master. Because there are a lot of Falmer in this room, it is possible to jump off of the small bridge to the right. On the left, there will be a button that activates the Centurion. Activate it, and the Falmer will become hostile and weaken or kill the Centurion with no intervention from the Dragonborn.\nRegardless of the choice, continue to the cage, and then go up the stairs. There should be a path that leads up and around to the next destination. Be cautions of more Falmer traps. Past the bear traps, there should be some &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; and Falmer across the hall. Once they have been dispatched, collect the loot in the chest next to the Falmer tent at the bottom of the stairs and go through the door leading to the Irkngthand Slave Pens. Go down the stairs and quickly kill the Dwarven Spider, then head left and continue down the stairs. Activate the lever and a spinning blade will take out the two Falmer down below; remember to turn it off before continuing. Run down the hall, but be careful of the three flame pressure plates near the corner.\nOnce in the next hall, Karliah will say that there are a lot of Falmer in the next room, and will give the option to either sneak or take them on. If it seems easier to sneak past, simply go to the far right-hand side wall and follow it all the way around, into the pen with a small cave at the rear. There is a chest next to the first fire pit in a Falmer tent, and another one in a tent directly across from the first. After the cave, the party will be in a larger cave, with two &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; Falmer in front. Continue down the ramp, and there will be several &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chaurus&lt;/a&gt;, along with another Falmer. If the Sneak skill is high enough, it is possible to bypass the chaurus and Falmer by sneaking along the golden pipes above their heads. Continue through the rear of the cave onto a downward hill, making sure to kill the Falmer before dropping down. Head through the gate, then down into Irkngthand Sanctuary. \"Note: there are a number of &lt;a href=\"%23Bugs\"&gt;quest-breaking glitches&lt;/a&gt; in the next stage, so be sure to create a save before entering the door.\"\nSlaying Mercer Frey.\nMercer will be removing the eyes of the statue as the party enters. He will spot the group, and then make the part of the ledge the Dragonborn is standing on collapse. Before the battle begins, he will converse shortly with the Dragonborn about the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and honor before engaging in combat.\nSubsequently, he will use a &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt;-type spell on &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt;, making him attack &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;, and thus rendering them unable to help with the fight. The following are strategies to battle him:\nOnce Mercer is dead, loot both the Skeleton Key and the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;Eyes of the Falmer&lt;/a&gt; from his body, including anything else on him, that being his weapons, gold, potions, and more. His death will also break the spell on Brynjolf and allow him to regain control of his body and stop attacking Karliah.\nEscaping from Irkngthand.\nBrynjolf and Karliah will jump down and the chamber will start filling up with water. Once the water is high enough, a rock above the statue's head will fall off and open up an area above it. Head into the area, which will lead to an entrance to &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Water%20Cave\"&gt;Bronze Water Cave&lt;/a&gt;.\nConclusion.\nUpon speaking to Karliah, she will explain that returning the key will not be easy. The inner sanctum has been locked due to the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Nightingales\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt; failed to protect the key in the first place, and the only way through is via the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Path\"&gt;Pilgrim's Path&lt;/a&gt;. Brynjolf will head back to the guild while Karliah is too afraid to face &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; after her failure, so the Dragonborn must do this alone. After telling the Dragonborn to return the Skeleton Key, she will hand over the &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Bow\"&gt;Nightingale Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarliah will tell the Dragonborn about the various \"Agent\" aspects that can be assumed at the end of the quest."}

I still can't bring myself to travel, the fear paralyzes me every time I think about leaving.\nAlmost a year ago, I was headed into &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; to do research on some plants native to &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;. They sent me along with a large caravan, one that was well-guarded. Despite being an infrequent traveler, I felt safe among the guards and heavy wagons.\nThat illusion shattered only four days into our journey. In the morning, as we prepared for our departure, I heard that one of the late-night watch had gone missing. At first, my traveling companions shrugged it off, assuming he'd just abandoned his post (which is apparently common), but we discovered his pack as we continued loading up. We set out, anyway, the question of what had happened hanging over us.\nBy mid-day, one of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; guards spotted something ahead of us on the trail. He scouted forward to investigate, and if a Khajiit can look pale, he did upon returning. He went straight to the caravan master, saying nothing. After some prying, I learned that the Khajiit found the guard's body, propped up in our path. Rumor had it that there was one arrow through his throat, marked with the word \"Bliss.\"\nHe was only the first. Every night, another guard went missing. Every day, his body was discovered on the trail ahead of us, an arrow marked with the word \"Bliss\" through the throat. The caravan was in turmoil. Some begged to turn back, but we were more than halfway to Dune by thn, and the caravan master wouldn't hear of it. No one slept, guards were put on double duty, campfires were built all along the perimeter -- but without fail, someone still disappeared every night. We took to constant travel, sleeping in shifts on the backs of lurching wagons.\nI woke from a fitful sleep two days out from Dune to discover my wagon had stopped moving. Bleary, I slowly sat up and peered over the wagon's side. All around me lay bodies. Every single remaining member of the caravan lay dead, with an arrow marked \"Bliss\" through the throat. I scrambled from one to another, trying to find any sign of life, but soon gave up and collapsed. Who or what could do this? Why? Why inscribe that word onto the arrows?\nThe two days from then to Dune are a blur. I was certain they'd find me, that they or he or it had just missed me. It feels now like I was supposed to escape, supposed to tell the tale.\nNo one believed me - when I rode out with the town guard to the site of the massacre, there was nothing there. Not a trace. I wondered if I had gone mad, but only a week later more reports started coming in of phantom archers playing the cruel game with caravan after caravan, always using arrows marked \"Bliss.\"\nI haven't had the will to leave Dune and return to the Mages Guild, though they've sent couriers to find me. Even though no reports have come for months, I cannot fight the fear and leave.\nWhoever did this is still out there. I'm sure of it."}

Blizzard can essentially be considered a more powerful &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Cloak&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as both surround the caster with frost\u2014but Blizzard has a much larger area-of-effect and higher damage, but only lasts ten seconds, as opposed to the 60 seconds of Frost Cloak.\nUsefulness.\nCrowd control.\nIt can be very effective in dealing with large groups of enemies because of its large area of affect and its high damage. However, it may be more effective to use the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt; spell, as Blizzard also causes a small amount of damage to the Dragonborn.\nSynergies.\n&lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Weapons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Frost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Weakness to frost&lt;/a&gt; cause enemies to take additional damage from Blizzard. This may be especially effective when used on &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, since many more targets may be hit by the arrows before the spell's effects expire.\nCounteracting the damage to self.\nThrowing up &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;s may limit damage inflicted on oneself by this spell. Casting a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Circle\"&gt;Guardian Circle&lt;/a&gt; may also help restore some of the damage inflicted by it.

This is presumably because of the damage dealt to oneself during the spell's duration.\nLeveling.\nBecause Blizzard deals damage to the caster, it can be used to level up the Destruction skill without enemies being within its area-of-effect radius."}

Its low magicka cost and fast regeneration means that it can be used efficiently in tandem with other spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Ward&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Elements\"&gt;Resist Elements&lt;/a&gt;. It could also be used as an extra block that does not use stamina or a block boost, for a single hit.\nSome players may find it better not to upgrade the spell, as doing so would increase magicka costs. It may be more worthwhile to simply cast it twice non-upgraded and use other magicka than it would be to have the extra health bonuses.\nBlizzard Armor can be activated when stunned. If the enemy staggers the &lt;a href=\"Fugitive%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fugitive&lt;/a&gt; and then sends an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;, this can prevent the stun effect as well as negating its negative health effects. When blocking, this can negate damage long enough for a new one's magicka to be regenerated entirely."}

The first one will be very close to the entrance.\n(Optional) Wipe out the Glenmoril Witches.\nWhile the quest only requires the death of one of the witches, it may be of benefit to kill all five. Later on after curing Kodlak of Lycanthropy, the Dragonborn may cure themselves, provided that a second head has been acquired. Afterwards, the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt;\" requires two more heads, as &lt;a href=\"Vilkas\"&gt;Vilkas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt; wish to be cured as well. The fifth head will remain unused as Aela will choose to remain a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nKodlak.\nUpon returning to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, several citizens can be noticed gathered around near the stairs leading to &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;. Halfway up the stairs, &lt;a href=\"Torvar\"&gt;Torvar&lt;/a&gt; and Aela the Huntress are found next to some dead Silver Hand members. After entering the building, Vilkas seeks the Dragonborn out and asks where they were during Companion's time of need, as in their absence, the Silver Hand attacked Jorrvaskr, managed to kill Kodlak and take off with all the fragments of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;. Kodlak\u2019s dead body is near the central fireplace, with Farkas and &lt;a href=\"Njada%20Stonearm\"&gt;Njada Stonearm&lt;/a&gt; next to him. Vilkas claims that his death will be avenged, which ends the quest and immediately starts the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Purity%20of%20Revenge\"&gt;Purity of Revenge&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

They are the first named species of dragon the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will encounter, which begin appearing after reaching Level 18. \nPhysical appearance.\nBlood dragons are bigger, faster, and stronger than their &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;generic brown cousins&lt;/a&gt;. They are also significantly more reptilian, being a vibrant green color, with much smaller, smoother scales, and horizontally-slit yellow eyes. They feature a wide frill in place of horns, and a dorsal fin in place of spines. Their tail frill is also a leaf-like fin instead of the usual diamond shape seen on other dragons.\nGameplay.\nAerial.\nThe dragon will begin by staying airborne, making sweeping dives or hovering in place to use its breath. A melee-focused character should find cover and stock up on healing items in case they get caught in a blast, as it can cut their health down quickly (&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is especially dangerous to melee fighters, as it cuts their stamina and slows their movement). When the dragon hovers or circles above, using a\u00a0bow\u00a0to chip away at its health can be effective.\nA magic-focused character may find combat with these dragons easier, as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lesser Ward&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be sufficient to block or absorb a breath attack, if they have enough\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Once it stops attacking, respond with spells:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0for frost breath dragons, and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0fire breath dragons, as they take more damage against the opposite type. This may not be effective at long range.\nGrounded.\nWhenever the dragon lands, either run up and use melee attacks, or attack it with spells from a distance. Stay away from its head, as it will continually bite or breathe fire or frost, which can easily be fatal. However, even when it is not facing the Dragonborn, the dragon can still beat its wings or swing its tail to deal substantial damage.\nOnce the dragon falls below half-health, it can no longer maintain flight and will crash to the ground. If one is a melee-focused character, strafe around it and keep attacking, dodging when necessary. Power attacks will stagger the dragon and cancel its attacks.\nIf the Dragonborn is a mage,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oakflesh\"&gt;Oakflesh&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stoneflesh\"&gt;Stoneflesh&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be beneficial. Strafe around the dragon, continually firing the appropriate spell, and pausing when necessary to heal or let magicka regenerate. Wards can be very useful here, especially with the Ward Absorb perk, which will completely refill magicka with a single breath attack."}

He will tell you that he is a vampire hunter, and that he is clearing up an infestation of the beasts here. When you offer to join him, his companions Zungarg and Agalir will reveal themselves. You can talk to them if you wish. Either way, talk to Sabonn again and he will tell you the plan. He will give you a Bloodstone and will ask you to drop it down the well in town. This will draw the vampire lord out, so that he may be killed. \nGet into position and throw the stone into the well in the center of Goldfolly. This will cause the well to spout blood; a number of feral vampires will now charge at you. Kill them all, then speak with Sabonn again. He will express his surprise that the vampire lord did not show up, as well as show his concern that his allies Zungarg and Agalir did not join the fighting. He will ask you to look for Agalir at the east gate while he looks for Zungarg at the west gate. \nHead to the east gate. You will find Agalir's body there; examine it and you will find it to be nothing more than a blackened husk. Speak with Sabonn again and he will tell you that he did not even find Zungarg's body, but as you are speaking, Zungarg will show up and tell you he found the vampire lord's lair. Follow him to &lt;a href=\"Faltonia%27s%20Mine\"&gt;Faltonia's Mine&lt;/a&gt;; once there, you will see that Zungarg has turned. Kill him as well as the vampire lord &lt;a href=\"Lenendore\"&gt;Lenendore&lt;/a&gt;, then head outside and speak with Sabonn to finish the quest."}

Upon speaking to him, Jorald will tell you that there has been a string of murders around the farmstead. When you offer to help investigate, he will tell you to go ahead and report anything you find to him. \nIn the mill, on the balcony on the top floor, you will find the dead body of &lt;a href=\"Hramdin%20Eversmiling\"&gt;Hramdin Eversmiling&lt;/a&gt; with numerous knife wounds across his torso and hands. Across the vegetable patch from the farmhouse, you will find the body of &lt;a href=\"Eislef%20Frostmoon\"&gt;Eislef Frostmoon&lt;/a&gt; in a similar condition. Head into the farmhouse itself and you will see a stack of books on the shelf. There will be a letter in between them; take it and read it. It is a love letter to &lt;a href=\"Raerana%20Frostmoon\"&gt;Raerana Frostmoon&lt;/a&gt; from a person named &lt;a href=\"Rilyn%20Uvani\"&gt;Rilyn&lt;/a&gt; where he mentions he will take her away. \n\"&lt;Searching carefully through the books, you spot a small, folded note among the pages of one tome.&gt;\"\nOn the desk, you will find &lt;a href=\"Eislef%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Eislef's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, which details that the guy is not a big fan of Rilyn, and that he planned to marry his daughter Raerana off to Hramdin Eversmiling, one of the corpses you have found.

She will tell you that she would meat Rilyn in a cave to the southwest, and will ask you to bring him to comfort her. Asking about her dad will reveal that he was abusive and would beat her if she talked back to him. Either way, head to the cave and you will find &lt;a href=\"Rilyn%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Rilyn's Journal&lt;/a&gt;. It will describe him murdering the people at Frostmoon to get Raerana's hand. After reading it, Rilyn will appear behind you. Speak with him and he will confess to what he is done, but will ask you to keep it secret for Raerana's sake. He murdered her parents to free her because they were horrible people. He will ask you to help provide some closure for Raerana and steer suspicion away from him. \nIf you agree to help him, \nIf you side against him, head back to the farmhouse.

They killed many of her companions, and are barring her path.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, you will meet a woman named Tharayya. She will tell you that her camp was attacked by treasure hunters, and that they are currently barring the way for her escape. You can offer to clear the way for her. \nHead ahead and kill the enemies, then talk to Tharayya again. She will tell you that these goons were likely working for her ex-husband, Quintus Verres. The two of them had competing ideas about the dwemer, so when Tharayya found Volenfell first, Quintus stole her notes on something called the Guardian's Eye and killed her men. Tharayya came back with a small army, but did not forsee that Quintus would have an army too. Your next task is to look for Quintus and retrieve the research notes. \nProceed further along the path. You will find the &lt;a href=\"Desert%20Lion\"&gt;Desert Lion&lt;/a&gt; along the way, but you do not have to engage with this boss. Head on and you will eventually run into Quintus Verres; he will first send some of his men after you, before confronting you himself. After you bring him to about half health, he will start throwing fireballs at you. When you bring him to low health, he will summon a &lt;a href=\"Monstrous%20Gargoyle\"&gt;Monstrous Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;, that will crush him immediately; the gargoyle is your next opponent. Once you have killed it, retrieve Tharayya's notes and speak with Tharayya. \nShe will tell you what mut be done to get deeper into the ruins and obtain the Guardian's Eye. You are to head north into something called the Guardian's Helm and pull a lever there. Head north along the path and fight your way through some enemies until you reach a secret tunnel. There will be some Dwemer automatons in this tunnel, but nothing too threatening. On the other side, head north to find the Guardian's Helm. You will have to face off against a boss &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20Beetle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Assassin Beetle&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Boilbite\"&gt;Boilbite&lt;/a&gt; inside; kill the thing, then pull the lever. This will open the gates for Tharayya and her men; head outside and talk to her. She will tell you that the next step is to bypass something called the Guardian's Skull. She will mention that the challenge you will face there has something to do with steam. \nHead to the south until you reach the river. Head a bit east along the river, and you will find a door to your north that will lead to the Guardian's Skull. The road ahead is blocked by damaging steam, but you can use the lever here to block the steam valve temporarily. Head across quickly to face off against another boss, the &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Construct\"&gt;Unstable Construct&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have defeated this &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, pull the lever to open the door to the next room, where you will find the Release Lever that will allow you and Tharayya to progress to the Guardian's Eye. Once this is done, head back outside. A giant &lt;a href=\"Duneripper%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Duneripper&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Tremorscale\"&gt;Tremorscale&lt;/a&gt; has shown up; you will have to kill it before you can speak with Tharayya again. \nOnce Tremorscale lies dead, speak with Tharayya again and she will tell you that the Guardian's Eye is in a place called the Guardian's Orbit. She suspects that this is in one of the buildings to the south; sure enough; one of those buildings is called the guardian's orbit. Head in and fight your way through some automatons until you reach the Eye's chamber. There, you will have to face off against a trio of bosses: &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian%27s%20Soul\"&gt;The Guardian's Soul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian%27s%20Spark\"&gt;The Guardian's Spark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian%27s%20Strength\"&gt;The Guardian's Strength&lt;/a&gt;. The Spark likes to stand still and throw projectiles at you, while the other two like to use melee attacks. They will occasionally share their remaining HP equally between them, so there is no point in focusing on one over the others. Once all three lie dead, the Guardian's Eye will appear in the middle of the battlefield. \nWhen you try to interact with the Guardian's Eye, Tharayya will call out for you to stop. She will try to dislodge the eye so that it can be taken, but in doing so, she will destroy the Eye. This will cause a horde of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt; to appear; There is an endless amount of these, so there is no point in trying to fight. Flee through a door in the south, then speak with Tharayya about what just happened. This will finish the quest."}

It appears that I stumbled right into one of them.A dog approached me on the streets of Daggerfall. It seems agitated and wants me to follow it.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen the Vestige first enters Daggerfall, they will hear guards and citizens alike comment on a dog. Alternatively, the &lt;a href=\"Giblets\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; may approach the Vestige. After speaking with the dog, the quest initiates. The Vestige must follow Giblets, and will eventually reach the lifeless body of Roy, with a note next to it. The Vestige much read the note, and learn that three merchants must be spoken with.\nThe first merchant is Cristoph Lamont, who can be found at his market stall in the Daggerfall market. When initiating dialogue with him, he will say the following:\n\"Welcome, friend. You can't get better fruits or vegetables anywhere in Daggerfall, I guarentee it!\"\nThe second merchant is florist Diane Guissant, who can be found at her flower shop in the Daggerfall market. When speaking to her, she will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Flowers for sale! A posy to gain a sweetheart's favor, perhaps?\"\nThe third, and final, merchant is the tailor Kareem Winvale. Opposed to the two other merchants, he can't be found in the Daggerfall market, but instead inside his shop. When spoken to, he will say the following:\n\"Interested in a set of new clothes? Something in silk, perhaps? No one ever leaves my shop empty handed.\"\nAfter locating and speaking with Captain Aresin, he will mention &lt;a href=\"Grenna%20gra-Kush\"&gt;Grenna gra-Kush&lt;/a&gt;, urging the Vestige to speak with her. After locating Grenna inside the inn, she will mention &lt;a href=\"Stephen%20Leveque\"&gt;Stephen Leveque&lt;/a&gt;, who is found on the second floor of the inn. Grenna will suggest confronting him, to learn what he knows, but urges the Vestige not to kill him, as they might need him in the future.\nWhen confronting Steven, he will point the Vestige towards &lt;a href=\"Martine%20Lerineaux\"&gt;Martine Lerineaux&lt;/a&gt;, who resides in &lt;a href=\"Lerineaux%20Manor\"&gt;Lerineaux Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reaching the manor, the Vestige will be confronted by several Bloodthorn Assassin located within. After defeating the assassins, the Vestige must make their way to the second floor, where they will meet Martine, who turns hostile on sight. After defeating him, the Vestige must enter the bedroom, where they will find a &lt;a href=\"Note%20to%20Martine\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;. Once read, it will be discovered that the Bloodthorn Assassins planned to assassinate King Casimir by sneaking agents through the docks to try and get close to him. After uncovering this information, the Vestige must return to the Captain, and inform them all they have learned. He will thank the Vestige, and award them."}

A dying archivist claimed they sought a secret sanctuary and the sacred words of Malacath that are hidden within.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAt the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Stronghold\"&gt;Fharun Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, you will meet an injured woman named Archivist Murboga. She will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt; attacked here to steal the sacred words, but that they misinterpreted the ritual to get to the words. She will ask you to collect the blood of all four archivists for the ritual, starting with her own blood. \nThe other archivists' bodies can be found throughout the stronghold. &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Akur\"&gt;Archivist Akur&lt;/a&gt; will be in the Feast House in the southeast, &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Megorz\"&gt;Archivist Megorz&lt;/a&gt; is in the Ransacked Clan House in the northeast and &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Boldarkh\"&gt;Archivist Boldarkh&lt;/a&gt; is in the Fharun Longhouse in the northwest. Once you have all the blood, a man named Azrath will show up; he is one of the &lt;a href=\"Agra%20Crun%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Agra Crun&lt;/a&gt;, a secretive order devoted to Malacath. He will give you a book called \"&lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Faithful\"&gt;Path of the Faithful&lt;/a&gt;\" and will tell you that in order to retrieve the sacred words, you must go to Malacath's shrine in the keep and then follow the book's guidance from there. \nHead into the keep, then head left to reach Malacath's shrine. There, you will have to solve the book's first riddle: \n\"Only a gift of life's most precious liquid, freely given by the holy curators, will reveal the way.\"\nThe liquid meant here is blood. to solve this puzzle, place the blood of the archivists into the four ritual bowls on the sides of the room to open the way. The door to the next portion is in the giant Malacath head. There, you are to solve the next riddle:\n\"In the prayer rooms, those who refuse to follow Malacath's light will forever walk in darkness and never find the Hall of Faith.\"\nHead on and you will reach a room with four doors. The key here is that each door will have a candle next to it, but only one of the candles is lit. The doors with the unlit candles will just lead you back to the entrance. Head through the door with the lit candle, then repeat this song and dance for the next few rooms. Eventually, you will find yourself in a room with a big well. This is where the third riddle is relevant:\n\"In the Hall of Faith, trust that Malacath will catch you, no matter how far you must fall.\"\nThe objective here is to take a leap of faith. You will land in a pool of foul liquid, but once you get out, you will be greeted by the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Words\"&gt;Keeper of the Sacred Words&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you she is ready for what you must do. here the final part of the book comes into play:\n\"Finally, in the Sanctuary of Sacred Words, only a sacrifice will call forth the teachings of the Furious One.\"\nSlay the Keeper and the Sacred Words of Malacath will appear in front of you. Take them, and Azrath will appear behind you. Talk to him and he will tell you to take the scroll to someone named &lt;a href=\"Kroma%20kra-Magla\"&gt;Kroma&lt;/a&gt; in Orsinium. You can find her in &lt;a href=\"Bludrath%27s%20House\"&gt;Bludrath's House&lt;/a&gt; just across from the Outlaws Refuge. Give her the words for safekeeping to finish the quest."}

Go to the temple and speak with &lt;a href=\"Priest%20Uugus\"&gt;Priest Uugus&lt;/a&gt; there. He will tell you that when the soldiers came, Solgra and Eveli fled through the door at the top of the temple. Head up the stairs and go after them. You will find them in a standoff with some &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;; kill the bad guys, then speak with the priestess. \nWhen you explain what is going on, Solgra will give you the key to the temple catacombs, but you will be set upon by archers immediately after you are done talking. Eveli will take an arrow for Solgra, but you do not have the time to worry about her. The attacker is someone named &lt;a href=\"Penitent%20Vumnish\"&gt;Penitent Vumnish&lt;/a&gt;; you can find her higher up on the city's walls. She will not be hostile; speak with her and you will be offered the choice to either kill her or send er to warn her superiors that you are coming. Either way, once you have dealt with her, head back into the temple to check on Eveli. She will be barely clinging on to life, but she will encourage you to make sure the King's plan does not succeed. \nAt this moment, Chief Bazrag will arrive in the temple and lament the situation. Speak with him and he will suggest using your anger at what just happened to fuel your determination to end Kurog's reign. The entrance to the tunnels will be beneath the temple library, which can be accessed from the door in the southeast. Here, a quest marker will guide you to a scroll cataloguing all the books here. This scroll contains nothing important. However, speaking to Bazrag here will reveal that he thinks the switches around the Malacath head look suspicious. There are three switches in total: left and right of the Malacath head, and on the top floor. You will notice symbols on the switches; they must be twisted in the right direction to open the way. Hints can be found in the books around the room.\nThe correct solution is that for the eastern switch, the wolf should be facing the door. For the western switch, the hammer should befacing the door, and for the top switch, the owl should be facing the Malacath statue. This will cause the head to move, revealing a pathway underneath. Head in and proceed through the tunnels; the first part will be tricky to navigate so make use of your map, but after that it's mostly a straight path. As you progress, you will overhear Kurog talking to the chiefs. At the end, you will find your way to the moot barred by a gate, but Bazrag will lift up the gate in a display of strength, allowing you to get inside and allowing the chiefs to get out. Kurog will not like this, and will send a horde of soldiers after you. Once all these are dead, Kurog and &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt; will try to kill you themselves. The moment you kill one, the other will get powered up, so it is advantageous to divide your attention. Kurog may set parts of the battlefield on fire, crating a small arena for you to duke it out. \nOnce Kurog and Alga are dead, speak with Bazrag. He will lament the death of his once-friend, and contemplate what this will mean for the future of Wrothgar and the clans. Not all of the chiefs survived, so there will probably be fighting over the dead chiefs' lands. Bazrag asks to be alone for a while, so head back to the keep. Just outside the Moot grounds, you will find &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Ramash\"&gt;Chief Ramash&lt;/a&gt;, who survived the ordeal and can bring you back to &lt;a href=\"Scarp%20Keep\"&gt;Scarp Keep&lt;/a&gt; with him. Once back, speak with Bazrag there to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Long%20Live%20the%20King\"&gt;Long Live the King&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

In recent days, several young women have been found dead and mutilated, with the most recent being &lt;a href=\"Susanna%20the%20Wicked\"&gt;Susanna the Wicked&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Windhelm guard&lt;/a&gt; busy with the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as well as a generally unhelpful disposition towards the murder spree\u2014it is up to the Dragonborn to find \"the Butcher\" and bring them to justice. The investigation takes the Dragonborn all throughout the city as they unravel the mystery, beginning at the murder scene interrogating witnesses; after an autopsy, the Dragonborn eventually stumbles into &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt; in a state of necromantic sacrifice. Enough evidence can be found in the house to begin piecing the crimes together\u2014but depending on the Dragonborn's choices, the wrong killer may be apprehended due to a lapse in judgement, and further murders will occur under their watch. Only upon deducing the proper culprit and having them dealt with will peace finally be brought back to the streets of Windhelm.\nThanks to occurring in the city of Windhelm, the quest only functions properly when done when the city is under the control of the Stormcloaks; otherwise, Hjerim may not be properly obtainable as a &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. Not only that, but the quest has many back-end issues that can cause it to run incorrectly, frequently becoming permanently broken. It is advised to complete \"Blood on the Ice\" as soon as possible and to save frequently in order to avoid being locked out of getting Hjerim.\nBackground.\n\"Windhelm is plagued by a shadowy killer. I've been asked to help investigate the latest murder.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest takes place exclusively in the city of Windhelm, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where several young women have been killed alone at night by an unknown murderer dubbed \"the Butcher.\" They have all been killed in a similar manner, left mostly naked with distinctive lacerations.\nThe Dragonborn will encounter a murder scene at night, between 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM; several bystanders and a guard stand around the corpse of Susanna the Wicked atop a burial slab in the graveyard of the city. The guard will approach the Dragonborn, telling them to keep their distance from the scene. After asking what happened and offering to help investigate, the quest will begin.\n\"Hold it there. Keep your distance.\"\nAs the guard directed, the Dragonborn should ask the witnesses gathered around the body if they saw anything. The witnesses include &lt;a href=\"Calixto%20Corrium\"&gt;Calixto Corrium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silda%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Silda the Unseen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Helgird\"&gt;Helgird&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorrium will have the following conversation with the Dragonborn:\n\"Always sad when someone dies.\"\nSilda will have this to report:\n\"Another one. Terrible.\"\nAnd Helgird will tell the following:\n\"This is a shame.\"\nAs Helgird notes, although the corpse of Susanna will not have any clothes, she will still have various items such as gemstones, &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. It is clear that this was not a robbery, but rather something much more dubious.\nAfter the Dragonborn has spoken to all three of the witnesses, they should speak again to the guard at the scene of the murder.\nI've spoken to the witnesses. \"Just like always \u2013 nobody saw anything useful. The bastard's escaped again.\"\nAlthough the Dragonborn can directly begin looking for clues into the murders, they will not receive any hints from the guards or the steward if they do so. If the Dragonborn reports to the steward, &lt;a href=\"Jorleif\"&gt;Jorleif&lt;/a&gt;, he will have the following conversation:\nI've heard about these murders. \"These are difficult times indeed, when men stalk their brethren like beasts. My men are stretched thin as it is. If you offer your aid, I gladly accept. The guards will be told to assist you as necessary. I'm happy to lend my hand as much as I can, as well.\"\nOnce the Dragonborn has received permission from Jorleif to investigate the murders, the guards will assist the Dragonborn by providing advice and hints that will lead to the advancement of the quest. Upon returning to the guard at the crime scene, the body of Susanna will be gone and the guard will render assistance.\nJorleif has granted me permission to aid in the investigation. \"All right, then. I noticed a trail of blood away from here. Helgird's taken the body into the Hall of the Dead to prepare for burial. She's a little crazy, but if she knowns anything, it's dead bodies.\"\nAdditionally, after reading one of the pamphlets across the city, the Dragonborn can ask a guard about the killer who the pamphlet has been calling the \"Butcher\":\nCan you tell me anything about the \"Butcher\"? \"Uf. Have you been talking to Viola Giordano? She posts those all over the city, and someone keeps taking them down. Ask her about it if you want an earful.\"\nInvestigation.\nThe Dragonborn can choose to follow the trail of blood leading away from the crime scene or enter the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; to speak with Helgird. \nAutopsy.\nGoing to the Hall of the Dead is optional; however, it can yield some useful information. Helgird will say the following on this matter:\nHave you noticed anything strange about the body? \"Well, she's dead. But I guess that's not unusual, at least not for somebody in here. I mean, someone who's not me, that is. Sorry, was only joking with you.\"\nTalking to Helgird here will reveal that the lacerations on the bodies of the victims were unmistakably caused by curved blades indicative of ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Embalming%20Tool\"&gt;embalming tools&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Helgird being the only person to obviously possess ancient Nord embalming tools, she insists that she had nothing to do with the murders. This indicates that the murderer also possesses such tools.\nFollowing the blood trail.\nA trail of blood leads away from the crime scene and up to the upper residential level of the city. The Dragonborn can proceed to follow the trail of blood leading from the cemetery to &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, a manor to the northwest. Approaching the door will complete the \"Examine the crime scene\" objective and remove the marker over the tomb near where the victim was found. The manor is master-locked and can be opened if the Dragonborn successfully &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt; the door or by retrieving the key. Speaking to a guard will reveal that the only person with a key to the house is &lt;a href=\"Friga%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Friga Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;'s mother, &lt;a href=\"Tova%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Tova Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;, as the house once belonged to her daughter before she was murdered by the Butcher.\nHow do I get into Hjerim? \"Friga Shatter-Shield's old place? It's been abandoned ever since she was killed.\" \"\nThe Dragonborn does not need to talk to a guard before speaking with Tova, and can go straight to her instead. The Dragonborn, if skilled enough, can &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; the key from Tova directly or can just speak with her to gain access to the house. \n\"Not really sure what to do with myself anymore. I just miss her so much.\"\nWhen the Dragonborn enters Hjerim, they will need to investigate the seemingly abandoned property, including the furniture. Upon inspecting various elements throughout the house, it will become obvious that the house is not, in fact, abandoned, but has been recently accessed. They can investigate the following, yielding individual observations for each:\nThe bloody chest against the wall of the left of the entrance contains &lt;a href=\"Butcher%20Journal%201\"&gt;Butcher Journal 1&lt;/a&gt;, which details some of the Butcher's activities. In the northwest room of the first floor lie two wardrobes and a small shelf. On the shelf in this room is a stack of pamphlets entitled, \"&lt;a href=\"Beware%20the%20Butcher%21\"&gt;Beware the Butcher!&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Viola%20Giordano\"&gt;Viola Giordano&lt;/a&gt;; obscured underneath these is an amulet with a jade carving of a skull, marked as, \"&lt;a href=\"Strange%20Amulet\"&gt;Strange Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\" The wardrobe on the right has a false back panel that hides a secret room, which contains an altar for the purposes of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromantic magic&lt;/a&gt;; also inside are bloody remains and &lt;a href=\"Butcher%20Journal%202\"&gt;Butcher Journal 2&lt;/a&gt;, the second half of the Butcher's personal details of his murderous activities. \nJoining with Viola Giordano.\nIf the Dragonborn chooses not retrieve the Butcher's second journal, they can speak to Viola Giordano, the author of the pamphlets, who can assist the Dragonborn in investigating Hjerim further. Initially speaking to her will yield this:\nWhat can you tell me about the \"Butcher\"? \"I've been following him for months now. Well, not actually following. Trying to find him. The guards won't help. The people won't help. I'm the only one who thinks he can be caught.\"\nThe Dragonborn can then lead Giordano to Hjerim or meet her there. Once outside the house, the Dragonborn can have the following conversation with her:\nReady to check out the house? \"Let's go. I'd rather not stay out here longer than I have to.\"\nInside, Giordano will move through the first floor of the house towards the northeast room straight ahead, where she will notice something off about the wardrobe with the false back. \nFind anything? \"Look here. There's something strange about this cabinet.\"\nThe Dragonborn should then, upon inspecting the cabinet, open the false back panel and enter the secret room. The Dragonborn should then pick up the journal on the altar and speak to Giordano:\n\"What's it say?\"\nAlternatively, if the Dragonborn has already investigated Hjerim and found the second journal, talking to Viola afterwards and showing her the journal will also result in her suspecting Wuunferth and telling the Dragonborn to talk to the steward about him.\nAppraising the Strange Amulet.\nThe Dragonborn can then go straight to Jorleif and accuse &lt;a href=\"Wuunferth%20the%20Unliving\"&gt;Wuunferth the Unliving&lt;/a&gt; of being the Butcher, or confront Wuunferth themselves. Alternatively, the Dragonborn, after recovering the Strange Amulet, can ask a guard about it, in which they will direct them to Calixto, the curator of &lt;a href=\"Calixto%27s%20House%20of%20Curiosities\"&gt;Calixto's House of Curiosities&lt;/a&gt;:\nDo you know what this amulet is? \"I've never seen anything like it. I would take this to Calixto at the House of Curiosities. He has a good eye for strange trinkets. Might even give you a bit of gold for it.\"\nCalixto is often located at Calixto's House of Curiosities, his house and business, and will discuss the amulet with the Dragonborn, identifying it as the symbolic Wheelstone belonging to Wuunferth. He will offer to buy it for 500 , claiming that it is merely of ceremonial value.\nDo you know anything about this amulet? \"\"\nNote that if the Strange Amulet is not sold to Calixto, it will become permanently stuck in the Dragonborn's inventory with no way of turning it into the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20Amulet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;proper version&lt;/a&gt; later.\nConfronting Wuunferth.\nNow, the Dragonborn must choose to speak to Jorleif or directly accuse Wuunferth.\nSpeaking to Jorleif First.\nThe Dragonborn can decide to go to Jorleif and tell him that the Butcher is Wuunferth, the court wizard.\nI believe the killer is Wuunferth the Unliving. \"That's quite an accusation. I assume you have proof?\"\nJorleif will then direct a guard to follow him to arrest Wuunferth and proceed to his location, usually his quarters. It is not necessary to witness Wuunferth's arrest, however doing so will yield the following:\nWuunferth: \"What is the meaning of this?\"\nJorleif: \"You're under , for the Murder of Susanna of Candlehearth Hall. And Friga Shatter-Shield. And all the rest. We're wise to your scheming, you coward.\"\nWuunferth: \"Has the whole city lost their brains? I've been scrying and auguring to find the murderer myself.\"\nJorleif: \"Make your excuses from the Bloodworks, wizard. Get him out of my sight.\"\nWindhelm Guard: \"Yes, sir! I'm sorry, sir. But you'll have to come with me.\"\nWuunferth: \"This isn't over, Jorleif!\"\nWuunferth will now be imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Windhelm Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, to which the guard will curtly say, \"In you go,\" before closing and locking the cell.\nWith the quest complete, Windhelm appears safe once again; however, following a period of three days, the body of a young female with similar cuts to the previous victims will appear outside of &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt;. A guard nearby will have the following conversation with the Dragonborn if spoken to:\nWhat happened here? Another killing? \"Indeed. I... I thought you captured the Butcher. You said the city was safe, now. How could this have happened?\"\nWith Wuunferth still behind bars, it appears that the Butcher has eluded arrest after all. Talking to Wuunferth, located in his cell in the Bloodworks of the Palace of the Kings, will make it clear that he is not the killer:\nThe killer has struck again. \"Oh, isn't that a shame. And here I am in the Bloodworks. Looks like you aren't such a sharp investigator after all.\"\nFrom this, it is clear that the Mysterious Amulet is actually the Necromancer Amulet, and that necromancy is indeed a core part of the murders. Wuunferth will reveal that he had been tracking the killer before he was arrested; on this note, he is able to determine when and where the Butcher will strike next according to the journals. The mage predicts that the next murder will occur within the next day or so; the Dragonborn must now patrol the Stone Quarter at night to catch the Butcher before he can strike again.\nSpeaking to Wuunferth First.\nAlternatively, the Dragonborn may approach Wuunferth immediately and accuse him of necromancy as well as the murders. The following conversation will occur:\nI've heard you dabble in necromancy. \"I beg your pardon? Necromancy? I am a member of the College of Winterhold, in good standing! They haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!\"\nSpeaking directly with Wuunferth instead of having him arrested results in a similar conversation with the Dragonborn, also directing them to keep watch in the Stone Quarter at night. The Dragonborn can then proceed with the quest without having to wait for the next victim and wrongfully imprisoning Wuunferth.\nCatching the Butcher.\nRegardless of the earlier paths taken, the Dragonborn finds themselves in the Stone Quarter in order to thwart the Butcher once and for all. In the markets in the southwest corner of the city, the killer will strike again; the Dragonborn should be ready to act immediately if they wish to save the next victim.\nCalixto Corrium will be present in the market; however, unlike the other characters in the area, he will simply stand around and not interact with anyone. Soon, one of the following will walk into the Stone Quarter: &lt;a href=\"Nilsine%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Nilsine Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jora\"&gt;Jora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermir%20Strong-Heart\"&gt;Hermir Strong-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Idesa%20Sadri\"&gt;Idesa Sadri&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Arivanya\"&gt;Arivanya&lt;/a&gt;; if Wuunferth was not accused of being the Butcher, then Arivanya will always be the victim. Suddenly, the target will begin shouting for help as Calixto draws a knife and slowly approaches his next victim, revealing himself to be the Butcher. \nDespite this display, the guards will not react, and so it is up to the Dragonborn. Without incurring a bounty, they may attack and kill Calixto at any time, including before he draws his knife, when he is approaching his victim, and after he has killed her. Followers may engage Calixto in combat, and it is also possible for residents, such as the Shatter-Shield clan members, or other clan members, to interfere and kill Calixto.\nIf Calixto is able to kill his victim, he will make his escape and proceed to run to Hjerim and into the secret room there. Entering will result in the Dragonborn being attacked; Calixto cannot be detained, and the quest will only progress once he has been killed. Once the deed is done, the Dragonborn should then speak with Jorleif to confirm that the Butcher has been stopped.\nCalixto Corrium was the real killer. \"Ysmir's beard! The man was always a bit odd, but I wouldn't have expected... \"\" You've done this city a mighty service, friend. I believe you'll find the guards to be a bit more cordial with you in the future.\"\nThe quest will then be completed and the Dragonborn will now have the ability to purchase and decorate Hjerim from Jorleif if they did not arrest Wuunferth; notably, this will only be available if the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; were sided with in the Skyrim Civil War or if Windhelm was taken with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn sold the Strange Amulet to Calixto previously, it can be recovered from his corpse, now becoming the Necromancer Amulet that Wuunferth mentioned; in addition, Calixto carries a key that unlocks a chest that lies on the small second level of his house. This chest contains items such as ancient Nordic embalming tools, definitively indicating that he was the Butcher."}

These creatures appear to be exactly the same as other bloodfiends we have examined in the past. But for all their similarities, they have one telling and significant difference\u2014they appear at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; cycle instead of at the end.\nInstead of appearing at the end of an otherwise long and grueling vampiric gestation period, this process changes ordinary citizens into feral monsters in a frighteningly short amount of time. It's almost like a fevered blood affliction that burns through individuals at an alarming rate. While not everyone who comes in contact with the catalyst becomes afflicted, those who do either turn into a vampire (rarely) or quickly spiral into the frenzied madness that characterizes all bloodfiends (the most likely outcome).\nMy investigations suggest that these bloodfiends have a connection to the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt; and Lady &lt;a href=\"Lleraya%20Montclair\"&gt;Lleraya Montclair&lt;/a&gt;. The court magician of &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt; and the daughter of Baron &lt;a href=\"Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt; have been leading Montclair troops across Rivenspire\u2014troops that include vampires. There have been rumors of a blood-curse, some sort of foul magic that allows Reezal-Jul and Lleraya to turn ordinary citizens into bloodfiends with nothing but a glance, a wave of a hand, and a few muttered words. Eyewitness reports have been confused, at best, and these claims have yet to be fully verified.\nAs with other bloodfiends dealt with in the past, the Rivenspire bloodfiends are vampires that have gone insane. Their minds have degraded beyond recovery, and they attack anything that moves with no regard for their own wellbeing. They are feral, violent creatures driven by their carnal lust for bones and blood. This strain of the blood-curse runs its course at an alarmingly rapid pace. I have documented instances of citizens being afflicted and turning feral in mere moments. How &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt; and Lleraya came by this terrible power is unknown. What is known is that they seem to be &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;-bent on helping Baron Montclair conquer the entirety of Rivenspire.\nThis unusual blood-curse notwithstanding, the bloodfiends operate as all others of their ilk. These wild, ferocious savages can and often do pass their affliction on to their victims. Anyone wounded or killed by a Rivenspire bloodfiend has a significant chance of becoming a bloodfiend, and in a remarkably short period of time. Until I can gather more information, I can only recommend one course of action concerning the bloodfiends of Rivenspire\u2014they must be destroyed."}

It serves as the third quest in the main storyline. Optionally, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may choose the option of learning the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nBackground.\n\"While exploring Dimhollow Crypt, I freed a mysterious young woman named Serana from an ancient sarcophagus. She asked me to guide her home, to a castle off the northern coast of Skyrim.\"\nWalkthrough.\nEscape.\nAfter speaking to the mysterious woman, it is revealed her name is &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; happens to be a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; she will comment that she could \"Smell you from a mile away.\" She seems puzzled at her newfound freedom and asks to be accompanied to her home, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;, located west of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must then proceed to the exit on the far side on the cavern. Two &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; statues will shatter and come to life. After defeating the gargoyles, proceed out of the cavern into the next room. There is a lever on the right that then opens a gate on the left, and also releases two leveled draugr from tombs on the walls.\nThrough this gate is a large arena of sorts. Several skeletons and a leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; will be seated in various places around the arena. A &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; is located on the far right where a word of &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Vitality%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Drain Vitality&lt;/a&gt; can be learned. Around this room are at least four &lt;a href=\"malachite%20ore\"&gt;malachite ore&lt;/a&gt; veins.\nProceeding through the final iron door, another gate can be found with a chain that leads back outside into Skyrim.\nCastle Volkihar.\nUpon arriving at Volkihar Castle, the &lt;a href=\"Watchman\"&gt;Watchman&lt;/a&gt; will be at the door. He initially refuses the Dragonborn entry, but upon seeing Serana with them, gives the go-ahead to open the gate to let them in.\nInside, Serana is met by a surprised &lt;a href=\"Vingalmo\"&gt;Vingalmo&lt;/a&gt; who initially berates the Dragonborn for entering, but backs off once he sees Serana, whom he gives a grandiose welcome back, only to be cut short by her father, Lord &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt;, who only seems interested in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Sun%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; that is on Serana's person.\nHe then proceeds to question her on the \"guest\" she has brought with her. She tells her father the Dragonborn is the one who rescued her from her entrapment back at Dimhollow Crypt.\nHarkon: \"My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder Scroll?\"\nSerana: \"After all these years, that's the first thing you ask me? Yes, I have the scroll.\"\nHarkon: \"Of course I'm delighted to see you, my daughter. Must I really say the words aloud? Ah, if only your traitor mother were here, I would let her watch this reunion before putting her head on a spike. Now tell me, who is this stranger you have brought into our hall?\"\nSerana: \"This is my savior, the one who freed me.\"\nHarkon: \"For my daughter's safe return, you have my gratitude. Tell me, what is your name?\"\nHarkon then asks the Dragonborn their name. The following options are presented:\nEither choice leads to the same follow up: \"I am Harkon, lord of this court. By now, my daughter will have told you what we are.\"\nHe will expand on this by mentioning \"For centuries we lived here, far from the cares of the world. All that ended when my wife betrayed me and stole away that which I valued most.\"\nThe next set of questions relate to a potential reward where Lord Harkon offers to bestow the power of a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; unto the Dragonborn.\nWhat happens now? \"You have done me a great service, and now you must be rewarded. There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again.\"\nDo I get a reward for finding your daughter? \"I was about to suggest that very thing. Yes, you most certainly deserve a reward. There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you will never fear death again.\"\nThe next set of questions are dependent upon if the Dragonborn is already a vampire, werewolf or neither. He demonstrates his immense power by transforming into a Vampire Lord himself:\nI'm already a vampire. What more can you offer me? \"You contracted a disease, perhaps, but you are no true vampire. Accept my gift and I promise that you will learn the difference. Refuse me, and I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once, but after that, you are prey.\"\nI'm a werewolf. What will happen if I accept your gift? \"Yes, I can smell it on you. The power of my blood will purge that filth and make you whole again.\"\nAnd if I refuse your gift? \"Then you will be prey, like all mortals. I will spare your life this once, but you will be banished from this hall. Perhaps you still need convincing? Behold the power! This is the power that I offer! Now, make your choice!\"\nVolkihar or Dawnguard?\nThe Dragonborn can either accept or refuse his offer:\nHarkon's tutelage.\nIf Harkon's offer has been accepted, the Dragonborn will awaken in the castle cathedral where Harkon stands before an altar, reverted back to his human appearance, and explains some of his history. He then proceeds to teach the Dragonborn how to use the vampiric powers which include Blood Magic, Night Powers and fighting \"as beasts do\". After the tutelage is done, he will have the Dragonborn speak to &lt;a href=\"Garan%20Marethi\"&gt;Garan Marethi&lt;/a&gt;, leading into the next quest on the Vampire side of the Dawnguard quest line, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bloodstone%20Chalice\"&gt;The Bloodstone Chalice&lt;/a&gt;\".\n\"Awake at last, good. The power is growing within you, and now you must learn to wield it.\"\nI'm ready to learn about my new powers: \"With my guidance you will become a deadly instrument, striking terror in the hearts of mortals wherever you tread. Now, listen to my words and do as I instruct. The true power of the ancient blood is found in the form of the Vampire Lord. Assume the mantle of the Vampire Lord, and we will continue.\"\n\"In this form, you can drain the life from your foes with your right hand. With your left hand, you can wield the power of blood magic to raise the dead. You can also call upon the powers of night to turn into a swarm of bats and reappear some distance away. Should you run out of magicka, you can descend to the ground and fight as the beasts do. Do so now and we will continue.\"\n\"Good. You are weaker while on the ground, because you cannot access the blood magic. However, the night powers are still yours to command, and your claws are still formidable weapons. Over time, your powers will grow in strength and you will find new ways to use your gifts.\"\n\"There is much to learn, but if you master the powers of the Vampire Lord, few enemies will be able to stand against you.\"\n\"There is one last thing you must know. Slaying mortal men with your life drain grants you new night powers and blood magic. I keep a stable of thralls in the castle should you need to feed like the baser vampires to stave off the sun. That is all I have to teach you. If you wish to be reminded of these lessons, you need only ask. I have a task that will test your new powers, but first, do you have any questions?\"\nWhat happened? How did I get here?: \"My blood is potent. At first, the body is overwhelmed by it. After my bite, you collapsed and fell into a slumber. Now your flesh has acclimated to the new blood that courses through your veins. I assure you, no harm was done. In truth, your strength surprises me. Not all mortals can withstand my embrace.\"\nWhat is this place?: \"A shrine to Molag Bal, the mighty Daedra Prince who is father to all our kind. Our power is a blessing from him. It is he who first bestowed the gift of the ancient blood upon me.\""}

Not giving up, Tasus invaded Bravil a second time, filling in the secret underground tunnels they found.\nOnce again, the next morning Tasus' soldiers inside the city were all killed, and once again Tasus assaulted Bravil. After his third victory over Bravil, Tasus posted his soldiers outside of Bravil along the roads and rivers to watch for the Ayleids approaching. The next morning, however, the bodies of his soldiers who had been inside Bravil were thrown over the city's parapets.\nFinally, Tasus assaulted Bravil and captured it for the fourth time. After his victory, Tasus led his soldiers over every inch of space inside Bravil, searching for and finding the hiding places of the Ayleids. Noticing narrow platforms high up on the walls as well as a non-Imperial footprint in the mud near the river, Tasus concluded that the Ayleids were levitating themselves up to and turning themselves invisible on the platforms and using water-breathing spells to survive under the surface of the river. Having discovered the hiding places of the Ayleids, Tasus' forces routed them from the city for the final time."}

While the legionaries marched into the capital city, an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; spawned in the middle of the company. More than half of the soldiers died in the encounter, including their commander. The entire company would have died if it weren't for an Imperial Captain named Tertius Ione. He managed to pull the survivors together and withdraw. Instead of withdrawing all the way back to the Imperial City, he mustered farmers and hunters from the countryside and &lt;a href=\"Pell%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Pell's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. He made of the peasant something more than they were. They returned to where to &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; had spawned and they slaughtered all the Daedra they found. The soldiers had heard that a gate at Kvatch had been closed somehow by entering it. Captain Ione left half of his troops guarding the gate, and he entered the portal with the other half. Some weeks later, one of his men, a Bosmer named &lt;a href=\"Fenton\"&gt;Fenton&lt;/a&gt; appeared half dead and mad, claiming that the rest of the soldiers had sacrificed themselves give Fenton the chance to close the portal.\nThe forces outside the gate had started building fortifications and simple buildings. After the gate was destroyed, the camp became a safe place, so a lot of people stayed and over time it became &lt;a href=\"Ione\"&gt;Ione&lt;/a&gt; town, which was named after Captain Ione."}

After that, he heads to the Imperial City's popular &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt; and strolls around there until his usual dinner time at 8pm. On Turdas, he skips the temple and spends the entire day at the Arboretum. Loredas evening sees him, Sergius, and fellow merchant Maro Rufus from &lt;a href=\"The%20Best%20Defense\"&gt;The Best Defense&lt;/a&gt;, praying in the Temple of the One between 8pm and midnight. Sundas is Sergius' day off and Tertullian is alone in the store all day.

I met with her on three different occasions for the purposes of this book. The first time was at her suite in the palace, on the balcony overlooking the gardens below.\nI was early for the interview, which had taken me nearly six months to arrange, but she gently chided me for not being even earlier.\n\"I've had time to put up my defenses now,\" she said, her bright green eyes smiling.\nLady Benoch is a Bosmer, a Wood Elf, and like her ancestors, took to the bow in her early years. She excelled at the sport, and by the age of fourteen, she had joined the hunting party of her tribe as a Jaqspur, a long distance shooter. During the black year of 396, when the Parikh tribe began their rampage through southeastern Valenwood with the aid of powers from the Summurset Isle, Lady Benoch fought the futile battle to keep her tribe's land.\n\"I killed someone for the first time when I was sixteen,\" she says now. \"I don't remember it very well -- he or she was just a blur on the horizon where I aimed my bow. It meant no more to me than shooting animals. I probably killed a hundred people like that during that summer and fall. I didn't really feel like a killer until that wintertide, when I learned what it was like to look into a man's eyes as you spilled his blood.\n\"It was a scout from the Parikh tribe who surprised me while I was on camp watch. We surprised each other, I suppose. I had my bow at my side, and I just panicked, trying to string an arrow when he was half a yard away from me. It was the only thing I knew to do. Of course, he struck first with his blade, and I just fell back in shock.\n\"You always remember the mistakes of your first victim. His mistake was assuming because he had drawn blood and I had fallen, that I was dead. I rushed at him the moment he turned from me towards the sleeping camp of my tribesmen. He was caught off guard, and I wrested his blade away from him.\n\"I don't know how many times I stabbed at him. By the time I stopped, when the next watch came to relieve me, my arms were black and blue with strain, there was not a solid piece of him left. I had literally cut him into pieces. You see, I had no concept of how to fight or how much it took to kill a man.\"\nLady Benoch, aware of this deficiency in her education, began teaching herself swordsmanship at once.\n\"You can't learn how to use a sword in Valenwood,\" she says. \"Which isn't to say Bosmer can't use blades, but we're largely self-taught. As much as it hurt when my tribe found itself homeless, pushed to the north, it did have one good aspect: it afforded me the opportunity to meet Redguards.\"\nStudying all manners of weapon wielding under the tutelage of Warday A'kor, Lady Benoch excelled. She became a freelance adventurer, traveling through the wilds of southern Hammerfell and northern Valenwood, protecting caravans and visiting dignitaries from the various dangers indigenous to the population.\nUnfortunately, before we were able to pursue her story of her early years any further, Lady Benoch was called away on urgent summons from the Emperor. Such is often the case with the Imperial Guard, and in these troubled times, perhaps, more so than in the past. When I tried to contact her for another talk, her servants informed me than their mistress was in Skyrim. Another month passed, and when I visited her suite, I was told she was in High Rock.\nTo her credit, Lady Benoch actually sought me out for our second interview on Sun's Dusk of that year. I was in a tavern in the City called the Blood and Rooster, when I felt her hand on my shoulder. She sat down at the rude table and continued her tale as if it had never been interrupted.\nShe returned to the theme of her days as an adventurer, and told me about the first time she ever felt confident with a sword.\n\"I owned at that time an enchanted daikatana, quite a good one, of daedric metal. It wasn't an original Akaviri, not even of design. I didn't have that kind of money, but it served my primary purpose of delivering as much damage with as little effort on my part as possible. A'kor had taught me how to fence, but when faced with a life or death situation, I always fell back on the old overhand wallop.\n\"A pack of orcs had stolen some gold from a local chieftain in Meditea, and I went looking for them in one of the ubiquitous dungeons that dot the countryside in that region. There were the usual rats and giant spiders, and I was enough of a veteran by then to dispatch them with relative ease. The problem came when I found myself in a pitch black room, and all around me, I heard the grunts of orcs nearing in.\n\"I waved my sword around me, connecting with nothing, hearing their footsteps coming ever nearer. Somehow, I managed to hold back my fear and to remember the simple exercises Master A'kor had taught me. I listened, stepped sideways, swung, twisted, stepped forward, swung a circle, turned around, side-stepped, swung.\n\"My instinct was right. The orcs had gathered in a circle around me, and when I found a light, I saw that they were all dead.\n\"That's when I focused on my study of swordplay. I'm stupid enough to require a near death experience to see the practical purposes, you see.\"\nLady Benoch spent the remainder of the interview, responding in her typically blunt way to the veracity of various myths that surrounded her and her career. It was true that she became the master of the Valenwood Fighter's Guild after winning a duel with the former master, who was a stooge of the Imperial Battlemage, the traitor Jagar Tharn. It was not true that she was the one responsible for the Valenwood Guild's disintegration two years later (\"Actually, the membership in the Valenwood chapter was healthy, but in Tamriel overall the mood was not conducive for the continued existence of a nonpartisan organization of freelance warriors.\") It was true that she first came to the Emperor's attention when she defended Queen Akorithi of Sentinel from a Breton assassin. It was not true that the assassin was hired by someone in the high court of Daggerfall (\"At least,\" she says wryly, \"That has never been proven.\"). It was also true that she married her former servant Urken after he had been in her service for eleven years (\"No one knows how to keep my weaponry honed like he does,\" she says. \"It's a practical business. I either had to give him a raise or marry him.\").\nThe only story I asked her that she would neither admit nor refute was the one about Calaxes, the Emperor's bastard. When I brought up the name, she shrugged, professing no knowledge of the affair. I pressed on with the details of the story. Calaxes, though not in line for succession, had been given the Archbishopric of The One: a powerful position in the Imperial City, and indeed over all Tamriel where that religion is honored. Whispering began immediately that Calaxes believed that the Gods were angered with the secular governments of Tamriel and the Emperor specifically. It was even said that Calaxes advocated full-scale rebellion to establish a theocracy over the Empire.\nIt is certainly true, I pressed on, that the Emperor's relationship with Calaxes had become very stormy, and that legislation had been passed to limit the Church's authority. That is, up until the moment when Calaxes disappeared, suddenly, without notice to his closest of friends. Many said that Lady Benoch and the Imperial Guard assassinated the Archbishop Calaxes in the sacristy of his church -- the date usually given was the 29th of Sun's Dusk 3E 498.\n\"Of course,\" responds Lady Benoch with one of her mysterious grins. \"I don't need to tell you that the Imperial Guard's position is as protectors of the throne, not assassins.\"\n\"But surely, no one is more trusted that the Guard for such a sensitive operation,\" I say, carefully.\nLady Benoch acknowledges that, but merely says that such details of her duties must remain secret as a matter of Imperial security. Unfortunately, her ladyship had to leave early the next morning, as the Emperor had business down south -- of course, I couldn't be told more specifics. She promised to send me word when she returned so we could continue our interview.\nAs it turned out, I had business of my own in the Summurset Isle, compiling a book on the Psijic Order. It was therefore with surprise that I met her ladyship three months later in Firsthold. We managed to get away from our respective duties to complete our third and final interview, on a walk along the Diceto, the great river that passes through the royal parks of the city.\nSteering away from questions of her recent duties and assignments, which I guessed rightly she was loath to answer, I returned to the subject of swordfighting.\n\"Frandar Hunding,\" she says. \"Lists thirty-eight grips, seven hundred and fifty offensive and eighteen hundred defensive positions, and nearly nine thousand moves essential to sword mastery. The average hack-and-slasher knows one grip, which he uses primarily to keep from dropping his blade. He knows one offensive position, facing his target, and one defensive position, fleeing. Of the multitudinous rhythms and inflections of combat, he knows less than one.\n\"The ways of the warrior were never meant to be the easiest path. The archetype of the idiot fighter is as solidly ingrained as that of the brilliant wizard and the shrewd thief, but it was not always so. The figure of the philosopher swordsman, the blade-wielding artist are creatures of the past, together with the swordsinger of the Redguards, who was said to be able to create and wield a blade with but the power of his mind. The future of the intelligent blade-wielder looks bleak in comparison to the glories of the past.\"\nNot wanting to end our interviews on a sour note, I pressed Lady Allena Benoch for advice for young blade-swingers just beginning their careers.\n\"When confronted with a wizard,\" she says, throwing petals of Kanthleaf into the Diceto. \"Close the distance and hit 'im hard.\""}

The official explanation is remarkably vague. Apparently, the Mad-Prince &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; flung the giant rock at &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. No one seems to know why or how. It's a curious account, even by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; standards. I took the question to the streets to see what the common folk think of Baar Dau. These were their stories. Names have been changed to protect the speakers from Temple reprisals.\nI began by speaking to a harried Dark Elf merchant named Tolvasa. She stopped sorting &lt;a href=\"kwama%20egg\"&gt;kwama egg&lt;/a&gt;s just long enough to recount this tale:\n\"Oh, my mother used to tell me all kinds of bedtime-tales about Baar Dau. I doubt any of them are true. My favorite was 'The Tale of the Lonely Magna Ge.' It begins at the Beginning. In the story, a Star-Orphan named Una fled into the sky with all her brothers and sisters, but got lost in the dark. She cried out for help, but one-by-one, her stronger, faster kin fled into Aetherius. Eventually, their songs faded away and Una was left alone\u2014adrift in the void. Just when she'd lost all hope, she heard a quiet sobbing. It was lonely Nirn, stumbling through the black\u2014weeping like a babe and trying to lull itself to sleep. Seeing a kindred spirit, Una sailed back to Mundus to comfort the lonesome planet. She named herself Baar Dau, and nestled in close, right here above Vvardenfell. Now the Star-Orphan and Nirn are never lonely, because they have each other. Lovely story, isn't it?\"\nA &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; miner called Hodstag took a more pragmatic view:\n\"It's a goldmine, that's what it is! Mark me, there's some kid of precious metal in that thing. My mate's a geologist\u2014works for the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;'s mining operations, y'know? He says it's got all the signs of a rich deposit. He's got a divining rod, see? It's a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt; contraption, I think. I'm not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, he aimed it at Baar Dau and the thing started chirping like a snow-wren in springtime! All that's left to do is get up there with a few picks and get a sample. Been looking for someone who could float me up there\u2014no luck though. Say, you don't know how to make a man float, do you?\"\nOf course, not everyone was keen to talk about Baar Dau. A grizzled longshoreman named Donoven had this to say:\n\"It's a rock. I don't know how it got there. &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; I guess? Look, I've got work to do, all right? Get lost.\"\nMost accounts were fairly prosaic. Given enough time and exposure, even the fantastical becomes mundane. Of course, there were a few truly extraordinary accounts\u2014like that of Tiram, an excitable Dark Elf scholar:\n\"It's an egg, obviously. I often hear the wastrels and peasants calling it a 'rock.' Hmph. Ignorant twaddle. Only a great fool could look at such an imposing celestial body and call it a 'rock.' Baar Dau is the chrysalis from which will emerge the last child of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s ill-fated union. On that day, our glorious lord Vehk will spring forth from his temple and do battle with the emerging nightmare-child. After forty-seven days of pitched combat, Vivec will strike the final blow and cast the beast's ruin down into the frothing sea, where it shall break into thirty-six pieces\u2014none of which will be recovered. It should be quite spectacular. And also horrifying.\"\nPerhaps the most colorful explanation came from an inebriated &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; named Narkhozug:\n\"What, that big rock? Yeah, it's a giant hunk of dung. No, seriously! Way I hear it, Vivec and &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; were up late one night, drinking and talking about godly things. You know how it is. Well, I guess you don't. Anyway, Vivec said something about &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; that rubbed old Mauloch the wrong way, so he popped a squat over the city and dropped a stink-pickle right on Vivec's head! Gross, right? Hrmph. That's Malacath for you. Does make me wonder though, what is it with Malacath and dung?\"\nWhen I asked the Doctrinal Inquisitors for an official statement, this was the only reply:\n\"You'd be wise to leave such matters to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. The precise nature of Baar Dau is a mystery. Vivec's divine mercy keeps it from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;destroying us&lt;/a&gt;. That is all you need know.\"\nDespite the Temple's best efforts, the moonlet Baar Dau remains the subject of vigorous debate, many long centuries after its arrival. The diversity of opinion is remarkable\u2014especially in a city so thoroughly policed by religious zealots. I find it heartening that even in a society this restrictive, folk tales and wild theories can still bubble beneath the surface."}

The House has never given an official statement about their choice of architecture, and most are too frightened by Telvanni's vast power to ask. It's common knowledge that the Telvanni Magisters value their privacy, but why not build a tower of stone or wood? I decided to ask the common folk their theories. Names have been changed to protect the speakers from Telvanni attention.\nI first talked to local merchants who weren't officially affiliated with the House, but often sell wares to its members. A rather exasperated &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; named Verna was happy to explain her theory:\n\"It's the smell, that's what it is! They're obsessed with this Three-forsaken stench. Can't get enough of it. I think there's something about their biology, something different from other Dark Elves. Makes them just crave the smell of mushrooms, so much so that they magicked them into towers. I've heard they sit up there all day and just inhale the fumes. Me? I just get headaches. What's wrong with the fresh scent of pine, or stone, or any other honest building material? Sometimes I think I'd rather see the towers made of &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;silt strider&lt;/a&gt; dung than of moldy old mushrooms!\"\nAn &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; inn-keeper, Makes-Some-Waves, believed that the purpose was more functional:\n\"Well, we all know that the Telvanni are isolationists. They can't even be bothered to attend the inter-council meetings. My guess is that they eat the mushrooms, to save on trips to the market. Only makes sense, doesn't it? Mushroom stew, mushroom pie, mushroom gravy! There's a lot you can make with bits of mushroom. We just don't notice because their slaves gather the stuff discreetly. Wouldn't want to ruin their image by being mushroom fanatics, would they? Well, more fanatical I suppose than simply having your entire house built out of the stuff.\"\nA rather friendly Dark Elf merchant by the name of Hader had a vastly different opinion of what the mushrooms were used for:\n\"I've heard that mushrooms are a powerful aphrodisiac. Really makes you wonder what those Magisters do all day up in those towers. I've thought about taking up my own collection, for purely studious purposes, of course. But I'd rather not attract the attention of the homeowners. Telvanni mages aren't very giving Dark Elves, even when well pleased. And I suspect they might be pleased more often than they let on, if you catch my drift. By the way, you did say that you were changing my name for this, didn't you?\"\nThe merchants who cater to Telvanni were interesting sources of material and raised many questions for me to consider, but I found myself drawn to those who worked directly for the House. Though most slaves were unwilling to speak to me, I found an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; hireling who had this to say:\n\"Well, who else is using [the mushrooms]? If they're there, they're there. Might as well make some use of them. Only useful decision the Telvanni ever made, truth be told.\"\nMaybe the truth was that simple. The Telvanni found this native flora and simply wished to make use of it. A matter of convenience seems to be the most plausible theory I had heard, but was it the truth? I had but one more source I could find who would speak their mind, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; trader by the name of Rumoc, who explained:\n\"This one always thought the towers were built to intimidate outlanders. Rumoc was most unsettled when he set up business in [retracted]. Having such a strange tower looming above you. Perhaps it represents the Telvanni themselves, yes? Imposing, mysterious, almost haunting. The Telvanni do not wish to welcome ones such as us to their lands. It is in their best interest to keep us frightened.\"\nI could get no official comment from a member of House Telvanni, other than a few strongly worded requests that I cease my inquiries. But my curiosity cannot be contained by mere threats, and the mystery of the Telvanni is something I will always find myself attempting to unravel. I take heart in the fact that even under the House's oppressive eye, so many shared with me their thoughts and theories, each more interesting and thought-provoking than the last."}

My hope is that in\nthe years that come, this letter will be read and the sad story of {...}, Prince of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; will be\ntold. I am fifteen years old at the time of this writing, and have been plagued with bad health\nfor most of my life, to the frustration of my hearty parents. The finest healers and apothecaries\nin western &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; have labored over my every cough and fever, but while they could save\nmy life time and time again, they could not improve my sickly constitution. In retrospect, I\nreceived little real affection from the king and queen, embarrassed as they were about\nbegetting such a cripple as the heir of the kingdom. I cannot say I missed the love; I received\nmuch attention from the doctors, priests, and herbalists constantly at court. Certainly I was not\nto be the sort of warrior that King Cameron was, but one of my dearest friends, a priest of\n&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; said that I might be the first scholar-king in the history of Sentinel. My younger\nsister &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; was the true favorite of my parents: athletic, beautiful, and charming. It is hard\nto think of an uncomplimentary word for her. I am resigned to my imminent death, and yet, I\nwould like to see her once again. For six years, Aubk-i and I were the only children of\nSentinel. Eight years ago, the queen had a boy child and named him &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt;, after the ancient\n&lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; word for Strong King. Few speak that tongue any longer, but all the scholars and\nnobles of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; understood. And Greklith is a strong boy indeed -- I have never so\nmuch as seen him cough. The Queen's next child, born only a year after Greklith, had an even\nmore ominous birthname -- &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;. Second Boy. Perhaps had I been less sheltered, more\nsuspicious by nature, I might have read into these nominations. Lhotun and Greklith are\ncommon enough names in our family, I reasoned. Now I know that even then, I was\ndisinherited -- even if it was not official yet. For several months before Lhotun's birth and\nover three years afterward, I was in the throes of a very serious fever. The doctors despaired\nof me, but somehow and very, very gradually, I recovered. For the first time, and the last, I\nread an expression on my father, the King's face that was not indifference. It was disgust. That\nwas a fortnight ago. Three nights ago, I was seized by men I had never seen while I was\nhaving a walk. My nursemaid stood by watching placidly as I was gagged and tied and\nthrown roughly into a sack. I do not know how long they rode with me, but I was eventually\nleft here. When I finally freed myself from my bonds, I found that I was alone. My wanders\nhave gotten me nowhere. This place is filled with &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures that prevent me from\nfinding any exit. I have no hope left, but no fear either. A few regrets. Perhaps had I studied\nmagic instead of history and science I could free myself of this place. One of my tutors told\nthe story of &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt;, how he had placed his lifeforce in the body of a powerful being\nand had thus conquered all Tamriel long, long ago. Had I only had the strength of a more\npowerful body like that. But I did not study magic. I studied history, so I leave this letter --\nnot to revenge myself, but as an historic document."}

Speaking to Lord Thadon will start the Addiction quest, which in turn must be completed in order to finish Understanding Madness.\n&lt;a href=\"Addiction\"&gt;Addiction&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Thadon asks the Hero to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Reversal\"&gt;Chalice of Reversal&lt;/a&gt;, a recipient that is able to remove all ill effects that come from consuming Felldew.

He serves as the region's main antagonist.\nBackground.\nThallik Wormfather was a necromancer in the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, he went to &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; with a group of cultists to raise &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; king slain by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;. First, he convinced an army of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; to distract the Companions and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; army from his true objective: stealing the axe &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; from the catacombs beneath &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Hall\"&gt;Fallowstone Hall&lt;/a&gt;. His diversion succeeded, and he escaped with Wuuthrad just as Pact forces led by the Soulless One attacked the Hall.\nThallik then raised Sinmur from the dead by using the power contained within Wuuthrad, shattering it into several pieces. He was killed by the Soulless One, but merged his spirit within Sinmur, making the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; giant nearly invulnerable to harm. Sinmur then rampaged through &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the northern part of the city before making his way to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric ruins&lt;/a&gt; of Trollhetta in the mountains with the remaining Worm Cult forces.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Jorunn\"&gt;High King Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; led an attack with Pact troops and the Companions, routing the remaining Worm Cult forces and fought the combined Sinmur/Thallik, weakening him using the shards of Wuuthrad. They were able to separate the two spirits and slay Thallik and Sinmur.\nAfter his death, he can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Cliffs%20of%20Failure\"&gt;Cliffs of Failure&lt;/a&gt;, participating in the\u00a0Observer's\u00a0\"game.\"\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hopes\"&gt;Shattered Hopes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter receiving the rune from &lt;a href=\"Mim\"&gt;Mim&lt;/a&gt;, if the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is with the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"So you ended up with my rune?

First established under the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; as a joint diplomatic corps and military police group for the Dominion's armies, the Thalmor, despite their collapse and reorganisation along with the Dominion twice, would foster political power within Altmeri society until it assumed governmental control over the Summerset Isles following the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor, using their diplomatic capabilities, would strictly enforce the ban on &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship in the Empire.

The justiciars of the Thalmor's paramilitary arm were often brutal and repressive, becoming known as the \"Fists of Thalmor\", to distinguish them from the diplomatic corps. With the forming of the Dominion, the diplomatic corps would also influence the citizens of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on communication between them and their &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; allies with an emphasis on fostering cultural relations. Citizens would also be permitted to question the Thalmor rulership and request possible changes. One Bosmer treethane in command of &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; was also a member of the Thalmor.\nThe Thalmor Justiciars would serve as a military guard unit in &lt;a href=\"Velyn%20Harbor\"&gt;Velyn Harbor&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the wedding between the &lt;a href=\"The%20Silvenar\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady&lt;/a&gt;. The justiciars would also dispense punishments to those who had committed crimes.\nAltmer dissidents did exist, who even outright questioned the policy of the Thalmor, accusing them of happily sending generations of Altmer to their deaths through continued involvement in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, sending the youth of the Altmer to the frontier, numbers which would double the next year. Opposition to Thalmor rule also existed among some Bosmer, who would aid the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; in combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second Aldmeri Dominion's origins can be traced from &lt;a href=\"2E%20830\"&gt;2E 830&lt;/a&gt;, when Valenwood was in the midst of a civil war between the heirs of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and another &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; faction. This faction was making overtures to create peace with the people of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; invaded the nation of Valenwood, conquering it. Justifying their invasion with a treaty from thousands of years ago, the Altmer established a provisional government, called the Thalmor, on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Anaxemes\"&gt;Camoran Anaxemes&lt;/a&gt;, whose bloodline had struck the pact with the Aldmeri Council.\nAfter creation of this new government, the &lt;a href=\"Colovians\"&gt;Colovians&lt;/a&gt; were pushed back, still weakened from the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, and any opposition was silenced. The Bosmer were grateful for the Altmer aid, and in return, Camoran Anaxemes swore fifty years of fealty to the King of Alinor, starting the Second Aldmeri Dominion.\nHaving solidified their hold on Valenwood, the Thalmor worked to consolidate their strength there while the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt; had began, commanding Bosmer tribes to skirmish with the Colovian armies along the Strid River. These attacks would come to a halt when the Third Empire was founded under &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, while encampments of both parties were still present on either side of the border. When the Thalmor would attempt to probe the defenses of the Empire, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; claimed descisive victories. At sea, the situation would be different, however, as the Dominion held the waters from the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt; with its navy. Likewise, the Thalmor repaired the roads of Valenwood, which had been overgrown from the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and changed the capital of the province from &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thalmor of the Second Dominion would fall when Tiber Septim conquered Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thalmor of the Third Aldmeri Dominion largely formed during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;; though they had always been a powerful faction within Summerset, they always consisted of a minority voice.\nThey were syndicates of wizards who led boycotts on Imperial goods in the Summerset Isles, and its members had started to worship the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. During the Oblivion Crisis itself, Summerset was hit hard. In the final moments of the Crisis, the Daedra had overran the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and before they could continue their rampage, the Oblivion Crisis had ended. In the confusion, the Thalmor came out and proclaimed themselves the ones to have ended the Crisis. The Altmer of Summerset, desperately looking for a savior, thanked the Thalmor with open arms, providing the Thalmor with authority and power. While in reality it was the effort of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; which ended the Crisis, the Thalmor certainly prevented the Isles from being overrun by the Daedric hordes. \nMonths later, some doubt began to arise. One of the defenders of the Crystal Tower, known as Rynandor the Bold, questioned the influence the Thalmor had in ending the crisis, and in doing so, was besmirched by the Thalmor. With the public opinion being in favor of the Thalmor, Rynandor's reputation was quickly tarnished, and Rynandor himself would be denounced and exiled soon after. While in exile, Rynandor had set out for &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil, but never arrived, as he and those who sailed with him were killed on the sea.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; took place in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor took advantage of the chaos in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. They incited the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; to mount a massive uprising, which worked, with Black Marsh and southern Morrowind falling to the &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, the Thalmor lost what little influence they had over the Argonians. Later, &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, had started listening to the dissidents of Summerset, but before he could do anything, the Thalmor had him assassinated.\nWith the death of Ocato, the Empire entered the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it greatly weakened. In the chaos, the Thalmor overthrew the kings and queens of the Altmer, further consolidating their grip on Summerset in &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;. They would also implement reforms, purging all those who were not of \"the blood of the Aldmer\", alongside dissidents. They would also rename the Summerset Isles to \"&lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;\", which hearkens back to the time before the rise of Man, though most people still refer to the land as the Summerset Isles. \nWhen &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt; ended the Stormcrown Interregnum, he was still trying to stabilize what remained of the Empire. In the ongoing chaos, the Thalmor staged a coup in Valenwood alongside their Bosmer allies in &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;. By using a greater network of spies and being more mobile than their Imperial counterparts, the Thalmor and Bosmer were able to defeat the Imperial generals in Valenwood, despite their smaller numbers. The Bosmer then made an alliance with the Thalmor, resulting in the Aldmeri Dominion being reborn. After this event, the Thalmor would sever all contact with the Empire for the next 70 years, giving the Thalmor the time to further consolidate their power within Valenwood and Summerset. In these years of silence, the Thalmor would also take part in trying to harm the Empire in other ways. They supplied a group of rebels in &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Natives\"&gt;The Natives&lt;/a&gt;, and also provided them with funds.\nAt the same time, the Empire was aware of the geopolitical goal of the Thalmor. Through investigations by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;, the conclusion was made that the Thalmor desired a new &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, as the Thalmor sought to pacify and purify Tamriel. To support this claim, the evidence was brought up that the reforming of the Aldmeri Dominion, persecution of refugees from Valenwood and Summerset, and Thalmor contact with Elsweyr all amounted to a build up in political tensions and military capabilities with the objective to wage war on Tamriel and usher in a new Merethic Era.\nThe Thalmor also took down dissidents outside of the Summerset Isles. Refugees who had fled to Sentinel in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2042\"&gt;4E 42&lt;/a&gt; were found and attacked by members of the Thalmor. By the time the Legionnaires stationed in the city could respond, the Refugee Quarter was already a smoking ruin. This event would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Green%20Fire\"&gt;Night of Green Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Other refugees would also be targeted by the Thalmor, though primarily &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; were targets of their attacks. On Balfiera, series of murders were attributed to the Thalmor on the basis that all of the targets were generally targeted by the Thalmor. Those of mixed blood or those in contact with organizations which were considered to be unclean by the Thalmor. In Valenwood, the situation for dissidents was worse, with the Thalmor actively working against local rebels, and having clear intelligence on the supply lines to those rebels by the Penitus Oculatus, often executing the rebels and occasionally managing to take down Penitus Oculatus Agents.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; took place, as both &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; vanished. Most of the Empire looked at this in horror, but in Elsweyr, the situation was worse. When the moons returned in &lt;a href=\"4E%20100\"&gt;4E 100&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor proclaimed they had brought them back using previously unknown Dawn Magicks. Regardless of whether or not this claim was true, the Khajiits of Elsweyr hailed the Thalmor as their saviors. Fifteen years later, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20115\"&gt;4E 115&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial influence within the land had diminished enough that the Imperial forces could not responed effectively to the coup by the Khajiits, dissolving the Elsweyr Confederacy and returning the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt;, both of which became client states to the Dominion. \nThe Great War.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor and the Blades would find themselves at odds, with the Blades being involved in damaging operations, such as breaching a prison and an incident at &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the Thalmor took out most of the Blades both prior to, and during, the Great War. The Blades had underestimated the Thalmor, leading to their destruction. Many Altmer disagreed with the Thalmor around this time, but only few dared to speak up about it.\nOn the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor sent an ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with an ultimatum for Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;. The terms of the ultimatum demanded disbandment of the Blades, outlawing of &lt;a href=\"Talos%20worship\"&gt;Talos worship&lt;/a&gt;, ceding large portions of Hammerfell to the Dominion, and several tributes of gold. Despite the warnings of his generals, Titus Mede refused the ultimatum. As such, the Thalmor opened a cart they had brought, revealing the heads of every Blades agent in the Summerset Isles and Valenwood. And so, the Great War started. \nUnder the command of Thalmor &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion advanced into both Hammerfell and Cyrodiil, quickly conquering most of Hammerfell's southern coastline, and taking territory in Cyrodiil. While the original goal of Lord Naarifin's army was to pin down the Legions in Cyrodiil while Hammerfell was overrun, the weakness of Cyrodiil's defenses made the Thalmor change their plans. The complete overthrowing of the Empire now became their goal. The Dominion would have the greatest extent of its territory in &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, when the Thalmor sent all available forces to Cyrodiil in order to conquer the Imperial City. In Hammerfell, the Thalmor had conquered all of southern Hammerfell, excluding &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, and had also claimed &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt;, though they would be pushed out of Skaven later the same year. Within Cyrodiil, the Thalmor had claimed &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperial City. \nThrough the usage of the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Vaermina\"&gt;Orb of Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the Dremora &lt;a href=\"Reive\"&gt;Reive&lt;/a&gt; carrying &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, Naarifin was able to make great progress in achieving this goal, with the Orb being used to spy on the Imperial Legion. His success made Nord Legionnaires believe the Legion was doomed, resulting in them deserting the Legion. He attempted to fulfill the Culling prophecy, which would unleash hordes of Daedra, but ultimately failed when the Legion would retake the Imperial City. After the Battle of the Red Ring had ended, Lord Naarifin was kept alive for thirty-three days. Reports on what happened to the Thalmor General on the thirty-fourth day vary. It is unknown where he was buried, or if he was buried, with one report stating he was carried off by winged daedra.\nAfter the Battle of the Red Ring, the entire Imperial army was decimated, and to continue the war would have meant defeat for the Legion. With most of the Empire welcoming peace at any price, Titus Mede signed the peace treaty known as the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which was similar to the ultimatum the Emperor had refused years prior. Hammerfell refused the treaty, unwilling to give up so much of their territory, despite most of it already being conquered by the Dominion. As such, the Emperor was forced to renounce Hammerfell as an Imperial province. While the Great War within the Empire was over, it would continue for five more years in Hammerfell, and end when the Redguards managed to stop the Aldmeri advance and fight them to a standstill. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; was signed, and the Thalmor withdrew their forces from the province, leaving southern Hammerfell devastated. With the Great War officially over, Hammerfell and the Empire were in an uneasy situation, as Hammerfell felt betrayed by the Empire when the Concordat was signed, yet acknowledged that only their combined forces could truly defeat the Dominion. \nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath of the Great War, the Thalmor would attempt to further their political goals. &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the son of the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; had been captured by the Thalmor during the Great War, and had been allowed to escape after investigation, being assigned as an asset to &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;. After the war, the Thalmor established direct and cooperative contact with Ulfric, who would prove his worth as an asset to the Thalmor. During the Great War, the guardsmen of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; would be conscripted by the Legion to aid them in battle. With the Reach being greatly weakened, the natives, known as the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; took their chances and took over the land, creating the independent kingdom of the Reach. With the Legion still being in Cyrodiil, Jarl Hrolfdir turned to Ulfric and his militia, requesting their aid in reclaiming the Reach. Ulfric would grant this request, on the condition that open and free Talos worship would be permitted within the city. Hrolfdir agreed, and Ulfric reclaimed the Reach in his name.\nThe ban on Talos worship had not been enforced by the Empire within &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; up until this point, as nobody paid attention to the ban and everyone still had their shrines of Talos. As such, the reason Ulfric demanded free Talos worship was due to his collaboration with the Thalmor, who considered the Markarth Incident particularly valuable in regards of their aims towards Skyrim. After the city had been reclaimed, the Thalmor suddenly found out about the breaking of the Concordat, and demanded the arrest of Ulfric and his men. Because of this, Ulfric became uncooperative to direct contact with the Thalmor, and his status of asset to them turned dormant.\nAfter this incident, the Emperor was forced to crack down on Talos worship and permit the Thalmor entry into Imperial land to enforce the Concordat. Within Skyrim, the Thalmor would seek to advance their goals through various pursuits. &lt;a href=\"Ondolemar\"&gt;Ondolemar&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor commander of the Justiciars, was stationed in Markarth. The &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s were in charge of enforcing the ban on Talos worship. Thalmor patrols would take Talos worshippers as prisoners for interrogation, and conduct assassination attempts against those who attempted to hinder their work in Skyrim. The Thalmor would, in their effort to root out Talos worship, also locate shrines to Talos and eliminate those worshipping at them.\nOther activities within the province revolved around perpetuating the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim through indirect aid to the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, finding magical artifacts, and defending themselves from harassing Stormcloaks in skirmishes. On the isle of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor would also attempt to uncover the means to craft weapons and armor made from &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; by kidnapping the blacksmith of the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt;. Other missions included finding &lt;a href=\"Esbern\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;, the loremaster of the Blades regarding the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, as the Thalmor sought to discover why the Dragons returned. Another assignment was finding &lt;a href=\"Delphine\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;, a Blades agent who had dealt serious damage to the Dominion before the Great War broke out, avoided a purge, and personally defeated three assassination teams. At the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor advisor, &lt;a href=\"Ancano\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;, gathered intelligence on the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; and his endeavors. When the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; was found, Ancano attempted to take its power for himself, but was killed by a College Wizard in his attempts. The &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, which had become an enemy of the Thalmor years prior due to conflict with them, and their repudiation of Thalmor authority, eventually took the Eye of Magnus away.\nIn other parts of the Empire, the Thalmor hunted down Blades members, and continued to root out Talos worship."}

According to &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the Thalmor are \"&lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; supremacists\" who seek to end &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt; and eradicate the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; as it goes against their own beliefs. They claim sole responsibility for closing the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; in the Dominion (much like the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;). Although this is partly true,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was the one who ended\u00a0the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; by destroying the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and invoking the avatar of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhilosophy and traits.\nAs a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor seeks to unify the &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; through one-government leadership, with Elves holding all places of power. Deeply offended by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s victory in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Thalmor have sworn to root out Talos worship in the Empire. The signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which effectively ended the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;'s war with the Empire of Cyrodiil, gave the Thalmor legal authority to eradicate Talos worship; although many devout believers either openly revolted or tried to circumvent their ban by worshipping in secret. The Thalmor would use lethal force, and even torture, to eradicate all Talos worshippers.\nMembers of the Thalmor wear long &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Thalmor%20Robes\"&gt;hooded robes&lt;/a&gt; and are viewed unfavorably. They are adept &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;spell-casters&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nBackground.\nOrigins and early history.\nThalmor was the name of the provisional government set up by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Claiming the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; for themselves, they renamed them Alinor in the &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Thalmor sought to unify the land, even before, along with parts of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, to align it against seafaring threats that plagued the isles for centuries. The endeavor was thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;\"Brass God\"&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; origin. This sparked a deep-seated hatred for the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the man who apothesised into the deity, Talos.\nThe Oblivion Crisis and Fourth Era.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer organization that would become the Thalmor were little more than a loudmouthed fringe group mocked openly by Altmeri society. In the waning years of the Third Era, they led numerous boycotts of Imperial goods.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion gates&lt;/a&gt; began opening all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; were thrown into anarchy. Refugees were slaughtered by the thousands. Those who tried to flee by boat found the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; had conjured storms to prevent escape and were cut down on the wharves and docks. Many were forced into the raging sea and drowned.\nTowards the end of what would become forever known as, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;The Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;\", only the legendary &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; stood fast against the Daedric hordes. It was there they made their last stand, in the ensuing battle the Altmer Sorcerers and Archers killed so many &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; that they scaled the walls over mounds of their own dead. It was not enough however, and the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; fell, literally torn asunder by Daedric machines. In those final moments, the hordes of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; vanished completely.\nThough many disputed the Thalmor's miraculous claims, one by one they had their reputations ruined by Thalmor perpetuated rumors and were exiled. Those who continued, even in exile were often assassinated. One such famous example was the great seer-mage &lt;a href=\"Rynandor\"&gt;Rynandor&lt;/a&gt; the Bold. He had commanded the defense of the Crystal Tower, and was considered a great hero of the Oblivion Crisis.\n&lt;a href=\"Rynandor\"&gt;Rynandor&lt;/a&gt; was quickly assassinated aboard a ship bound for &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; thereafter.\nPotentate &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;'s murder began the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; fractured, leading into seven years of ruthless in-fighting, plots and backstabbing. With the Empire submerged in this mayhem, the Thalmor were quick to act. They overthrew the rightful Kings and Queens of the Altmer in a violent uprising.\nThen the first of many pogroms descended on Summerset Isle. They slaughtered any who were not \"of the blood of the Aldmer\" as well as many remaining dissidents. The Thalmor never wasted an opportunity.\nThe newly empowered Thalmor reacquired Valenwood during the Fourth Era through a coup d'\u00e9tat, and the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Former Confederacy of Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, shaken by political strife, became a protectorate of the new Aldmeri Dominion. The Thalmor's ambitions would not cease there however.\nThe Thalmor is also mentioned few times in as the most dangerous enemy to the Empire. &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for gathering intel about their moves. Reports claim that Thalmor agents continued to harass the refugee communities in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balfiera%20Island\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, there were a series of murders in the latter which could be pretty confidently assigned to them. The pattern was typical, the victims were all of mixed blood or had associations considered unclean by the Aldmeri Dominion. The situation in Valenwood was much worse, the Empire's supplies no longer reliably got to the rebels there. According to &lt;a href=\"Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt;, there must have been a leak somewhere, the Thalmor knew too much about the Empire's movements. Sixty rebels were caught and executed in a week, along with four Penitus Oculatus agents.\nThe Great War.\nThe Thalmor initiated the Great War against &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, seeing the frailty of the ruling class and the office of &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; had struggled for decades to place rulers on the throne. The war was vast and bloody.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legionnaire&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was imprisoned. After an interrogation by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;First Emissary Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0during the Aldmeri campaign of the Imperial City,\u00a0Ulfric was eventually released, in the hope he might stir up unrest in the region thus destabilizing the Empire further.\u00a0Four years of rampant bloodshed forced Mede II to sign the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which included the removal of Talos from the Pantheon of Gods; the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; reduced to Eight.\nHammerfell and the Markarth Incident.\nAt this time, the Thalmor unsuccessfully attempted to besiege Hammerfell, retreating after suffering extreme losses. With the Imperial Legions preoccupied by the continuing conflicts in Cyrodiil and Hammerfell, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat the usurper &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; natives (known as the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;) occupying &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; in what came to be known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;\". Ulfric asked only one promise as payment - agreement to permit the free worship of Talos in Markarth. After taking back Markarth, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt; initially kept his promise to Ulfric and allowed free worship of Talos, for a time. When the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; arrived to restore the rule of law, Ulfric allegedly refused them entry into the city until they also agreed that free worship of Talos would be allowed. The Empire capitulated to Ulfric's demand but the Thalmor discovered this violation of the White-Gold Concordat and gave them an ultimatum - enforce the terms of their peace treaty and forbid the worship of Talos, or declare war against the Dominion. The Empire and Hrolfdir forsook their agreement to Ulfric and, caving into pressure from the Aldmeri Dominion, the Empire arrested Ulfric Stormcloak and his followers to enforce the ban on Talos worship stipulated by the White-Gold Concordat. Meanwhile, the Bretons stewed in anger at this defeat, vowing to retake the The Reach and renaming themselves the \"&lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;\". After the Markarth incident, the Thalmor gained a foothold in Skyrim, as it sought to enforce the White-Gold Concordat.\nSkyrim Civil War.\nBy &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor had sent agents to personally demand Ulfric's arrest in Markarth. After Ulfric's arrest the Emperor was forced to crack down on Talos worship and allow the Thalmor to send in their Justiciars, which by some is seen as one of the main causes of the civil war. From their &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, they enforce the White-Gold Concordat and makes sure that the Empire doesn't break it again.\nSecretly, they have been using the conflict between the Empire and the rebel &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; as means to an end, remaining only indirectly involved while the war continues and interfering only in certain instances to keep the war ongoing, such as during Ulfric's capture and near execution. The Thalmor have also been hunting &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and any surviving members of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; who escaped eradication.\nRole in Skyrim.\nRooting out Talos worship.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may have met &lt;a href=\"Ondolemar\"&gt;Ondolemar&lt;/a&gt;, who will attempt to acquire the Dragonborn's assistance in exposing a worshipper of Talos.\nActive throughout Skyrim, the Dragonborn may have &lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;encountered&lt;/a&gt; them randomly in several ways. Initially, members of the Thalmor are non-hostile and will only attack when provoked or if the Dragonborn is wearing an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Talos%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Talos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThalmor patrols can be encountered along most of Skyrim's major roadways and usually consist of three &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Justiciars&lt;/a&gt; with two bodyguards and one &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Wizard\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;. A prisoner for interrogation may accompany the party to the Embassy. The prisoner can be freed by interacting with him and giving him &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. After attacking a patrol, the Thalmor send another group of Thalmor agents to kill the Dragonborn.\nCollege of Winterhold.\nAn advisor named &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; to oversee its studies. During his stay, Ancano attempts to absorb the power of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt; in the process. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, armed with the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, ended the endeavor.\nThe Blades and the Dragon Crisis.\nNarrowly escaping the Thalmor during the Great War, &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt;, the last acting &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; hid at the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. There, she located and stole the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to lure the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to her. With the Dragonborn's aid, she hoped to halt the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;resurrection of the Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Suspecting the Thalmor of causing the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, she &lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;sent the Dragonborn undercover&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Dragonborn learned that the Thalmor was not behind the return of the Dragons. Instead, the Dragonborn discovered that a Dragon Loremaster and Blade named &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; was alive, hiding somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn freed &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Rarnis\"&gt;Etienne Rarnis&lt;/a&gt;, returning to Delphine with the news. Traveling to Riften, the Dragonborn cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and located Esbern in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway%20Vaults\"&gt;The Ratway Vaults&lt;/a&gt; beneath the city. After convincing Esbern to bring him to Delphine, the two were attacked by Thalmor agents. Reunited, Esbern, Delphine, and the Dragonborn reclaimed the lost &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; and plotted the destruction of Alduin.\u00a0\n&lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not blatantly offering aid to either side, the Thalmor took a keen interest in the Civil War.\u00a0They were more interested in weakening the morale of Skyrim and keeping the Empire divided than supporting either cause. Despite this, the Thalmor do indirectly aid the Stormcloaks by using their influence to stir or enable unrest against the Imperial Legion and the Imperial Legion makes use of them to imprison Stormcloak sympathizers. The Thalmor have a tangible presence in cities in which the Empire has the most secure foothold.\nRelations with characters.\nDelphine.\nDelphine was a target of the Thalmor during the Great War with the Empire. She was involved with several damaging operations within the Dominion before the Great War took place. Attempts on her life were planned prior to the Great War, but she was recalled before these could take place. \nDuring the war itself, she evaded three attempts on her life, during one of these attempts she killed the assassination team sent to kill her. Since then the Thalmor have been unable to gain direct information regarding her whereabouts. She is considered very dangerous and no move against her is to be made without an overwhelming force.\nEsbern.\nEsbern is believed to be have been behind some of the most damaging operations of the Blades prior to the Great War. Including the Falinesti Incident and the breach of the Blue River Prison. Esbern is to be captured in order to inform the Thalmor about the Dragons returning.\nUlfric Stormcloak.\nUlfric Stormcloak first came to the Thalmor's attention during the Great War, when he got captured by the Dominion during their campaign for the White-Gold Tower. The Thalmor learned that he was the son of the Jarl of Windhelm and he was assigned to Elenwen. He was made to believe that the information he gave led to the fall of the Imperial City. Following this, he was allowed to escape. \nAfter the Great War, the Thalmor and Ulfric established direct and cooperative contact, following which he proved his worth as asset to the Thalmor. The so-called Markarth Incident resulted in the Thalmor being allowed into Skyrim to enforce the White-Gold Concordat, however, since it also imprisoned Ulfric he turned uncooperative.\nMain goal.\nThe Thalmor see the races of man as inferior to mer. In their eyes, they seek to pacify and purify all of Tamriel, to bring about a new &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; in which Mer rule over Man."}

They consist of both &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Wizard\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Soldier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, but all share the name Thalmor Justiciar. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Ondolemar\"&gt;Ondolemar&lt;/a&gt;.\nShould the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; converse with the Justiciar, they will have the option of saying whether or not they worship &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. If they say that they do, the Justiciar will immediately turn hostile. Should they remain neutral on the subject, the Thalmor will assume the Dragonborn is hiding the fact that they are cooperating with the worship of Talos and turn hostile. The only way to avoid combat is to cancel conversation if things are turning accusational. If the Dragonborn enters conversation with a Thalmor Justiciar twice, the second conversation will always end with the Justiciar deciding to attack the Dragonborn, regardless of the dialogue option chosen. \nBackground.\nAgents of the high elven &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; are known as Thalmor. After the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, they've been authorized by the Empire to maintain an &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;embassy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and have been known to secretly capture and imprison any &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who question their doctrines or beliefs. The Justiciars were sent to Skyrim to enforce the White-Gold Concordat and make sure that the Empire doesn't break it again.\nNot all Thalmor in Skyrim are equal in station, or purpose. In fact, there is one group in particular that operates secretly, in the shadows \u2014 watching and waiting for those Nords who break the law, and continue their worship of Talos. These are the Justiciars, and it is their job to enforce the Talos ban of the White-Gold Concordat. During the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor have a tangible presence in cities in which the Empire has the most secure foothold. Some claim these Thalmor have far too much influence over the Empire and Imperial loyal Jarls.\nSecretly, they have been instigating conflict between the Empire and the rebel &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, directly interfering only in certain instances to keep the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; going.\nEscorting prisoners.\nJusticiars may occasionally be escorting a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, presumably a Talos worshipper. The prisoner may be freed by starting a dialogue, which also allows for trading items. The Justiciars will immediately become hostile towards the Dragonborn, the prisoner, and any followers. Killing the Justiciars after they become hostile does not gain a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;. After the Justiciars are dead, the freed prisoner will make his way to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThalmor Justiciars can be sent to kill the Dragonborn. This will start to happen when the Dragonborn has completed the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\" They can also be sent if the Dragonborn has attacked &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Keep\"&gt;Northwatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; or if the Dragonborn has attacked Thalmor justiciars roaming Skyrim. They may also attack the Dragonborn after &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt; is killed during &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;The Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the completion of these quests, only the \"assassin\" squads sent specifically to hunt the Dragonborn will be hostile on sight; regular Thalmor squads will initially be neutral to the Dragonborn.\nBehavior.\nThalmor Justiciars often travel in small groups. During lower level they often can be seen wearing &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elven%20light%20armor\"&gt;Elven light armor&lt;/a&gt; and using &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel weapons&lt;/a&gt;, but at higher levels they equip &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;glass armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. The mages always wear &lt;a href=\"hooded%20Thalmor%20robes\"&gt;hooded Thalmor robes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf hostile, they will quickly attack the Dragonborn with their &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and often &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; spells. They can also use &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;turn undead&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures. The mages will then support the soldiers from behind with &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; and fire spells. They may prove difficult to defeat due to their numbers and surrounding of the Dragonborn during combat.\nDialogue.\nDialogue with a Thalmor Patrol.\n\"You're interfering with official Thalmor business.\"\nWho are you? \"I am a Thalmor Justiciar on important business that you are interfering with.\"\nDo all Thalmor have such high opinions of themselves? \"\"That we are superior to men is an established fact. For example, take this belief in Talos. The \"ninth\" divine. Heh. Certainly you don't believe such things? Or perhaps there is something you'd like to confess?\"\"\nWhat's wrong with worshipping Talos? \"It's immoral to worship a man. And it's also illegal. A faithful Imperial citizen would know that. Perhaps there's something you wish to confess?\"\nDialogue with a Thalmor Patrol escorting a Talos worshipper.\n\"You're interfering with official Thalmor business.\"\nWhat are you doing? \"Taking this man to be interrogated.\"\nWhere are you taking your prisoner? \"That is none of your concern.\""}

It was because of his leadership, House Dres was elevated to the status of Great House after a very successful slave revolt in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThalthil Dres was the Grandmaster of House Dres, an insignificant house in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Elves of House Dres were experts in the ways of agriculture, establishing saltrice fields as far as the eye can see. Not to mention being proficient in the slave trade. But Thalthil would give House Dres their big break with the &lt;a href=\"Raid%20of%20Thorn\"&gt;Raid of Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, which was an attack on the Black Marsh city-state of &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, located just south of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, where House Dres would normally operate. Thalthil advanced onto the city-state of Thorn and initiated a slave-raid, capturing various Argonians for their plantations. The raid on Thorn goes down in infamy as a violent and heart-breaking event in Tamriel, but regardless, House Dres would rise above the ranks and become established as a Great House.\nLegacy.\nThalthil Dres established the slave trade as it has appeared throughout the eras, eventually incorporating the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and other races that were unlucky to encounter the Dres. Eventually, the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; had begun to take in slaves as House Dres began to bring them onto Morrowind. However, the Raid of Thorn had created a growing vengeance from the people of Tamriel, especially the slaves. Various slave outbreaks occurred throughout the eras, such as the Raid on Tear and the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, when the Dark Elves were weak and the Argonians grew stronger, the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; had arrived onto Morrowind, besieging various cities including Tear and the House Telvanni cities. The Slave Trade had proved to be the downfall of Morrowind during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, with the Accession War. It is unknown whether the practice of slavery continued in Morrowind."}

The title is given to someone who has contributed to a hold significant deeds that have helped the Jarl of the hold and its people. Newly titled Thanes receive &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt;s, sworn bodyguards who protect the Thane, their &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spouses&lt;/a&gt;, and their property.\nInteractions.\n\"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\".\nThe title of Thane is an honor gifted by a city's Jarl to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. It is only granted if the Dragonborn completes &lt;a href=\"Becoming%20Thane\"&gt;tasks&lt;/a&gt; for people of the hold, and personally assists the Jarl in official or unofficial business, depending on the city. Rarely, if the Dragonborn has enough , the title of Thane may be given.\n&lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s will excuse the Dragonborn from &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crimes&lt;/a&gt; if they mention they are the Thane in a dialogue option when confronted, but this only works once. After being proclaimed Thane in a city, the Dragonborn can &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;purchase houses&lt;/a&gt; from the Jarls' &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s, alongside various improvements and furniture for said house. In a few rare cases, purchasing a home within a Hold is a prerequisite for becoming a Thane of said Hold, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Elder Scrolls Online\".\nDuring the Second Era, Thanes are prevalent throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, each having contributed deeds and acts of heroism for their Holds. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; meets and helps out most of the Thanes with dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Brigade\"&gt;Stormfist Brigade&lt;/a&gt; as part of the royal retinue of &lt;a href=\"King%20Jorunn\"&gt;King Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; going around &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;.
