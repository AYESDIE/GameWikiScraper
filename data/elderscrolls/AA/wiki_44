They originated from the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Wandering Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, just as the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt;s did.\nHistory.\nThe First Tsaesci Invasion.\nFor thousands of years, the Tsaesci lived, and presumably thrived, on Akavir, without disturbing or being disturbed by Tamriel. Late in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, around 2703, the Tsaesci invaded Tamriel, at a time when the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; Empire was still fairly small. This invasion is usually credited with forcing the &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n Empire to officially join the Cyrodilic Empire, under then-Emperor &lt;a href=\"King%20Reman%20I\"&gt;King Reman I&lt;/a&gt;. The invaders managed to fight their way through northern Tamriel, into the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. Reman eventually defeated the Tsaesci, trapping them at &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; and cutting off their supply lines until they died or fled back to Akavir.\nAfter their defeat, the Empire granted amnesty to many of the remaining Tsaesci men, including taking them on in key political and military roles. The Tsaesci presumably bred into the Imperial families, as Tsaesci surnames are now considered a thing of pride among Imperial nobility. There are rumored to be small clans of \"true\" Akaviri still on Tamriel, though the details are inconsistent. The military prowess of the Tsaesci was one of the key reasons the Empire was able to expand as successfully as it did.\nA Serpent King.\nAt the end of the First Era, in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, a Tsaesci Potentate named &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; was advisor to Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt; as part of the emperor's attempt to conquer &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. A theory states that the Potentate was secretly plotting to eliminate the royal family (another possible source of their depiction as \"snake-men\"), and eventually succeeded. The heirs of Reman III were all killed, in battle or by hired assassins, and eventually Reman himself died without a successor. The Potentate assumed command of the Empire, and ruled for over 300 years before being assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. His son then ruled for another 100 years, before he was also assassinated and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; put an Imperial back on the throne. At that point, the Tsaesci and Akavir in general disappeared from historical record, until the time of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt; and his Akaviri invasion.\nFounder of the Fighters Guild.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;2E 320&lt;/a&gt;, a Tsaesci warrior, &lt;a href=\"Dinieras-Ves\"&gt;Dinieras-Ves&lt;/a&gt; \"the Iron\" presented to &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, amidst the chaos of constant revolts and financial bankruptcy within the empire a solution to the plaguing issues. He suggested an order of mercantile warriors, named the Syffim, hired by the aristocracy which would serve in place of a standing army, as well as a percentage of the profits being invested back into the imperial treasury, effectively solving two of Versidue-Shaie's biggest issues. Following the &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20Act\"&gt;Guilds Act&lt;/a&gt;, the Syffim was renamed to the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, an already popular name for the organisation and legitimised as an order. Versidue-Shaie's successor, &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; reformed the empire's army, breaking the reliance on the Fighters Guild for military capacities. Following the reforms, the Fighters Guild was reduced to more mercenary based work and Dinieras-Ves disappeared into obscurity.\nUriel and the Tsaesci.\nAround &lt;a href=\"3E%20290\"&gt;3E 290&lt;/a&gt;, near the end of his reign, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; launched an invasion of Akavir.Uriel had mostly succeeded in stabilizing his empire on Tamriel, including retaking lands recently lost to revolt, and was anxious to focus the might of the Empire outside of itself. Relying primarily on information retained from the First Era &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;s, and extensive reconnaissance of the areas between Akavir and Tamriel, the Emperor launched a military initiative to conquer the small island kingdoms in the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, to the east of Morrowind, most notably, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harbor\"&gt;Black Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, which served as a base for the Imperial navy. When he finally reached Akavir itself (far to the east of Tamriel), he landed in the kingdom of Tsaesci, on the southeastern Akaviri coast.\nAccording to the official record of the invasion, it was initially successful, but primarily due to a lack of Tsaesci resistance. Once the Tsaesci armies decided to put up a fight, the Imperial armies were routed in short order, with nearly the entire invasion force lost. Only a fraction of one naval fleet managed to return across the ocean to safety back home. The Emperor himself was killed before he was able to flee Akavir, and to date there have not been any subsequent attempts to invade the continent. In addition to the obvious military prowess of the Tsaesci, there are persistent rumors that the Tsaesci mages possess very potent abilities, including changing the weather patterns off the Akaviri coast, and large-scale disruption of magical communication lines.\nAnatomy.\nThe continent of Akavir, in general, is the least understood of all of Nirn's continents. Only three times in recorded history have inhabitants from the two continents mingled, all three being military invasions, two of which involved the Tsaesci. Thus, the Tsaesci are the only race on Akavir that the majority of Tamriel has even heard of. What little we do know about Akavir's other races mostly derives from accounts related to the Tsaesci &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;s during the late First and early Second Eras.\nEven though the Tsaesci are the best known of Akavir's inhabitants, very little is known about them, and much of it is contradictory or cryptic. Within the current lore of Tamriel, there are two quite different depictions of the Tsaesci. Some evidence seems to indicate that they are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, much like the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; from their respective continents. Other evidence, however, paints a much stranger picture, as &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; snake-like creatures that feed on humans. One source says that the serpentine beings are tall and beautiful with golden scales.\nSerpentine folk.\nEarly depictions of the Tsaesci almost invariably describe them as having the upper body of a man but the lower body of a snake. The most direct evidence of these \"snake folk\" comes from \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Akavir\"&gt;Mysterious Akavir&lt;/a&gt;\", which claims that the vampire snakes of Tsaesci ate all of the humans that once lived on Akavir. The reputability of this book is frequently questioned, however, as few of its other claims have been independently verified. A much more reliable source is the series of &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20The%20Last%20Year%20of%20the%20First%20Era\"&gt;2920&lt;/a&gt; books that describe the events that ushered in the Second Era. One of the key elements of this series is the plot by the Tsaesci Potentate, a close adviser to Emperor Reman III, to have the king and his heirs assassinated, and assume the throne in his place. Though the books are written in a narrative, as opposed to a historical style, they are extensive, detailed, and the author is considered to be quite credible. These books explicitly describe the Tsaesci Potentate, and his son, in serpentine terms (as \"eels\", moving by \"slithering\", etc.) An obscure text known as \"And We Ate It To Become It\" purporting to be the Tsaesci's version of the creation myth, is strongly steeped in snake-like and reptile-like symbolism and phraseology.\nIn , a reward for a quest in &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; to bless the bones of those who died in the Second Akaviri Invasion has the following description: \"These gauntlets were designed to choke the scaled throats of the Akaviri invaders.\" More evidence of this serpentine physiology comes from veterans of the Second Akaviri Invasion: Fedrasa Andrethi, who has become terrified of any reptile she sees since the war, especially lizards, and &lt;a href=\"Denskar%20Earth-Turner\"&gt;Denskar Earth-Turner&lt;/a&gt;, who refers to the Akaviri as \"the Snakes.\" It is also supported by &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Brela\"&gt;Priestess Brela&lt;/a&gt;, who states the Akaviri were \"Snake men.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther written accounts of the Tsaesci seem to contradict the popular legend, however. A religious text on the Imperial creation myth, &lt;a href=\"The%20Annotated%20Anuad\"&gt;The Annotated Anuad&lt;/a&gt;, lists the Tsaesci alongside the Nords of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and the Redguards of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; as one of the races of men. A detailed report of Uriel V's invasion of Akavir, which first attempted to conquer Tsaesci, describes them as mounted men, and makes no mention of snake-like qualities.\nIn addition, the Tsaesci had a very strong influence on Imperial culture dating from the early Second Era, including being the genesis for the Fighter's Guild and Imperial Blades. Despite this, there are no pictorial depictions, or any other physical evidence, that would indicate that the Tsaesci were anything other than human. The question has been further complicated by a recent re-discovery of a Tsaesci fortress, deep in the Pale Pass on the Cyrodiil - Skyrim border. The remains of the Tsaesci found inside, including the apparition of a Tsaesci officer, all appeared entirely human. The Tsaesci also interbred heavily with the aristocracy of the time. Modern-day nobles consider it a high honor to possess a Tsaesci surname and facial features.\nDuring one of the invasions, the Akaviri built &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; as explained by Esbern during the events of Skyrim. And inside the Temple lies Alduin's wall, built during their occupation of Skyrim. In the third panel, the Akaviri are kneeling before the Dragonborn and are depicted as humanoid figures which may mean they are human.\nAkaviri, even when entirely human, are sometimes referred to as serpents, as shown with a crypt containing only Akaviri-descendent men still being named &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Serpents\"&gt;Tomb of the Serpents&lt;/a&gt; by the Khajiit.\nTheories.\nThere are a variety of theories that attempt to explain this contradiction. The most clear-cut are simply that one or the other of these conflicting images of the Tsaesci are simply wrong. Many scholars have attempted to reconcile the contradiction in a more practical manner. Some of the better-known theories are:\nCulture.\nRegardless of which of the views of the Tsaesci people are correct, there is a good bit of information available on their culture, dating from the time of their first invasion. They were known as powerful warriors, especially when mounted, and are very disciplined soldiers. Their battle prowess made them ideal as guardsmen, and by the Third Era, the descendants of Akaviri men were training nearly the entire Imperial Army, Imperial Guard, and made up the bulk of the Fighter's Guild and the Emperor's personal guard. The Emperors of Cyrodiil also traditionally kept a Tsaesci advisor, or Potentate, on hand.\nThe Tsaesci fought with &lt;a href=\"Dai-Katana\"&gt;daikatana blades&lt;/a&gt;, and wore &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragonscale armor&lt;/a&gt;, their army gear became the source of most of the traditional raiment and banners of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;. They also apparently had tamed, and perhaps even rode, the Akaviri dragons in battle. The red dragon was eventually adopted as the main symbol of the Imperial Septim Dynasty. Of particular note, Reman I was the Emperor who instituted the tradition of lighting the &lt;a href=\"dragonfires\"&gt;dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and was ruling Cyrodiil at the time of the Tsaesci invasion.\nIn addition to being powerful individual warriors, the Tsaesci are very potent as a unified military force. A relatively small invasion force managed to fight its way through all of Skyrim, and into the northern Jerall Mountains, before ultimately being stopped only by the combined armies of Cyrodiil, Colovia, and their allies. When Uriel V invaded Akavir, with as large an army as he dared pull out of Cyrodiil, he was soundly defeated by a Tsaesci army that, by all reports, was barely even seen before they struck. The military prowess of the Tsaesci so impressed Reman I that he granted amnesty to any Tsaesci left on Tamriel after their failed invasion and promoted a Tsaesci adviser to the high political office of Potentate.\nThey seem to make buildings of stone as evidenced by Cloud Ruler and Sky Haven Temple. They have blood seals that can only be triggered by a specific kind. The Tsaesci appear heavily based on both Imperial China and feudal Japan. The Chinese influence in the Tsaesci culture can be seen from their architectural style as well as their status as the most powerful kingdom in Akavir, which reflects pre-modern China's traditional status as the most powerful kingdom in East Asia. The Japanese influence can be seen from their weapons, the katanas, and dai-katana, which are traditional Japanese weapons, as well as their armor designs. They use hieroglyphic-like murals for story telling. In a book called \"&lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20the%20Dragonguard\"&gt;Annals of the Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;\", a map with their written language can be seen.\nLifespan.\nNot much is known regarding the Tsaesci's lifespan, but a member of the race, &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, was known to have been alive from at least 2E 1\u20132E 324 until his assassination. This lifespan is irregularly long for the Tsaesci and was said to be prolonged by magic, although exactly how long the regular Tsaesci lifespan is remains unknown. According to some sources, the Tsaesci are in fact immortal."}

Before the creation of the world, Tu'whacca was the god of Nobody Really Cares. It was when Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout that Tu'whacca found purpose in becoming caretaker of the Far Shores, helping &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; to the afterlife. Many souls have enemies that wull try to keep them from reaching the Far Shores, but Tu'whacca always outwits these enemies and delivers the souls of Redguards to the far shores. Tu'whacca's cult is associated with &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; in the regions of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; where the population includes more people from outside of the province. \nTu'whacca has been worshipped by the Redguards since before the sinking of Yokuda. He was still worshipped by &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, and was worshipped by them in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe has a temple in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca%27s%20Throne\"&gt;Tu'whacca's Throne&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that the view from this temple over the desert is incredible. It functions both as a holy place and as a burial ground. The victims of the sinking of Yokuda are enshrined here, and pilgrims often come to visit the graves of the Redguard kings that were buried in this necropolis. In 2E 582, following the theft of the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Wards\"&gt;Ansei Wards&lt;/a&gt;, the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Uwafa\"&gt;Uwafa&lt;/a&gt; raised the honoured dead here and defiled the temple, but after &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;a member&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt; lit all the braziers around the temple, Tu'whacca's breath returned all the dead to rest."}

(For a particularly uninspired summary of the obvious, see \"Psychopomps of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\", by that old bloviator &lt;a href=\"Phrastus\"&gt;Phrastus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;.) Nearly every culture on the continent worships these deities in one form of another -- indeed, the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; revere them both! I wish, in this brief disquisition, to pose several questions about the origins of these gods, and then speculate upon the answers to those questions.\nWe begin with Xarxes, as his worship, at least as recorded in written history, predates that of both Arkay and Tu'whacca. An &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; deity who records the life-stories of all the races of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i, Xarxes appears in multiple creation or origin stories, many of which are inconsistant with each other. While some of these origins may be \"false\", their multiplicity may also be a reflection of Xarxes' many-fold nature.\nIn the two most common origin myths, Xarxes appears either as &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;'s scribe, recording events at his side since the beginning of time, or as a &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic&lt;/a&gt; Aldmeri priest of Auri-El who was elevated to divinity by the higher deity. The latter story is consistent with the High Elves' conceit that they are directly descended from the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, and can, in certain miraculous circumstances, &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;apotheosize&lt;/a&gt; and re-ascend to godly status.\nFor the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, Xarxes records not just the life stories of individual Elves, but all the connections and lineage and heritance that bind them together and link them to their ancestors. As nothing is more important to an Altmer than his or her ancestry, it is easy to understand Xarxes' paramount role in defining and maintaining status and stability in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; society.\nArkay, of course, is one of the Eight Divines that were presented to the newly-freed citizens of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt; at the founding of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Though official dogma of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Church of the Eight&lt;/a&gt; holds that Alessia was merely revealing to her subjects gods who had been watching over them all along, scholarly research of documentary fragments that survive from early in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; hint at a different story. &lt;a href=\"Khosey\"&gt;Khosey&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Tamrilean%20Tractates\"&gt;Tamrilean Tractates&lt;/a&gt;\", are well known, but I had the privelege of styding Sandralath's \"&lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; Oblations\" and the anonymous \"Death-Song for King Darodiil\" in their original manuscripts. Comparisons of the latter two against each other illuminated several previously obscure passages in both, and the resulting clarification was the impetus for this paper.\nTo come to the point, I believe I may well finally have enough evidence to confirm Sedulus' speculative \"&lt;a href=\"Orkey%23Orkey%20an%20Arkay\"&gt;Theory of Arkayn Convergence&lt;/a&gt;.\" Most of my readers will doubtless be familiar with Sedulus' proposal that the Arkay of the Eight Divines is, in origin, a fusion of aspects of the Elven deity Xarxes with those of the primal &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; death-god &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt; My new translation of the Death-Song and its (formerly ill-understood) \"plea for soul-guidance\" passages make it clear that the psychopomp being addressed possesses attributes of both the Elven and Atmoran deities. And, once the proper vowel-shift is applies, what is the name of this god?\n\"To-Arcka.\"\nWhich brings us, inevitably, to the Yokudan deity Tu'whacca. How long he was worshipped in that name by the &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; tribes of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; is now unknowable, as all our race's records were lost in the cataclysm that sank the archipelago. But as even old Phrastus had the wits to note, it cannot be a coincidence that Tu'whacca performs the same functions for the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; that Arkay and Xarxes do to Tamrielic Men and Mer. Are these gods really separate and distinct deities, or are they all aspects of the same deity, worshipped under different names in different cultures?\nYou must seek the answer elsewhere, for that is where scholarship ends and theology begins."}

He says he has escaped his cruel masters at the &lt;a href=\"Dren%20Plantation%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dren Plantation&lt;/a&gt; and is looking for a \"kindly &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;\" who helps escaped slaves such as himself.\nBackground.\nTul claims that he was a slave on the Dren Plantation, but escaped and is now hiding on a field belonging to the Ules Plantation. He asks the Nerevarine in extraordinarily courteous tones for help. He claims that his old masters were extremely cruel, especially &lt;a href=\"Orvas%20Dren\"&gt;Orvas Dren&lt;/a&gt; and the brothers Ienith. He believes that a Redguard can be nearby who will be able to help him in his situation, and asks the Nerevarine to help him find this man. The Nerevarine is suspicious from the start, however, as Tul looks healthy and rather not like a recently escaped slave.\nDetailed walkthrough.\nAfter the quest was accepted, Tul will follow the Nerevarine unless told otherwise. The Redguard in question is Sterdecan who can be found on his &lt;a href=\"Sterdecan%27s%20Farmhouse\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving there, Tul reveals himself as a &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; member tasked with the murder of Sterdecan. He gives the Nerevarine the choice to leave and forget about what they've seen, or die by his hand. The Nerevarine can either accept to walk away, or defend Sterdecan. If they walk away, there will be no reward. If they side with Sterdecan and kill Tul, Sterdecan will reward them with the &lt;a href=\"First%20Barrier%20Ring\"&gt;First Barrier Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Sterdecan will also reveal that bounty hunters are not an uncommon occurrence on his farm."}

The Dragonborn is to prepare a special meal for the Emperor using a secret ingredient: &lt;a href=\"jarrin%20root\"&gt;jarrin root&lt;/a&gt;, which is a deadly poison.\nImpersonating the chef.\nNote: to avoid unwanted complications, it may be best to leave any follower behind before heading to &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it will be difficult to find them later.\nThe main quest begins at Castle Dour, where Commander Maro can be found. He will be waiting by the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Emperor's Tower&lt;/a&gt; entrance, with two of his &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Agent%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus Agents&lt;/a&gt; standing guard to either side of the entrance after a short conversation regarding the two Imperial Legionnaires standing watch by the door to where &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; can be found. Once he is shown the Gourmet's Writ of Passage, he says that the Dragonborn must speak to the castle chef, Gianna, and the door behind him can then be entered.\nOnce inside, the Dragonborn should find Gianna. She will accept the Dragonborn's claim to being the Gourmet, but will not allow them to cook without a chef's hat, which can be found on a shelf nearby (to the left when facing Gianna). She has already prepared the broth, and will ask what ingredients to add. The ingredients suggested do not matter. Eventually, there will be an option to give her the Jarrin Root to be added to the stew. Whether added or not, Gianna will finish the dish and carry it up to the Emperor.\nThe Emperor's last meal.\nIf the root was added, the Emperor will drop dead shortly after tasting the meal. The Penitus Oculatus Agents standing guard will immediately suspect the cooks of poisoning him, and will become hostile. With a high enough &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill, hiding as the Emperor is eating the meal can prevent detection by the guards. There is no need to watch the event as it happens, so the Dragonborn can go into the next room and start sneaking there. Once the Emperor is dead, escape through the back door as instructed.\nIf the root was not added, the Emperor will suffer no ill effects. The Dragonborn must then kill the Emperor to complete the quest. It is much more difficult to remain undetected using this method, as the Emperor is in a very crowded room, with few safe vantage points for ranged attacks and even fewer for melee. Alternatively, since the Emperor is completely unarmed and unprotected, he is extremely easy to kill. This will turn the guards hostile, but will not in itself add a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nWith the Poisoned perk in the &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; tree, an easy way to kill the Emperor without being detected is to give him a frenzy poison. This will cause the guards to attack the Emperor, during which time the Dragonborn can hide in the next room. It may take two to three frenzy poisons to do this, however, as the Emperor will attempt to flee the room once given the poison.\nBetrayal.\nWhile crossing the bridge, the Dragonborn will be stopped by three &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; agents, along with Maro. He will explain that the man who was just assassinated was a decoy. He goes on to explain that someone within the Dark Brotherhood made a deal to let him capture the Dragonborn, and in return, he would retract all aggression against the Dark Brotherhood. However, he intends to break the deal, which means killing the Dragonborn and assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, out of revenge for the murder of &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegardless of how the decoy Emperor was killed or whether the Dragonborn was detected, a 1500 (or 750 if the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; has influence in Solitude) bounty for &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; Hold will be placed on the Dragonborn once Maro finishes his speech, and the soldiers will attack. Either way, the quest continues back at the Sanctuary. It may be easier to escape Solitude by continuing down the spiral staircase past the first landing, since it leads directly outside of Solitude, to a footpath just east of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. Fast travel, however, may be impossible while near Solitude with such a high bounty. Also, fast travel directly to the Sanctuary is not possible because the map location is inactive with only a quest marker in its stead, so it is necessary to travel somewhere close and walk/run there. Also, if the Dragonborn has a follower who was left behind somewhere in Solitude (so as to avoid questions while impersonating the Gourmet), they should be retrieved before leaving Solitude for good.\nIf this quest was used as a means to attain the \"&lt;a href=\"Master%20Criminal\"&gt;Master Criminal&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"Wanted\" &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; after earning a bounty in the other holds, it might be best to pay the bounties off so travel through the holds is unrestricted and the Dragonborn is not confronted by &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s should they be spoken to while a bounty is still active.\nSanctuary Under Siege.\nBy the time the Dragonborn arrives back in Falkreath Hold, the Sanctuary is already under attack by Maro's men. This quest will then be completed, and the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20Incarnate\"&gt;Death Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;,\" will begin.\nTrivia.\nPenitus Oculatus Agent 1 \"The city is crawling with &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and you know what? I'm still nervous.\"\"\nPenitus Oculatus Agent 2 \"Lazy and useless, the lot of them. They can't even keep the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in line. No way I trust them with the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s life.\"\"\nPenitus Oculatus Agent 1 \"You worry too much. The Emperor's never been safer. You think assassination attempts are planned overnight? We discovered the plot. End of story.\"\"\nPenitus Oculatus Agent 2 \"I suppose. But what about the &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;old man&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;Son&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Breaching%20Security\"&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt;, family name ruined...and he acts as if nothing even happened. Think's he's even fit for duty?\"\"\nPenitus Oculatus Agent 1 \"I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that. Commander Maro is the best that the Penitus Oculatus ever produced. You should be half the man he is.\"\"\nPenitus Oculatus Agent 2 \"You misunderstand. Its just...I feel for him, is all. To carry a weight like that. It's got to take its toll.

He's bringing in a good bit of coin, a little of which I've sent to you as usual. Things are going well, and at this rate, we'll have the manor restored to its former glory by winter. I know you're tired of hearing about it, but I implore you to reconsider my offer. We have plenty of room here, and both of you are always welcome to join us. I know it's tough out there, but sufffering in that horrible place just to prove a point isn't necessary anymore. Just a little sisterly advice."}

Yet its countenance remained stuck in that playful stare, halfway between laughter and mockery. She would have to respond in his place.\nUfkul Gilgar had spent the last 10 years contemplating the same question before settling on her answer. Throughout much of that time, her life had mirrored Hasedoki's, traveling the world in search of one who could challenge her.

So long as it passed, contentment would morph into boredom, and love would fall into loneliness.\nAs a necromancer, she had the tools to defy death. She had no similar solution for life.\nPerhaps the mortals had already divined an answer. For them it was magic, but children who allowed them to delay time's inexorable march. Now that she was a mother, the loneliness no longer consumed her even though that too was temporary. And just as the staff was passed on to her by her father, when the time came, she would do the same for her son. It may have been why Hasedoki bound his soul to the staff, so that his spirit would be with whoever wielded it.\nUkful placed the staff in the child's hands and watched as he scuttled through the tomb, swinging it around like a blunt instrument. It's possible the boy would be free of the same curse, the boredom that plagued his ancestors and Hasedoki before them. Morrowind was home to a great many wizards. Somewhere in that group was a worthy challenger.\nAnd if not, there would still be time for the next child."}

It appears to involve a rescue, but she wants to give me the details in person.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Name%20of%20the%20King\"&gt;In the Name of the King&lt;/a&gt;\" and leaving the cornerclub, Eveli Sharp-Arrow will approach you, telling you that High Priestess Solgra has a secret mission for you. \nYou can find Solgra in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Temple of Ire&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that a group of fanatical Trinimac worshippers have kidnapped one of the chiefs and are holding him at &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Stronghold\"&gt;Fharun Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. You are to meet up with Eveli there to help free the chief. Fharun Stronghold is in the far north of Wrothgar, northeast of the Frozen Fleet. Ideally, you should try to remain undetected there as long as possible, so that the enemies don't suspect any danger. At the stronghold, you will find a Wood Elf Arrow; this is probably a hint from Eveli. Up the path to the north, you will find another arrow; once you approach it, Eveli will appear. \nEveli has overheard that there is a large prison here in the stronghold, but she has not yet found it. She did notice a Vosh Rakh storm off towards the overlook, upset with the cult. That can be a good source of information, or you can eavesdrop on other Vosh Rakh members or search their buildings. The Vosh Rakh at the overlook is a man named &lt;a href=\"Quan\"&gt;Quan&lt;/a&gt;; you can either hear him out or push him off the platform. If you hear him out, he will tell you that the prison is below the ground, and that you can get there through the well. If you instead choose to gather information by eavesdropping or reading notes, . \nReturn to Eveli with this information; she can be found in the east of the stronghold, behind the feast house. She will suggest finding a rope to climb down into the well, and will direct you to the forge. Sure enough, you will find rope there; take it back to Eveli and she will lead you to the well. She will secure the rope so you can climb in. Once inside, head north through the passageway and continue north through the caves, fighting escaped murderers along the way. Once you reach the actual prison, take the path east, then north again. To your right, you will find the cell where they are holding none other than &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bazrag\"&gt;Chief Bazrag&lt;/a&gt;. \nBazrag will tell you he was captured and imprisoned here the moment he returned from Orsinium, and that he had nothing to do with the attack on the Temple. He is too weakened to climb up the well, so you will have to fight your way through the main entrance. Proceed through the dungeon to the Chamber of Scorn, where the most dangerous prisoners are kept. To progress through to the next room, Bazrag needs to turn the levers here in the correct order, but doing so will cause the prisoners to be released and parts of the room to fill with poison gas. You will first be facing a pair of ogres, then a pair of trolls, then a prisoner named &lt;a href=\"Ordun%20Clan-Slayer\"&gt;Ordun Clan-Slayer&lt;/a&gt; and finally another prisoner named &lt;a href=\"Viras%20the%20Red\"&gt;Viras the Red&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you stay out of the gas while fighting these foes.\nOnce all these enemies are dead, proceed on to the next room, the spike room. Here, you will notice spikes coming out of the floor, but they won't all come out every time. Bazrag will tell you there is a pattern to the spikes, and that you must turn all the valves in the room to shut them off. However, the valves must all be turned within a certain time limit, otherwise they will reset. You can analyze the spike patterns from the platform, but if you have a high enough HP you can also choose to just take the spike damage and rush through to the valves. This is the last puzzle room; hereafter, you can just fight your way out. \nOnce you are out of the dungeons, speak with Bazrag. He will threaten to kill you, and will demand to know why Solgra would send you. He would rather die than get taken to Kurog. He will tell you that if you want the truth, you should speak to someone named Ulsha; as you are talking, Eveli will appear behind him and force him to lower his weapon. Talk to Eveli; she will suggest taking Bazrag to Solgra since he refuses to be taken to Kurog. \nAs Eveli is doing this, you should go speak to Ulsha south of Fharun stronghold, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Zthenganaz\"&gt;Zthenganaz&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that it was her who asked Solgra for aid, and will confirm that Bazrag was taken captive the moment he got back here and cannot possibly have been behind the attack on the temple. This will finish the quest."}

Fyr plans to take a \"unique expedition,\" and requires a heroic companion.\"\nIf accepted from the collections interface:\n\"The famed wizard, Divayth Fyr, has put out a call for aid in seeking a powerful Daedric artifact. I can find him in Mournhold.\"\nWalkthrough.\nFirst, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; should talk to &lt;a href=\"Eldrasea%20Deras\"&gt;Eldrasea Deras&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"My Master waits for you in Mournhold Tribunal Temple. A word of advice: don't keep him waiting for long.\"\nAfter obtaining the quest, seek out Divayth Fyr at the Tribunal Temple in Mournhold. Upon approach, he will say \"Ah, you've arrived at last. Come forward, we have much to discuss.\" Divayth will explain that he is looking for a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; artifact within the Clockwork City, and he wants the Vestige to help him find it. His statements will vary depending on if the Vestige has already gone to Clockwork City and completed the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Fabrication\"&gt;Halls of Fabrication&lt;/a&gt;.\" He will request that you talk to him again at the waterfall to the north of Mournhold.\n\"You've arrived. I am Divayth Fyr, wizard-lord of Tel Fyr. I trust no further introduction is necessary? I see a Daedric artifact. It lies hidden in a brass city filled with danger, curiosity, and contradiction. You will accompany me, if you wish.\"\nOnce you find Divayth Fyr, talk to him again.\n\"My companion arrives at last. Now then, our journey beings in this dreary little cave. Quite a surprise, yes? Believe me, it won't be the last. We can speak freely here, but do make it brief. All this natural splendor is just ... tedious.\"\nAfter the dialogue, he will enter the Mysterious Cavern, where the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt; are. Inside the cavern, he will say the following lines:\n\"Hmm. Even draftier than I remembered. Follow me.\"\n\"Welcome to the Dwarven hold of Bamz-Amschend ... such as it is. Ironic that Ayem's holy city of Mournhold has Dwemeric roots, don't you think?\"\n\"Curious. Practically no one knows this route, but this scaffolding looks new. Built by rogue ordinators, perhaps? Stay watchful.\"\n\"Sotha Sil always did admire Dwarven industry, albeit quietly. Perhaps that's why he built his city here.\"\n\"This lift will take us to the nethermost depths of the ruin, and to our destination. Come along.\"\n\"Do you see it, just across the ravine? That's our door.\"\n\"Sotha Sil's factotums still remember me. How touching.\"\n\"I'd say prepare yourself, but nothing can prepare you for what's to com. Touch the sphere. The Clockwork City awaits.\"\nHe will then go to &lt;a href=\"Seht%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Seht's Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Interacting with the globe will lead the Vestige to the Clockwork City.\nOnce entering, it is discovered that the Vestige and Divayth Fyr do not go directly to Brass Fortress, but are instead intercepted. In the confusion, &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%27s%20Shadow\"&gt;Divayth Fyr's Shadow&lt;/a&gt; splits away from himself. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Factotum&lt;/a&gt; will attack. Once defeating them, chase Divayth's Shadow.\n\"What in the ... This is not the Brass Fortress.\"\n\"My shadow! My power! Don't let it escape! Factotums. They're activating!\"\n\"Fetching scrapheaps ... My shadow remains close. We must hurry!\"\n\"Perhaps I failed to impress the gravity of our situation upon you. If my shadow gets away, we may never escape this place. So if you have something to say, say it quickly.\"\nEventually the Vestige will come upon traps, which must be deactivated to continue.\n\"Well done. Killed by spinning knives is not an epitaph worthy of Divayth Fyr.\"\nAfter disabling the traps, continue chasing Divayth Fyr's Shadow until it confronts the Vestige, forcing the Vestige to defeat it before continuing. This will allow Divayth Fyr to regain his power, which he uses to defeat the remaining Factotum, and escape the &lt;a href=\"Pneumatic%20Forge\"&gt;Pneumatic Forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDivayth will say the following things accordingly when he recognizes the place, when they reach Divayth's Shadow and defeat it, when the shadow re-enters him and when more factotums appear:\n\"I recognize this place now. The Pneumatic Forge. We should leave as soon as possible.\"\n\"At last! Defeat this monstrosity, but don't kill it. I must reclaim my power.\"\n\"Maliad, khebeit tehir! Devahrokad sint molad!\"\n\"Finally. You never know how much you miss a thing until it tries to kill you.\"\n\"More rediclous machines? I've had enough of this!\"\nFrom there, accompany Divayth Fyr to the gates of the Brass Fortress, and lead him inside.\n\"Follow this road to the Brass Fortress. When you see the wayshrine, veer north ... or what passes for north here. If you have other business to attend to, I'll not stop you. Just meet me at the gates to the fortress when you're ready to proceed.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Proctor%20Luciana%20Pullo\"&gt;Proctor Luciana Pullo&lt;/a&gt;, however, tries to stop Divayth Fyr from entering the city. Conversing with Luciana Pullo will reveal that she is the leader of the Clockwork Apostles, and that every newcomer into the city must be sponsored. Going back to Divayth Fyr and talking one final time will complete the quest.\nProctor Luciana Pullo: \"Divayth Fyr! I warned you never to come back!\"\nDivayth Fyr: \"Luciana Pullo. Hospitable as ever. Go talk to her. I'll not waste my time speaking with a petulant toy soldier.\"\nDialogue with Luciana:\n\"Hold there, friend of Fyr. I am Proctor Luciana Pullo, of the Clockwork Apostles. I don't know how you and this egomaniac breached Lord Seht's celestiodorome, but I won't have non-citizens stirring up mischief in the Brass Fortress.\"\nFinal dialogue with Divayth Fyr:\n\"Luciana clearly hasn't lost her charming demeanor. Predictable.\""}

Trechtus' father and mother were common laborers, but his father had secretly, against the law of Lord Gyrnasse, taught himself and then Trechtus to read. Lord Gyrnasse had been advised that literate serfs were an abomination of nature and dangerous to themselves and their lords, and had closed all bookstalls within Sollicich-on-Ker. All booksellers, poets, and teachers were forbidden, except within Gyrnasse's keep. Nevertheless, a small scale smuggling operation kept a number of books and scrolls in circulation right under Gyrnasse's shadow.\nWhen Trechtus was eight, the smugglers were found and imprisoned. Some said that Trechtus's mother, an ignorant and religious woman fearful of her husband, was the betrayer of the smugglers, but there were other rumors as well. The trial of the smugglers was nonexistant, and the punishment swift. The body of Trechtus' father was kept hanging for weeks during the hottest summer Sollicich-on-Ker had seen in centuries.&lt;br&gt;\nThree months later, Trechtus ran away from Lord Gyrnasse's estate. He made it as far as Alinor, half-way across Summerset Isle. A band of troubadours found him nearly dead, curled up in a ditch by the side of the road. They nursed him to health and employed him as an errand boy in return for food and shelter. One of the troubadours, a soothsayer named Heliand, began testing Trechtus' mind and found the boy, though shy, to be preternaturally intelligent and sophisticated given his circumstances. Heliand recognized in the boy a commonality, for Heliand had been trained on the Isle of Artaeum as a mystic.\nWhen the troupe was performing in the village of Potansa on the far eastern end of Summurset, Heliand took Trechtus, then a boy of eleven, to the Isle of Artaeum. The Magister of the Isle, Iachesis, recognized potential in Trechtus and took him on as pupil, giving him the name of Vanus Galarion. Vanus trained his mind on the Isle of Artaeum, as well as his body.\nThus was the first Archmagister of the Mages Guild trained. From the Psijics of the Isle of Artaeum, he received his training. From his childhood of want and injustice, he received his philosophy of sharing knowledge.\u00c3\u00bee\u00c3\u00a4O\nTrivia.\nYou look like you could use a hand. \"Well, yes.

It is a large cave comprised of three zones, which are inhabited mostly by &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. The cave is located southeast of &lt;a href=\"Ansilvund\"&gt;Ansilvund&lt;/a&gt; and east of &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Watchtower\"&gt;Shor's Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;. It is on a ridge with a wheelbarrow in front of it. It is the location of the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Crown of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; for the \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Stone%20Unturned%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;No Stone Unturned&lt;/a&gt;\" quest.\nSublocations.\nTolvald's Cave.\nUpon entering the cave, there is a small hunter's camp consisting of three bed rolls and an apprentice-locked leveled chest. There is a &lt;a href=\"hunter%27s%20journal\"&gt;hunter's journal&lt;/a&gt; to read on the stool between two of the bed rolls.\nTurning the corner, there will be an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraith&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0a &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;snow bear&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost troll&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the tunnel beyond it to the left, be aware of the bone \"tripwire\". A short distance down the tunnel another Ice Wraith, Snow Bear or Frost Troll will be in an alcove to the right. Continuing forward, the tunnel goes off to the right opening into a small cavern with another wraith, troll or bear in it. A tunnel on the opposite corner leads to a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; door. Through the door, there is a raised platform with a trapped &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; on it. The trap cannot be disarmed. Search the chest; poisoned arrows will fly from the walls, and two hidden doors will open, allowing three Falmer of varying levels to come out. Two are melee, one is ranged. At higher levels, 6\u20138 Falmer can appear, mostly being melee.\nTake either path to a room containing multiple &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/a&gt; around the room as well as an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;. There is a dead hunter in the gated area to the left.\nContinue onto the next room where there is a Falmer camp. There are three Falmer in this room and another slain hunter on a table. One of the Falmer has a &lt;a href=\"Shaman%27s%20Key\"&gt;Shaman's Key&lt;/a&gt;; It is a rare key but opens no lock or chest in the game. There is a leveled chest on the left side of the room next to the tanning rack.\nThe Falmer camp continues into the next room and overlooks two\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt;. Following the path through the camp, there are three or four Falmer. There is an adept-locked chest behind the first tent on the left and another found in the right tent with a door. The tunnel in between the tent leads to Tolvald's Gap.\nTolvald's Gap.\nUpon entering Tolvald's Gap a large cavern opens with water running from the ceiling. In the cavern, there are several Falmer and &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Falmer drops a &lt;a href=\"Shaman%27s%20key\"&gt;Shaman's key&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeading down the ramp, up the bridge to the right is one of three chests under the waterfall to the right. Continue on this path into a small room to find a few more Falmer, lots of mushrooms, and another chest inside the tent. Head back out of the room past the stream. Head down the land-bridge and follow the river downstream, turning right towards the waterfall to find the last (apprentice-locked) chest.\nFollowing the stream into the next room, there are two &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and a few Falmer (some of which are hiding in an alcove to the right). Keep following the stream to a tunnel, containing a skeever, which leads to a circular room with a few Falmer and some &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20Fledgling\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter Fledgling&lt;/a&gt;s inside the gated enclosure to the right. There is an ore vein inside and several egg sacs to harvest. Go up the ramp where there is an adept-locked chest before heading into the tunnel.\nThe tunnel leads back to the main chamber and more Falmer. The tent on the left contains a leveled chest. Follow the ledge to into the tunnel on the right and eventually the stream appears again. Follow it upstream this time and exit to Tolvald's Crossing.\nTolvald's Crossing.\nA short way down the tunnel, there is one powerful leveled\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0next to a waterfall on a Dwemer bridge. A little past the waterfall on the left there is an astral vision that fades into a skeleton and a \"&lt;a href=\"Faded%20Diary\"&gt;Faded Diary&lt;/a&gt;\".\nKeep following the tunnel until it divides into two paths:\nTo the right is a small clearing with another astral vision with a skeleton and the \"&lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Journal%20%28Tolvald%27s%20Crossing%29\"&gt;Tattered Journal&lt;/a&gt;\". Besides the skeleton is a magic &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;. Opposite is an apprentice-locked leveled chest. The path is further blocked by rubble unless you are on the final stage of the \"&lt;a href=\"No%20Stone%20Unturned%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;No Stone Unturned&lt;/a&gt;\" in which case you may continue into the next chamber. Amongst the debris there are swords, armor, and the crown. The ghosts of three elven guards will appear and attack the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the crown in death as they did in life.\nThe left path has a tripwire that can be deactivated. Just past the trap to the right are a few skeletons, an expert-locked chest, and some books including the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skill Book&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20Talara%2C%20Book%20III\"&gt;Mystery of Talara, Book III&lt;/a&gt;\".\nA little further down the tunnel is a ramp which doubles back to a Falmer and a master-locked chest. Back down the ramp, follow the path to a small room with two tiers of Falmer. The tent on the second level holds a chest.\nHead through the gate down the tunnel to a larger Dwemer room with several Falmer and a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering the room another astral vision quickly disappears. On the table at the base of the ramp is a skeleton and a \"&lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Trailbook\"&gt;Ruined Trailbook&lt;/a&gt;\" along with some loot. Up the incline, there is a table with 2 &lt;a href=\"Human%20Flesh%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Human Flesh&lt;/a&gt; on it. Follow the ledge to the left until you reach the first tunnel to the right. There is a Falmer inside with a chest. Back out to the ledge, continue to the next tunnel and follow it into a room with several Chaurus and/or Chaurus Hunters before a river.\nCross the bridge to the center platform and take either bridge the rest of the way across. There are a few Falmer and another Chaurus or Chaurus Hunter or two. There is a Dwemer chest at the structure to the left. Go through the gate and follow the tunnel to find more mushrooms and a &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;moonstone ore&lt;/a&gt; vein on the right. Upon reaching the Dwemer floor over the river, go to the far side and walk on the ledge down and around and then across the Dwemer pipes. Follow the tunnel back to Tolvald's Cave.\nThere is a wall chain to open a secret door back into the hunter camp."}

Fortunately for the practically-minded practitioner of conjurational studies, there is another option.\nDregs of the Deadlands have been known to offer the use of existing &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sigil Stones&lt;/a&gt; in crossing the traverse. Though the purposes of said beings are must be regarded with the wary suspicion, it is frequently possible to engage in transliminal studies with minimal risk to one's person, especially if one's go-between is supplied with sufficient motive.\nThe Deadlands, of course, are filled with searing heat and suffocating ash. But if you find a way to quench these things, their secrets\u2014and those of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; itself\u2014lie at your fingertips.\nTake heed, then, and read well of what fates befell those who first attempted contact with these domains.\nFirst, there was the scholar Daron, who thought the sheer power of elemental flame would be enough to initiate contact with the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; of the Deadlands. Though his attempt was impressive\u2014indeed, the fire instilled in the walls of his hovel would go on to spark one of the worst wildfires in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; history\u2014it ultimately proved futile. His ashes were never recovered.\nBelieving Daron was on to something, &lt;a href=\"Olpion\"&gt;Olpion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; sought to insulate the flames with compacted earth. By all accounts he nearly succeeded, but when his chambers burst from the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, his apparatus lost focus, collapsing the gateway upon itself.\nIn the end, it was the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Avumar\"&gt;Avumar&lt;/a&gt;, whose multifarious approach led to the final revelation. Once the flames were ignited, it was Avumar who thought to use an earthen vessel to convert the immense energy into steam. Once her boiler reached sufficient temperature, she was able to converse with a Dremora of some power on the other side.\nRelieved, no doubt, at her success in the face of her predecessors' failure, Avumar quickly agreed to the terms of the Dremora's contract. An ominous decision, it turns out, that ultimately led to the fall of &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nTake care, therefore, in your attempts to contact the Deadlands, for good seldom comes out of agreements made in haste with the creatures who call it home."}

Other types are the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Sword-Singing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Green%20Singing\"&gt;Green Singing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe original sound was made with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; and spans over all existence. Everything in the Aurbis is part of it and inevitably add to it by creating events and taking actions which results in songs. The heart of the music of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, whose name is &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri\"&gt;Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; for \"Doom-Drum,\" since he incites the greatest changes. Important events are recorded by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, which collect the songs for &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nTonal magic is able to add, interrupt, or change the song, although this is seldom used on a bigger scale. The Dwemer mastered this magic and their &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt;s could use it to build long-lasting structures, as a mining tool, for medical purposes, or to synchronize it with the mind. This made them able to bend the wills of others and enslave them, like the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly connect their own minds in a telepathic way, known as \"The Calling.\" Only a few people have learned how to reproduce tonal architecture, most notably &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and, to a lesser extent, the &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Auditor\"&gt;Harmonic Auditor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dwemer desired to escape the mundial restrictions and become something greater that would be equal to or surpass the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; by reversing their subgradient devolution into mortals. To achieve this goal, they attempted to modify their animi and that of their slaves with tonal architecture, but &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; and his followers went even further. After the Dwemer found the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; at the core of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Kagrenac created the three tools &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; which allowed their wearer to redirect the waves the Heart emitted by striking it. They continued by building a new god, &lt;a href=\"Anumidium\"&gt;Anumidium&lt;/a&gt;, which was supposed to free them. The &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Dwemer, but it was too late, as Kagrenac used the tools on the Heart and created the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Moment\"&gt;Red Moment&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;, wherein the Dwemer became immortal, were stopped, turned to ash, and merged with the Numidium, which was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\nNumidium itself may have used a type of tonal architecture that could nullify the &lt;a href=\"protonymic\"&gt;protonymic&lt;/a&gt;s and therefore the history of its targets. The Dwemer saw \"phenomena (that which can be perceived by the senses) and noumena (that which is the thing-itself)\" as illusions of the godhead &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and tried to escape it through Numidium which was beyond subgradience and could dismantle the structure of the Aurbis by negating the song."}

{"id": "5005", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5005", "title": "Tongues", "text": "Tongues are individuals who have a natural ability to speak the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;language of Dragons&lt;/a&gt;\u2014known as the \"Storm Voice,\" or simply the \"Voice.\"\nTongues are typically &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic in origin and those who demonstrate a talent usually require a great deal of study and training to develop their power. Nords consider themselves to be the children of the sky, and the breath and the voice of a Nord was his vital essence. Through the use of the Voice, the vital essence of a Nord could be articulated into a &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; possess the natural ability to speak the language of the Dragons. Such a person can learn Words of Power almost instantly, due to their ability to absorb a Dragon soul and its knowledge, without long-term study and practice.\nAbilities and powers.\nShouts could be used to sharpen &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blades&lt;/a&gt; or to strike enemies at a distance. Masters of the Voice could call to specific people over hundreds of miles, and could move by casting a shout, appearing where it lands. The most powerful of Tongues could not speak without causing great destruction. They had to be gagged, and communicated through a sign language and through scribing runes.\nOrigins.\nThe first Tongues can be dated back to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Before the war, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; were worshipped as gods by &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;mankind&lt;/a&gt;. That soon changed when the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;, the subordinates of the Dragons, began to rule over man with an iron fist making slaves of the population.\nMankind eventually rebelled and the Dragon War began. &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s response was swift and brutal. At first, humans were woefully outmatched and were shouted down effortlessly by the Dragons and their Voice. Nordic legends relate that &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; herself took pity on mankind, causing the Goddess to intervene by granting mortals the ability to Shout as the Dragons could, and by appealing to &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; to teach them how to use their new found power. At the behest of Kyne, the Dragon Paarthurnax, who originally was the lieutenant of Alduin, betrayed his master and thus instructed Men into using the Thu'um. Becoming masters of the Voice, the ancient Nord heroes succeeded in developing &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;a unique Shout&lt;/a&gt; independent of Paarthunax's teachings, which they used to defeat Alduin and banish him from the world, so ending the legendary Dragon War.\nNotable Tongues.\nMiraak.\n&lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; was the Dragon Priest ruling over the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; during the time when &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; ruled over mortals. At some point, Miraak came into possession of a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;, and then came into servitude under &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, who taught him &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;a great power&lt;/a&gt;. With this knowledge, Miraak turned on his Dragon masters and started a revolution against them. However, his revolution failed and was restrained to Solstheim, during which his &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; was razed to the ground by the Dragons.\nAncient Nord Heroes.\nNotable Ancient Nord Tongues include &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;. They were the first &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who learned the power of the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt; and were instrumental in Alduin's suspension in time at the summit of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great Nord War Chiefs.\nAround the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, Three great Nordic war chiefs were famous practitioners of the Voice. &lt;a href=\"Derek%20the%20Tall\"&gt;Derek the Tall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorg%20Helmbolg\"&gt;Jorg Helmbolg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; used the Thu'um to great effect in various military campaigns to expand the empire.\nIt was said that when they attacked a city, they needed no siege engines, rather they would form up in a wedge in front of the gatehouse, and draw in breath. When the leader let out in a thu'um, the doors were blown in, and the axemen rushed into the city.\nKvenel The Tongue.\n&lt;a href=\"Kvenel%20the%20Tongue\"&gt;Kvenel the Tongue&lt;/a&gt; was an ancient the leader of a group of powerful warriors capable of using &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt;.\nKvenel wanted a new weapon of excellent quality, to match his beloved sword, &lt;a href=\"Eduj\"&gt;Eduj&lt;/a&gt;. For his next adventure, Kvenel wanted a hand axe crafted by the legendary blacksmith &lt;a href=\"Haman%20Forgefire\"&gt;Haman Forgefire&lt;/a&gt;, who was known as the greatest blacksmith. Haman began to work on his most spectacular piece ever, the handaxe &lt;a href=\"Okin\"&gt;Okin&lt;/a&gt;. Haman was later murdered by his jealous rival, Gerhild. However, Coldheart and Kvenel brought the murderer to justice.\nWulfharth.\n&lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; was born in Atmora in the First Era. He was chosen to be the High King of Skyrim in 1E 500 by the Pact of Chieftains after the death of High King Hoag Merkiller, who was killed in the battle that led to the defeat of the Alessian army at Glenumbria Moors. Wulfharth was a mighty warrior blessed with the ancient \"Way of the Voice\". His Thu'um was so powerful that he could not verbally swear into the office, and scribes were used to draw up his oaths. Wulfharth was a true believer of the old gods and fought for their glory against the eastern &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, shouting their chief into Oblivion with his Thu'um.\nJurgen Windcaller.\n&lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; was said to be the mightiest of all the Tongues. He led a campaign to Morrowind, but after a disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; where his army was annihilated, he spent seven years pondering the meaning of his defeat.\nHe finally came to the conclusion that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Thu'um. Following this revelation, Jurgen developed a pacifist creed called the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; that preached the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods rather than martial exploits. After he converted to pacifism, he became known as Jurgen the Calm.\nThe Greybeards.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; are a monastic order who live on the highest mountain peak in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. They follow the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;, the pacifist philosophy developed by Jurgen Windcaller that is based largely on their veneration of the Wind as the personification of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic aspect of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. As such, they live in absolute silence in order to better attune themselves to the Voice.\nWhen they speak, storms brew above High Hrothgar, and people are forced to evacuate due to the imminent danger of avalanches. When &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; traveled to meet with them believing he was a figure of prophecy, he was blasted to ash. Such is their power, the last time that they spoke was when they announced the destiny of a young Tiber Septim. When they spoke his name, the world shook.\nTiber Septim.\nHjalti Early-Beard, better known as &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; or General Talos, was a true master of the Voice. He had studied the Voice in Skyrim, and it was said he could rout entire armies with his battle-cry and shout lesser men off their feet. As a general under Emperor &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, he led the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Old Hrol'dan&lt;/a&gt; and took it back from the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; by shouting down the walls.\nHe also endowed an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Imperial College of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to returning the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; to the ancient and honorable art of war.\nUlfric Stormcloak.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;\u2014best known for his rebellion against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;\u2014is a notable &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim who used The Voice to kill the &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; during a duel."}

She is trying to recover him from her research site.\"\nWalkthrough.\nNear the &lt;a href=\"Qharroa%20Ruins\"&gt;Qharroa Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Clarisse%20Laurent\"&gt;Lady Clarisse Laurent&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that she has been researching these ruins, but that her servant &lt;a href=\"Stibbons\"&gt;Stibbons&lt;/a&gt; has become incapacitated and her camps have been overrun by &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;. She will ask you to help her resolve these problems. \nYour first task will be to retrieve Lady Laurent's alchemical supplies from her camp to the east. The camp is unguarded; you can just head into the big tent and take the supplies. Once you have them, return them to Lady Laurent and she will ask you to escort her to her other camp so that she can revive Stibbons. This camp is north of the road, though there will be hostile &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; and goblins in your way. At the camp, you will see that Stibbons has been turned to stone; speak with Lady Laurent and she will tell you that she was trying to perform some alchemical ritual she discovered here, but that it worked a bit too well and turned Stibbons to stone. She will ask you to look for her notes so that she may return Stibbons to normal. \nThe notes are in the crate beside the tent; return them to Lady Laurent and give her a moment to read them, then speak with her again. She will tell you that the goblins took her reagents so she cannot make the antidote at this time. Once she does make the antidote, she wishes to test it on some goblins first, so she will have to find the Yokudan inscriptions detailing how to turn them to stone. Both the reagents and the inscriptions can be found in the area to the west. The reagents will be found on the body of one of the goblins, and the inscriptions are found on stone tablets along the ancient Yokudan arches. \nOnce you have found both the reagents and the inscriptions, speak with Lady Laurent. She will ask you to administer the Stoneflesh Potion she has made to the goblins by adding it to their stew. In the meantime, she is going to consult with her guide. The stew can be found to your northeast; add the potion, then head out to meet Lady Laurent and her guide at Hermit's Climb, to the east of your current location and just southwest of &lt;a href=\"Yanurah%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Yanurah's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Mareh%20the%20Hermit\"&gt;Mareh the Hermit&lt;/a&gt;; you will find that he speaks in riddles. If you speak to Lady Laurent now, she will tell you that Mareh is seeking the answer to the riddles in the notes lying beside him. \n\"The hawk watches over sands without effort. But what watches over the hawk?\"\n\"Sword and spell are useless. As it fells man and beast alike, and given time, the mountains themselves.\"\n\"A mother gave the first gift to her son, and for the rest of his life did he keep it with him.\"\nThe answer to all these riddles is \"Air.\" Tell this to Mareh and he will reveal how to cure the effects of the Stoneflesh Potion; you need the tongue of a gargoyle. Gargoyles can be found throughout the ruins; slay one and Lady Laurent will harvest its tongue. Once you have the tongue, return to the camp where Stibbons was petrified and talk to Lady Laurent there. She has prepared several versions of the antidote and will ask you to test them on the petrified goblins. You will find a great many goblins in the area to your west; pour the antidote on four of them and they will all explode upon being treated. \nAfter you have tested the four potions, return to Lady Laurent's first camp, the one where you found the alchemy supplies, and speak with her there. She has dragged Stibbons here while you were testing the potion, and will use your results to perfect the potion and cure Stibbons.

She is using a magical war horn Targoth had in life. When his soldiers heard the call they obeyed it and Drusilla binds them to her will. She must be killed before she sends his soldiers against their descendants. This will free Targoth from her will and then the horn can return his warband to its honored rest.\nReach the lower chamber to find Drusilla and eliminate her so Targoth can be freed from her spell. Then take the War Horn from the table behind her and go back to Targoth and speak with him again.\nHe is happy that he is finally free but his warriors still cry out for an end to their torment.

He then asks for the horn to be placed on his tomb in the next chamber and then his warriors will rest once again. If the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; keeps the horn the warriors will be condemned to further degradation. If the Vestige places the horn on the tomb, the warriors return to their rest.\nAfter chosing one of the two, leave the ruins and return to Azlakha and tell her what happened.

She will be grateful that you returned the skulls, but then she will say some unsettling things about her and her daughters craving power, and about corpses and craving blood. she says she will let you live, but that you should not try to stop her. She will then disappear.\nLook for Sonya's husband, &lt;a href=\"Hadmal%20Lastblood\"&gt;Hadmal Lastblood&lt;/a&gt;. He will be in &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Jorunn's Stand&lt;/a&gt;.

He says that she will most likely be performing the ritual at a shrine to the south, and will ask you to help him stop her. \nThe shrine is at &lt;a href=\"Hammerhome\"&gt;Hammerhome&lt;/a&gt;, in the far southeast of Eastmarch. Sonya's ritual fuses her spirit with her daughters into a being called &lt;a href=\"The%20Lastblood\"&gt;The Lastblood&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "185443", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=185443", "title": "Torradan ap Dugal", "text": "Torradan ap Dugal, colloquially referred to as the Scourge of the Abecean Sea, the Terror of the Gold Coast, and Cutthroat of Hunding Bay, was a male &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; who was the founder and leader of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;, a group of pirates and sailors that terrorized the western waters of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nCommanding his organization from his flagship, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;, Dugal took advantage of the chaos caused by the wars of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; to raid &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; shipping and trade on the western coast of Tamriel. Dugal rose from his humble origins in the town of &lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow\"&gt;Dunbarrow&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to become one of the most well-known pirates in Tamrielic history.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nTorradan hailed from the ap Dugal family, which dates back to the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. His ancestor, &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;, was the leader of the pirate group known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails&lt;/a&gt;, and later ruled &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; for over five years.\nDuring an unknown year of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Torradan ap Dugal was born in the small town of Dunbarrow on the northern coast of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; into a poor family. Due to the fact that his family was poor, Dugal was not educated during his early years at the academies where children learned in Skyrim.\nAt the age of nine, Dugal's parents sold him to the captain of a smuggling vessel that was visiting Dunbarrow at the time. The captain taught Dugal all about the art of sailing and quickly became the father figure to Dugal that he never had. Dugal learned how to avoid and smuggle goods under the nose of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; from the smuggling captain.\nThis learning was further cemented by Dugal's serving on the vessel which smuggled &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. However, Dugal's time serving as a smuggler was short as the captain was eventually caught by the Imperial Navy and executed by hanging.\nAfter the execution of the captain of the smuggling vessel that he had served on, Dugal was stranded in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;. He served on several different vessels for short stints of time, but eventually secured a more permanent position as a midshipman on a pirate ship commanded by Captain &lt;a href=\"Kaladas\"&gt;Kaladas&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Kaladas was a notorious drunkard, and ended up running his ship aground near the city of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; shortly after setting sail from Hammerfell. Dugal's stint with Kaladas lasted a little while longer until Kaladas ended up drinking himself to death in a tavern in Anvil, and then he once again became unemployed.\nShortly afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; as he was more commonly known, began his undead crusade against the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the provinces of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the outset of the war, Dugal was serving on a \"rickety tub\"\u00a0 that had a \"worthless rot\" of a captain.\nStretched thin by the undead legions of Camoran, the Imperial Navy took control of all pirate vessels docked at Anvil and conscripted their crews into service to fight against Camoran and his forces. Dugal's captain agreed to hand his vessel over to the Imperial Navy for use in the war effort; however, Dugal led a mutiny against the captain which resulted in Dugal taking control of the ship after he cut the captain's throat and threw his body overboard.\nPirate lord of the Red Sabre.\nAfter seizing control of the ship from his captain, Dugal led his crew to &lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow%20Cove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Dunbarrow Cove&lt;/a&gt; where they stayed until things had blown over and the Imperial Navy was too busy fighting against Camoran to search for Dugal and his crew in order to punish them for their mutiny.\nSensing the profit that could be made from the chaos that the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; was experiencing, Dugal used his vessel to raid the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;'s supply lines which were unprotected due to the fact that the Navy was stretched thin and did not possess enough ships to defend their cargo ships. As more and more ships succumbed to his ship, Dugal rallied other pirates under his flag and formed the organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;.\nDugal commanded his new organization of pirates, cutthroats, deserters, and ex-prisoners from his flagship, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Flag\"&gt;Black Flag&lt;/a&gt;. Controlling refitted privateer galleons, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; ships with living sails, and captured navy cutters, Dugal raided merchant ships on the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually earned such an infamous reputation that crews of merchant ships abandoned ship as soon as his standard was seen, and the Empire placed a bounty of forty-thousand &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; on his head.\nHowever, his good fortune was not to last. Eventually, the War against the Camoran Usurper ended, and the Imperial Navy, under the command of Commodore &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, turned its attention to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt; and Dugal. With unlimited funding from &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20II\"&gt;Cephorus II&lt;/a&gt;, Umbranox occupied Anvil and attempted to discover Dugal's location from his crew member's that had been captured there. Umbranox landed soldiers on every island in the Abecean and killed or arrested Dugal's forces wherever he encountered them.\nPlanting a lead elsewhere, Dugal drew Umbranox's forces away from Anvil so that he could capture the ships that Umbranox had left behind. However, Umbranox saw through the deception and trapped Dugal in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Bay\"&gt;Anvil Bay&lt;/a&gt;. In order to prevent the Red Sabre from fleeing onto land and into Anvil, Imperial forces torched Anvil.\nTrapped in Anvil Bay, Dugal led the Red Sabre against Umbranox's Imperial Navy until all ships on both sides had been sunk except for the Black Flag and Umbranox's ship. Realizing that he was going to lose, Dugal attempted to escape and sailed the Black Flag under a cliff. However, Umbranox had brought mages on his ship. Umbranox's mages used spells to bring the cliffside down on the Black Flag and trapped Dugal, his ship, and his crew under a mountain of rubble.\nDeath.\nTrapped under the rubble of the cliff, Dugal and his crew survived off of the rations and supplies that the ship had been supplied with before the battle in Anvil Bay. They turned the ruins of the Black Flag into their home in the caverns that had formed around it due to the avalanche caused by Umbranox's mages. Dugal; however, did not give up on escaping from his prison. He and his crew attempted to blast their way out, dig their way out, and even pray their way out. However, nothing worked and they were trapped. \nDugal and his crew survived in the caverns for approximately twenty years on the supplies of the Black Flag. During that time, Dugal recorded his life story in his &lt;a href=\"Cap%27n%20Dugal%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; . Eventually; however, a sickness descended upon the remaining crew of Dugal. A pirate known as &lt;a href=\"Grim\"&gt;Grim&lt;/a&gt; was the first to succumb to the illness, but he was quickly followed by many other members of the crew. Dugal tried to quarantine the sick in the farthest sections of the caverns, but even that failed and eventually, Dugal contracted the illness.\nDugal eventually died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20286\"&gt;3E 286&lt;/a&gt; and he was turned into a walking skeleton along with the rest of his crew. His skeleton was not put to rest until &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; rediscovered Dunbarrow Cove, defeated the skeletons of Dugal and his crew, and re-formed the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;."}

They called the land &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt;, in recognition of the vast number of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; that lived there, and established relations with the local Snow Elves.\u00a0They built the great city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0the first major Atmoran settlement in Skyrim as well as the first city of Men in the continent of Tamriel.\nSack of Saarthal.\nOne night, an invading force of Snow Elves descended upon Saarthal and slaughtered the inhabitants. The city itself was burned to the ground. These events became known as the Night of Tears.\nMotive.\nOriginally, it was believed that the Snow Elves' motive was to exterminate the Atmorans as they realized the rate at which the human settlers' population was growing. If left unchecked, these settlers would become a great threat to Elvish civilization on Tamriel.\u00a0Another theory, proposed by Imperial scholars, is that the Snow Elves attacked Saarthal because they feared that the Atmorans' culture would surpass their own, and thus sought to drive the Men from their lands.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Report%20on%20Saarthal\"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the initial attack on Saarthal was very focused, and did not appear to correlate to any locations that were established as points of defense or importance. Not only did the elves know the apparent layout of the city, but that their assault was based on a specific directive and perhaps a singular goal. It has been speculated that when Saarthal was originally built, the Atmorans found a &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;source of great power&lt;/a&gt; located underneath its foundations, and attempted to keep it buried. The Mer learned of this and coveted the object for themselves.\nA Nordic-Breton myth known as, \"The Seven Fights of the Aldudagga,\" states that the Daedric Prince, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, was responsible for the destruction of Saarthal. It is told that the Snow Elves had already hated the Atmorans, but Dagon gave the Elves grim dreams (most likely involving the Atmorans) that heightened their hatred of the Atmorans to the point in which they sacked Saarthal. Though the myth is rather eccentric and can't really be taken as entirely legitimate, there could be some truth to it.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and his sons, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, survived and fled back to Atmora,\u00a0but would later return with an army known as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim Saarthal and lead a reprisal campaign against the Snow Elves.\u00a0The ruined city was successfully retaken, and eventually rebuilt.\nYsgramor and his army hunted the Snow Elves and other Mer alike, ending the dominion of Mer over Skyrim and making possible the rise of Men on Tamriel, establishing the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Any remaining Snow Elves were brutally bound and burnt alive, or chained and enslaved. These series of events gained the name of &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;, and led to a lasting distrust and prejudice between Men and Mer."}
{"id": "107019", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=107019", "title": "Night of Tears (Book)", "text": "Night of Tears is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nSummary.\nThis tome, written by &lt;a href=\"Dranor%20Seleth\"&gt;Dranor Seleth&lt;/a&gt;, details the complete history of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0and how they came\u00a0to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, as well as\u00a0how they constructed and settled the city of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. After their arrival, the Nedes began a great\u00a0alliance with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, and both races believed that a lasting peace between them would endure. At some point the Snow Elves began to fear the growing population of the Nedes, and the possibility that they might expand beyond Saarthal and settle all of Skyrim. So the Snow Elves broke their alliance with the Nedes by sending a legion of their troops to Saarthal in which they brutally slaughtered every last man, woman and child in the city. The remaining Nedes who survived the attack returned to Atmora to tell of the night's events.\u00a0Thus they gathered the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to return to Skyrim on the day which would later be known as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;. When they landed in Skyrim they\u00a0fought a huge battle against the Snow Elves, eventually winning. Over time, the Nedes would develop into the Nords, and would eventually settle all of Skyrim. The events which involve the entire Nede race traveling from Atmora to Skyrim would later be referred to as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe event that occurred in Saarthal would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, and would stay with the Nords as a part of their history and culture, as well as their hatred of the Snow Elves and essentially all &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven-kind&lt;/a&gt;.\nContents.\nSaarthal holds a prominent place in Skyrim history, even if most do not remember it by name. It is of course the site of one of the first major &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; settlements, one of the first cities of men in Skyrim, and the earliest known capital of their civilization. It was also the site of terrible bloodshed, when the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; attempted to drive the Nords out of Skyrim, to succeed only in incurring their wrath in the form of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his fabled Five Hundred Companions, who swept the elves from Skyrim and firmly established it as the home of the Nords.\nAll this is known, but little else. What happened on that Night of Tears, when Saarthal was razed to the ground? What provoked the elves to such a deliberate, vicious attack, and what prompted such a severe response from the Nords?\n&lt;a href=\"Vingalmo\"&gt;Vingalmo's&lt;/a&gt; Treatise on the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; Antecedent suggests that the elves of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, along with their counterparts the early &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, possessed a degree of sophistication unparalleled in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. They displayed power beyond what could be expected of the time. While a distinct explanation is not given for this, I believe that this work, compared with the early writings of Heseph Chirirnis, suggest that something greater was at work on that night in Saarthal.\nThe true motives behind the Night of Tears have been obscured to us by the passage of time, but I believe this was not a simple war of territory, or of control of Skyrim. I believe that what happened was a significant event based around something very particular.\nThe Nords found &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; when they built their city, buried deep in the ground. They attempted to keep it buried, but the elves learned of it and coveted it for themselves. Thus they assaulted Saarthal, their goal not to drive the Nords out but to secure this power for themselves. I believe Ysgramor knew something of what the elves would find under Saarthal, and rallied together his people to keep the elves from gaining it. When Nords once again controlled Skyrim, this power was buried deep below the earth and sealed away.\nTime has kept this knowledge from us, but it is my hope that Time will also reveal the truth of these words. Every effort will be made to relocate Saarthal, and find that which has been lost to us."}

{"id": "18087", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18087", "title": "Nightblade (Oblivion)", "text": "Nightblades are effective assassins and enforcers. Their &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; allow them to easily reach places most others could not. Nightblades dispose of opponents with a quick &lt;a href=\"blade\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic. They are also skilled in &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; magic, and are proficient in &lt;a href=\"heal\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt;ing themselves. It is a premade &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse.\nNightblades tend to favor &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; armor over &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;. They are adept healers and are good at using &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; magic, casting spells to protect themselves, and so on. They use melee based blades to further weaken their foes while they dispatch them with their powerful spells of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nTheir proficiency in &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; is unusual for a class that specializes in magic, but they make great assassins and thieves due to their natural speed.\nBlades.\nAs the name references to, Nightblades use bladed weapons to further protect themselves. Daggers and shortswords are good to use because the Nightblade tends to be quick and agile, allowing for quick attacks while blasting their foes with destruction magic. Longswords are slower and less quick, but can be deadly if it is used just the right way with a Nightblade. Claymores are not recommended.\nMagic.\nSince Nightblades are not naturally high in &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, it is best to work on &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; to gain a boost in &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; reserves to cast more spells. Their high Willpower allows them to regenerate magic quickly, which can be used to let off more spells. Their high alteration skill allows them to protect themselves with spells such as &lt;a href=\"Protect\"&gt;Protect&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;. If an enemy is far away, a Nightblade can use Destruction spells, ranging from long distance to damage on touch.\nDisadvantages.\nSince they aren't skilled with Illusion magic, it may be wise to use as a side skill to cast invisibility spells, or choose &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt;. They can probably be killed easily due to their lack of endurance, so it is best to also use &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; as a side skill, too. It is hard to face hordes of enemies head-on with this type of class, also."}

As a last-ditch effort to prevent the Orcs from seizing the inner sanctum in which the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; stands, the priests released \"the Miasma,\" a gas which instantly puts all those who inhale it into an unbreakable deep hibernation while also keeping those slumbering perfectly preserved. Unfortunately, the longer one stays asleep due to \"the Miasma,\" the more their mind breaks down. As such, upon entering the tower and breaking the air-tight seal, \"the Miasma\" dissipates, allowing the Orcs and the Priests to awaken and begin attacking in a frenzy, not able to tell the difference between friend and foe.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeaking to &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt;, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; will begin the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric Quest&lt;/a&gt; to end the nightmares, &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, which involves a visit to Nightcaller Temple.\nErandur established a small shrine to Mara within the tower's entry hall, hoping to seek her guidance. Upon entering the shrine, the priest explains how &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Skull&lt;/a&gt; is the source of everyone's nightmares, since it devours dreams and memories for Vaermina to collect.\nIf the quest Waking Nightmare is completed without killing Erandur, Erandur may be found at the meager shrine in the entry hall.

The most recent incarnation of the &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; was made up of three elite thieves: &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus Desidenius&lt;/a&gt;.

It is common belief that the Nightingales do not exist, and were simply created as a way to scare &lt;a href=\"Footpad\"&gt;Footpad&lt;/a&gt;s into doing what they are told.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; progresses through the Thieves Guild, they are invited to join the Nightingales. In doing so, the Dragonborn swears to protect Nocturnal and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;her shrine&lt;/a&gt;, even after death. As a reward for the pledge of service, Nightingales are granted &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; blessed by Nocturnal and receive special powers, including increased luck in their exploits as thieves.\nAfter the completion of \"&lt;a href=\"Trinity%20Restored\"&gt;Trinity Restored&lt;/a&gt;\" the Dragonborn becomes a fully-fledged Nightingale. They are then allowed to choose whichever manner of agent of Nocturnal (see &lt;a href=\"%23Powers\"&gt;Powers&lt;/a&gt; below).\nHistory.\nAccording to \"Nightingales: Fact or Fiction?\", the first signs of the existence of a group dedicated to the service of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; Nocturnal \u2014 the Nightingales \u2014 surfaced over one-hundred years prior to the events of . A corpse was discovered wearing strange black armor, and bearing an insignia that resembled a nightbird cradling the moon in its wings. Since then, it has always been rumored that a secret inner-circle existed within the Thieves Guild which was responsible for protecting the shrines of Nocturnal. Little is known of the Nightingales' membership prior to the return of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, but purportedly a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named Lorthus, who was executed for murder, was suspected of being a Nightingale.\nPowers.\nAgents are powers that are gifted from &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; to the Nightingales. There are three known kinds of Agents, each possessing a &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; that can be used once a day. It is possible to change to another kind of Agent, but only once per day, and only at the Twilight Sepulcher.\nAgent of Stealth (crescent moon).\nAn Agent of Stealth is an expert infiltrator. They use darkness to conceal themselves. They are granted the power of &lt;a href=\"Shadowcloak%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Shadowcloak of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; which automatically turns the Nightingale invisible when &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;. While sneaking, the effect acts as any other form of &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that if the Agent interacts with an object or character, the effect will dissipate. However, the cloak can be re-engaged by leaving and entering sneak again (as long as the duration holds). Shadowcloaks last for two minutes, or indefinitely if the Dragonborn never interacts with anything whilst crouching.\nAgent of Subterfuge (half moon).\nAn Agent of Subterfuge uses darkness to obscure others' thoughts and judgement. They are granted the power of &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Subterfuge\"&gt;Nightingale Subterfuge&lt;/a&gt; which forces targets in the area of effect to attack anybody on sight, allowing the Agent to take advantage of the chaos to gain the upper hand.\nAgent of Strife (full moon).\nAn Agent of Strife uses darkness for their own benefit. They are granted the power of &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20Strife\"&gt;Nightingale Strife&lt;/a&gt; that creates a cord between them and their foes. This cord draws health from said foe while giving health to the Agent."}

In exchange for killing Nimhe, Calcelmo will give them the keys to his &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Museum\"&gt;Dwemer Museum&lt;/a&gt; and the excavation site.\nStrategy.\nAn easy way to defeat Nimhe is to use &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic spells and attack her from the tunnel to Nimhe's lair. Nimhe cannot crawl nor attack through the small tunnel (with the exception of the poison she shoots) that the Dragonborn enters Nimhe's lair from, making this area a wonderful spot to attack from.\nThis can be a tough fight for melee characters, especially on higher difficulties. Directly across from the entrance where the Dragonborn first comes in, an egg sac sits on the raised platform near the exit. By crouching and hiding behind it, Nimhe can't hit them with its poison attack, and can't climb the stairs, giving a lot of time to replenish stamina and magicka. It might take a while, but it definitely makes the fight a lot easier.\nNimhe can be easily killed using high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; ability. For this, take a corner and pelt her with arrows, the result will be minimum to no damage to the Dragonborn and the giant spider will be slain with relative ease."}

The religion combines the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; pantheon created by &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;apotheosized&lt;/a&gt; form of the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; who became &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, the ninth Divine. There are six gods and three goddesses. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, there is a &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; in each major &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; venerating the divines. There are also &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; along the roads that are devoted to the Nine Divines. Many of these gods also appear in various combinations in the pantheons of other cultures.\nImperial Pantheon.\nIncluding the Nine Divines \u2013 the Imperial Pantheon itself also has three additional gods.\nAlessia and the Eight Divines.\nThe Eight Divines as an official religion was instituted by Alessia upon her slave revolt against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. She is said to have consciously made a synthesis of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic gods&lt;/a&gt;, in order to appease both her Nord allies and the Cyrods and Ayleids she now ruled.\nPerhaps coincidentally, the eight &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; Alessia chose are those Aedra said to have been most active in the creation of the world. When the &lt;a href=\"et%27ada\"&gt;et'ada&lt;/a&gt; realized what &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; had done, and how their divinity was being drained to create &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, most of them objected or withdrew. The eight Aedra that make up the divines, however, willingly gave of themselves to complete the act of creation, and are therefore seen as benevolent, in contrast to the more aloof merish deities.\nPopular opinion and worship.\nWorship of the Imperial Pantheon started in the province of Cyrodiil, the homeland of the Imperials. The missionary arm of the religion was known as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, whose aim was to bring divine inspiration and consolation to the Empire's remote provinces. Because Talos was not originally one of the Divines, in some religious sects the Nine Divines are referred to as \"The Eight And One.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the late-Third Era, worship of the Nine Divines was prevelant in both Cyrodiil, and to some extent in Morrowind. Within Morrowind, following of the Nine Divines was dominant within the territory of Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and the District of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; after the Imperial Cult took advantage of the collapse of the orthodox &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; cults. The Nords of Skyrim still largely followed their own religion, with even the Nords in Bruma refusing to revere the Nine in favor of their own gods, in part due to their preferance to Ysmir compared to Akatosh.\nWhile the part that Talos played in the religion of High Rock and Hammerfell during the Third Era is unknown, the Eight Divines are part of the religion of High Rock, and some of the Eight are also venerated along the Iliac Bay region in Hammerfell. Unlike their Imperial Cult counterpart, however, the temples in these regions of these are only dedicated to one of the Eight, as opposed to all the Divines.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile by the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim's cities had enthusiastically taken to the worship of the Nine, they historically had their own pantheon, which was still followed by citizens in more remote locations. Despite Talos not being part of the religion of the Nords, the conversion of Skyrim was such a success, that the Nords came to believe that Talos was a part of their culture and traditions. Contrary to the chapel worship in Cyrodiil, the Temples in Skyrim are only dedicated to one of the Divines - with no additional shrines for the other Eight. The sole exception being the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Since Skyrim converted to the Imperial faith, Nordic burial customs include offerings to shrines of each of the Nine Divines.\nFollowing the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, Talos was effectively removed from the pantheon of the Gods\u2014and The Eight Divines worship resumed. While the ban on Talos worship was not enforced originally, following the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor was forced to crack down, and permit the Thalmor entry to enforce the Concordat. Where required, &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; agents from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, ensure that the worship of Talos remains an illegal activity. The outlawing of Talos worship is one of the causes of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, who see the ban on the worship of Talos as a violation of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s religious freedom.\nAn Imperial Liaison to the Aldmeri Dominion wrote the book known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Talos%20Mistake\"&gt;The Talos Mistake&lt;/a&gt;\", stating the Empire chose to remove Talos from the Nine not because of the Dominion, but because it was the right thing to do. The book states that the worship of Talos only weakened the history of Tiber Septim's mortal deeds, and pulled the people away from the Eight Divines.\nThe Imperial Priests of Talos within Skyrim were largely against the Empire due to the outlawing of Talos worship, believing that any true son of the Empire would never forsake Talos. Within the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, attendance to the chapel of the Divines was low due to many citizens joining the Legion to fight in the war, however, the High Priest of the Eight Divines did get more visitors asking for council. By contrast, the population of Windhelm flocked to the Temple of Talos when the war broke out, though not always because of the war itself. Within the city of Whiterun, &lt;a href=\"Danica%20Pure-Spring\"&gt;Danica Pure-Spring&lt;/a&gt;, the priestess of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; stopped most of her duties as a priestess to instead tend to the wounded soldiers of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; who returned after clashes with the Stormcloaks.\nCommunication with mortals and manifestation.\nPrior to Alessia's pact with Akatosh, binding her soul to the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, many Aedra and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; were able to fully interact with Nirn and its population. However, even during this period, these eight Aedra are not known to have manifested physically on the planet, but communicated through dreams and visions (as with Alessia). Their interaction with the world is relegated to blessings through their altars and shrines, and the Divines themselves are mostly seen as distant, beyond a few charismatic cults for individual Divines. On rare occassions, the Divines may communicate with a follower of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, turning them into an Oracle.

By &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt; they had captured the Ayleid &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, ending the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Empire\"&gt;Ayleid Empire&lt;/a&gt; and forming the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nEight Divines.\nAlessia's first major act as &lt;a href=\"empress\"&gt;empress&lt;/a&gt; was to abolish worship of the Ayleid &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;. However, she was a shrewd politician, enough to realize that her people had never known any other gods. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; violently opposed the Ayleid gods, and chiefly worshiped their version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, whom they called &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;. The elves, however, hated Lorkhan, whom they called \"The Trickster,\" and completely rejected any worship of him. Alessia knew she had to be careful in choosing the official state religion; she could not afford to anger her Nordic allies, but her own people could not adjust to the complete Nordic pantheon in just a single generation.\nHer compromise was to merge the two religions, choosing to keep the less controversial Ayleid gods, such as &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, and bring in popular Nordic ones, such as &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. She sidestepped the issue of Lorkhan by leaving him out of her Eight Divines, but identifying him as the \"missing ninth god,\" a brother to the Eight Divines who was otherwise absent from the pantheon. The worship of the Eight Divines, along with the Empire itself, would go on to become the most prominent religion across all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiber Septim.\nOn his deathbed, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; bequeathed his throne to his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and died in &lt;a href=\"3E%2038\"&gt;3E 38&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber died at the age of 108, the oldest man in history. He was buried in the catacombs of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; among the members of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20dynasty\"&gt;Reman dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his death, Tiber &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;ascended to godhood&lt;/a&gt;. He became Talos again, the God of War and Governance, for after a lifetime of war, he had united Tamriel for the first time in history. He changed the religion of the Eight Divines into that of the Nine Divines.\n&lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; was signed, ending the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the elves of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. However, peace was agreed upon with one of the conditions being that the Empire cease to recognize Talos as one of the Divines, and all shrines to him be removed from the temples of towns loyal to the Empire and their new elven masters.

They were said to have been ruthless, inflicting death and destruction on their path, until disappearing, earning them the name the Lost Legion. The Legion was tricked by an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; named Gin-Rajul, who worked for the Legion as a scout during their occupation of Murkmire. Gin-Rajul brough the Legion to &lt;a href=\"Tsofeer%20Cavern\"&gt;Tsofeer Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, convincing them the location would protect the Legion from the elements and threats within the area. He also convinced the Legion that a powerful artifact was located within the cave. Once the Legion had set up camp within the cave, scavenger parties and guard units started disappearing. While the Legion itself was suspicious, Gin-Rajul ensured that the troops probably deserted and fled the area. Though the Legion considered the idea insane, they did not see a reason for Gin-Rajul to lie, and so, remained within the cave.\nEventually, the Legion ended up getting attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Wuju-Ka\"&gt;Wuju-Ka&lt;/a&gt;, large, strong, and resilient &lt;a href=\"Voriplasm\"&gt;Voriplasm&lt;/a&gt;. It ended up killing many Legionnaires, resulting in what remained of the Legion causing a rockslide to keep the monster in, and prevent it from threatening the Empire's interests within Murkmire. The last Legionnaire of the Ninth Legion managed to survive for longer than most of the Legion because of the Legionnaire's skill with spellcasting. The Legionnaire thought that their trust in Gin-Rajul might have been misplaced, and that Gin-Rajul led them to the cave specifically to get killed by the Wuju-Ka. The Legionnaire would later die during his attempt to bind the Wuju-Ka, as he was attacked by voriplasms.\nIt was later speculated by one of Gin-Rajul's relatives that Gin-Rajul did not aid the Legion out of personal gain, but for the good of all Murkmire. The local Argonian tribes were too weak to face the Legion on their own, and so Gin-Rajul led them to the Wuju-Ka to be devoured, saving the Argonians of the area from the Ninth Legion's occupation.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Third Era, the Legion was selected by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in his invasion of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the &lt;a href=\"Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt;. The Ninth Legion, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Seventeenth%20Legion\"&gt;Seventeenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, was originally assigned as one of the reinforcement Legions after the &lt;a href=\"Fifth%20Legion\"&gt;Fifth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Legion\"&gt;Tenth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fourteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourteenth&lt;/a&gt; had secured a landing area on Akavir.\nWhen the beachhead was secured, however, the decision was made to send colonists over rather than the two reinforcement legions. The Ninth and Seventeenth were sent to &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt; instead, due to local unrest, and would remain there for the rest of the invasion."}

She wears a long queue, clad in a flowing black robe embroidered with the stylized form of a &lt;a href=\"draugr\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Attrebus\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; arrived at &lt;a href=\"Sathil%20%28Village%29\"&gt;Sathil&lt;/a&gt; searching for &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;, Nirai received them at the gates of the castle. Attrebus made up a cover to hide their real identity, so he introduced himself as Uriel Tripitus and Sul as Ozul, naturalists commissioned to make a new guide to the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and independent realms of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Nirai offered them lodging and whatever help they required.\nAttrebus discovered thanks to &lt;a href=\"Irinja\"&gt;Irinja&lt;/a&gt; that the sword was being held in the depths of Sathil castle. &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul Sathil&lt;/a&gt; had been possessed by Umbra, so his father had locked him in the dungeons of the castle. Sul ventured into the darkness while Attrebus waited for him in the entrance. However, Nirai closed the gate of the dungeon, trapping Sul and Attrebus.\nNirai revealed Attrebus that Irinja had seduced him to discover who they really were and what they were looking for. Nirai explained how his brother Elhul had gone mad after touching Umbra. Unlike her father, Nirai did not want to leave Elhul (or whatever Elhul was now) alive, so she had allowed Sul and him access his cell to kill him. However, she would not leave them escape,\neven if they defeated Elhul, in case they also went mad after touching the blade.\nAttrebus and Sul managed to kill Elhul. They wrapped Umbra very carefully so that they did not directly touch it. Nirai was waiting for them in the gate when they came back. Nirai offered to set them free if they left the sword in the dungeon. She told them all she knew about the sword in an attempt to bring Sul and Attrebus to their senses, but they were determined to take the sword. Nirai left them locked, but Sul opened a gate to &lt;a href=\"The%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;The Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;'s realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;."}

The exact reasons and specifics behind Nirn's creation are largely uncertain. However, all agree that the deity &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; played pivotal roles in the creation of the planet. Two moons, &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;, orbit Nirn. They are Lorkhan's sundered corpse. Nirn is the center of Mundus, which itself is the \"hub\" of universe's \"wheel.\" The heavens beyond Nirn are star-filled. These stars are holes or portals through &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, and carry magical significance due to the beings which tore them open, the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCreation myths.\nThere are many theories on how Lorkhan created Nirn; ranging from the other &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; agreeing to willfully help, to Lorkhan tricking them into it. However, it is universally acknowledged that the Aedra gave their energy and power over to it, that the majority gave up on the project after realizing the cost and became the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, while those who willingly helped became the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. In , &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; proclaims that Nirn is possibly an extension of the realm of Oblivion.\nLunar activity.\nThe two moons that orbit Nirn, &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;, are said to be Lorkhan's sundered corpse. Masser, Nirn's larger moon, revolves around Nirn itself. By observing the nighttime sky in \"Oblivion\" and , it is revealed that Secunda, Nirn's smaller moon, revolves around Masser.\nSolar eclipses happen multiple times a year across Nirn. They are known as \"Vampire Days.\"\nAxial tilt and climate.\nIt is never stated, but can safely be assumed, that Nirn's axial tilt is negligible, since &lt;a href=\"Time\"&gt;days and nights&lt;/a&gt; remain more or less the same length throughout the &lt;a href=\"year\"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;, even in the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. There also appears to be minimal variation in climate from &lt;a href=\"month\"&gt;month&lt;/a&gt; to month.\nThe northern regions are frigid. The land of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, far to the north of Skyrim, is said to be primarily a frozen plain. Skyrim, and, by some extension, &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, are typically snowy, especially farther north, towards &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Closer to the equator lies &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, relatively tropical and warm locations.\nWeather.\nSnow and rain are common forms of precipitation on Nirn. Certain areas in northern Tamriel, such as Skyrim and Solstheim, experience rare &lt;a href=\"Aurora\"&gt;Aurora&lt;/a&gt;s, colorful waves of energy in the night sky.\nGeography.\nThe planet has a notably large continent,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, which is where all of activity takes place, with another similarly large continent to the east, named &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. The land masses are separated by the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;, a massive saline body of water.\nThe cold, barren land called &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; is to the north of Tamriel, which is where the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel hailed from. To the west of Tamriel lies &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, which was the former homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel. To the southwest of Tamriel lies &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if these are the only continents, as there are very few maps or globes showing all of Nirn.\n&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nTamriel is geographically diverse: it has mountains, tundras, cold and hot deserts, swampy regions, grasslands, tropical rainforests, and a large volcano. The diversity of biomes is unique as the hot desert is bordered by cold mountains to the north.\nAlso known as \"Dawn's\u00a0Beauty\" in the\u00a0language of the Altmer, Tamriel also has an archipelago of islands called the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, which became the home of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, or \"High Elves,\" after they abandoned their original homeland of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot much is known about Yokuda since it was nearly obliterated in an unknown cataclysmic event, but it seems to have a dull, rocky, hilly, desert landscape. It is known to be the original home to the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; before they rendered it uninhabitable.\n&lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;.\nAtmora is a barren and frozen wasteland. It is this extreme cold that caused the water of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; that separates Tamriel and Atmora to become icy. This frozen land is also where the progenitors of the Nords of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; are originally from, although not many trips back are made.\n&lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext to nothing is known about the geography of Akavir. It is known that the continent is split into four warring kingdoms, each boasting its own race: &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Mo\"&gt;Tang Mo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Ka Po' Tun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;. Akavir is known to have been one of the original homes of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; were originally from Akavir, where they were known as the Dragonguard, but turned to serve &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; in their search for a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;.\nPyandonea is the island-continent located to the far south-west of Tamriel and home to the elusive &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;. The island consists of dense rainforests, which provide shelter for the southern water spirits. Due to its populace being primarily elves, there is speculation that Pyandonea may, in fact, be part of Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThras, also known as the Coral Kingdom, has been a powerful, antagonizing power against the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; since before recorded time. The &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; may at one time have even called Summerset part of Thras.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known about Aldmeris, including if it still exists. The &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; claim that this continent was the birthplace of both elves and mankind.\n&lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Lyg&lt;/a&gt;.\nA parallel version of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; which can only be reached by sliding sideways in some unusual manner, only being entered through its \"non-cardinal\" directions."}

Alchemical research on Nirnroot showed its magical properties, with it fortifying &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, bolstering &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, conjuring protective &lt;a href=\"ward\"&gt;ward&lt;/a&gt;s, and augmenting speed, among other things. It is also said that Nirnroot can be used in a concoction which protects clothing from stains. Additionally, Nirnroot can be brewed into a wine.\nBackground.\nNirnroot can be cultivated under specific circumstances. The juice from &lt;a href=\"Jazbay%20Grapes\"&gt;Jazbay Grapes&lt;/a&gt; is acidic enough to enable the plant to grow. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the sole person known to have cultivated Nirnroot from seed to a full plant was &lt;a href=\"Avrusa%20Sarethi\"&gt;Avrusa Sarethi&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe plant makes a unique chiming noise, and only grows by the water, making it easily recognisable when found in the field. Its leaves are blue-white. Though it is said that Nirnroot do not regrow, there have been times when the plant does regrow.\nIt is said that Nirnroot closer to &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; grow tall and lush, whereas the farther away the plant is, they grow reedier and less hardy. The seed of the Nirnroot can be carried by, birds, among other creatures.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the late-Third Era, the root was said to be extremely rare and nearly extinct within &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial Herbalist Chivius Regelliam claimed that Nirnroot once flourished in the province, until an event weakened their growth. Herbalist Regelliam claimed that the Sun's Death, an eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt; had a devastating aftermath on plantlife, the Nirnroot's lineage being damaged by the sun's exposure being blocked for a full year. The magical nature of the plant made it stand at risk due to the changing climate. During Regelliam's time, the Nirnroot was said to have a yellowish glow, in contrast to their Third Era counterparts, which were had a soft blue-white glow. Conversely, &lt;a href=\"Sinderion\"&gt;Sinderion&lt;/a&gt; tells the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; that Nirnroot does not require sunlight to grow and to consider checking underground when looking for samples.\nWhile the development may or may not have been caused by the Sun's Death, the change of the Nirnroot over time became apparent. Due to the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; researcher Sinderion being the first to tackle Nirnroot research since the days of Regelliam, the reason for the change in the plant is unknown. The researcher claimed that the plant sensed its extinction, and in order to avoid it, changed its nature in order to survive. A notable observation made by associates of Sinderion was that the Nirnroot was now able to grow underground, as opposed to in the sunlight outside.\nSinderion claimed that the reason for this laid in the soil of the plant. While Sinderion supported Regelliam's claim that the Sun's Death had an effect on the Nirnroot, he disagreed in the nature of the effect. The Altmer proposed that the ash that fell from the sky for an entire year mixed with the soil, and due to the magical nature of the Nirnroot, resulted in the aforementioned changes in appearance and areas of growth. Sinderion's claim was based on the fact that &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Salts\"&gt;Ash Salts&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found among the regular ash from Red Mountain, have very potent magical abilities. Because of this, Sinderion proposed further research into the plant before it would go extinct.\nThe inspiration for Sinderion's research was an old tome he had found several years before the Oblivion Crisis. One of the pages of the book provided the recipe for an &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Exploration\"&gt;Elixir of Exploration&lt;/a&gt;. This Elixir, which was specifically made for dungeon delving, required Nirnroot to be crafted. Four versions of the Elixir existed after Sinderion's research was complete, each being stronger than the previous.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrimson Nirnroot are Nirnroot native to &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Limited research on the plant has been performed by the Altmeri researcher Sinderion in the Fourth Era. When Sinderion arrived at Blackreach, his research indicated that the Crimson Nirnroot had a similar affinity for moisture as the regular Nirnroot, while at the same time having a close connection to the large fungi native to Blackreach. Based on this, it is said that the fungi functions as a source of water for the Crimson Nirnroot, providing an ideal enviroment for the plant. In contrast to regular Nirnroot however, the Crimson variant had a much shorter lifespan, and were relatively rare.\nWhile Crimson Nirnroot was a rare plant which few people knew of, the plant was also used in research of the &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Var\"&gt;Tel Var&lt;/a&gt; stones."}

The plant makes a sound somewhat akin to chimes and emits a white glow. The glow is faint in daylight, but very bright\u2014even from a distance\u2014after dark. &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Crimson nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, a cousin to standard nirnroot, also grows abundantly within Skyrim's &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;.

I myself have yet to come across one of the gnarled shoots, as they're rarely in sight of the roads that cross &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. According to the records of the noted &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Herbalist &lt;a href=\"Chivius%20Regelliam\"&gt;Chivius Regelliam&lt;/a&gt;, the Nirnroot once flourished and could be found all over the country, but he suspected a cataclysmic event severely stunted their growth. Although many scholars reject the proposal that the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt; event of &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt; catastrophically affected plant life, Chivius feels that the Nirnroot's lineage was damaged by the lack of sun for a full year. Whereas other plant species tend to \"find a way,\" the Nirnroot's mysterious &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; nature made it especially susceptible to this climate shift. While this may or may not be the case, it's certainly true that the recorded sightings of Nirnroot are declining as the years pass.\nThe most perplexing facet of Chivius's studies is that his notes describe the root as having a yellowish glow. Contrary to this fact, the Nirnroot of today has a soft bluish or blue-white glow. Unfortunately, since not many studies of the Nirnroot were performed from Chivius's day until now, it's unknown when or why this occurred. What I'm proposing today is that the Nirnroot, even though merely a plant, sensed impending extinction and therefore changed its own nature to survive. One of the more obvious facets of today's Nirnroot that supports this theory is the fact that it can now survive underground without any sunlight at all. While it's true that generally only mosses and fungi grow in these environments, I have two signed depositions by persons claiming that they sighted the Nirnroot in deep caves. Not once in Chivius's copious notes is a subterranean Nirnroot mentioned. But how could this be? How could a surface dwelling plant suddenly begin appearing in new locations radically different from its normal habitat?\nThe answer, my fellow alchemists, is nestled within Chivius's own notes. Although he spends a great deal of time with the Nirnroot in his laboratory, the one thing he neglected to test at a high enough level of detail was the soil. As stated previously, Chivius felt that the Sun's Death, the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, contributed to the demise of the Nirnroot. Agreed. My amendment to that proposal is that the ash that fell from the sky that entire year mixed with the soil, and again, due to the magical nature of the root, contributed to the aforementioned changes. The ash became a catalyst of sorts, forcing a change in the very makeup of the Nirnroot. Although very little ash from that dark time remains, I have done tests on newer ash samples sent to me from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. They show little to no magical properties, certainly none of which could affect a plant to that magnitude. However, the rare occurrence of what's known as &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Salt\"&gt;Ash Salt&lt;/a&gt; in the normal ash does contain very potent magical abilities. In fact, some native &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; are said to harness that ability to create a cure for the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;, which pervaded their realm many years ago. I feel this magic, meshed with the Nirnroot's inherent magic caused the radical change... in essence; the root \"healed itself.\"\nTo surmise, my two proposals are certainly linked. The plant needed to survive, and therefore used a byproduct of its destructor to do so. No other plant in nature has ever come close to this metamorphosis. I feel the Nirnroot has accomplished in a relatively short amount of time what it would take other species millions of years to complete.\nWhatever the case may be, one thing is certain; the Nirnroot is on a path to destruction. It contains untapped potential to create potions the likes of which have never been seen in our day. I propose to you today that we divert a small portion of our funds to an expedition to collect some of these roots to study. I have outlined this proposal for your perusal after this section of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Symposium\"&gt;Symposium&lt;/a&gt;. Please, seriously consider this proposal before it becomes too late, and the Nirnroot becomes nothing but a memory.\nThank you for your time."}

She will then suggest they travel to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and speak to &lt;a href=\"Olava%20the%20Feeble\"&gt;Olava the Feeble&lt;/a&gt;. Olava the Feeble is usually seen outside her house sitting on the bench during the day. When approached and told that the Dragonborn has a token for her, she proceeds to tell them their fortune:\n\"Come to Olava for a reading, did you? Sorry, pup, but I'm not quite in the mood.\"\nShe tells of a cave that is home for the Dragonborn (\"a sanctuary\"), with family, but that there will be \"so much blood.\" Then she mentions Deepwood Redoubt, which is \"ripe for the plunder\". Through there is Hag's End, a place where a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; member can be found. If the Dragonborn attempts to speak to Olava again, she will simply say: \"By Sithis, but you are a persistent one. Haven't I told you enough?\".\nOn the way through Deepwood Redoubt, several &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; are encountered. Beyond, in Deepwood Vale, there are more Forsworn in a camp. Finally, up multiple sets of stairs leading east, there is &lt;a href=\"Hag%27s%20End\"&gt;Hag's End&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Witch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;witches&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt; are fought. Three more witches are encountered in the throne room of Hag's End. The door behind the throne can be opened by activating the handle.\nInside the secret room the dead &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; Assassin, named the Dark Brotherhood Assassin, can be found. By looting his corpse the &lt;a href=\"ancient%20shrouded%20armor\"&gt;ancient shrouded armor&lt;/a&gt; is gained. Additionally, there is a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; behind him containing more treasure. Further through the gates is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; shout."}

The area that is able to be explored is estimated to be 16 square miles; unlike &lt;a href=\"cities\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;, locations must be discovered before one can &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; to them. For more information on traveling throughout the country, see &lt;a href=\"Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Travel&lt;/a&gt;.\nMap locations.\nFor a list of locations for each type, see its main article. You are able to fast travel back and forth to the following locations once you first discover them.\nAyleid Ruins.\nAyleid Ruins are ancient structures built by an ancient race of elves known as the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. Besides the usual &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; that inhabit the ruin, these ruins usually contain Ayleid casks and reliquaries, several &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt;, and occasionally some rare &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, secret passages, and special magical towers known as &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Dark Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s that shoot out balls of magicka as you pass by.\nCamps.\nMany small camps are scattered throughout Cyrodiil. They usually contain a bed or two, a chest, and a few &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;marauders&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaves.\nCaves often wind underground and may have multiple levels. Most simply contain a few barrels and &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt;, a variety of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; if occupied by &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;NPCs&lt;/a&gt;. Caves usually are abundant in &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20Stalk\"&gt;Wisp Stalk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Cairn%20Bolete\"&gt;Cairn Bolete&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaedric Shrines.\nDaedric Shrines are scattered across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and are a means of communication with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;. They offer &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;, but some require you to be above a certain level and/or to give an offering. The rewards from these quests are &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts\"&gt;powerful items and weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nForts.\nForts are ancient defensive structures, built most likely during the late First Era to protect the land from foreigners such as &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaders (a likely explanation, since the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lifting%20the%20Vale\"&gt;Lifting the Vale&lt;/a&gt;\" implies an Akaviri attack on such a fort long ago).\nMines.\nMines are man-made underground caverns built for harvesting &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ore\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandmarks.\nLandmarks are usually geographic points of interest, such as a mountain peaks, gardens, cemeteries, or bridges, and most do not have a fast travel location to them and must be reached on foot or horseback.\nOblivion Gates.\nOblivion Gates are the gates to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s realm. Once the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; is delivered to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; is visited during the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; will open around &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nSettlements.\nSettlements can be places such as farms and smaller towns, without the full services of a large city, such as inns, armorers or weapon shops.\nTaverns/Stables.\nTaverns are convenient places to rest in the wilderness from one's adventures, there are side quests involved with many of the taverns.\nStables are often located outside major cities and are a place to leave your horse as you shop the city.\nOther locations.\nThese locations have &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;no map marker&lt;/a&gt; and must be found by direction or exploration.\nDoomstones.\nThere are twenty-one doomstones scattered across Cyrodiil. Thirteen of these monoliths are named after the &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsigns&lt;/a&gt;, while the other eight are believed to be named after long forgotten cults.\nRune Stones.\nRune Stones are slightly different than doomstones in that they offer &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bound Items&lt;/a&gt; to those that use them. They do not offer powers gained by the doomstones but their conjured weaponry can be valuable in a fight.\nWayshrines.\nWayshrines are shrines to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; in the wilderness. Making pilgrimages to these shrines bestows a blessing on the character, and allows the player to receive the same blessing from city &lt;a href=\"chapels\"&gt;chapels&lt;/a&gt;. Pilgrimages to all nine wayshrines gives the ultimate blessing of the nine, the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Pilgrim's Grace&lt;/a&gt;. Wayshrines are not marked on the world map, and so they cannot be fast traveled to."}

Locations include such places as events, cities, towns, services, ruins, dungeons and more.\nTypes.\nPoints of Interest.\nBattlefields.\nBattlefields are locations throughout Tamriel in which a historic conflict was fought or is an active area of battle. Historic battlefields, such as &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;, serve as the site of a battle often pivotal to the events of an associated quest. Others, such as &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;, are places that are subject to an ongoing battle.\nBeacons.\nBeacons are tall structures throughout Tamriel used variously for navigation and defense. Beacons such as lighthouses can be found along the coasts of various &lt;a href=\"zones\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt; close to coastal cities and towns, while beacons such as watchtowers can be found along borders. Some locations, such as &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Wilderking%20Court\"&gt;Wilderking Court&lt;/a&gt;, are considered beacons since they feature prominent towers.\nCamps.\nCamps are small settled areas that serve as temporary holdings for their residents. Camps may be part of a mobile military force or civilians such as those displaced by war or hunters, bandits and wilderness laborers. Camps may either be neutral to the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, even offering services, or may be populated by enemies.\nCaves.\nCaves are subterranean structures throughout Tamriel. They are distinct from Delves and other dungeons as they may or may not have associated quests or even any inhabitants. Caves also include artificially dug structures and secluded locations away from civilized areas.\nCemeteries.\nCemeteries are locations throughout Tamriel in which the dead are buried or otherwise interred. They are distinct from crypts in that they are less structured and typically do not include extensive interiors. Cemeteries may include graveyards and simple burial monuments.\nCities.\nCities are major settlements that feature a wide range of services. They are highly urbanized with a larger than average population of residents. Cities will always feature various facilities and services including &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crafting stations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"guild%20traders\"&gt;guild traders&lt;/a&gt;. The story quests of many zones often center around its cities.\nCrypts.\nCrypts are locations throughout Tamriel used to inter the dead, and are more elaborately built than cemeteries. They often include extensive interiors and sublocations and are used as the burial sites of those dead who were more prominent and powerful in life such as those belonging to royal families.\nDaedric Ruins.\nDaedric Ruins are structures throughout Tamriel that were built for the Daedra, usually in worship to a particular &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;prince&lt;/a&gt;, and are constructed in the typical Daedric architectural style. Daedric Ruins serve as a type of Point of Interest in which self-contained quests are featured.\nDark Anchors.\nDark Anchors, known also as Dolmens and classified as 'World Events,' are ritual sites where the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; performs sacrificial rituals to summon Dark Anchors from Coldharbour. Once activated, the Dark Anchor will transport invading Daedra that must be defeated. Each round allows a pinion to be activated leading to a final &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Online%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; that, once defeated, will allow the Anchor to be destroyed.\nDocks.\nDocks are coastal locations, usually near or adjacent to populated areas that facilitate trade and travel via bodies of water across Tamriel. Some Docks feature &lt;a href=\"boatswain\"&gt;boatswain&lt;/a&gt;s that can be used to travel to zones closely connected across bodies of water. Docks may serve as Points of Interest with self-contained quests.\nDwemer Ruins.\nDwemer Ruins are largely subterranean city-like structures left by the Dwemer since their disappearance. Almost all Dwemer Ruins will contain left-behind hostile &lt;a href=\"Animunculi%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt;. Dwemer Ruins will always be associated with another quest or serve as its own Point of Interest with a self-contained quest unrelated to any others.\nElven Ruins.\nElven Ruins are structures constructed by the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. These ruins lie deserted by their original owners or are occupied the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; or outlaws. Such ruins can be found in all parts of Tamriel, but most prominent are those belonging to the Ayleids found from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nEstates.\nEstates are different areas located away from cities. They are characterised by a large central building which can be surrounded by walls or other smaller buildings.\nFarms.\nFarms are agricultural areas with a small population and few structures. They often feature vast farmlands and pastured animals. Many Farms marked on the map are Points of Interest or are associated with an external quest. Farms that are not marked on the map will not usually be significant to any quest.\nForts.\nForts are fortified locations throughout Tamriel. They can be both military structures for defence, though separate from Gates and Keeps, as well as civilian populated areas with heavy fortifications such as &lt;a href=\"Southpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;. Keeps outside of Cyrodiil are fundamentally different from those in Cyrodiil as they do not have any strategic value to any campaign and are non-destructible.\nGates.\nGates are defensive structures typically built on the borders of zones or provinces. They may either be guarded by local soldiers or deserted and defunct. Gates may be related to an external quest or have their own as a Point of Interest. Gates outside of Cyrodiil are distinct from those within as Gates in Cyrodiil serve a strategic purpose in campaigns.\nGreat Lift.\nGreat Lifts are structures found throughout &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; connecting &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; and the surface.\nWorld Bosses.\nWorld Bosses are locations throughout Tamriel that feature a difficult &lt;a href=\"Boss%20%28Online%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; to defeat. Bosses may have unique mechanics and abilities or be typical of a regular enemy class, and will always have significantly more health and deal more damage than any other enemy in the zone. They are comparable in difficulty to normal level Group Dungeon bosses. Bosses will drop &lt;a href=\"item%20sets\"&gt;item sets&lt;/a&gt; associated with the zone they are located in when defeated.\nGroves.\nGroves are floral areas of significance throughout Tamriel. They are typically natural places with features distinct from their surrounding environment. Groves may include forested areas, marshes, bodies of water, and areas with unusual geography. Groves often serve as Points of Interest with self-contained quests. \nHouses.\nHouses are locations that are available to the Vestige to purchase with or and can be either furnished or unfurnished. They have various thematic architecture and environments, and vary in size from single rooms to extensive manors. Houses can be decorated with crafted or bought furnishings as well as collectible items.\nMines.\nMines are locations throughout Tamriel used by various settlements to extract minerals and other resources. They are often Points of Interest with associated quests and are similar in design and layout to caves.\nMundus Stones.\nMundus Stones are standing stones Tamriel that give the Vestige a passive bonus once activated. The effects do not expire, but only one can be acquired at a time. There are thirteen bonuses corresponding to the thirteen birthsigns and each Alliance area has all thirteen stones within their zones. Cyrodiil also has all thirteen throughout the map. Functional Mundus Stones can be purchased with as furnishing for houses.\nMuseums.\nMuseums are unique locations that serve as displays for special thematic items collected by the Vestige. Museums include the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Orsimer%20Glories\"&gt;House of Orsimer Glories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Histories\"&gt;House of Histories&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Online%20Location%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt;, each is associated with a quest to find and restore items to the museum.\nRuins.\nRuins are defunct structures abandoned by their creators. Regular Ruins are distinct from Daedric, Dwemer or Elven Ruins as they are more generic and not universally associated with any particular civilization or architectural style. Ruins may be inhabited by enemies and also serve as a Point of Interest with an associated quest.\nSet Stations.\nSet stations are locations throughout Tamriel that include a &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing%20station\"&gt;blacksmithing station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"clothing%20station\"&gt;clothing station&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"woodworking%20station\"&gt;woodworking station&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"jewelry%20station\"&gt;jewelry station&lt;/a&gt;. Distinct from generic crafting stations, Set Stations are used to craft items as part of a item set with unique effects. Crafted sets can be made in any style, material and trait just as any crafted item can be. Set Stations are often found in the the wilds of zones rather than populated areas.\nSewers.\nSewers are subterranean locations typically connected to and running underneath a city or other populated area. Sewers are typically Points of Interest with an associated quest and may be populated with enemies. Although Outlaws Refuges may take the appearance of sewers, they are not classified as such. Cities such as &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; have extensive sewers.\nShips.\nShips can be found in regions with access to open water. They are usually located near ports and piers.\nStriking Locales.\nStriking Locales are unique places throughout Tamriel that feature interesting vistas and places or note. They are not Points of Interest, as they do not have self-contained quests and only serve as ambient locations to the zone. Striking Locales vary immensely from natural formations to created structures with distinct features.\nTowns.\nTowns are small populated locations throughout Tamriel. Although they are considerably smaller than cities, they often feature some services and merchants including bankers and crafting stations. Like cities, towns will be guarded but will not have an Outlaws Refuge to escape to.

All banks share a universal inventory, are inaccessible to others, and have their own capacity limit separate from regular bag space that can be upgraded individually.\nBoatswains and caravans.\nBoatswains and caravans offer travel services to transport the Vestige from one location to another. They are useful for accessing non-adjacent zones that have not already been discovered. Boatswains and caravans only offer specific locations to travel to, and so are not viable for regular place-to-place travel in the same manner as wayshrines.\nBrewers, chefs and cooking fires.\nBrewers, chefs and cooking fires are provisioning related merchants and services. Brewers and chefs sell various &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Online%29\"&gt;beverages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Online%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; respectively, as well as &lt;a href=\"Recipes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt;.

There is a maximum number items that can be sold and laundered each day.\nFurnishers.\nFurnishers are merchants that sell furnishings for homes.

Like all merchants, furnishers will buy any sellable item for the same price as other merchants and will repair damage armor for a fee.\nGuild kiosks.\nGuild kiosks are stalls operated by a unique merchant that can be acquired by a &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; to publicly sell items form that guild's store. Anyone can buy from a kiosk, but only members of the guild can sell items in the store. Kiosks are sold to the guild that bids the most for it, and are up for bidding once a month. A guild cannot have more than one kiosk.\nTavern.\nTaverns are locations throughout Tamriel typically located in towns and cities. Taverns will usually have one or more brewer and chef for beverage and food services as well as a provisioning station.\nJewelers and jewelry crafting stations.\nJewelers are merchants that sell jewelry and jewelry crafting materials including trait and plating materials.

Pieces of equipment can also be deconstructed at a clothing station.\nShrines.\nShrines are special services that allow the Vestige to alter their stats. Rededication shrines allow the vestige to reset their &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; while a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20to%20Mara\"&gt;Shrine to Mara&lt;/a&gt; will allow the Vestige and another to perform the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Ritual of Mara&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmithies and blacksmithing stations.\nSmithies are merchants that sell heavy armor and melee weapons as the nine style materials for each race.

Pieces of equipment can also be deconstructed at a blacksmithing station.\nStablemasters and stables.\nStablemasters are special merchants sell &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt; and offer horse training. Stablemasters can increase the speed, stamina and bag capacity bonus of horses for a fee once every day up to a maximum of sixty times for each category. Training applies to all horses on a single character, but does not affect horses for different characters on the same account. Stablemasters can be found at stables near the entries and exits of cities.\nTransmutation stations.\nTransmutation stations allow the Vestige to change the trait of an item for the cost of fifty &lt;a href=\"transmutation%20crystals\"&gt;transmutation crystals&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige can only carry a maximum of one-hundred crystals, or two-hundred with &lt;a href=\"ESO%20Plus\"&gt;ESO Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Only one transmutation station exist without purchasing one for a home, located in the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. \nWoodworkers and woodworking stations.\nWoodworkers are merchants that sell shields, bows and staffs as well as the nine style materials for each race.

Delves are instanced like regular zones, meaning that multiple people can enter a participate in delve without grouping. The difficulty of Delves is designed to be completable by a single person. The boss of a Delve will drop item sets for the zone they are in.\nEvent Hubs.\nEvents are timed themes that offer unique rewards for participation and extra experience. Events include the gothic-themed &lt;a href=\"Witches%27%20Festival\"&gt;Witches' Festival&lt;/a&gt;, player versus player-themed &lt;a href=\"Midyear%20Mayhem%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Midyear Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;, and new year-themed &lt;a href=\"New%20Life%20Festival%20%28Online%29\"&gt;New Life Festival&lt;/a&gt;.

Dungeons have a normal and hard difficulty that determines the health and damage dealt by enemies. On veteran difficulty, the final boss has an optional hard mode, further increasing the difficulty.\nPublic Dungeons.\nPublic Dungeons are similar to delves but are designed for groups. They feature multiple bosses as well as a group challenge and two associated quests. Like delves, Public Dungeons share a single instance, allowing anyone to enter at any time with anyone else. Public Dungeon bosses offer item sets associate with the zone they are in. Most zones only have a single Public Dungeon.\nTrials.\nTrials are long 'raid'-like dungeons featuring many bosses and difficult enemies throughout a large location. Trials are designed for groups of no more than twelve and feature normal and veteran difficulties. In trials, enemies are numerous and bosses are skilled with unique mechanics that require teamwork and coordination from group members. Trials offer unique and powerful rewards, particularly item sets and &lt;a href=\"crafting%20motifs\"&gt;crafting motifs&lt;/a&gt;.\nFactions.\nFighters Guildhalls.\nFighters Guildhalls function as regional headquarters for members of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and includes &lt;a href=\"Armorers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armorers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armsmen\"&gt;armsmen&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"hall%20steward\"&gt;hall steward&lt;/a&gt;.

It is not necessary to be a member of the Mages Guild to buy and sell from Guildhall merchants. Some Mages Guildhalls also provide consumable crafting stations. Guildhalls can be found in most major cities.\nOutlaws Refuges.\nOutlaws Refuges are hidden underground sanctuaries that provide protection and services for criminals. Outlaws refuges feature general merchants as well as fences and &lt;a href=\"moneylender\"&gt;moneylender&lt;/a&gt;s to sell, launder and bank stolen items. All major cities have an a=outlaws refuge with an entrance in the city and another on the outskirts.\nUndunated Enclaves.\nUndaunted Enclaves serve as the three main headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt;, with one located in the capital city of each Alliance: &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Enclaves provide daily pledge quests and unique items such as shoulder pieces for monster item sets.\nCyrodiil.\nBorder Keeps.\nBorder Keeps are the six main bases of the three &lt;a href=\"Alliances\"&gt;Alliances&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Each Alliance maintains two Keeps on the border of their territory in Cyrodiil and their territory proper, and each features essential services including merchants, crafting stations, stables, and a wayshrine and &lt;a href=\"Transitus%20Shrine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Transitus Shrine&lt;/a&gt;. All Alliance members enter a campaign from either one of their Alliance's Keeps which are the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Elsweyr%20Gate\"&gt;Eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Western%20Elsweyr%20Gate\"&gt;Western Elsweyr Gate&lt;/a&gt;s for the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20High%20Rock%20Gate\"&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20High%20Rock%20Gate\"&gt;Southern High Rock Gate&lt;/a&gt;s for the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Morrowind%20Gate\"&gt;Northern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Morrowind%20Gate\"&gt;Southern Morrowind Gate&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. These Keeps cannot be captured, nor can members of other Alliances enter them.\nImperial City.\nThe Imperial City sits at the centre of Cyrodiil and is contested by the three Alliances. The City contains six districts; the &lt;a href=\"Arboretum%20District%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arena%20District%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Gardens%20District%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elven Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20District\"&gt;Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20District\"&gt;Nobles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Temple%20District%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; Districts; and each are independently fought over for &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Points\"&gt;Alliance Points&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Var%20Stones\"&gt;Tel Var Stones&lt;/a&gt;. The City is directly connected to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City Sewers&lt;/a&gt; beneath it as well as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Prison%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City Prison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial City acts as its own player versus player campaign separate from the rest of Cyrodiil.\nImperial City Sewers.\nThe Imperial City Sewers is a vast underground network of tunnels, and while primarily occupied by &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliances fight each other for access to the Districts above. The three Alliances each operate a base from each corner to manage command and control of operations within the Imperial City. The Sewers, similar to zones, feature various sublocations including locales and group bosses.\nKeeps.\nKeeps are fortified locations in Cyrodiil that determine the total area control an Alliance has. The more Keeps and Alliance owns, the more Alliance Points, experience, bonuses members of that Alliance receives. Control of Keeps is necessary to maintain effective an Transitus Network, allow access to hostile &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Online%29\"&gt;temples&lt;/a&gt; and crown an &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Each Keep also has a mine, a farm and a lumbermill. Each resource grants bonuses for the Keep's owner the longer they are held and allows Transitus Shrine travel from connected locations.\nMilegates.\nMilegates are nine fortified structures throughout Cyrodiil that demarcate the borders of each Alliance's starting territory. These structures can only be crossed if they have not been destroyed by siege weaponry, otherwise other Milegates or crossings must be used. Milegates can be repaired with kits from Alliance siegemasters. Three Bridges along the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben River&lt;/a&gt; act as Milegates between Dominion and Pact territory, while the other six are forts between Pact and Dominion, and Covenant and Dominion territory. The areas between Milegates are inaccessible, with the exception of small paths and crossings. Destroying Milegates can thus provide the advantage of slowing advancing armies and forcing them through preferred paths.\nOutposts.\nOutposts are minor fortifications; of which there are six in total, two in each Alliance's territory; that provide their holders with additional Transitus Network links aside from those of keeps. This allows Alliances to utilize travel via the Transitus Network beyond Milegates without having to hold better defended keeps. Due to their small size, Outposts can be easily captured, even by small groups, due to minimal guards, weak doors and no walls.\nTemple Gates.\nTemple Gates are fortifications that protect temples from hostile attacks. They are heavily defended and can only be opened after the two adjacent keeps have been taken by the same hostile Alliance. Once the gate is open, its respective temple and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; within becomes vulnerable to incursion.\nTemples.\nTemples are fortified buildings beyond the temple gates that house Elder Scrolls. Each Alliance begins a campaign with two Elder Scrolls kept within one of the two temples. A temple becomes vulnerable if its respective gate is opened when the two adjacent keeps are occupied by the same hostile Alliance. Only one Elder Scroll can be kept in a temple at any one time. Other Scrolls must be kept in keeps outside the temples gates.\nTowns.\nTowns are settled areas in Cyrodiil that can be captured by Alliances to provide them with an additional Transitus Network location as well as a safehouse featuring merchants with unique items to sell. Towns feature three flags, all of which must be captured for the town to change ownership. Guards specific to each Alliance will defend the town when it is captured. Towns in Cyrodiil are also hubs for repeatable quests, though it is not necessary to capture the town to complete them.\nCraglorn.\nGroup variants.\nCraglorn features several distinct location subtypes. They are marked by a \"plus\" symbol on their icon. The difference between the normal and the group locations in Craglorn is that they are more difficult and are designed for groups of two or more people, though solo adventurers may still complete them. They are a leftover from the concept of &lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Zones\"&gt;adventure zones&lt;/a&gt;, which were discarded in &lt;a href=\"Update%2012\"&gt;Update 12&lt;/a&gt;.\nZones.\nZones, also called regions, are segregated areas of Tamriel that divide the playable map and separate content both narratively and visually. Locations within each zone are detailed on their respective pages."}

Lockpicking can be accomplished by chance or manually. Lockpicking requires having at least one &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt; in the inventory. Without a &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;, even the lowest level locks will require magic or a key to open.\nSecurity.\nThe ability to pick a lock is controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Stealth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; skill, &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the level in Security is raised, the number of tumblers that remain locked in place when a pick breaks increase in the following manner:\nPicking a lock.\nDepending on the difficulty of the lock, there can be anywhere from 1\u20135 tumblers in the 'down' position of a lock. Moving the pick left or right will select what tumbler the player will work on. Moving the tumbler up will result in attempting to place the tumbler. While moving the tumbler in place the character must \"set\" the tumbler in place when it reaches the top of the lock. When the tumbler is pushed up a slight \"tink\" sound will be heard once it reaches the top of the lock. When the sound is heard set the tumbler.\u00a0If the timing is not correct, the pick will break and the tumbler will fall. Skill level will determine how many additional tumblers will drop if a pick is broken. Once all the tumblers are set, the lock will open. It is important to note that the speed the pin slides at varies for each push, and can be quite tough to time correctly when it moves quickly, regardless of security level. The easiest way to combat this is to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile lockpicking, a pattern will develop with the tumblers rising and falling. If a pattern is recognized, one can easily set the tumbler when it reaches the top of the lock. One technique is to recognize the pattern of when the tumbler rises slow and falls slow. This will give the most time to set the tumbler.\nAnother technique is to recognize the pattern for when the tumbler rises and falls at its fastest rate. In these two cases it comes down to preferences of the player.\nThe in-game book \"&lt;a href=\"Advances%20in%20Lockpicking\"&gt;Advances in Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt;\" recommends holding a torch close to the lock while picking it. (Having a torch equipped when you approach the lock to pick it.) Heating the lock is supposed to make all the pins fall at a uniform rate. Unfortunately, this practice does not work in game.\nAuto-attempt.\nAuto-attempt is a chance game of unlocking the lock depending on the difficulty level of the lock and the &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; skill. The lock either opens or the pick breaks. Simply continue pressing Auto-Attempt until the lock successfully opens.\nIf your security level is low (relative to the lock difficulty), picks will break more often. However, auto-attempt is a chance so it is possible to unlock the lock on the first try.\u00a0\nA technique for auto-attempt is to have as many lockpicks as possible. If the player has a large quantity of lockpicks one can repeatedly hit auto-attempt until the lock opens. This will also raise the &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; skill faster.\nOne of the best techniques for lockpicking is to complete the quest given at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shrine of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. The reward given is the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;, which is an unbreakable lockpick. With the Skeleton Key, the player can repeatedly hit auto-attempt without running out of lockpicks. The Skeleton Key also increases the security skill by 40 points, increasing the chance of a successful pick.\nAlternatives.\nLockpicking can also be accomplished by &lt;a href=\"Open%20Lock\"&gt;Open Lock&lt;/a&gt; spells, based on &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;. Magicka regenerates for free, so this is often a cheaper/faster alternative to lock-picking by hand. Open Very Hard Lock spells do not seem to exist at vendors but can be made at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;."}

If pushed too long, a spring will reset and revert to its default position. Lockpicks have a small chance of breaking each time a pin fails to be put in place. There is a set amount of time (depending on Lockpicking level and the level of the lock itself), and if unsuccessfully completed in this time, will result in the chest being locked for a set amount of time before it can be retried. Players can still be attacked by hostile Characters and enemy players while lockpicking.\nThere is also a Force Lock option which functions similarly to the Auto Attempt mechanic in \"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\".\nLeveling.\nThe Lockpicking skill advances every time the player levels, meaning that locks which were once very difficult to open gradually become much easier.

To open locks, the Dragonborn must feel for the correct tumbler position with a &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt; while turning a tension wrench in the lock. Caution should be used, as the lockpick will break if too much pressure is applied while it is in the wrong position. The higher the level of the lock, the less pressure allowed before the pick breaks. Taking certain &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; in this skill will widen the correct tumbler position for picks, making locks easier to open. \nLockpicking is also used to remove traps on items such as doors and containers. Said traps look like a wire leading down from the trapped object to the floor. Activating the wire engages the same lockpicking minigame as with locks. Note that objects in Skyrim can be locked or trapped, but never both.\nLeveling.\nUnlike many other skills, failure grants advancement. In fact, each time a lockpick is broken, the skill goes up an amount smaller than successfully picking the lock. One way to level the skill is to obtain a large number of picks and deliberately break them in a master lock.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Museum\"&gt;Dwemer Museum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt; contains many locked display cases to unlock. A high sneak level is recommended to avoid the guards in the museum, since entering the area is considered trespassing. The Jarl chambers also contain cases, most of which offer hard-to-pick locks.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Lockpicking skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Lockpicking skill:\nPerks.\nThe following perks become available as the skill levels up:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nLockpicks.\nLockpicks are easily obtained, as almost all merchants carry at least one of them.

And I do mean everywhere, dear reader, as they were wild and hostile, covering the floors and a even a few unfortunate corpses. This horrific sight of beauty was soon ruined by the choking air. Thick, toxic pollen floated everywhere, spewed out by the various flowers. Perhaps the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; had allergies to surface flora, and saw spring as nothing more than a season of suffering. While the mercenaries coughed and vomited from the effects, my strong constitution allowed me to notice strange &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt; shambling through the artificial forests.

But the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; had predicted such superheat, indeed no doubt this unbearable weather was undoubtedly what summer meant to them. Even as I pulled myself through the swelter, I noticed &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;repair spiders&lt;/a&gt; darting to and fro, ignoring me and heading into side sections, which revealed great levers.

Strange fruits and grains grew in plots, while emaciated &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt; ran about all the while tended by massive double-bladed centurions. Did the Dwemer find it amusing that the surface-peoples had a whole season dedicated just to harvest, or did they do this as a mockery to some forgotten god of the feast? Whatever the case, I aimed to examine a piece of this Dwarven history for myself.\nThough the fruit smelled delicious, it was as hard as a rock, and the insides glowed with a foul light. Yet as dense as the harvest was, I observed the bladed centurions cutting through it with little effort and carrying them off to a hopper at the far end of the fields. While no doubt the blades of these machines would make short work of flesh and armor, my men nevertheless valiantly served as a distraction as I carried the heavy wheat over to the depository, hoping these offerings would satiate whatever freakish endeavors the Dwarves had begun, and gain me access to the rest of the farms."}

Yet they were not mountains, but great towering silos of frozen water. And the cold! Not even the highest mountains compared to such chills, and we were soon trading furs amongst ourselves to stay warm! Yet just as soon as the wind had picked up, it died down, the temperature dropping and the icy waters unfreezing, yet still cold. It became clear that if I was to progress through these silos, I would have to take advantage of the variable chill, quickly crossing through paths formed by the ice floes as impromptu bridges.

It was at that moment Gable gave me the signal and we struck. He'd always had an eye for the Captain's position, and with the chaos going on, this was a better time than any. Only that idiot, Blakeley was still loyal to the Captain, but the rest of us wanted the May. The fight lasted maybe a minute or two. Blakeley and Laughton knew that fighting was futile. We tossed them down below and now Captain Gable has set the May on course for the inlet. Hopefully we can get her secured for a while and then..."}

Lokir was about to steal a horse and escape to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, when he was caught in an ambush set up by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt; in order to capture &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and his top men. During the ride to Helgen, Lokir berates &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, for causing so much trouble that the Imperials caught him riding towards Hammerfell when the soldiers were looking for Stormcloaks. He then tells the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who was caught in the same ambush and is also among the prisoners on the cart, that neither of them should be here, only to be told that all of them are now \"brothers and sisters in binds.\"\nWhen he finds out that he is riding with Ulfric, and therefore will be executed along with the others in the cart, Lokir becomes terrified and desperately tries to tell the Imperials that he is not a Stormcloak. However, his pleas fall on deaf ears, with Ralof telling him to face his death with some courage, and he is ordered to the chopping block. In a final bid for survival, Lokir attempts to flee the execution, only to be shot down by Imperial archers.\nConversations.\nRalof: \"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there.\"\nLokir: \"Damn you Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along.

It is quite basic in appearance and follows a straight bow design. It is the lightest bow available, thus its draw speed is the fastest, though this is offset by its low damage. It is the only type of bow in the game that does not vibrate in the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; hand when shot.\nIf a Long Bow is improved to a greater quality with a high &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; skill and wielded with a high Archery skill with good &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, its damage output per second becomes greater than most other bows due to its fast draw speed.

Bows with a quick draw speed provide better value from the perks that increase damage as a percentage, such as 'Power Shot' and 'Bullseye,' compared to bows that are slower to draw. These bows, however, provide less value from damage-per-shot based &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; attack bonuses and the sneak skill 'Deadly Aim.'\nSmithing.\nThe Long Bow can be upgraded with a piece of &lt;a href=\"firewood\"&gt;firewood&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, however, it does not benefit from any &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Smithing perks&lt;/a&gt;.

Bazrag wishes to honor the memory of the Kurog he once knew, and speaks with the Vestige over doing so in &lt;a href=\"Scarp%20Keep\"&gt;Scarp Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"This last favor is of a more personal nature. I want to give Kurog a proper funeral, to honor him for the warrior and leader he was and not the crazed despot he turned out to be.\"\nChief Bazrag may then be questioned for more information:\nThe Vestige must then hand out letters to those involved with the late Kurog gro-Bagrakh.\n\"Tusk off! I've got no time for beggars or dishonest traders and I'm in the mood to throw someone into the river. So walk away before we find out if you can swim.\"\n\"Well I'll be a harpy's uncle! I never expected to see you here.\"\n\"Are you a sight for sore eyes! What brings you to the arse end of Malacath's wasteland? No, you don't have to answer that. I can guess why you're here. This is just the kind of place that attracts people like you. You can't help yourself.\"\n\"The high priestess used to study here. Read her books. Write her sermons. Now she's gone, and it feels like I've got a hole the size of Elden Root right in the middle of my chest.\"\n\"I don't think you should be here. I don't want any more trouble. I heard the king was dead and I'm sure you had something to do with it, so leave us out of it.\"\n\"I'm going to miss this place. The temple has become a more somber place since the death of the high priestess. Solgra was a good woman. She cared about our people and hoped to spread Trinimac's word. I know she also considered you to be her friend.\"\n\"I'm glad you're here. Saves me the trouble of finding you. Before I return to the Summerset Isles, I wanted to thank you for not killing me back at the Vosh Rakh temple. I appreciate that. I think I would have found death to be very boring.\"\n\"I'm glad to see that life still courses through your body. I'd be extremely out of sorts if you turned up dead. And I heard what happened. You have my thanks for keeping Chief Bazrag safe. I'd be even more upset if my husband had died.\"\nAfter all letters of invitation have been delivered, the Vestige must travel to the King's Cornerclub, the late Kurog's favorite tavern, located east of the &lt;a href=\"Rime%20Hammer%20Forge\"&gt;Rime Hammer Forge&lt;/a&gt;. There, they must acquire Kurog's favorite ale, delivered by Roxanne.\n\"No sad faces. Not in here. This was Kurog's happy place, and that's how it's going to stay! To Kurog! To Orsinium! May the city always remember the kind and gentle king who cared for his people. Everything else... that was his mother's fault.\"\nThe Vestige had acquired Kurog's favorite ale and had notified all of the appropriate people of the funeral. The final destination of their quest would be the Castle Overlook of Scarp Keep, where the funeral would be held. The Castle Overlook is reachable from the main hall of Scarp Keep, to the left of doors of the throne room.\nChief Bazrag: \"Old friends, I'm glad to see you. This... is very important to me.\"\nBumnog: \"I'm just sorry I missed all the action. It looks like you could've used another hand or two.\"\nBizra: \"Bumnog and hands. I think it's an obsession.\"\n\"Thank you for gathering everyone. It's important that they're all here to see what happens next.\"\n\"Today tests our resolve. We have lost friends, allies. And the one responsible for all this, we've gathered to honor him.\"\n\"Some of you question the wisdom of that, but we need to see the Orsimer in a new light. We need to respect and honor each other. That starts today!\"\n\"Even a good Orc can fall prey to ill-conceived notions. We need to bury the past with the king and look to the future.\"\n\"Outsider, step forward. Your help has been invaluable and I want you to be a part of this. Please, light the first torch.\"\nThe Vestige must then lit the two torches of the funeral in order.\n\"We ignite these fires to remember Kurog's true goal\u2015unity for the Orsimer people.\"\n\"Instead, we have clans without chiefs, a city without a king.

Strong, confident. A king who cared about his people. We will carry on that legacy, offering help but never forcing it upon anyone.\"\n\"Much to my regret, the clan chiefs have asked me to take on the mantle of king of the Orsimer. To this request, I have cautiously agreed.\"\n\"We cannot be seen as weak and leaderless to the rest of the world. I shall uphold Kurog's dream but I will avoid his ambition.

Or do you have another destination in mind?\"\nFlies-In-Wind: \"As long as it's not here, I'll go wherever the current takes me.\"\nRigurt the Brash: \"Does priest appreciate Rigurt's gift? It's filled with the finest Nord spices and... well, you probably don't want to know about the 'and.'\"\nPriest Uugus: \"Are you sure this is safe to eat? I'm not sure I even know what this is.\"\nEveli Sharp-Arrow: \"Thanks for the offer, but I... I can't. Not after everything that's happened.\"\nKing Bazrag: \"I understand. Thank you for everything you've done, little Elf. I shall miss you.\"\n\"Your courage and resilience in the face of adversity do you honor, my friend. If not for you, the clan chiefs and I wouldn't be standing here. And I certainly wouldn't be king. Hmm, so this is all your fault, isn't it?\"\nThe quest ends at this point. However, after finishing with Kurog, the Vestige, if they had completed the quest \"&lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Schemes\"&gt;God of Schemes&lt;/a&gt;,\" may meet an old friend for the last time.\n\"Greetings, Vestige. Though, I can hardly call you that anymore, can I?

I must find a ruin nearby, which Valaste says may hold a store of ancient knowledge.\"\nSummary.\nThis quest is the same for all &lt;a href=\"alliances\"&gt;alliances&lt;/a&gt;. However, the location changes based on the chosen alliance:\nWalkthrough.\nMages Guild.\nValaste asks the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to go to the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruin&lt;/a&gt; nearby and retrieve a few tomes. Once the tomes have been taken, &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; appears and speaks to them. When the Vestige returns to the Mages Guild and informs Valaste about the sighting, she is doubtful at first and then notices that the spell tome has blank pages. According to Shalidor, the words will appear with the help of fire. Using the Arcane Brazier reveals a text not readable for the Vestige but Valaste knows that one part is an attunement spell they can use to summon the Arch-Mage. But they will need some ritual orbs as well.\nValaste helps to summon Shalidor to the center of the room and he immediately speaks to the Vestige. They will be the one to help him complete his final task, a sanctuary for all the mages of Tamriel.\nShalidor informs them that the haven &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt; he had created for all mages had been stolen by the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. He asks the Vestige to retrieve four tomes that will help him recreate Eyevea. He then opens a portal to &lt;a href=\"Cheesemonger%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Cheesemonger's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nCheesemonger's Hollow.\nInside is a man named &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt;. After the Vestige informs him what they are here for, Haskill demands that they close a portal first, to earn the spell tomes, that different Daedra are pouring out of. When the portal is closed, Haskill opens the door to the Hollow. Here they need to make their way on the path, past &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt; and then defeat the boss &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gutsripper\"&gt;Gutsripper&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the first tome is taken, however, the rest disappear and Sheogorath appears instead. Sheogorath promises to give the Vestige the remaining tomes if they complete various tasks for him. Sheogorath then summons Shalidor and informs him about the deal. To Shalidor's ire, Sheogorath adds that Shalidor himself won't be able to read the tomes himself.\nAfter Sheogorath disappears, Shalidor curses the Mad God and says without his help it will take longer for Valaste to translate the tomes. He then sends the Vestige back to the Mages Guild hall to inform Valaste. Once informed, Valaste instructs the Vestige to check in from time to time and that she will send word when she's finished with the translation. The Vestige gives the tome to Valaste and is rewarded for their efforts."}

Longhaven is also located on the northern end of the Shademist Moors swamps which are always covered in a heavy shroud of mist and have a very eerie feel to them.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, many citizens living in Longhaven vanished into the Moors making the Village much less populated as a result. This was also the driving cause for people to leave Longhaven for Woodhearth since they feared of being taken. The local leader hired &lt;a href=\"Mel%20Adrys\"&gt;Mel Adrys&lt;/a&gt;, a valiant vampire hunter from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to slay the local &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; coven known as the &lt;a href=\"Keerilth\"&gt;Keerilth Clan&lt;/a&gt; to prevent more people from being taken into the Moors. With the help of a mysterious traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, Mel Adrys and the warrior defeated the Keerilth Clan and saved Longhaven from any further kidnappings.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, the Longhaven township exist in Valenwood in between the towns of &lt;a href=\"Marbruk%20Field\"&gt;Marbruk Field&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vullain%20Haven\"&gt;Vullain Haven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint%20%28Valenwood%29\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;.

It was a violent and terrible gale, one of the very worst I have seen in all my long years. The winds howled like all the &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and the driving snow made us blind to the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Ri%27saad\"&gt;Ri'saad&lt;/a&gt; called a halt and we staggered from the road, our hands held over our faces to ward off the stinging pellets of ice. We huddled together in the shelter of a copse of pines. There was no hope of raising our tents - the wind would tear them from our hands the moment we unpacked them.\nThey struck at the height of the storm. There were perhaps half a dozen of the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;. It was difficult to say, as the blowing snow and howling wind overwhelmed our sight and our hearing.\nThey were roughly man-sized, but hunched over and ugly. For garments, they wore only rags and leathers. They were armed with daggers and swords or various kinds, no doubt scavenged from their previous victims.\nThey had no noses to speak of, only long slits for nostrils. Their ears were sharply pointed, suggesting a distant kinship with the elves. With their pallid skin and lifeless black eyes, they seemed like something out of a nightmare.\n&lt;a href=\"Bhisha%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bhisha&lt;/a&gt; saw them first, but too late to save herself. So loud was her death-cry, we heard it over the roaring winds. That cry saved us all.\nAlerted to the presence of our foes, the Khajiit drew their blades and formed a circle, facing outward. The white fiends were too few to surround us completely, and the Khajiit fended off each attack. After three of the snow-devils had fallen, the rest fell back and did not come at us again.\nThe storm abated and we arrived in Windhelm the next morning. I have taken up residence in &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt; and I find I am quite comfortable behind the towering stone walls of the city.\nComfortable, at least until I go to sleep and visions of those awful creatures return to haunt my dreams."}

It is important to explain what I mean by haunted. Not every undead is a haunt. Only ghosts can cause a haunting. Ghosts are the spirits of people who were once alive as you or I. When they died, they refused to leave.\nEveryone in Glenumbra has a tale to tell about a spook, spectre, or haunt. You need only ask.\nWithout a doubt the most haunted place in Glenumbra are the moors northwest of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;. As everyone knows, this was the site of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. This great battle saw the near-simultaneous destruction of both the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; Elves on one field of battle. Such a tragedy suffuses this place with spectral energy. Wandering the moors, many travelers report hearing the sounds of conflict in the distance.\nThe second most haunted place in Glenumbra is directly related to the first. &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt; and the burial mounds surrounding began as a mass grave for the fallen soldiers of the battle of Glenumbria Moors. It is advised that you do not stray into the cemetery during times of heavy fog. Ghostly lights and moans have been reported there.\nWhile some consider the woodlands of &lt;a href=\"Daenia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; to be haunted, this is actually a misconception. Many spirits of nature, including the fame Guardians, inhabit the vale and forest. These are not ghosts, for they were never people. These creatures were born as spirits and should be treated with the respect they deserve.\nHearkening from Glenumbra's past of feudal division, the countryside is dotted with ruins and castles, each of which you could probably find someone to tell you a spooky story about. In particular, the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Baelborne%20Rock\"&gt;Baelborne Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dresan%20Keep\"&gt;Dresan Keep&lt;/a&gt; have many a local legend surrounding them.\nOf all the haunted sites in Glenumbra, I would give strongest caution against a trip to the village of Westtry. &lt;a href=\"Westtry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Westtry&lt;/a&gt; suffered from some form of terrible magical event that has left it infested with the undead. It is not safe, nor would I suggest anyone go ghost hunting there."}

Upon his death, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Cirion\"&gt;Count Cirion&lt;/a&gt; was visited by &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; who cursed him and the rest of the fort's inhabitants for their cowardice and miserably poor defense. Lord Sheogorath forced them to relive their last moments forever.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; arrives at the fort, they will find the Vitharn ghost defenders and the ghost Fanatics fighting each other. The door to the Keep is magically sealed. Working around to the left they will see a huge tree lit with Withering Moon plants. At the base of this tree is the Root Door to Vitharn Sump, which will allow entry.\nAt the end of this tunnel is an underwater door to the Vitharn Reservoir. Continue to the end of this to reach the Vitharn Keep. With further exploring they will come across the Great Hall and a feast taking place while the fighting is taking place outside. They will then be greeted by the Count, who if politely greeted will explain the situation. They will be told that the failed defense was due to the short-comings of four people, and that if the troops are able to hold the Fanatics back the curse will be lifted and their spirits allowed to rest.\nThe Archer.\nProceed to the Bailey where the battle takes place over and over. The first person to fail was &lt;a href=\"Althel\"&gt;Althel&lt;/a&gt;, a scout and archer whose job was to defend the gate wheel. Her main problem was that the armorer, &lt;a href=\"Bat%20gro-Orkul\"&gt;Bat gro-Orkul&lt;/a&gt;, was protective of his weapons and armor and wouldn't release them to the soldiers out of fear of his goods being destroyed or lost. Because he refused to give Althel any arrows and she was unable to leave her post to get any, her ledge was quickly over-run and the gate was opened.\nIn order to fix her mistakes, the Hero must get hold of the set of ghostly &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Arrow%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Steel Arrows&lt;/a&gt; from the armory and give them to her so she can defend her post. Bat gro-Orkul will refuse to hand them over, forcing the one to sneak in and get the arrows. The door to the armory is locked with a hard lock, but a key can be found in the west wing near a set of bookcases. They must sneak in and take the arrows before Bat gro-Orkul sees them and kicks them out. Once they have the arrows they need to give them to Althel. She will thank the Hero and will fight the enemy.\nThe Mage.\nThe next to fail was a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; mage named &lt;a href=\"Hloval%20Dreth\"&gt;Hloval Dreth&lt;/a&gt;. Hloval was born with &lt;a href=\"Stunted%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Stunted Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and can't regenerate magicka because of this. This means he can't fight the fanatics or heal his comrades. When asking around the Hero will discover that while his magicka is stunted, his ego is not; this leads Hloval to be edgy with others. In order to fix Hloval's problem the Hero must find a way to regenerate his magicka.\nThere are two ways to fix Hloval's problem. The first is to find a set of &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt; in the mausoleum. Giving him the stones will anger him because the Hero has now \"defiled them.\" He will, however, use the stones and recharge his Magicka.\nThe other method is to find the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20of%20Depletion\"&gt;Dagger of Depletion&lt;/a&gt; in the hidden study in the chapel. This is accessed by pressing the stone button in the back corner. When he is given the dagger he will use the Hero to recharge his magicka and head to Vitharn's defense.\nThe Soldier.\nThe third person to have failed on the battlefield is a soldier named &lt;a href=\"Desideratus%20Annius\"&gt;Desideratus Annius&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, Desideratus flees to protect his betrothed, who turns out to be a toy doll. Asking around the Hero will discover that the doll is all that Desideratus has left after his entire family was killed. There are two ways to get him to fight. Both ways involve taking his \"betrothed\" and using her to get him to stay. However, giving him the doll will cause him to leave the field and put the doll back.\nThe first way is to take the doll from the barracks and destroy it by placing it in one of the braziers scattered throughout the city. Go back to him and tell him the doll is destroyed and this will cause Desideratus to become overcome with grief and charge into battle to take as many fanatics with him as possible.\nThe alternative way to handle this is by taking the doll and giving it to the fanatics. When he hears that his betrothed is in the hands of one of the fanatics he will become enraged and storm into battle to rescue her.\nThe Count.\nDespite helping the three soldiers to stand and fight, fanatics will still make it into the fort. The Hero will be told to return to the Count and find out why this is happening. Count Cirion will then confess to being the fourth person responsible for the sacking of Vitharn. He states that it was his duty to stand on the field and lead the troops in battle, but he was too afraid of death so left his troops to handle all of the fighting.\nThe only way to break the curse is Cirion entering the battle and killing the fanatic leading the siege, However, Count Cirion can not exit the great hall because that is where he was when he died. He will ask the Hero to take his helmet and fight in his place. Once they put on the helm, he or she must either kill the Fanatics' leader or remain trapped in Vitharn.\nThe Devoted Fanatic.\nOnce they put on &lt;a href=\"Count%20Cirion%27s%20Helmet\"&gt;Count Cirion's Helmet&lt;/a&gt; the Fanatics will acknowledge the Hero and attack. They must now face the last Fanatic and kill him in order to break the curse.\nOnce the battle is over and won, Count Cirion will appear and thank the Hero for all their help and award them with the helmet. Once Cirion is through speaking, he and the rest of the ghosts will vanish and the gates will unseal forever."}

Do you speak sooth? Many and more are the tales of ghost-haunted towers, until it seems there must be hardly a tower that has not its spectre. Has the Songbird's well of stories at last gone dry?\n\u2014 Nay, be but patient, one-who-governs-with-wisdom. For the tale of the Old Tower of the Fallen Waste is unlike any you have heard before.\n\u2014 Say on then, O spellbinder. I will withhold judgment until I have heard the tale.\n\u2014 Patience as well as wisdom! Truly you have earned all the accolades that are laid at your feet, Honorable Vizier.\n\u2014 On with the story, Songbird. I get enough honeyed words from the lickspittle dogs at court.\n\u2014 As you command. There was, high atop a pinnacle in a lonely corner of the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Wastes\"&gt;Fallen Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, a tall and ill-favored tower that had stood there long and long. In the days when the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; warred against the Tusked Folk, a scout of the &lt;a href=\"Bergama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; Gallants was commanded to take possession of this tower, thereupon to post himself as observer and sentry. And his name was Abadaman of the Three Scars.\n\u2014 And there at night this Abadaman was visited by the sorrowing ghost of a nubile maiden? Or did the shade of his long-dead father appear to deliver a timely warning? Ah, but wait, I have it: The spirit of a murdered man moaned in the gloaming that he could not rest until his killing was avenged.\n\u2014 Nay, none of these haps did eventuate. Yet a haunting did occur, and strange to say, it took place in the golden light of noon. It happened in this wise: Abadaman of the Three Scars had done his morning devoirs, which consisted of climbing the many steps to the top of the Old Tower, peering to every point of the compass, and making note of what he saw, which was nothing of import. So went he for a walk in the desert, for this Abadaman liked to think, and when he thought he liked to walk. On this day of days his wandering took him down to the arid flats beneath the towered pinnacle, and there his thoughts were interrupted for his eyes beheld a wonder: beneath the bright noonday sun stood a coterie of ghosts, gazing about as if awaiting an imminent event.\n\u2014 Intriguing. This accords with no tale of haunting I have otherwise heard.\n\u2014 Yet I assure Your Munificence, it was so. The ghosts were eight in number, and though they were difficult to perceive clearly in the shimmering heat of daylight, their presence was undeniable. They were young Redguards all, and were clad in the armor of soldiers, like that of Abadaman, yet unlike as well. He took one of these ghosts, who had a commanding presence, to be the officer of the others. When the officer-wraith turned his head and locked eyes with Abadaman, the scout, though stout of heart, cried out in surprise.\n\u2014 Even I might do the same, I do confess it.\n\u2014 Perhaps, though you must give me leave to doubt it. At the scout's cry the ghost spake in a voice of echoes, saying, \"Well met, scout. Though the device upon your breast is unfamiliar, I see you are one of our soldiers. Are you he who will mete out justice to the one who betrayed us?\"\n\u2014 Ah ha! A story of revenge. Did I not say so? These ghosts are all the same.\n\u2014 You are correct, Your Efficacy\u2014and yet you are not. Shall I say on?\n\u2014 Such is my will.\n\u2014 I hear and obey. At these words the brave Abadaman was filed with wonder, and was moved to reply, saying, \"I know naught of what you speak, spirit-from-across-the-great-river. Yet I would hear more.\" \"I am Captain Fayda,\" said the spirit, \"and these are my soldiers, slain by treachery. We seek justice upon the traitor, yet we are confounded, for though dead we are unborn, and though murdered our killer has not harmed us.\"\u2014 A riddle, by &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;'s shining eye! And what said the scout to that?\n\u2014 He said, \"You speak in enigmas, O Captain, which as yet I cannot fathom. Tell me of how you were betrayed, that I might know more.\" The ghostly captain nodded and said, \"That I may do. We were ordered to garrison the Old Tower, though we have not been so ordered. Unbeknownst to us, one of our number was beholden unto our enemies the invading &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, though none have invaded. He did secretly admit them through our defenses and we were undone, though no such event has occurred. And the traitor's name was Amil Red-Hand.\"\n\u2014 Ah, I see now. The ghost is mad, and cannot speak words of sense.\n\u2014 Nay, for the words abruptly made sense to Abadaman, and he reeled back as if stricken. \"Alas!\" he cried. \"All is now clear! You are dead though unborn, for your life and death are both yet to come! You speak of a treachery that has not yet occurred, but it will many years from now. You appear before me, O lamentable haunt, because I and only I am in a position to mete out justice to your betrayer. But this I will never do.\"\n\u2014 How can this be? Explain forthwith!\n\u2014 Alas, my Vizier, a tale is like a river and flows only as it will. But this one nears its end. \"That you will never do, though you are an honorable soldier?\" moaned the officer's ghost. \"Wherefore?\" \"Wherefore the name of my infant son is Amil, born with a red mark upon his hand. Therefore away, importunate ghosts, for I shall not help you, and you cannot escape your fate.\" And then Abadaman of the Three Scars turned his feet back up the trail to the Old Tower."}

Riglametha in the &lt;a href=\"Banthan\"&gt;Banthan&lt;/a&gt; dialect of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; tongue means \"grateful-offering\" and is a festival of the graces the gods have granted the people of Lainlyn over the centuries. Tradition dictates the performance of a number of plays about the great moments from Lainlyn's past, and one of the most popular is &lt;a href=\"Ghraewaj\"&gt;Ghraewaj&lt;/a&gt;, which may be translated as \"The Crows Who Were Punished\" or \"The Crows Who Punish.\" Old Redguard is somewhat vague with its objective case.\nThe story of Ghraewaj, as any Lainlyn child will tell you, is of the wicked sisterhood of &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; worshippers who craft lies, curses, murders, and suicides to hurt the people of Lainlyn. Most of all, they use their beauty as a weapon to drive men to mayhem. Their leader, the temptress &lt;a href=\"Noctyr-a\"&gt;Noctyr-a&lt;/a&gt;, seduces the unnamed baron of Lainlyn and is about to force him to commit suicide to prove his love, when the baroness arrives. The baroness tricks Noctyr-a into wearing a beautiful white robe from the baroness' closet: \"See how the robe glows with the lumniscience of pearl, but the inside is soft, feathered with down.\" Noctyr-a puts on the robe and the trap is sprung: the robe is magical and transforms Noctyr-a into an giant black bird. The baron, no longer enchanted, slays the great bird and calls in his cook.\nThe sisterhood has, by this time, taken over Lainlyn castle and turned it into an orgy-filled den of decadence. At the height of their frenzied debauch, the cook arrives with an enormous roast to keep their energy high. They dig into the deliciously prepared meal, and at the crescendo of their gorging, the baron and baroness appear to tell them all that they have just devoured their leader, Noctyr-a. The women scream and caw and suddenly they too are transformed by the magic of the robe, into &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Daggerfall%20Creature%29\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, vicious half-bird creatures.\nThe interesting thing about Ghraewaj from a scholarly perspective is how much the story has changed and continues to change over the years. In some versions of the story, Noctyr-a is an innocent peasant seamstress and it is the baroness who is the cruel and wicked leader of the harpies. Noctyr-a prays to &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; and is given the charm to make the magical robe, and she and the baron live happily ever after once the harpies have feasted on the transformed baroness. During the long reign of the virgin baroness of Lainlyn, &lt;a href=\"Viana%20the%20Pure\"&gt;Viana the Pure&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"2E%20120\"&gt;2E 120&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"2E%20148\"&gt;2E 148&lt;/a&gt;), the baron was portrayed as a willing conspirator of Noctyr-a. The harpies thus have two birds to dine on.\nIt is unlikely that trying to find the truth in the story is profitable research. Harpies are indeed a common nuisance in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, particularly around Lainlyn. They do have their own tongue, and the few who have mastered it and not been devoured by their interviewees suggest that the harpies have no more idea about their origins than we do. In a different vein, one of the best known of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Princes&lt;/a&gt; is named &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, who is often portrayed as a beautiful dark woman holding two black crows. It is not a difficult etymologic trick to derive the name Noctyr-a from Nocturnal, or vice-versa."}

Infamous for their colossal height and immense strength, giants share little civil interaction with &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulturally, giants herd &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;, processing their milk into &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20Cheese%20Bowl\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt;, complementing their omnivorous diet with the cooked meat of &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt;. Seemingly nomadic, giants travel with their herds, setting camp across Skyrim and High Rock.\nAnthropology.\nAnatomy.\nGiants stand between 11 and 12 feet (3.4m and 3.7m) tall, and are mostly humanoid in appearance; with thick skin, long powerful limbs, large hands and feet, and thick greyish-brown hair decorated with braids and beads. Most giants have decorative scars carved into their chests, possibly serving as tribal or religious symbols. Their physical similarities with &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;\u2014jutting lower canines, tapered ears, and the presence of stumpy horns on the temples\u2014serve as evidence of some loose relation to the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll giants encountered in-game are male, with wrinkled faces and long, gray-streaked beards. Female giants make no appearances. Whether this indicates a scarcity of female giants, or some other unexplained attribute of their social structure or anatomy, or simply due to gameplay limitations, remains unknown.\nTechnology.\nThey arm themselves with crudely-made &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Club\"&gt;stone and wood clubs&lt;/a&gt;, and clothe themselves in &lt;a href=\"Pelts\"&gt;fur pelts&lt;/a&gt; adorned with the bones of animals and humanoids, although many prefer a simple loincloth. They also herd mammoths for meat and milk, which they make into cheese.\nThe giants' diet seems to consist largely of meat and mammoth cheese, evidenced by their herding of mammoths and the presence of charred &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; and other animals spit-roasting over their massive fires. They also appear to be partial to &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; as the bodies of these animals are (less frequently) found on smaller, square-shaped logpiles that have remained unlit. &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20Cat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sabre cat&lt;/a&gt; corpses can be found in their camps as well.\nIntelligence.\nDespite their primitive appearances, giants are moderately intelligent: they are able to fashion tools and clothes for themselves, herd mammoths, and harness fire for warmth. Giants can sometimes be heard \"speaking\" during combat, though their speech is deep and guttural, and consists of incomprehensible grunts and roars. There are no translations for any of the words they use, and they have no known written language. The only known giant who has dialogue, visible through the use of subtitles, is &lt;a href=\"Karstaag%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Karstaag&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Tribe\"&gt;The Cursed Tribe&lt;/a&gt;,\" giant paintings can be seen outside &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Cave\"&gt;Fallowstone Cave&lt;/a&gt; resembling their decorative scarification. Giants may also carve symbols into herded mammoth tusks. In the same quest, a shrine to &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; is seen, decorated with patterns usually found at &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Camps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giant camps&lt;/a&gt;, as well as indications of sacrifice, which may indicate worship. The shrine is also guarded by the giant who carries &lt;a href=\"Shagrol%27s%20Warhammer\"&gt;Shagrol's Warhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Night%20to%20Remember%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/a&gt;,\" the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with recovering a goat they traded to a giant during their alcohol-laced adventures. This shows that giants are intelligent enough to understand the concept of a trade and even become angry when double-crossed after said trade. The aforementioned giant becomes hostile and aggressive when the Dragonborn steals back the goat they had traded to it.\nBehavior.\nGiants are nomadic creatures that herd mammoths for sustenance, and are wary of, but used to, the presence of other races. They only attack if attacked first, or if someone strays too close to their camps or herds - lone groups of giants on the move can be closely approached with only a low chance of hostility. This is in contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Kill%20the%20Giant%20%28Bounty%29\"&gt;contracts&lt;/a&gt; issued by &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s, which state that the giant at a local named location has been harassing and attacking people and livestock. Due to a possible bug, sometimes they also appear to ignore the Dragonborn's presence altogether even if both are face to face with each other.\nMountain giants are often seen traveling with mammoths. These mammoths stay close to the giants' camps, and pouches of mammoth cheese are often found nearby, supporting the conclusion that the giants raise mammoths like livestock. Additionally, there is a giant herding a cow from the base of the path from &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;. The giant walks with the cow to &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Tree%20Camp\"&gt;Sleeping Tree Camp&lt;/a&gt; or another giant camp. After that, they stand still for hours.\nGiants are usually only found in the snowy terrain of &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;, the vast tundra of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, or the warmer parts of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, where they can roam freely. Giants can be found in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; as well, but they are usually only there to raid the player character's &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is no evidence that giants need to rest or sleep, as they are never seen doing so. Their camps rarely, if ever, contain bedding materials.\nIn some camps, giants have left a giant club lying on the ground. While the Dragonborn cannot equip it, certain followers possessing Two Handed weapon skills can.\nInteractions with humans.\nSome farmers offer &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt; as a sacrifice to the giants in order to avoid attacks on livestock. The cows are painted with traditional markings so that the giants recognize them as peace offerings. However, giants have been known to kill these farmers and ignore the peace offerings.\nAn angry man named &lt;a href=\"Ennis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ennis&lt;/a&gt;, mentions that the Dragonborn sold his goat to a giant named &lt;a href=\"Grok\"&gt;Grok&lt;/a&gt; in the quest \"A Night to Remember.\"\nIf is installed, it becomes evident that Giants can and will attack homesteads, often killing people and animals. The exact cause of the attacks is unknown.\nGiant camps.\nGiants can be found in the following locations:"}
