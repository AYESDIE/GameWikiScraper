With the civil war going on in Hammerfell, the few scattered &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;legions&lt;/a&gt; there provided little defense and were eventually driven into the northern sands of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. This event became known as the March of Thirst.\nContent to have full power over their gains in Hammerfell, Aldmeri troops stationed there continued to secure the major cities. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, all but &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0had fallen to the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; invaders.\u00a0\nHowever, in the north the survivors of the March of Thirst, including &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt;, regrouped with reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Aranneyla's advances into the Alik'r were initially successful; however, they clashed with General Decianus in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt; and a bloody conflict ensued. This went on for hours; in the end, Lady Aranneyla's troops proved victorious. However, they were unable to continue their assault through Hammerfell.\nAfter the Great War had ended for the Empire and Hammerfell was renounced from the Empire, the Redguards fought the Aldmeri Dominion to a standstill, although the war lasted for five more years and left southern Hammerfell devastated. This led to the eventual &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt; and the withdrawal of Aldmeri forces from Hammerfell."}

She was here when we got here, and nobody seems to know who she is or why she's there. Can anybody tell me who this is supposed to be?\nI think she's the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt;. I saw her statue in &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, once\u2015I can't put my claw on it, but it feels as though she's the same person. And it makes sense why the matron of fortune would be here, blessing the only consistent source of clean water in &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat do the rest of you think? Who is the lady in the cistern?\n\u2015&lt;a href=\"Andarri\"&gt;Andarri&lt;/a&gt;\nThe lady in the cistern is clearly &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look at the statue\u2015the face somewhat obscured, cloaked in an all-concealing robe, and hidden in a cistern that was once bricked off behind another cistern. Who hides water? Nocturnal cultists, that's who.\nNot that I was ever in a Nocturnal cult.\n\u2015&lt;a href=\"Thrag\"&gt;Thrag&lt;/a&gt;\nWe read translations of old &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; texts at &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Aldmeri%20Propriety\"&gt;my academy&lt;/a&gt;. I think the lady in the cistern is a depiction of &lt;a href=\"Hazadiyya%20Sea-Queen\"&gt;Hazadiyya Sea-Queen&lt;/a&gt;. She was well-known and respected amongst her people's descendants, and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Hew\"&gt;Prince Hew&lt;/a&gt; may have read her Lost Islands of Old Yokuda. Also, the creature wrapped around her is a &lt;a href=\"sea%20serpent\"&gt;sea serpent&lt;/a&gt;. This means the \"queen of the sea\" watches over the water supply for the only free port of Hew's Bane, as though it were a colony of Old &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; itself. Pompous symbolism\u2015worthy of Prince Hew himself.\n\u2015&lt;a href=\"Quen\"&gt;Quen&lt;/a&gt;\nThose who live in the alleys of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; are often without food, but it is rare to hear of any who suffer from lack of water. Have you never asked yourself why the lowliest are graced with such plenty?\nThe statue must be &lt;a href=\"Zeqqi\"&gt;Zeqqi&lt;/a&gt;, the Madonna of Tears. Though her father &lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt; forsakes this land, preventing most food from growing here, the water goddess takes pity on the lost souls who call Abah's Landing their home. The statue recognizes the sacrifices she makes to sustain us, hidden from the gaze of her disapproving father.\n\u2015&lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt;\nThe statue is the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Her right hand is open because She Knows. There's a snake wrapped around her. The snake represents &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's clear as the night sky that you're all idiots.\n\u2015&lt;a href=\"Velsa\"&gt;Velsa&lt;/a&gt;\nI do not know who the lady in the cistern used to be. But truly, it no longer matters who the statue was.\nYou see, I believe the statue now represents &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt;. Without her guidance, this strange little family of which I now proudly call myself a part would no longer exist. So for me, the Lady in the Cistern is your &lt;a href=\"guildmaster\"&gt;guildmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u2015&lt;a href=\"Silver-Claw\"&gt;Silver-Claw&lt;/a&gt;\nSilver-Claw\u2015I'm flattered, but the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; is more than one person. is proof enough of that.\nAnd the rest of you are wrong\u2015it's &lt;a href=\"Leki\"&gt;Leki&lt;/a&gt;, administering her Ephemeral Feint\u2015as sculptors used to depict it, in Hubalajad's time. The statue's left hand is curled, as though to hold a sword. Perhaps it did, long ago, though if it were not stolen it must have long since rusted away.\nNote the similarities to the &lt;a href=\"Hubalajad%27s%20Reflection\"&gt;massive statue of Hubalajad&lt;/a&gt; just south of the Abah's Landing's harbor. He commissioned a colossal, idealized sculpture of himself, embraced by a &lt;a href=\"sep%20adder\"&gt;sep adder&lt;/a&gt;. Enormous, ridiculous, and (for some reason) shirtless, as though nothing can harm him.\nYet the sculptor who hid Leki away in this cistern refuted him. The robes conceal intention, allowing her to strike with little warning. The Saint of the Spirit Sword accomplished so much more than Prince Hew, yet doesn't need to be taller than a ship's mast to prove it. Even more, she does not need to declare herself to the entire town. She is content to do what she must from the shadows.\nAnd the sep adder sash is delightful. A real thumb in the eye to Prince Hew.\n\u2015Zeira"}

Alva decided to keep her alive to use as a personal servant. Suspicious of Laelette's disappearance, Thonnir, her husband, went to Alva for an explanation, since Laelette was last seen visiting Alva. Alva told Thonnir she left Morthal to join the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nMurdering Hroggar's family.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Alva\"&gt;Alva&lt;/a&gt; charmed &lt;a href=\"Hroggar\"&gt;Hroggar&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Thrall\"&gt;enthrall&lt;/a&gt; him and keep him as a guardian of her coffin, she ordered Laelette to murder his family and make it look like an accident. Instead, Laelette burned their home to the ground, with the family still inside. During the burning, she became enamored with &lt;a href=\"Helgi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Helgi&lt;/a&gt;, Hroggar's daughter, and gave her vampiric blood, although she did not survive the fire.\nObsession.\nLaelette became obsessed with Helgi, visiting her coffin nightly at the &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20Cemetery\"&gt;Morthal Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; to try to raise her back from the dead.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Laid%20to%20Rest\"&gt;Laid to Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter speaking to Helgi's ghost, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; returns to the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; (who is either &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20Ravencrone\"&gt;Idgrod Ravencrone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sorli%20the%20Builder\"&gt;Sorli the Builder&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the status of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;). The Jarl then sends the Dragonborn to the city's cemetery to look for Helgi's ghost. There, the Dragonborn discovers Laelette. She immediately attacks the Dragonborn. After her death, her husband Thonnir arrives, shocked that his wife had become a vampire. Suspecting Alva of turning Laelette into a vampire, they search &lt;a href=\"Alva%27s%20House\"&gt;Alva's House&lt;/a&gt; for clues, despite Thonnir's denial that any such involvement on Alva's part occurred.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn may contract &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; during the duel with Laelette, if hit by her &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;."}

This is a quest that takes place in the city of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to the quest, &lt;a href=\"Hroggar%27s%20House\"&gt;Hroggar's House&lt;/a&gt; burned down, killing &lt;a href=\"Hroggar\"&gt;Hroggar&lt;/a&gt;'s wife and child. The townsfolk, including the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, are suspicious because Hroggar took up with a new love, &lt;a href=\"Alva\"&gt;Alva&lt;/a&gt;, the day after the fire. The Jarl will pay the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to investigate.\nIf is installed, completion of this quest is necessary before &lt;a href=\"Windstad%20Manor\"&gt;Windstad Manor&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased.\nBackground.\n\"A mysterious fire killed Hroggar's wife and child. Hroggar took Alva as a lover immediately after the fire, and many in town think he did it. The Jarl might pay me to investigate.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest can be started by speaking with the &lt;a href=\"Moorside%20Inn\"&gt;Moorside Inn&lt;/a&gt; innkeeper, Jonna, who will mention the burned down house nearby. Alternatively, &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20Ravencrone\"&gt;Idgrod Ravencrone&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Sorli%20the%20Builder\"&gt;Sorli the Builder&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn sided with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;) can be asked regarding the subject. The Dragonborn may also speak to any of the guards in Morthal to initiate the quest, as well as the Imperial Legate inside of Highmoon Hall. Initiating the quest through Jonna, the guards, or the Legate, will all result in the first objective being to speak with the Jarl anyway.\nNote that the Dragonborn may have to \"enter\" the burned down house in order for the innkeeper to have the dialogue option to speak with the Jarl.\nTalk to the Jarl.\nWhen asked about the burned down house, the Jarl will indicate that the house had once belonged to Hroggar, and that one night the house had burned down while he was away. Unfortunately, Hroggar's wife and daughter, &lt;a href=\"Helgi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Helgi&lt;/a&gt;, perished in the blaze. Rumors around town claim that Hroggar had set the blaze himself so that he could be with another woman, Alva. The Jarl wishes to know what really happened: accident or murder.\nInvestigate the burned house.\nUpon entering the burned out house, Helgi's ghost will be waiting in the corner. She recounts what little she knows but promises to reveal more after a game of hide and seek. She wants to wait until nightfall, however, as \"the other one\" will be playing too and only comes out at night.\nFind Helgi After dark.\nSpeaking to Jonna at Moorside Inn about the ghost will cause her to ask the Dragonborn to speak to the Jarl. The Jarl reveals Helgi's location if the Dragonborn asks about it. Waiting until dark will allow the quest to continue.\nAbove and to the right of the burned house (over the rocks), large piles of stones surround a grave site with a Child's Coffin unearthed. &lt;a href=\"Laelette%20the%20Vampire\"&gt;Laelette&lt;/a&gt;, the missing wife of Thonnir, will appear and attack the Dragonborn when approached. When she is killed, it is revealed that she was a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;. The Child's Coffin can then be activated to speak with Helgi's ghost. Helgi explains that Laelette was supposed to burn her and her mother, but had a change of heart and tried to turn Helgi beforehand and keep her forever. Although Helgi had then contracted Vampirism, Laelette had waited too long and the fire killed Helgi regardless.\nAsk Thonnir about Laelette.\nThonnir will happen upon the grisly scene and be hysterical at the sight of his dead wife, particularly that she was a vampire. When asked about the circumstances of Laelette's disappearance, Thonnir will state that he had believed that she had run off to join the Stormcloak rebellion. However, he also remembers that she had been spending a lot of time with Alva who, just the week prior, Laelette had despised. In fact, she was supposed to meet Alva the night of her disappearance but Alva had said she never showed up. Given the circumstances, it is presumable that Alva is, in fact, a vampire as well. Thonnir will refuse to believe it, however.\nInvestigate &lt;a href=\"Alva%27s%20House\"&gt;Alva's House&lt;/a&gt;.\nHroggar is staying in Alva's house. If you proceed directly to the house, it will be nightime, and he will likely be there. If he is there, he will be immediately aggressive on entry to the house, so a high &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;calming&lt;/a&gt; spell, or some other such tactic may be employed if an armed confrontation is to be avoided. Alternatively, you can wait until he is not there. Waiting until it is day to break into Alva's house, he is likely avoidable. Alva's coffin can be found in the basement and in it, \"&lt;a href=\"Alva%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Alva's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\". Alva may or may not be present depending on whether it is day or night. The journal goes into great detail of her plans and reveals that &lt;a href=\"Movarth%20Piquine\"&gt;Movarth&lt;/a&gt;, a master vampire, plans on turning the town into what equates to a blood farm for his coven of vampires. If Alva is there when the journal is recovered, she awakens and flees town for &lt;a href=\"Movarth%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Movarth's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nShow Alva's journal to the Jarl.\nUpon returning to the Jarl with the journal and telling them that Alva was responsible for the fire, they will reward the Dragonborn. However, the Jarl will then ask that the master vampire, Movarth, be dealt with.\nKill the Master Vampire.\nUpon leaving &lt;a href=\"Highmoon%20Hall\"&gt;Highmoon Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a mob with Thonnir in the lead has assembled to assist in taking retribution on the Vampires. To the northeast is &lt;a href=\"Movarth%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Movarth's Lair&lt;/a&gt; where Movarth Piquine lies in wait. The townsfolk can either be told to stay, as they will likely die, or Thonnir may come. &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Thrall\"&gt;Vampire thralls&lt;/a&gt; serve as guardians to the small coven of vampires. Movarth can be found sitting at a large banquet table. Alva, after fleeing town, is found in a back room with several bedrolls. She will usually be slain by the female vampire patrolling that area due to having no protective armor and only her &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; spell and dagger.\nStrategies.\nTo kill the Master Vampire, one method is to retreat through the cave. There is a point where the Master Vampire and his Thralls do not go past \u2013 the room with the dead &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; in an open grave is safe. Retreating to this point will allow the Dragonborn to heal themselves. The Nord, Redguard, and Vampire's Thralls (once killed) may sometimes be brought back to life temporarily by Movarth or other thralls and will start attacking, not stopping until they or the ones who resurrected them are killed. Alva can be resurrected as well after the vampires kill her. The vampire thralls are too powerful for the &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Zombie\"&gt;Raise Zombie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Reanimate%20Corpse\"&gt;Reanimate Corpse&lt;/a&gt; spells, however, they can be pre-emptively raised with &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Movarth from doing the same.\nIf the Dragonborn has a high sneak level, it is possible to sneak up on a ledge to the left when entering the cave where Movarth sits. From up there, he and the Vampire Thrall can be shot with a bow. If the Dragonborn has selected the quest as active in their journal, there will be a quest indicator above Movarth's head during the fight. The indicator remains visible when Movarth turns invisible, making it easy to target him.\nIt may be easier to visit Movarth's Lair before starting the quest and clearing it out. This way, when going after Movarth, one only has to deal with him alone, and he will only have whatever raised dead he conjures to back him up.\nOnce Movarth has been killed and on the way out of the cave, the Dragonborn will see the ghost of Helgi. She will thank the Dragonborn, say she is ready to sleep, and disappear.\nReturn to Morthal's Jarl.\nOnce Movarth has been dispatched and his coven eradicated, reporting back to the Jarl yields a reward. In addition to the gold, the Jarl will offer the title of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Thane of Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; provided that three people in the hold are assisted with their troubles. If \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Fort%20Snowhawk\"&gt;The Battle for Fort Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;\" was previously completed, the title will already be available to the Dragonborn. If is installed, &lt;a href=\"Windstad%20Manor\"&gt;Windstad Manor&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased from the Jarl's Steward for 5000 .\nReward.\nAfter giving Alva's Journal to the Jarl:\nAfter returning from Movarth's Lair:"}

Both differ in their opinions on who they should side with in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause she supports the Stormcloaks, the Jarl believes that Saerlund has lost his mind or is possessed, so she tells her &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;Court Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wylandriah\"&gt;Wylandriah&lt;/a&gt;, to find a reason. She believes she has the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; problem under control, and her advisors reinforce her belief.

If this option is completed, the Jarl reveals that she is already well aware of the skooma dealers in the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Warehouse\"&gt;Riften Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, and offers the task of suppressing the skooma operation. They have been long trying to track down the elusive skooma traders.\n&lt;a href=\"Supply%20and%20Demand\"&gt;Supply and Demand&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Dragonborn presents evidence of where the skooma operation is originating from in &lt;a href=\"Cragslane%20Cavern\"&gt;Cragslane Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, Laila gives the Dragonborn the go-ahead to eliminate everyone inside and shut down the operation. Doing so will be enough to convince Laila to consider naming the Dragonborn a Thane of Riften and the Rift.\n&lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a supporter of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, if she is removed from her position, she is exiled along with the rest of her family from &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. She is then replaced by &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt;, an affluent Nord noble who controls most aspects of the city even before her reign as Jarl. Laila can then be found at the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;.

The regional deity is &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;. Lainlyn has been utilized as a royal shipyard and being named after the Yokudan Goddess &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;, who guided the Yokudans to Hammerfell when their home, &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Lainlyn is located on the northern coasts of the Alik'r Desert, within the Hollow Wastes of the region. It is an open-aired city with the primary purpose of being a shipyard. The Barony of Lainlyn is situated east of the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and in an area where the Iliac Bay meets before the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the larger nations in that side of Hammerfell, bordering the &lt;a href=\"County%20of%20Satakalaam\"&gt;County of Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt; to the east, the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Kozanset\"&gt;Barony of Kozanset&lt;/a&gt; to the south, and barely the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast. Lainlyn is situated in an area traditionally being a part of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, the conservative group of Redguards. This is evident with the original name of Lainlyn, which revers a member of the &lt;a href=\"Redguard%20Pantheon\"&gt;Redguard Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Other notable Crowns settlements include the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Sentinel had absorbed several nations surrounding it, including the Barony of Lainlyn. The new kingdom extends as far as the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Barony of Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Mournoth\"&gt;Fiefdom of Mournoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLainlyn city itself is perhaps the smallest city-state in the Alik'r Desert. Lainlyn South is where various warehouses are used for storage. In the middle of town is a town square, as well as a large building with a forge and a fountain on the outside center. Lainlyn North, is where the local Town Hall is located, as well as various shipyards and docked frigates. As mentioned before, Lainlyn primarily serves as a shipyard, for incoming trade or wayfarers moving between major Kingdoms. In front of the Town Hall is the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Shrine%20%28Tava%27s%20Blessing%29\"&gt;Ansei Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, which was created by &lt;a href=\"Jamshald%20Lainlyn\"&gt;Jamshald Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt;. Moving upward from the Town Hall would lead to the Lainlyn Lighthouse, for incoming ships. Throughout that area are ruined Yokudan pillars, scattered about the water. On the outskirts of Lainlyn are various locations, including an encampment from the &lt;a href=\"Baandari%20Clan\"&gt;Baandari Clan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as, the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Rkundzelft\"&gt;Rkundzelft&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Withered Hand &amp; Alasan's Plot.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Tava's Blessing was used as the royal shipyard of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, though it was under the occupation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this time; the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; had begun to appear throughout the Alik'r Desert, taking the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Wards\"&gt;Ansei Wards&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Impervious%20Vault\"&gt;Impervious Vault&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. With the death of &lt;a href=\"Uwafa\"&gt;Uwafa&lt;/a&gt;, the Withered Hand traveled all over the Hollow Wastes under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Alasan\"&gt;Alasan&lt;/a&gt;. With his undead army, Alasan took over Tava's Blessing. To push back the Covenant, Alasan planned to turn into a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, with the power of the Ansei Ward and the surrounding energy. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Azah\"&gt;Prince Azah&lt;/a&gt; lead the Covenant attack on the port town, but because of Redguard tradition, they could not fight the &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt; utilized by Alasan. An &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant had intervened and fought the Ra-Netu, ultimately meeting with Alasan. Unfortunately, the Agent shattered the Ansei Ward, and Alasan's ritual was disrupted. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Maja\"&gt;Ansei Maja&lt;/a&gt;, the Ansei Ward was repaired, and Alasan's soul was trapped, freeing Tava's Blessing in the process. As time went on, Tava's Blessing would be renamed into Lainlyn, in honor of the &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn%20Family\"&gt;Lainlyn Family&lt;/a&gt; that lived in the region.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLainlyn during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Lainlyn in their quest to recover the pieces.\nBaron Shrike of Lainlyn &amp; the True Horn.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the Barony of Lainlyn was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Shrike\"&gt;Baron Shrike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Dh%27menka\"&gt;Baroness Dh'menka&lt;/a&gt;. Shrike was infamous throughout the Bay for being a ruthless and tyrannical ruler, forcing Lainlyn to bend to his whim. His brother, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kain\"&gt;Lord Kain&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Host%20of%20the%20Horn\"&gt;Host of the Horn&lt;/a&gt;, the local knightly order that enforced the Baron's lord. Kain did not take a liking to Shrike, and so the two formed a rival group called the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20True%20Horn\"&gt;Knights of the True Horn&lt;/a&gt;, with the purpose of overthrowing with a coup d'\u00e9tat. However, Kain's efforts were in vain, and the True Horn went their separate ways, waiting for Kain's call to arms, but it never came. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jaren\"&gt;Lord Jaren&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where he and various True Horn Knights created &lt;a href=\"Battlehorn%20Castle\"&gt;Battlehorn Castle&lt;/a&gt;. They remained on the estate until in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, where they were killed by marauders, ending Lord Kain's short legacy. Despite this, the Castle continued on, being occupied by an &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLainlyn during the Warp in the West.\nThe Barony of Lainlyn existed among the forty-four nations of the Iliac Bay, but it would be annexed into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; with the arrival of the Warp in the West. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;'s forces captured the regions of Hammerfell, from the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Abibon-Gora\"&gt;Barony of Abibon-Gora&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinel ultimately absorbed Lainlyn. Lainlyn's legacy has revolved around the Crowns, and with it being taken in by the Forebears of Sentinel, they were forced to bow to their adversaries. Though the Crowns were given a chance to fight back in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Ayaan-si\"&gt;Ayaan-si&lt;/a&gt; of the True Crowns rebelled against &lt;a href=\"King%20Lhotun\"&gt;King Lhotun&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel. This conflict would continue to grow, all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

At this point, the province of Hammerfell were members of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and so various Covenant ships were built in the city's ports, with Curly Lainlyn leading the helm on the project. Sometime later, the Barony of Tava's Blessing was renamed into Lainlyn, in honor of the family that has served them throughout out the eras."}

It is recorded that after the ordeal, Molag Bal shed a droplet of blood on her brow and left her to die.. She was a worshipper of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;.\nLamae was discovered by a tribe of nomads, who took care of her and attempted to heal her wounds. Despite their best efforts, however, she appeared to have died within a fortnight. The tribe then prepared to set her body aflame in a funeral pyre, but as it was still burning she rose up and emerged as the first pure-blood vampire. Enraged, she slaughtered the nomads by ripping out the throats of the tribe's women, eating the eyes of the children, and raping the men in a crazed act of violence.\nAs she was the first individual granted vampirism directly from Molag Bal himself, she became known as a &lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughter of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. This developed into a tradition among Molag Bal worshipping cults which dictated that females be offered to him on his summoning day. Few survive the ordeal, but those who do emerge as pure-blooded vampires. Being selected as an offering was considered to be an honor that is not rejected lightly.\nShe had also made her own cult of vampires in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Matron%27s%20Crypt\"&gt;Blood Matron's Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, where select few individuals would learn of Lamae's past and curse Arkay and Molag Bal. Upon completing the tasks, the initiate would go into a pool and have their blood drained out by the cult's priests. Lamae herself would then appear and turn the initiate into a vampire.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Scion%20of%20the%20Blood%20Matron\"&gt;Scion of the Blood Matron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; will complete the tasks and undergo a transformation into a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; directly from Lamae Bal.\nConversations.\n\"My beautiful abomination, how you shine in the dark.

This is because their very presence in the region constitutes something of a mystery.\nHow is it that creatures normally associated with the coastlands were able to find their way to such a brutal, unforgiving desert?\nI, your intrepid guide, your answerer of the unanswerable, made the journey to Craglorn in search of the truth.\nOn arriving in &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt; via the great highway that stretches from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, I ingratiated myself to the locals and plied them with the exotic wines I'd brought with me from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. Then they regaled me with all manner of stories concerning the lamias.\nBy far the strangest story is this one, related to me by a character of questionable morality in one of the local watering holes.\nA mage by the name of &lt;a href=\"Frederic%20Croyens\"&gt;Frederic Croyens&lt;/a&gt; crossed &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; collecting exotic creatures for his traveling menagerie. In &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, he spent many nights in the company of Wood Elves. These Elves were adherents of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; (the details of which are beyond comprehension to the civilized mind and irrelevant to this story).\nSuffice it to say, these Wood Elves introduced our mage to a panoply of curious concoctions of still more marvelous effects. After what amounted to anywhere from three days to a fortnight under the influence of these unusual unctions, it came about that the mage had been married to one of the local lamias.\nMy source in &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt; then went on to explain that the lamias in the caves and lakes of Craglorn are none other than the offspring of Frederic Croyens and his lamia wife, who journyed here with his traveling menagerie.\nI have no doubt that this story is utter hogwash. However, through independent research, I have been able to verify the existence of Frederic Croyens and his traveling menagerie. They did indeed visit Valenwood and &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; in the past. It seems more likely, however, that the &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lamias&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Craglorn by other means."}

When approached, he will initiate a conversation and explain he has beaten all previous foes and enemies, and his last challenge is to face the Dragonborn. Ultimately, his wish is for his soul to be sent to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe requests the Dragonborn to meet him at his &lt;a href=\"Last%20Vigil\"&gt;Last Vigil&lt;/a&gt;, a campsite located high in the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, for a fight to the death.\nResistances and immunities.\nThe Ebony Warrior has 50% resistance to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; damage through his enchanted apparel.

If he is attacked with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;, the effect may be reflected back onto the Dragonborn if it activates due to the Heavy Armor perk \"Reflect Blows.\" If Unrelenting Force is used to push him off a cliff, he will simply run back up to attack the Dragonborn, although he can take fall damage. He is also immune to &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the following &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt;:\nPerks.\nThe Ebony Warrior boasts a large number of perks in several skills which makes him a formidable opponent.\nKnown spells.\nDragon Shouts.\nThe Ebony Warrior is capable of using the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; and knows at least two\u00a0Dragon Shouts:\nEquipment.\nThe Ebony Warrior carries a selection of &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; ebony armor, &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;. This includes:\nCombat.\nThe Ebony Warrior will not acknowledge the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;'s motive for meeting him at his last vigil, nor will he initiate the battle. When talked to, he will only respond with generic dialogue until the Dragonborn attacks him. \nHe prefers melee combat in battle, using &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Cloak&lt;/a&gt; and mage armor spells in conjunction with his &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike common melee opponents, he is more aggressive in combat, frequently using power attacks and shield bashes. He also uses all three words of Unrelenting Force when in close proximity.\nHe will give chase or switch to his bow if the Dragonborn attempts to flee. Occasionally, his paralysis perks with his sword or bow render the Dragonborn immobile for several seconds.\nHe uses healing spells and will heal himself for a large amount if his health drops too low. He also possesses vigorous healing potions which he will use if he has taken enough damage.\nOne of the most potentially dangerous advantages the Ebony Warrior has in combat is the risk of damaging oneself upon striking him due to his &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; perk, &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20Blows\"&gt;Reflect Blows&lt;/a&gt;. The damage received is equal to that which was dealt and can potentially be fatal, especially if a sneak attack is used or on higher difficulty settings."}

This can allow a blocked blow to not be blocked, if the enemy desires after the first block, or it can keep an enemy blocking while they induced a stagger, thus negating their advantage while their opponent is semi-stunned. It can bring a fight to a close quickly enough to be the difference between loosing a little damage or a lot. It has an effect more than doubling damage."}

Enter &lt;a href=\"Drinith%20Ancestral%20Tomb%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Drinith Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt; where you'll find the first two clues.

After finding the first two clues, continue your way through the tomb into the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Kogoruhn\"&gt;Caverns of Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt;.

Few who do survive the experience. These large, muscular dogs with glowing red eyes are &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and often reside alongside &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, serving as guardians of their lairs. Should you find yourself face to face with one of these creatures, you likely have other, more pressing matters to deal with.\nWhile many death hounds remain indoors, serving as guard-dogs for their vampiric masters, there are those who roam the wilderness, as well. They play an important role in the ecology of the areas they inhabit, often to the detriment of the habitat itself. They are voracious, undead predators that attack everything alive in sight. It's still unclear whether they hunt prey for sustenance or merely to satisfy some unholy blood lust. They do eviscerate and consume their prey, but the wide variety of quarry suggests it is less about survival and more about temperament.\nOne of the most unique traits of the death hound is its wintry bite. It is often said that the death hound has a bite \"as cold as the grave.\" Almost like a poison, a bite from a death hound can freeze the very flesh of its prey and render it immobile. Whether this magic is somehow tied to the vampires, or just an innate quality of this monstrous creature, no one is certain.\nLocal &lt;a href=\"flora\"&gt;flora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt; tend to suffer in areas where death hounds abound. The beasts are so indiscriminate when hunting, they can raze an area and leave nothing left alive if they stay too long. Fortunately, vampire covens that operate in the wilderness are often transient in nature. They too, must relocate when their prey becomes scarce."}

Do you seek transport to Vvardenfell?\"\nAlmalexia \"Almalexia is one of the gods worshipped by the Dunmer in the Tribunal Temple. She's known as the Healing Mother and Lady of Mercy, the source of compassion and sympathy, and protector of the poor and weak. She's no tender-hearted powderpuff, though. She's an important symbol of Dunmer independence to those who resent the Empire, and the Hands of Almalexia -- her personal guard -- enforce a strict adherence to Temple doctrines.\"\nAthyn Llethan \"The former king was an old man and had been ill for a while. He had no sons or daughters. Helseth is Llethan's great-nephew -- Barenziah is Llethan's niece. Queen Barenziah renounced her claim to the throne, so, according to Imperial custom, the crown goes to Prince Helseth. He didn't do much, but we assumed he wasn't supposed to. We thought he was just a convenient fiction for Imperial administrative purposes.\"\nBarenziah \"She's the Queen Mother -- mother of King Hlaalu Helseth. She's also the widow of General Symmachus, the great Dunmer hero, and a former queen in her own right back in Wayrest. Many years ago she abdicated her throne and retired from public life here with her son. Now that her son has become king, you might expect him to respect her counsel and experience... or not. I pay no attention to MY mother.\"\nHelseth \"This new ruler, King Hlaalu Helseth, is trying to transform the role of King of Morrowind from a mere Imperial figurehead into a powerful, personalized head of state. Athyn Llethan, the previous king, was old and dignified, but few took him seriously. Helseth, by contrast, is dynamic and ambitious. Before Morrowind entered the Empire, the Dunmer had no kings, and many Dunmer prefer the old system of council rule, but Imperial partisans want a strong king along Western Imperial lines.\"\nlatest rumors \"The old king, Athyn Llethan, is dead. Long live King Hlaalu Helseth. Things are pretty grim here in the City of Light since the troubles with Dagoth Ur. Mournhold is Almalexia's city, and she's become more of a Warrior Queen than a Lady of Mercy. And there's always been hostility between the Temple and the Imperial administration, but since Helseth's accession, the tension between Imperial-leaning Dunmer and Almalexia's supporters is much worse.\"\nlittle advice \"Don't forget. You can't levitate in Mournhold. They say Almalexia doesn't want anyone's head rising higher than hers. If that's how you avoid trouble, it won't work here. You CAN levitate down in the sewers and ruins of Old Mournhold. I guess Almalexia doesn't go down there much. And it's also a cheap place to sleep, if you don't mind the rats and thieves.\"\nlittle secret \"If you are looking for access to the places of power, start with Tienius Delitian, King Helseth's Captain of the Royal Guard. He's fair and professional, and King Helseth is no simple figurehead, unlike his predecessor. There's real power there, and Helseth is just going to get more powerful as he learns how Mournhold works.\"\nMournhold \"Mournhold is the Imperial capital of Morrowind and the Holy City of Almalexia, one of Morrowind's three Living Gods. Modern Mournhold is built upon the ruins of Old Mournhold, which was destroyed by Mehrunes Dagon at the end of the First Era. You can reach the abandoned passages of Old Mournhold through the sewers beneath Mournhold, and adventurers still seek lost treasures in the First Era ruins.\"\nsewers and ruins \"If you're an adventurer, you'll want to go down there. The poor and the lawless live in the sewers under the city. It's dangerous -- but it's the only way to reach the ruins of Old Mournhold, where the real treasure lies. I'm probably wasting my breath -- but be careful down there. Maybe you think you're tough, and maybe you are... but there're things down there can kill you before you get your weapon out.\"\ntransport to Vvardenfell \"Do you wish to go back to Vvardenfell now?

The mechanism of the effects has, at present, been largely unknown\u2014theories of hidden knowledge and divine retribution were the subject of idle speculation with little investigation.\nI, &lt;a href=\"Justinius%20Poluhnius\"&gt;Justinius Poluhnius&lt;/a&gt;, have undertaken to thoroughly document the ailments afflicted by the Elder Scrolls on their readers, though a unified theory of how they manifest continues to elude me and remains a subject for future study.\nI have grouped the effects into four, finding that the avenue of experience depends largely upon the mind of the reader. If this is unclear, I hope that a proper dichotomy will lay it plain.\nGroup the First: The Naifs\nFor one who has received no training in the history or nature of the Elder Scrolls, the scroll itself is, effectively, inert. No prophecy can be scried nor knowledge obtained. While the scroll will not impart learning to the uninformed, nor will it afflict them in any adverse fashion. Visually, the scroll will appear to be awash in odd lettering and symbols. Those who know their astronomy often claim to recognize constellations in the patterns and connections, but such conjecture is impossible to further investigate since the very nature of this study necessitates unlearned subjects.\nGroup the Second: The Unguarded Intellects\nIt is this second group that realizes the greatest danger from attempting to read the scrolls. These are subjects who have an understanding of the nature of the Elder Scrolls and possess sufficient knowledge to actually read what is inscribed there. They have not, however, developed adequate discipline to stave off the mind-shattering effect of having a glimpse of infinity. These unfortunate souls are struck immediately, irrevocably, and completely blind. Such is the price for overreaching one's faculties. It bears mentioning, though, that with the blindness also comes a fragment of that hidden knowledge\u2014whether the future, the past, or the deep natures of being is dependent on the individual and their place in the greater spheres. But the knowledge does come.\nGroup the Third: Mediated Understanding\nAlone in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, it would appear that only the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Cult of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt; has discovered the discipline to properly guard one's mind when reading the scrolls. Their novitiates must undergo the most rigorous mental cultivation, and they often spend a decade or more at the monastery before being allowed to read their first Elder Scroll. The monks say this is for the initiates' own protection, as they must have witnessed many Unguarded Intellects among their more eager ranks. With appropriate fortitude, these readers also receive blindness, though at a far lesser magnitude than the Unguarded. Their vision fogs slightly, but they retain shape, color, and enough acuity to continue to read mundane texts. The knowledge they gain from the scroll is also tempered somewhat\u2014it requires stages of meditation and reflection to fully appreciate and express what one saw.\nGroup the Fourth: Illuminated Understanding\nBetween the previous group and this one exists a continuum that has, at present, only been traversed by the monks of the Ancestor Moth. With continued readings the monks become gradually more and more blind, but receive greater and more detailed knowledge. As they spend their waking hours pondering the revelations, they also receive a further degree of mental fortitude. There is, for every monk, a day of Penultimate Reading, when the only knowledge the Elder Scroll imparts is that the monk's next reading shall be his last.\nFor each monk the Penultimate Reading comes at a different and unknowable time\u2014preliminary work has been done to predict the occurrence by charting the severity of an individual monk's blindness, but all who reach these later stages report that the increasing blindness seems to taper with increased readings. Some pose the notion that some other, unseen, sense is, in fact, continuing to diminish at this upper range, but I shall leave such postulations to philosophers.\nTo prepare for his Ultimate Reading, a monk typically withdraws to seclusion in order to reflect upon a lifetime of revelations and appoint his mind for reception of his last. Upon this final reading, he is forever blinded as sure as those Unguarded ones who raced to knowledge. The Illuminated one, though, has retained his understanding over a lifetime and typically possesses a more integral notion of what has been revealed to him.\nIt is hoped that this catalog will prove useful to those who wish to further our mortal understanding of the Elder Scrolls. The Moth priests remain aloof about these matters, taking the gradual debilitation that comes with reading as a point of pride. May this serve as a useful starting point for those hoping to take up such study.\n---- Dictated to &lt;a href=\"Anstius%20Metchim\"&gt;Anstius Metchim&lt;/a&gt;, 4th of Last Seed in the &lt;a href=\"2E%20126\"&gt;126th year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;"}

I've started chewing dragonthorn like we used to in the old times. If I keep that up along with my tinctures for the months to come. I should be ready for the bonding. It'll be me this year. I know it.\nI'm so embarrassed. The dragonthorn is pungent. It's made my breath sour and the others have begun to notice. Even Mimme seems reluctant to talk to me. I complained of having bad salamander, but I'm going to have to be more discreet in chewing my herbs.\nI feel like it's working. I think my scales and claws are looking shinier. That's a good sign, I think. My teeth are staining yellow though. I've started drinking brewed scaldroot to clean my mouth. It tastes like death, but I think it'll help my teeth.\nKeenum accidentally took a sip of my scaldroot tea and nearly passed out. I had to work his watch at the uxith, so I couldn't get out to the dragonthorn patch until after dark. I was approached in the dark by a woman whose scales were so pale, especially under the moonlight. I almost screamed from fright, but she spoke warmly to me. She asked why I was picking dragonthorn in the dark of night and, I don't know why, but I told her the truth. I don't know why I would admit such a thing to a stranger. Maybe it's because she's a stranger. There's no one in the village I can speak to about it without a look of impotent pity. I spoke to the stranger long into the night. We agreed to meet again.\nI've gotten so little sleep lately, but I can't help it. &lt;a href=\"Ree-Nakal\"&gt;Ree-Nakal&lt;/a&gt; tells me she can only visit me in the night and I spend all day thinking about seeing her again. She understands my pain and it's such a relief to have someone who can listen. I don't feel the shame I do when the subject comes up at home. Ree-Nakal is one of the Veeskhleel, the Ghost People. I never expected her to be so nice. The Bright-Throats don't deal with them. Not many tribes do. They are treated like pariahs because they take eggs, but it can't be helped. They can't bear clutches themselves, so their Hist sends them to find others. It's so sad.\nI talked to Ree-Nakal about the bonding. I suggested that maybe the Bright-Throats could make an arrangement with the Ghost People for bonding rights, so they wouldn't have to steal eggs anymore. She thanked me, but it was just out of politeness. I could see it in her eyes that she held little hope of our tribes becoming allies. She said our bond was a unique one and it will have to be enough. I didn't press the matter. I didn't want to become for her what my tribe has become for me. I won't pity her.\nIt's a sad day. It's always a sad day when we learn which eggs will return to the Hist. Why does the Hist choose some eggs over others? I understand the eggs that are clearly unwell, but we can't always predict which will go on to hatch and which will sink in to the roots. I've always accepted that there's nothing we can do for them, but Ree-Nakal tells me that's not true. They can still be hatched. She offered to help me save them, if I can get the eggs to her. My tribe wouldn't even miss them. They've already given up on those children, but I won't. I'll care for them. They'll be our children.\nI was supposed to work with Keenam again tonight, but I spiked his drink with scaldroot extract. I should be able to slip away with a few eggs throughout the night. It's terrifying to think about, but those eggs need me. I won't give up because I'm scared.\nI did it. My skin was dry as dead bark when the morning watch came to relieve me. I told them that a few of the eggs returned to the Hist in the night and they just nodded and accepted it. I got a lump in my throat at how little the news bothered them.\nIt took me hours to fall asleep. I thought that the Tree-Minder would come and accuse me, but as I woke for my next watch, everything was perfectly normal. Does the Hist know what I've done?\nI've given Ree-Nakal nearly all the unfit eggs from our last clutch. There were so many when I think about it. Such a waste, but not now. She told me that the eggs I'd already brought to her are safely in nests under the watch of her tribe's folk and doing well. She doesn't think it wise for me to leave and see them just yet. Better to wait until after I've saved the last of the eggs. That shouldn't be much longer I think. I can barely keep my quill steady when I think about it.\nMy children are doing well, or so I'm told. I haven't been able to see my eggs yet. I'm reminded of their absence every day as I tend to the eggs in my village. I want to tend to my clutch. I'm their mother. Is this how the others feel when we are raising their eggs?\nRee-Nakal tells me the clutch is nearly hatched! I told her I want to be there for it, but she says it's not the time. The bonding ritual is coming again soon, and I would be missed. I don't care though. The tribe can do without me, but not those eggs. They need me!\nI haven't seen Ree-Nakal since we fought. I'm afraid she won't come back. If she doesn't, I don't know what I'll do. I don't know where to find her. I don't know where my children are! All I wanted was to see them!"}

Even that little smudge of a trading post would be a welcome escape from all the fuss at home. Things are more frantic than usual this year and it seems as though all eyes are upon the egg-tenders. I've barely had a minute's peace to think, let alone put quill to paper. Perhaps things will settle down when you return with supplies for the ceremony. I hope you return soon.

These adorable creatures come in a variety of sizes, roles, and dispositions, each more beautiful than the last. Our goal, of course, is the welfare of each and every kwama in Vvardenfell, but many see these majestic creatures only as sources of profit. Remember though, a happy mine is a productive mine! It's in the best interest of all that we treat kwama with respect and dignity.\nKwama are best known for their relation to egg-mining, and of course there can be no eggs without a queen. Kwama queens are beautiful beings, far larger than any other kwama. Good thing for us, for she's the one who produces all of the yummy eggs which end up on our dinner plates! A queen in distress is not only a sad sight to see, it also can cause egg productivity to plummet. Make sure your queen is well fed, and at the end of the day you'll end up with a full belly, too!\nYou're not the only one taking care of the queen, of course. She has kwama foragers, warriors, and workers at her disposal. Each of these kwama have important roles to play in the colony, and each makes sure their queen is well fed or well protected. If you want a happy queen, you need a happy colony. The reverse is also quite true! A distressed queen always leads to an upset colony, and that hurts productivity.\nKwama foragers serve as the scouts of the colony, always looking for new homes and suitable prey. If met in the wild, it's best to resist the urge to pet these lovely creatures, as they can be quite aggressive. I'm sure you would be a bit peeved as well if some stranger came up to pat you on the head! Keep your distance and these little fellows shouldn't harm you.\nA kwama built to inflict harm, however, is the mighty warrior. Though not as large as their lovely queen, these soldiers are often taller than your common Dark Elf. Don't be too awestruck if you meet one! A hasty exit is usually your best chance to escape the mine unscathed. Workers often emit special scents to protect them from a kwama warrior's wrath. Make sure that you speak to a knowledgeable alchemist if you wish to obtain the proper scents.\nAnd last, but most certainly not least, is the ever busy kwama worker! My word, but there would be no colony at all without these bustling bugs! The kwama worker digs the tunnels, tends to the queen, and watches over the precious eggs until they're ready to harvest. They're often nonaggressive, but best not to disturb these little ones while they're about their work. You never know if a kwama warrior lurks around the corner.\nThese basics provide the start in understanding our hard-shelled little friends! Further chapters in this volume will explore breeding methods, nutrition guides, mining practices, and much more! Join me in the journey, and together we can protect kwama of all kinds."}

The Wandering Ehlnofey expected to be welcomed into the peaceful realm, but the Old Ehlnofey looked on them as degenerates, fallen from their former glory. For whatever reason, war broke out, and raged across the whole of Nirn.\nThe Old Ehlnofey retained their ancient power and knowledge, but the Wandering Ehlnofey were more numerous, and toughened by their long struggle to survive on Nirn. This war reshaped the face of Nirn, sinking much of the land beneath new oceans, and leaving the continents that would be later known as &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;; with &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; having been completely sunk beneath the ocean's surface while &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; became ruined and lost to time.

It is this mechanism that makes it impossible to ever truly kill a Daedra, because they simply return to the planes of Oblivion and then project themselves back to the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; once again. The implication is that there are (and always will be) bonds between these planes and our own.\nThis begs the question, however, if you kill a Daedra within its respective &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, is it then truly annihilated? What about if the Daedra is slain while within one of the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aedric planes&lt;/a&gt; of existence? I am fortunate enough to have had the privilege of engaging several Daedra on this subject and I can assure you that they are not forthcoming on this topic.\nWhat I have been able to glean, mostly by way of observing their reactions to my suggestions, is that Daedra do not often, nor do they appear to care to, travel to the planes of existence dominated by Aedric influences. Realms such as the many varieties of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; being a prime example) do not appear suitable for the travel of Daedric creatures.\nI would hypothesize based on this information, and from information gathered from other sources, that the Aedric planes do not share the same energetic tie to the Daedric planes that they share to one another and to the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it might be possible that a Daedric vestige slain in an Aedric plane cannot return to its home plane, and thus is left dead or simply trapped for all eternity. The irony doesn't escape me that if this proves true, then a Daedra can only truly die after it enters heaven."}

Another day in Orsinium. Honestly, Clavel, if we don't return to &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; soon, I may lose my mind.\nWhat shameless merchants operate out of this city! You'll never believe what one of these Orc vendors tried to sell me. I was minding my own business, examining an assortment of roots and snowberries\u2014they were all shriveled and rancid, by the way\u2014when this toothless merchant shoved a bowl of fat in my face. A huge bowl of fat. Can you imagine? He claimed it was the fat from some legendary &lt;a href=\"troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; or some such nonsense. I asked him why anyone would buy such a thing and his rheumy eyes just lit up. Would you like to know more about &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll fat&lt;/a&gt;? I'm something of an expert now.\nDid you know that troll fat is the densest fat in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;? Denser even than &lt;a href=\"horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Horker&lt;/a&gt; fat? I bet you didn't. Apparently, it makes an excellent lubricant that's especially ideal for cold-weather use. And we know all about cold weather here in &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, don't we?\nArmor looking a bit dull? Why not rub some of this repulsive fat on it? I hear that no polish in all of Tamriel does a better job than troll fat! It can be used in poultices and various potions. It can be rubbed on window sills to keep out vermin. It can be dried and eaten as a kind of disgusting jerky. It can be boiled to make a particularly strong glue. It can even cure vampirism! Who knew?\nWhen he started talking about the many uses for troll fat in the bedroom, I had to take my leave.\nHe also mentioned that it could be used to talk to Malacath. That was at least a little interesting. Apparently, if you rub troll fat on an idol of Malacath, it allows you to talk to the Prince himself. I may have to try this. I'd love to ask him why his little green children peddle such atrocious wares!\nI'm giving this place another week. If I'm offered one more wedge of echatere cheese or a stewed mammoth stomach, I'm on the next ship back to Vulkhel Guard\u2014with or without you!"}

Not until the sun burned through her window, infusing the light wood and flesh colors of her chamber in a milky glow did she open her eyes. It was quiet and serene, a stunning reverse of the flavor of her dreams, so full of blood and celebration. For a few moments, she simply stared at the ceiling, trying to sort through her visions.\nIn the courtyard of her palace was a boiling pool which steamed in the coolness of the winter morning. At the wave of her hand, it cleared and she saw the face and form of her lover &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; in his study to the north. She did not want to speak right away: he looked so handsome in his dark red robes, writing his poetry as he did every morning.\n\"Vivec,\" she said, and he raised his head in a smile, looking at her face across thousands of miles. \"I have seen a vision of the end of the war.\"\n\"After eighty years, I don't think anyone can imagine an end,\" said Vivec with a smile, but he grew serious, trusting Almalexia's prophecies. \"Who will win? Morrowind or the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;ic Empire?\"\n\"Without &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, we will lose,\" she replied.\n\"My intelligence tells me the Empire will strike us to the north in early springtide, by &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt; at the latest. Could you go to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; and convince him to return?\"\n\"I'll leave tomorrow,\" she said, simply.\n4 Morning Star, 2920&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Empress paced around her cell. Wintertide gave her wasteful energy, while in the summer she would merely sit by her window and be grateful for each breath of stale swamp wind that came to cool her. Across the room, her unfinished tapestry of a dance at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Court seemed to mock her. She ripped it from its frame, tearing the pieces apart as they drifted to the floor.\nThen she laughed at her own useless gesture of defiance. She would have plenty of time to repair it and craft a hundred more. The &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; had locked her up in Castle Giovesse seven years ago, and would likely keep her here until he or she died.\nWith a sigh, she pulled the cord to call her knight, &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared at the door within minutes, fully uniformed as befitted an Imperial Guard. Most of the native &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; tribesmen of Black Marsh preferred to go about naked, but Zuuk had taken a positive delight to fashion. His silver, reflective skin was scarcely visible, only on his face, neck, and hands.\n\"Your Imperial Highness,\" he said with a bow.\n\"Zuuk,\" said &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress Tavia&lt;/a&gt;. \"I'm bored. Lets discuss methods of assassinating my husband today.\"\n14 Morning Star, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe chimes proclaiming &lt;a href=\"South%20Wind%27s%20Prayer\"&gt;South Wind's Prayer&lt;/a&gt; echoed through the wide boulevards and gardens of the Imperial City, calling all to their temples. The &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; always attended a service at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, while his son and heir &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; found it more political to attend a service at a different temple for each religious holiday. This year, it was at the cathedral &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Benevolence 's services were mercifully short, but it was not until well after noon that the Emperor was able to return to the palace. By then, the arena combatants were impatiently waiting for the start of the ceremony. The crowd was far less restless, as the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; had arranged for a demonstration from a troupe of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"acrobat\"&gt;acrobat&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Your religion is so much more convenient than mine,\" said the Emperor to his Potentate by way of an apology. \"What is the first game?\"\n\"A one-on-one battle between two able warriors,\" said the Potentate, his scaly skin catching the sun as he rose. \"Armed befitting their culture.\"\n\"Sounds good,\" said the Emperor and clapped his hands. \"Let the sport commence!\"\nAs soon as he saw the two warriors enter the arena to the roar of the crowd, Emperor Reman III remembered that he had agreed to this several months before and forgotten about it. One combatant was the Potentate's son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, a glistening ivory-yellow eel, gripping his &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wakizashi\"&gt;wakizashi&lt;/a&gt; with his thin, deceptively weak looking arms. The other was the Emperor's son, Prince Juilek, in &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor\"&gt;Ebony armor&lt;/a&gt; with a savage &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Helmet\"&gt;Orcish helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longsword\"&gt;longsword&lt;/a&gt; at his side.\n\"This will be fascinating to watch,\" hissed the Potentate, a wide grin across his narrow face. \"I don't know if I've even seen a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; fight an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; like this. Usually it's army against army. At last we can settle which philosophy is better -- to create armor to combat swords as your people do, or to create swords to combat armor as mine do.\"\nNo one in the crowd, aside from a few scattered Akaviri counselors and the Potentate himself wanted Savirien-Chorak to win, but there was a collective intake of breath at the sight of his graceful movements. His swords seemed to be a part of him, a tail coming from his arms to match the one behind him. It was a trick of counterbalance, allowing the young serpent man to roll up into a circle and spin into the center of the ring in offensive position. The Prince had to plod forward the less impressive traditional way.\nAs they sprang at each other, the crowd bellowed with delight. The Akaviri was like a moon in orbit around the Prince, effortlessly springing over his shoulder to attempt a blow from behind, but the Prince whirled around quickly to block with his shield. His counter-strike met only air as his foe fell flat to the ground and slithered between his legs, tripping him. The Prince fell to the ground with a resounding crash.\nMetal and air melted together as Savirien-Chorak rained strike after strike upon the Prince, who blocked every one with his shield.\n\"We don't have shields in our culture,\" murmured Versidue-Shaie to the Emperor. \"It seems strange to my boy, I imagine. In our country, if you don't want to get hit, you move out of the way.\"\nWhen Savirien-Chorak was rearing back to begin another series of blinding attacks, the Prince kicked at his tail, sending him falling back momentarily. In an instant, he had rebounded, but the Prince was also back on his feet. The two circled one another, until the snake man spun forward, &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; extended. The Prince saw his foe's plan, and blocked the katana with his longsword and the wakizashi with his shield. Its short punching blade impaled itself in the metal, and Savirien-Chorak was thrown off balance.\nThe Prince's longblade slashed across the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;'s chest and the sudden, intense pain caused him to drop both his weapons. In a moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostate in the dust with the Prince's longsword at his throat.\n\"The game's over!\" shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause from the stadium.\nThe Prince grinned and helped Savirien-Chorak up and over to a healer. The Emperor clapped his Potentate on the back, feeling relieved. He had not realized when the fight had begun how little chance he had given his son at victory.\n\"He will make a fine warrior,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"And a great emperor.\"\n\"Just remember,\" laughed the Emperor. \"You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.\"\n\"Oh, I'll remember that,\" nodded the Potentate.\n&lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; thought about that comment for the rest of the games, and had trouble fully enjoying himself. Could the Potentate be another enemy, just as the Empress had turned out to be? The matter would bear watching.\n21 Morning Star, 2920Mournhold, Morrowind\n\"Why don't you wear that green gown I gave you?\" asked the Duke of Mournhold, watching the young maiden put on her clothes.\n\"It doesn't fit,\" smiled Turala. \"And you know I like red.\"\n\"It doesn't fit because you're getting fat,\" laughed the Duke, pulling her down on the bed, kissing her breasts and the pouch of her stomach. She laughed at the tickles, but pulled herself up, wrapping her red robe around her.\n\"I'm round like a woman should be,\" said Turala. \"Will I see you tomorrow?\"\n\"No,\" said the Duke. \"I must entertain Vivec tomorrow, and the next day the Duke of Ebonheart is coming. Do you know, I never really appreciated Almalexia and her political skills until she left?\"\n\"It is the same with me,\" smiled Turala. \"You will only appreciate me when I'm gone.\"\n\"That's not true at all,\" snorted the Duke. \"I appreciate you now.\"\nTurala allowed the Duke one last kiss before she was out the door. She kept thinking about what he said. Would he appreciate her more or less when he knew that she was getting fat because she was carrying his child? Would he appreciate her enough to marry her?\nThe Year Continues in 2920, Sun's Dawn (v2)\n2920, vol 02 - Sun's Dawn.\n3 Sun's Dawn, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; watched the initiates float one by one up to the oassom tree, taking a fruit or a flower from its high branches before dropping back to the ground with varying degrees of grace. He took a moment while nodding his head in approval to admire the day. The whitewashed statue of &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, which the great mage was said to have posed for in ancient days, stood at the precipice of the cliff overlooking the bay. Pale purple &lt;a href=\"proscato%20flowers\"&gt;proscato flowers&lt;/a&gt; waved to and fro in the gentle breeze. Beyond, ocean, and the misty border between Artaeum and the main island of Summurset.\n\"By and large, acceptable,\" he proclaimed as the last student dropped her fruit in his hand. With a wave of his hand, the fruit and flowers were back in the tree. With another wave, the students had formed into position in a semicircle around the sorcerer. He pulled a small fibrous ball, about a foot in diameter from his white robes.\n\"What is this?\"\nThe students understood this test. It asked them to cast a spell of identification on the mysterious object. Each initiate closed his or her eyes and imagined the ball in the realm of the universal Truth. Its energy had a unique resonance as all physical and spiritual matter does, a negative aspect, a duplicate version, relative paths, true meaning, a song in the cosmos, a texture in the fabric of space, a facet of being that has always existed and always will exist.\n\"A ball,\" said a young &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; named Welleg, which brought giggles from some of the younger initiates, but a frown from most, including Sotha Sil.\n\"If you must be stupid, at least be amusing,\" growled the sorcerer, and then looked at a young, dark-haired &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; lass who looked confused. \"&lt;a href=\"Lilatha\"&gt;Lilatha&lt;/a&gt;, do you know?\"\n\"It's grom,\" said Lilatha, uncertainly. \"What the &lt;a href=\"dreugh\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt; meff after they've k-k-kr-&lt;a href=\"krevinasim\"&gt;krevinasim&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Karvinasim, but very good, nonetheless,\" said Sotha Sil. \"Now, tell me, what does that mean?\"\n\"I don't know,\" admitted Lilatha. The rest of the students also shook their heads.\n\"There are layers to understanding all things,\" said Sotha Sil. \"The common man looks at an object and fits it into a place in his way of thinking. Those skilled in the Old Ways, in the way of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, can see an object and identify it by its proper role. But one more layer is needed to be peeled back to achieve understanding. You must identify the object by its role and its truth and interpret that meaning. In this case, this ball is indeed &lt;a href=\"grom\"&gt;grom&lt;/a&gt;, which is a substance created by the dreugh, an underwater race in the north and western parts of the continent. For one year of their life, they undergo karvinasim when they walk upon the land. Following that, they return to the water and meff, or devour the skin and organs they needed for land-dwelling. Then they vomit it up into little balls like this. Grom. Dreugh vomit.\"\nThe students looked at the ball a little queasily. Sotha Sil always loved this lesson.\n4 Sun's Dawn, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Spies,\" muttered the Emperor, sitting in his bath, staring at a lump on his foot. \"All around me, traitors and spies.\"\nHis mistress &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; washed his back, her legs wrapped around his waist. She knew after all these many years when to be sensual and when to be sexual. When he was in a mood like this, it was best to be calmly, soothingly, seductively sensual. And not to say a word unless he asked her a direct question.\nWhich he did: \"What do you think when a fellow steps on his Imperial Majesty's foot and says 'I'm sorry, Your &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Majesty'? Don't you think 'Pardon me, Your Imperial Majesty' is more appropriate? 'I'm sorry,' well that almost sounds like the bastard Argonian was sorry I am his Imperial Majesty. That he hopes we lose the war with Morrowind, that's what it sounds like.\"\n\"What would make you feel better?\" asked Rijja. \"Would you like him flogged? He is only, as you say, the Battlechief of &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;. It would teach him to mind where he's stepping.\"\n\"My father would have flogged him. My grandfather would have had him killed,\" the Emperor grumbled. \"But I don't mind if they all step on my feet, provided they respect me. And don't plot against me.\"\n\"You must trust someone.\"\n\"Only you,\" smiled the Emperor, turning slightly to give Rijja a kiss. \"And my son &lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Juilek&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose, though I wish he were a little more cautious.\"\n\"And your council, and the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Rijja.\n\"A pack of spies and a snake,\" laughed the Emperor, kissing his mistress again. As they began to make love, he whispered, \"As long as you're true, I can handle the world.\"\n13 Sun's Dawn, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nTurala stood at the black, bejeweled city gates. A wind howled around her, but she felt nothing.\nThe Duke had been furious upon hearing his favorite mistress was pregnant and cast her from his sight. She tried again and again to see him, but his guards turned her away. Finally, she returned to her family and told them the truth. If only she had lied and told them she did not know who the father was. A soldier, a wandering adventurer, anyone. But she told them that the father was the Duke, a member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. And they did what she knew they would have to do, as proud members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon her hand was burned the sign of Expulsion her weeping father had branded on her. But the Duke's cruelty hurt her far more. She looked out the gate and into the wide winter plains. Twisted, sleeping trees and skies without birds. No one in Morrowind would take her in now. She must go far away.\nWith slow, sad steps, she began her journey.\n16 Sun's Dawn, 2920 &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, Anequina (modern day &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;)\n\"What troubles you?\" asked Queen &lt;a href=\"Hasaama\"&gt;Hasaama&lt;/a&gt;, noticing her husband's sour mood. At the end of most &lt;a href=\"Lovers%27%20Days\"&gt;Lovers' Days&lt;/a&gt; he was in an excellent mood, dancing in the ballroom with all the guests, but tonight he retired early. When she found him, he was curled in the bed, frowning.\n\"That blasted &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt;'s tale about Polydor and Eloisa put me in a rotten state,\" he growled. \"Why did he have to be so depressing?\"\n\"But isn't that the truth of the tale, my dear? Weren't they doomed because of the cruel nature of the world?\"\n\"It doesn't matter what the truth is, he did a rotten job of telling a rotten tale, and I'm not going to let him do it anymore,\" King &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zel\"&gt;Dro'Zel&lt;/a&gt; sprang from the bed. His eyes were rheumy with tears. \"Where did they say he was from again?\"\n\"I believe &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; in easternmost &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the Queen, shaken. \"My husband, what are you going to do?\"\nDro'Zel was out of the room in a single spring, bounding up the stairs to his tower. If Queen Hasaama knew what her husband was going to do, she did not try to stop him. He had been erratic of late, prone to fits and even occasional seizures. But she never suspected the depths of his madness, and his loathing for the bard and his tale of the wickedness and perversity found in mortal man.\n19 Sun's Dawn, 2920Gilverdale, Valenwood\n\"Listen to me again,\" said the old carpenter. \"If cell three holds worthless brass, then cell two holds the gold key. If cell one holds the gold key, then cell three hold worthless brass. If cell two holds worthless brass, then cell one holds the gold key.\"\n\"I understand,\" said the lady. \"You told me. And so cell one holds the gold key, right?\"\n\"No,\" said the carpenter. \"Let me start from the top.\"\n\"Mama?\" said the little boy, pulling on his mother's sleeve.\n\"Just one moment, dear, mother's talking,\" she said, concentrating on the riddle. \"You said 'cell three holds the golden key if cell two holds worthless brass,' right?\"\n\"No,\" said the carpenter patiently. \"Cell three holds worthless brass, if cell two --\"\n\"Mama!\" cried the boy. His mother finally looked.\nA bright red mist was pouring over the town in a wave, engulfing building after building in its wake. Striding before was a red-skinned giant. The &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. He was smiling.\n29 Sun's Dawn, 2920Gilverdale, Valenwood\n&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; stopped her steed in the vast moor of mud to let him drink from the river. He refused to, even seemed repelled by the water. It struck her as odd: they had been making excellent time from Mournhold, and surely he must be thirsty. She dismounted and joined her retinue.\n\"Where are we now?\" she asked.\nOne of her ladies pulled out a map. \"I thought we were approaching a town called Gilverdale.\"\nAlmalexia closed her eyes and opened them again quickly. The vision was too much to bear. As her followers watched, she picked up a piece of brick and a fragment of bone, and clutched them to her heart.\n\"We must continue on to Artaeum,\" she said quietly.\nThe Year continues in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2003%20-%20First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;.\n2920, vol 03 - First Seed.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;Book Three of 2920, The Last Year of the First Era\n15 First Seed, 2920Caer Suvio, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nFrom their vantage point high in the hills, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt; could still see the spires of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but he knew he was far away from hearth and home. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Glavius\"&gt;Lord Glavius&lt;/a&gt; had a luxurious villa, but it was not close to being large enough to house the entire army within its walls. Tents lined the hillsides, and the soldiers were flocking to enjoy his lordship's famous hot springs. Little wonder: winter chill still hung in the air.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt;, your son, is not feeling well.\"\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; spoke, the Emperor jumped. How that &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; could slither across the grass without making a sound was a mystery to him.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;ed, I'd wager,\" grumbled Reman. \"See to it he gets a healer. I told him to hire a taster like I have, but the boy's headstrong. There are spies all around us, I know it.\"\n\"I believe you're right, your imperial majesty,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"These are treacherous times, and we must take precautions to see that Morrowind does not win this war, either on the field or by more insidious means. That is why I would suggest that you not lead the vanguard into battle. I know you would want to, as your illustrious ancestors &lt;a href=\"Reman%20I\"&gt;Reman I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brazollus%20Dor\"&gt;Brazollus Dor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; did, but I fear it would be foolhardy. I hope you do not mind me speaking frankly like this.\"\n\"No,\" nodded Reman. \"I think you're right. Who would lead the vanguard then?\"\n\"I would say Prince Juilek, if he were feeling better,\" replied the Akavir. \"Failing that, Storig of &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Naghea\"&gt;Queen Naghea&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Riverhold\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; at left flank, and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Ulaqth\"&gt;Ulaqth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; at right flank.\"\n\"A &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; at left flank and an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; at right,\" frowned the Emperor. \"I never do trust beastfolk.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; took no offense. He knew that \"beastfolk\" referred to the natives of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, not to the Tsaesci of Akavir like himself. \"I quite agree your imperial majesty, but you must agree that they hate the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Ulaqth has a particular grudge after all the slave-raids on his lands by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nThe Emperor conceded it was so, and the Potentate retired. It was surprising, thought Reman, but for the first time, the Potentate seemed trustworthy. He was a good man to have on one's side.\n18 First Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Erfoud\"&gt;Ald Erfoud&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\n\"How far is the Imperial Army?\" asked &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Two days' march,\" replied his lieutenant. \"If we march all night tonight, we can get higher ground at the &lt;a href=\"Pryai%20River\"&gt;Pryai&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow morning. Our intelligence tells us the Emperor will be commanding the rear, Storig of Farrun has the vanguard, Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.\"\n\"Ulaqth,\" whispered Vivec, an idea forming. \"Is this intelligence reliable? Who brought it to us?\"\n\"A &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; spy in the Imperial Army,\" said the lieutenant and gestured towards a young, sandy-haired man who stepped forward and bowed to Vivec.\n\"What is your name and why is a Breton working for us against the Cyrodiils?\" asked Vivec, smiling.\n\"My name is &lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr Whitley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the man. \"And I am working for you because not everyone can say he spied for a god. And I understood it would be, well, profitable.\"\nVivec laughed, \"It will be, if your information is accurate.\"\n19 First Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nThe quiet hamlet of Bodrum looked down on the meandering river, the Pryai. It was an idyllic site, lightly wooded where the water took the bend around a steep bluff to the east with a gorgeous wildflower meadow to the west. The strange flora of Morrowind met the strange flora of Cyrodiil on the border and commingled gloriously.\n\"There will be time to sleep when you've finished!\"\nThe soldiers had been hearing that all morning. It was not enough that they had been marching all night, now they were chopping down trees on the bluff and damming the river so its waters spilled over. Most of them had reached the point where they were too tired to complain about being tired.\n\"Let me be certain I understand, my lord,\" said Vivec's lieutenant. \"We take the bluff so we can fire arrows and spells down on them from above. That's why we need all the trees cleared out. Damming the river floods the plain below so they'll be trudging through mud, which should hamper their movement.\"\n\"That's exactly half of it,\" said Vivec approvingly. He grabbed a nearby soldier who was hauling off the trees. \"Wait, I need you to break off the straightest, strongest branches of the trees and whittle them into spears. If you recruit a hundred or so others, it won't take you more than a few hours to make all we need.\"\nThe soldier wearily did as he was bade. The men and women got to work, fashioning spears from the trees.\n\"If you don't mind me asking,\" said the lieutenant. \"The soldiers don't need any more weapons. They're too tired to hold the ones they've got.\"\n\"These spears aren't for holding,\" said Vivec and whispered, \"If we tired them out today, they'll get a good night's sleep tonight\" before he got to work supervising their work.\nIt was essential that they be sharp, of course, but equally important that they be well balanced and tapered proportionally. The perfect point for stability was a pyramid, not the conical point of some lances and spears. He had the men hurl the spears they had completed to test their strength, sharpness, and balance, forcing them to begin on a new one if they broke. Gradually, out of sheer exhaustion from doing it wrong, the men learned how to create the perfect wooden spears. Once they were through, he showed them how they were to be arranged and where.\nThat night, there was no drunken pre-battle carousing, and no nervous neophytes stayed up worrying about the battle to come. As soon as the sun sank beneath the wooded hills, the camp was at rest, but for the sentries.\n20 First Seed, 2920Bodrum, Morrowind\n&lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt; was exhausted. For last six days, he had gambled and whored all night and then marched all day. He was looking forward to the battle, but even more than that, he was looking forward to some rest afterwards. He was in the Emperor's command at the rear flank, which was good because it seemed unlikely that he would be killed. On the other hand, it meant traveling over the mud and waste the army ahead left in their wake.\nAs they began the trek through the wildflower field, Miramor and all the soldiers around him sank ankle-deep in cold mud. It was an effort to even keep moving. Far, far up ahead, he could see the vanguard of the army led by Lord Storig emerging from the meadow at the base of a bluff.\nThat was when it all happened.\nAn army of Dunmer appeared above the bluff like rising &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, pouring fire and floods of arrows down on the vanguard. Simultaneously, a company of men bearing the flag of the Duke of Mournhold galloped around the shore, disappearing along the shallow river's edge where it dipped to a timbered glen to the east. Warchief Ulaqth nearby on the right flank let out a bellow of revenge at the sight and gave chase. Queen Naghea sent her flank towards the embankment to the west to intercept the army on the bluff.\nThe Emperor could think of nothing to do. His troops were too bogged down to move forward quickly and join the battle. He ordered them to face east towards the timber, in case Mournhold's company was trying to circle around through the woods. They never came out, but many men, facing west, missed the battle entirely. Miramor kept his eyes on the bluff.\nA tall Dunmer he supposed must have been Vivec gave a signal, and the battlemages cast their spells at something to the west. From what transpired, Miramor deduced it was a dam. A great torrent of water spilled out, washing Naghea's left flank into the remains of the vanguard and the two together down river to the east.\nThe Emperor paused, as if waiting for his vanquished army to return, and then called a retreat. Miramor hid in the rushes until they had passed by and then waded as quietly as he could to the bluff.\nThe Morrowind army was retiring as well back to their camp. He could hear them celebrating above him as he padded along the shore. To the east, he saw the Imperial Army. They had been washed into a net of spears strung across the river, Naghea's left flank on Storig's vanguard on Ulaqth's right flank, bodies of hundreds of soldiers strung together like beads.\nMiramor took whatever valuables he could carry from the corpses and then ran down the river. He had to go many miles before the water was clear again, unpolluted by blood.\n29 First Seed, 2920 &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;\n\"You have a letter from the Imperial City,\" said the chief priestess, handing the parchment to &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;. All the young priestesses smiled and made faces of astonishment, but the truth was that Corda's sister &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; wrote very often, at least once a month.\nCorda took the letter to the garden to read it, her favorite place, an oasis in the monochromatic sand-colored world of the conservatorium The letter itself was nothing unusual: filled with court gossip, the latest fashions which were tending to winedark velvets, and reports of the Emperor's ever-growing paranoia.\n\"You are so lucky to be away from all of this,\" wrote Rijja. \"The Emperor is convinced that his latest battlefield fiasco is all a result of spies in the palace. He has even taken to questioning me. Ruptga keep it so you never have a life as interesting as mine.\"\nCorda listened to the sounds of the desert and prayed to &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; the exact opposite wish.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2004%20-%20Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\n2920, vol 04 - Rain's Hand.\n&lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;Book Four of 2920, The Last Year of the First Era\nby &lt;a href=\"Carlovac%20Townway\"&gt;Carlovac Townway&lt;/a&gt;\n3 Rain's Hand, 2920&lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; proceeded as quickly as he could through the blackened halls of the palace, half-submerged in brackish water. All around him, nasty gelatinous creatures scurried into the reeds, bursts of white fire lit up the upper arches of the hall before disappearing, and smells assaulted him, rancid death one moment, sweet flowered perfume the next. Several times he had visited the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; princes in their &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, but every time, something different awaited him.\nHe knew his purpose, and refused to be distracted.\nEight of the more prominent &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20princes\"&gt;Daedra princes&lt;/a&gt; were awaiting him in the half-melted, domed room. &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Dusk and Dawn; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Plots; &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, Daedra of Knowledge; &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the Hunter; &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, God of Curses; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Disaster; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Rage; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the Mad One.\nAbove them, the sky cast tormented shadows upon the meeting.\n5 Rain's Hand, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset&lt;/a&gt;\nSotha Sil's voice cried out, echoing from the cave, \"Move the rock!\"\nImmediately, the initiates obeyed, rolling aside the great boulder that blocked the entrance to &lt;a href=\"the%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;the Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Sotha Sil emerged, his face smeared with ash, weary. He felt he had been away for months, years, but only a few days had transpired. Lilatha took his arm to help him walk, but he refused her help with a kind smile and a shake of his head.\n\"Were you ... successful?\" she asked.\n\"The Daedra princes I spoke with have agreed to our terms,\" he said flatly. \"Disasters such as befell &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; should be averted. Only through certain intermediaries such as witches or sorcerers will they answer the call of man and mer.\"\n\"And what did you promise them in return?\" asked the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; boy &lt;a href=\"Welleg\"&gt;Welleg&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The deals we make with Daedra,\" said Sotha Sil, continuing on to &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;' palace to meet with the Master of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. \"Should not be discussed with the innocent.\"\n8 Rain's Hand, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nA storm billeted the windows of the Prince's bedchamber, bringing a smell of moist air to mix with the censors filled with burning incense and herbs.\n\"A letter has arrived from the Empress, your mother,\" said the courier. \"Anxiously inquiring after your health.\"\n\"What frightened parents I have!\" laughed &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; from his bed.\n\"It is only natural for a mother to worry,\" said &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;'s son.\n\"There is everything unnatural about my family, &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. My exiled mother fears that my father will imagine me of being a traitor, covetous of the crown, and is having me &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Prince sank back into his pillow, annoyed. \"The Emperor has insisted on me having a taster for all my meals as he does.\"\n\"There are many plots,\" agreed the Akavir. \"You have been abed for nearly three weeks with every healer in the empire shuffling through like a slow ballroom dance. At least, all can see that you're getting stronger.\"\n\"Strong enough to lead the vanguard against Morrowind soon, I hope,\" said Juilek.\n11 Rain's Hand, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset&lt;/a&gt;\nThe initiates stood quietly in a row along the arbor loggia, watching the long, deep, marble-lined trench ahead of them flash with fire. The air above it vibrated with the waves of heat. Though each student kept his or her face sturdy and emotionless, as a true Psijic should, their terror was nearly as palpable as the heat. Sotha Sil closed his eyes and uttered the charm of fire resistance. Slowly, he walked across the basin of leaping flames, climbing to the other side, unscathed. Not even his white robe had been burned.\n\"The charm is intensified by the energy you bring to it, by your own skills, just as all spells are,\" he said. \"Your imagination and your willpower are the keys. There is no need for a spell to give you a resistance to air, or a resistance to flowers, and after you cast the charm, you must forget there is even a need for a spell to give you resistance to fire. Do not confuse what I am saying: resistance is not about ignoring the fire's reality. You will feel the substance of flame, the texture of it, its hunger, and even the heat of it, but you will know that it will not hurt or injure you.\"\nThe students nodded and one by one, they cast the spell and made the walk through the fire. Some even went so far as to bend over and scoop up a handful of fire and feed it air, so it expanded like a bubble and melted through their fingers. Sotha Sil smiled. They were fighting their fear admirably.\nThe Chief Proctor &lt;a href=\"Thargallith\"&gt;Thargallith&lt;/a&gt; came running from the arbor arches, \"Sotha Sil! &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Artaeum. Iachesis told me to fetch you.\"\nSotha Sil turned to Thargallith for only a moment, but he knew instantly from the screams what had transpired. The Nord lad Wellig had not cast the spell properly and was burning. The smell of scorched hair and flesh panicked the other students who were struggling to get out of the basin, pulling him with them, but the incline was too steep away from the entry points. With a wave of his hand, Sotha Sil extinguished the flame.\nWellig and several other students were burned, but not badly. The sorcerer cast a healing spell on them, before turning back to Thargallith.\n\"I'll be with you in a moment, and give Almalexia the time to shake the road dust from her train,\" Sotha Sil turned back to the students, his voice flat. \"Fear does not break spells, but doubt and incompetence are the great enemies of any spellcaster. Master Welleg, you will pack your bags. I'll arrange for a boat to bring you to the mainland tomorrow morning.\"\nThe sorcerer found Almalexia and Iachesis in the study, drinking hot tea, and laughing. She was more beautiful than he had remembered, though he had never before seen her so disheveled, wrapped in a blanket, dangling her damp long black tresses before the fire to dry. At Sotha Sil's approach, she leapt to her feet and embraced him.\n\"Did you swim all the way from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;?\" he smiled.\n\"It's pouring rain from &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; down to the coast,\" she explained, returning his smile.\n\"Only a half a league away, and it never rains here,\" said Iachesis proudly. \"Of course, I sometimes miss the excitement of Summurset, and sometimes even the mainland itself. Still, I'm always very impressed by anyone out there who gets anything accomplished. It is a world of distractions. Speaking of distractions, what's all this I hear about a war?\"\n\"You mean the one that's been bloodying the continent for the last eighty years, Master?\" asked Sotha Sil, amused.\n\"I suppose that's the one I mean,\" said Iachesis with a shrug of his shoulders. \"How is that war going?\"\n\"We will lose it, unless I can convince Sotha Sil to leave Artaeum,\" said Almalexia, losing her smile. She had meant to wait and talk to her friend in private, but the old Altmer gave her courage to press on. \"I have had visions; I know it to be true.\"\nSotha Sil was silent for a moment, and then looked at Iachesis, \"I must return to Morrowind.\"\n\"Knowing you, if you must do something, you will,\" sighed the old Master. \"The Psijics' way is not to be distracted. Wars are fought, Empires rise and fall. You must go, and so must we.\"\n\"What do you mean, Iachesis? You're leaving the island?\"\n\"No, the island will be leaving the sea,\" said Iachesis, his voice taking on a dreamy quality. \"In a few years, the mists will move over Artaeum and we will be gone. We are counselors by nature, and there are too many counselors in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as it is. No, we will go, and return when the land needs us again, perhaps in another age.\"\nThe old &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; struggles to his feet, and drained the last sip of his drink before leaving Sotha Sil and Almalexia alone: \"Don't miss the last boat.\"\nThe Year Continues in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2005%20-%20Second%20Seed\"&gt;2920, vol 05 - Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;\n2920, vol 05 - Second Seed.\n5 Second Seed, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Your &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Majesty,\" said the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, opening the door to his chamber with a smile. \"I have not seen you lately. I thought perhaps you were ... indisposed with the lovely &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"She's taking the baths at &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup\"&gt;Mir Corrup&lt;/a&gt;,\" the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; said miserably.\n\"Please, come in.\"\n\"I've reached the stage where I can only trust three people: you, my son the Prince, and Rijja,\" said the Emperor petulantly. \"My entire council is nothing but a pack of spies.\"\n\"What seems to be the matter, your imperial majesty?\" asked the Potentate Versidue-Shaie sympathetically, drawing closed the thick curtain in his chamber. Instantly all sound outside the room was extinguished, echoing footsteps in the marble halls and birds in the springtide gardens.\n\"I've discovered that a notorious poisoner, an &lt;a href=\"Orma\"&gt;Orma&lt;/a&gt; tribeswoman from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Catchica\"&gt;Catchica&lt;/a&gt;, was with the army at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Suvio\"&gt;Caer Suvio&lt;/a&gt; while we were encamped there when my son was poisoned, before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle at Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure she would have preferred to kill me, but the opportunity didn't present itself,\" The Emperor fumed. \"The Council suggests that we need evidence of her involvement before we prosecute.\"\n\"Of course they would,\" said the Potentate thoughtfully. \"Particularly if one or more of them was in on the plot. I have a thought, your imperial majesty.\"\n\"Yes?\" said Reman impatiently. \"Out with it!\"\n\"Tell the Council you're dropping the matter, and I will send out the Guard to track this Catchica down and follow her. We will see who her friends are, and perhaps get an idea of the scope of this plot on your imperial majesty's life.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Reman with a satisfied frown. \"That's a capital plan. We will track this scheme to whomever it leads to.\"\n\"Decidedly, your imperial majesty,\" smiled the Potentate, parting the curtain so the Emperor could leave. In the hallway outside was Potentate Versidue-Shaie's son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;. The boy bowed to the Emperor before entering the Potentate's chamber.\n\"Are you in trouble, father?\" whispered the Akaviri lad. \"I heard the Emperor found out about whatshername, the poisoner.\"\n\"The great art of &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, my boy,\" said Versidue-Shaie to his son. \"Is to tell them what they want to hear in a way that gets them to do what you want them to do. I need you to get a letter to Catchica, and make certain that she understands that if she does not follow the instructions perfectly, she is risking her own life more than ours.\"\n13 Second Seed, 2920Mir Corrup, Cyrodiil\nRijja sank luxuriantly into the burbling hot spring, feeling her skin tingle like it was being rubbed by millions of little stones. The rock shelf over her head sheltered her from the misting rain, but let all the sunshine in, streaming in layers through the branches of the trees. It was an idyllic moment in an idyllic life, and when she was finished she knew that her beauty would be entirely restored. The only thing she needed was a drink of water. The bath itself, while wonderfully fragrant, tasted always of chalk.\n\"Water!\" she cried to her servants. \"Water, please!\"\nA gaunt woman with rags tied over her eyes ran to her side and dropped a goatskin of water. Rijja was about to laugh at the woman's prudery\u2014she herself was not ashamed of her naked body\u2014but then she noticed through a crease in the rags that the old woman had no eyes at all. She was like one of those Orma tribesmen Rijja had heard about, but never met. Born without eyes, they were masters of their other senses. The Lord of Mir Corrup hired very exotic servants, she thought to herself.\nIn a moment, the woman was gone and forgotten. Rijja found it very hard to concentrate on anything but the sun and the water. She opened the cork, but the liquid within had a strange, metallic smell to it. Suddenly, she was aware that she was not alone.\n\"Lady Rijja,\" said the captain of the Imperial Guard. \"You are, I see, acquainted with Catchica?\"\n\"I've never heard of her,\" stammered Rijja before becoming indignant. \"What are you doing here? This body is not for your leering eyes.\"\n\"Never heard of her, when we saw her with you not a minute ago,\" said the captain, picking up the goatskin and smelling it. \"Brought you &lt;a href=\"neivous%20ichor\"&gt;neivous ichor&lt;/a&gt;, did she? To &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; the Emperor with?\"\n\"Captain,\" said one of the guards, running up to him quickly. \"We cannot find the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;. It is as if she disappeared into the woods.\"\n\"Yes, they're good at that,\" said the captain. \"No matter though. We've got her contact at court. That should please his Imperial Majesty. Seize her.\"\nAs the guards pulled the writhing naked woman from the pool, she screamed, \"I'm innocent! I don't know what this is all about, but I've done nothing! The Emperor will have your heads for this!\"\n\"Yes, I imagine he will,\" smiled the captain. \"If he trusts you.\"\n21 Second Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, Black Marsh\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Sow%20and%20Vulture\"&gt;The Sow and Vulture&lt;/a&gt; tavern was the sort of out-of-the-way place that &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; favored for these sorts of interviews. Besides himself and his companion, there were only a couple of old seadogs in the shadowy room, and they were more unconscious from drink than aware. The grime of the unwashed floor was something you felt rather than saw. Copious dust hung in the air unmoving in the sparse rays of dying sunlight.\n\"You have experience in heavy combat?\" asked Zuuk. \"The reward is good for this assignment, but the risks are great as well.\"\n\"Certainly I have combat experience,\" replied &lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt; haughtily. \"I was at the Battle of Bodrum just two months ago. If you do your part and get the Emperor to ride through &lt;a href=\"Dozsa%20Pass\"&gt;Dozsa Pass&lt;/a&gt; with a minimal escort on the day and the time we've discussed, I'll do my part. Just be certain that he's not traveling in disguise. I'm not going to slaughter every caravan that passes through in the hopes that it contains Emperor Reman.\"\nZuuk smiled, and Miramor looked at himself in the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;'s reflective face. He liked the way he looked: the consummate confident professional.\n\"Agreed,\" said Zuuk. \"And then you shall have the rest of your &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nZuuk placed the large chest onto the table between them. He stood up.\n\"Wait a few minutes before leaving,\" said Zuuk. \"I don't want you following me. Your employers wish to maintain their anonymity, if by chance you are caught and tortured.\"\n\"Fine by me,\" said Miramor, ordering more grog.\nZuuk rode his mount through the cramped labyrinthine streets of Gideon, and both he and his horse were happy to pass through the gates into the country. The main road to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Giovese\"&gt;Castle Giovese&lt;/a&gt; was flooded as it was every year in springtide, but Zuuk knew a shorter way over the hills. Riding fast under trees drooping with moss and treacherous slime-coated rocks, he arrived at the castle gates in two hours' time. He wasted no time in climbing to &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress Tavia&lt;/a&gt;'s cell at the top of the highest tower.\n\"What did you think of him?\" asked the Empress.\n\"He's a fool,\" replied Zuuk. \"But that's what we want for this sort of assignment.\"\n30 Second Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nRijja screamed and screamed and screamed. Within her cell, her only audience was the giant gray stones, crusted with moss but still sturdy. The guards outside were deaf to her as they were deaf to all prisoners. The Emperor, miles away in the Imperial City, had likewise been deaf to her cries of innocence.\nShe screamed knowing well that no one would likely hear her ever again.\n31 Second Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Kavas%20Rim%20Pass\"&gt;Kavas Rim Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nIt had been days, weeks since &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; had seen another human face, Cyrodiil or &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. As she trod the road, she thought to herself how strange it was that such an uninhabited place as Cyrodiil had become the Imperial Province, seat of an Empire. Even the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; must have more populated forests than this &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt; wood.\nShe thought back. Was it a month ago, two, when she crossed the border from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; into Cyrodiil? It had been much colder then, but other than that, she had no sense of time. The guards had been brusque, but as she was carrying no weaponry, they elected to let her through. Since then, she had seen a few caravans, even shared a meal with some adventurers camping for the night, but met no one who would give her a ride to a town.\nTurala stripped off her shawl and dragged it behind her. For a moment, she thought she heard someone behind her and spun around. No one was there. Just a bird perched on a branch making a sound like laughter.\nShe walked on, and then stopped. Something was happening. The child had been kicking in her belly for some time now, but this was a different kind of spasm. With a groan, she lurched over to the side of the path, collapsing into the grass. Her child was coming.\nShe lay on her back and pushed, but she could barely see with her tears of pain and frustration. How had it come to this? Giving birth in the wilderness, all by herself, to a child whose father was the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;? Her scream of rage and agony shook the birds from the trees\nThe bird that had been laughing at her earlier flew down to the road. She blinked, and the bird was gone and in its place, a naked Elf man stood, not as dark as a Dunmer, but not as pale as the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. She knew at once it was an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;, a Wild Elf. Turala screamed, but the man held her down. After a few minutes of struggle, she felt a release, and then fainted away.\nWhen she awoke, it was to the sound of a baby crying. The child had been cleaned and was lying by her side. Turala picked up her baby girl, and for the first time that year, felt tears of happiness stream down her face.\nShe whispered to the trees, \"Thank you\" and began walking with babe in her arms down the road to the west.\nThe Year is continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20Mid%20Year%20%28v6%29\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;\n2920, vol 06 - Mid Year.\n2 &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;, 2920&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\n\"The Imperial army is gathered to the south,\" said &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt;. \"They are a two weeks march from &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Iuval\"&gt;Ald Iuval&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Coronati\"&gt;Lake Coronati&lt;/a&gt;, heavily armored.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; nodded. Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt; were strategically important fortresses. He had been expecting a move against them for some time. His captain pulled down a map of southwestern Morrowind from the wall and smoothed it out, fighting a gentle summer sea breeze wafting in from the open window.\n\"They were heavily armored, you say?\" asked the captain.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Cassyr. \"They were camped out near &lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;, and I saw nothing but &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;, fine weaponry, and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Weapons\"&gt;siege equipment&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"How about spellcasters and boats?\" asked Vivec.\n\"A horde of battlemages,\" replied Cassyr. \"But no boats.\"\n\"As heavily armored as they are, it will take them at least two weeks, like you said, to get from Bethal Gray to Lake Coronati,\" Vivec studied the map carefully. \"They'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval. Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south.\"\n\"They'll be vulnerable along the straits,\" said the captain. \"Provided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the Heartland.\"\n\"Your intelligence has once again served us well,\" said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. \"We will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again.\"\n3 Mid Year, 2920&lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Will you be returning back this way after your victory?\" asked Lord Bethal.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; barely paid the man any attention. He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds. All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.\n\"If we return shortly, it will be because of defeat,\" said the Prince. He could see down in the meadow, the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores. An army was an expensive thing, for certes.\n\"My Prince,\" said &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bethal\"&gt;Lord Bethal&lt;/a&gt; with concern. \"Is your army beginning a march due east? That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati. You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits.\"\n\"You just make certain your merchants get their share of our ,\" said the Prince with a grin. \"Let me worry about my army's direction.\"\n16 Mid Year, 2920&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Coronati\"&gt;Lake Coronati&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters. What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection. They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest. Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor could not move invisibly, silently.\n\"Let me see the map again,\" he called to his captain. \"Is there no other way they could approach?\"\n\"We have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and be bogged under,\" said the captain. \"We would at least hear about it. But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits.\"\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him. Then he looked back on the map.\n\"Spy,\" said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. \"When you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?\"\n\"They were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them,\" explained Cassyr. \"I figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army? They couldn't have all been healers.\"\n\"You fool!\" roared Vivec. \"They're mystics schooled in the art of &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;. They've cast a spell of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; on the entire army.\"\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north. Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, they could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak. Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.\n\"Return to &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. \"Your services are no longer needed nor wanted.\"\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak. It had been taken by the Imperial Army.\n19 Mid Year, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nThe &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the Imperial City amid great fanfare, the streets lined with men and women cheering him as the symbol of the taking of Ald Marak. Truth be told, a greater number would have turned out had the Prince returned, and the &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; knew it. Still, it pleased him to no end. Never before had citizens of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; cheered the arrival of an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; into their land.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; greeted him with a warm embrace, and then tore into the letter he had brought from the Prince.\n\"I don't understand,\" he said at last, still joyous but equally confused. \"You went under the lake?\"\n\"Ald Marak is a very well-fortified fortress,\" explained the Potentate. \"As, I might add, the army of Morrowind has rediscovered, now that they are on the outside. To take it, we had to attack by surprise and with our soldiery in the sturdiest of armor. By casting the spell that allowed us to breathe underwater, we were able to travel faster than Vivec would have guessed, the weight of the armor made less by the aquatic surroundings, and attack from the waterbound west side of the fortress where their defenses were at their weakest.\"\n\"Brilliant!\" the Emperor crowed. \"You are a wonderous tactician, Versidue-Shaie! If your fathers had been as good at this as you are, Tamriel would be Akaviri domain!\"\nThe Potentate had not planned to take credit for Prince Juilek's design, but on the Emperor's reference to his people's fiasco of an invasion two hundred and sixteen years ago, he made up his mind. He smiled modestly and soaked up the praise.\n21 Mid Year, 2920Ald Marak, Morrowind\n&lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; slithered to the wall and watched through the arrow slit the Morrowind army retreating back to the forestland between the swamps and the castle grounds. It seemed like the ideal opportunity to strike. Perhaps the forests could be burned and the army within them. Perhaps with Vivec in their enemies' hands, the army would allow them possession of Ald Iuval as well. He suggested these ideas to the Prince.\n\"What you seem to be forgetting,\" laughed Prince Juilek. \"Is that I gave my word that no harm to the army or to their commanders during the truce negotiations. Do you not have honor during warfare on &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"My Prince, I was born here in Tamriel, I have never been to my people's home,\" replied the snake man. \"But even so, your ways are strange to me. You expected no quarter and I gave you none when we fought in the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Imperial Arena&lt;/a&gt; five months ago.\"\n\"That was a game,\" replied the Prince, before nodding to his steward to let the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; battle chief in.\nJuilek had never seen Vivec before, but he had heard he was a living god. What came before him was but a man. A powerfully built man, handsome, with an intelligent face, but a man nonetheless. The Prince was pleased: a man he could speak with, but not a god.\n\"Greetings, my worthy adversary,\" said Vivec. \"We seem to be at an impasse.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" said the Prince. \"You don't want to give us Morrowind, and I can't fault you for that. But I must have your coastline to protect the Empire from overseas aggressions, and certain key strategic border castles, such as this one, as well as &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Umbeil\"&gt;Ald Umbeil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mothrivra\"&gt;Tel Mothrivra&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"And in return?\" asked Vivec.\n\"In return?\" laughed Savirien-Chorak. \"You forget we are the victors here, not you.\"\n\"In return,\" said Prince Juilek\u00a0carefully. \"There will be no Imperial attacks on Morrowind, unless in return to an attack by you. You will be protected from invaders by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20navy\"&gt;Imperial navy&lt;/a&gt;. And your land may expand by taking certain estates in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, whichever you choose, provided they are not needed by the Empire.\"\n\"A reasonable offer,\" said Vivec after a pause. \"You must forgive me, I am unused to Cyrodiils who offer something in return for what they take. May I have a few days to decide?\"\n\"We will meet again in a week's time,\" said the Prince, smiling. \"In the meantime, if your army provokes no attacks on mine, we are at peace.\"\nVivec left the Prince's chamber, feeling that &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; was right. The war was at an end. This Prince would make an excellent Emperor.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2007%20-%20Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;\n2920, vol 07 - Sun's Height.\n4 Sun's Height, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; took a stroll around the Imperial Gardens. Studded with statuary and fountains, the north gardens fit the Emperor's mood, as well as being the coolest acreage in the City during the heat of summertide. Austere, tiered flowerbeds of blue-gray and green towered all around them as they walked.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; agreed to the Prince's terms for peace,\" said Reman. \"My son will be returning in two weeks' time.\"\n\"This is excellent news,\" said the Potentate carefully. \"I hope the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; will honor the terms. We might have asked for more. The fortress at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;, for example. But I suppose the Prince knows what is reasonable. He would not cripple the Empire just for peace.\"\n\"I have been thinking lately of &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; and what caused her to plot against my life,\" said the Emperor, pausing to admire a statue of the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Queen%20Alessia\"&gt;Slave Queen Alessia&lt;/a&gt; before continuing. \"The only thing I can think of to account for it is that she admired my son too much. She may have loved me for my power and my personality, but he, after all, is young and handsome and will one day inherit my throne. She must have thought that if I were dead, she could have an Emperor who had both youth and power.\"\n\"The Prince ... was in on this plot?\" asked Versidue-Shaie. It was a difficult game to play, anticipating where the Emperor's paranoia would strike next.\n\"Oh, I don't think so,\" said Reman, smiling. \"No, my son loves me well.\"\n\"Are you aware that &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, Rijja's sister is an initiate of the &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; conservatorium in &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked the Potentate.\n\"Morwha?\" asked the Emperor. \"I've forgotten: which god is that?\"\n\"Lusty fertility goddess of the Yokudans,\" replied the Potentate. \"But not too lusty, like &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. Demure, but certainly sexual.\"\n\"I am through with lusty women. The Empress, Rijja, all too lusty, a lust for love leads to a lust for power,\" the Emperor shrugged his shoulders. \"But a priestess-in-training with a certain healthy appetite sounds ideal. Now what were you saying about the Black Gate?\"\n6 Sun's Height, 2920&lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nRijja stood quietly looking at the cold stone floor while the Emperor spoke. He had never before seen her so pale and joyless. She might at least be pleased that she was being freed, being returned to her homeland. Why, if she left now, she could be in Hammerfell by the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Merchant's Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing he said seemed to register any reaction from her. A month and a half's stay in Thurzo Fortress seemed to have killed her spirit.\n\"I was thinking,\" said the Emperor at last. \"Of having your younger sister Corda up to the palace for a time. I think she would prefer it over the conservatorium in Hegathe, don't you?\"\nReaction, at last. Rijja looked at the Emperor with animal hatred, flinging herself at him in a rage. Her fingernails had grown long since her imprisonment and she raked them across his face, into his eyes. He howled with pain, and his guards pulled her off, pummeling her with blows from the back of their swords, until she was knocked unconscious.\nA healer was called at once, but the Emperor Reman III had lost his right eye.\n23 Sun's Height, 2920&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nVivec pulled himself from the water, feeling the heat of the day washed from his skin, taking a towel from one of his servants. &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; watched his old friend from the balcony.\n\"It looks like you've picked up a few more scars since I last saw you,\" said the sorcerer.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; grant it that I have no more for a while,\" laughed Vivec. \"When did you arrive?\"\n\"A little over an hour ago,\" said Sotha Sil, walking down the stairs to the water's edge. \"I thought I was coming to end a war, but it seems you've done it without me.\"\n\"Yes, eighty years is long enough for ceaseless battle,\" replied Vivec, embracing Sotha Sil. \"We made concessions, but so did they. When the old Emperor is dead, we may be entering a golden age. Prince Juilek is very wise for his age. Where is &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Collecting the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. They should be here tomorrow afternoon.\"\nThe men were distracted at a sight from around the corner of the palace - a rider was approaching through the town, heading for the front steps. It was evident that the woman had been riding hard for some time. They met her in the study, where she burst in, breathing hard.\n\"We have been betrayed,\" she gasped. \"The Imperial Army has seized the Black Gate.\"\n24 Sun's Height, 2920Balmora, Morrowind\nIt was the first time in seventeen years that the three members of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Morrowind Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had met in the same place, since Sotha Sil had left for &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. All three wished that the circumstances of their reunion were different.\n\"From what we've learned, while the Prince was returning to Cyrodiil to the south, a second Imperial Army came down from the north,\" said Vivec to his stony-faced compatriots. \"It is reasonable to assume Juilek didn't know about the attack.\"\n\"But neither would it be unreasonable to suppose that he planned on being a distraction while the Emperor launched the attack on Black Gate,\" said Sotha Sil. \"This must be considered a break of the truce.\"\n\"Where is the Duke of Mournhold?\" asked Vivec. \"I would hear his thoughts on the matter.\"\n\"He is meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Almalexia, quietly. \"I told him to wait until he had spoken with you, but he said that the matter had waited long enough.\"\n\"He would involve the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;? In outside affairs?\" Vivec shook his head, and looked to Sotha Sil: \"Please, do what you can. Assassination will only move us backwards. This matter must be settled with diplomacy or battle.\"\n25 Sun's Height, 2920Tel Aruhn, Morrowind\nThe Night Mother met Sotha Sil in her salon, lit only by the moon. She was cruelly beautiful dressed in a simple silk black robe, lounging across her divan. With a gesture, she dismissed her red-cloaked guards and offered the sorcerer some wine.\n\"You've only just missed your friend, the Duke,\" she whispered. \"He was very unhappy, but I think we will solve his problem for him.\"\n\"Did he hire the Morag Tong to assassinate the Emperor?\" asked Sotha Sil.\n\"You are straight-forward, aren't you? That's good. I love plain-speaking men: it saves so much time. Of course, I cannot discuss with you what the Duke and I talked about,\" she smiled. \"It would be bad for business.\"\n\"What if I were to offer you an equal amount of gold for you not to assassinate the Emperor?\"\n\"The Morag Tong murders for the glory of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and for profit,\" she said, speaking into her glass of wine. \"We do not merely kill. That would be sacrilege. Once the Duke's gold has arrived in three days time, we will do our end of the business. And I'm afraid we would not dream of entertaining a counter offer. Though we are a business as well as a religious order, we do not bow to supply and demand, Sotha Sil.\"\n27 Sun's Height, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nSotha Sil had been watching the waters for two days now, waiting for a particular vessel, and now he saw it. A heavy ship with the flag of Mournhold. The sorcerer took the air and intercepted it before it reached harbor. A caul of flame erupted over his figure, disguising his voice and form into that of a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Abandon your ship!\" he bellowed. \"If you would not sink with it!\"\nIn truth, Sotha Sil could have exploded the vessel with but a single ball of fire, but he chose to take his time, to give the crew a chance to dive off into the warm water. When he was certain there was no one living aboard, he focused his energy into a destructive wave that shook the air and water as it discharged. The ship and the Duke's payment to the Morag Tong sunk to the bottom of the Inner Sea.\n\"Night Mother,\" thought Sotha Sil, as he floated towards shore to alert the harbormaster that some sailors were in need of rescue. \"Everyone bows to supply and demand.\"\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2008%20-%20Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;.\n2920, vol 08 - Last Seed.\n1 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nThey were gathered in the Duke's courtyard at twilight, enjoying the smell and warmth of a fire of dry branches and bittergreen leaves. Tiny embers flew into the sky, hanging for a few moments before vanishing.\n\"I was rash,\" agreed the Duke, soberly. \"But &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; had his laugh, and all is well. The &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; will not assassinate the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; now that my payment to them is at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. I thought you had made some sort of a truce with the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20princes\"&gt;Daedra princes&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"What your sailors called a daedra may not have been one,\" said &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. \"Perhaps it was a rogue battlemage or even a lightning bolt that destroyed your ship.\"\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; are en route to take possession of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt; as our truce agreed. It is certainly typical of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to assume that their concessions are negotiable, while ours are not,\" Vivec pulled out a map. \"We can meet them here, in this village to the north-west of Ald Lambasi, Fervinthil.\"\n\"But will we meet them to talk,\" ask &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. \"Or to make war?\"\nNo one had an answer to that.\n15 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Fervinthil\"&gt;Fervinthil&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nA late summer squall blew through the small village, darkening the sky except for flashing of lightning which leapt from cloud to cloud like acrobats. Water rushed down the narrow streets ankle-deep, and the Prince had to shout to be heard by his captains but a few feet away from him.\n\"There's an inn up ahead! We'll wait there for the storm to pass before pressing on to Ald Lambasi!\"\nThe inn was warm and dry, and bustling with business. Barmaids were rushing back and forth, bringing &lt;a href=\"greef\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt; and wine to a back room, evidently excited about a famous visitor. Someone who was attracting more attention than the mere heir to the Empire of Tamriel. Amused, Juilek watched them run until he overheard the name of \"&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"My Lord Vivec,\" he said, bursting into the back room. \"You must believe me, I knew nothing about the attack on &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; until after it happened. We will, of course, be returning it to your care forthwith. I wrote you a letter to that effect at your palace in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, but obviously you're not there,\" he paused, taking in the many new faces in the room. \"I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Juilek Cyrodiil.\"\n\"My name is Almalexia,\" said the most beautiful woman the Prince had ever seen. \"Won't you join us?\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" said a serious-looking Dunmer in a white cloak, shaking the Prince's hand and showing him to a seat.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Indoril Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;, Duke-Prince of Mournhold,\" said the massively-built man next to him as he sat down.\n\"I recognize that the events of the last month suggest, at best, that the Imperial Army is not under my control,\" said the Prince after ordering some wine. \"This is true. The army is my father's.\"\n\"I understood that the Emperor was going to be coming to Ald Lambasi as well,\" said Almalexia.\n\"Officially, he is,\" said the Prince cautiously. \"Unofficially, he's still back in the Imperial City. He's met with an unfortunate accident.\"\nVivec glanced the Duke quickly before looking at the Prince: \"An accident?\"\n\"He's fine,\" said the Prince quickly. \"He'll live, but it looks like he'll lose an eye. It was an altercation that has nothing to do with the war. The only good news is that while he recovers, I have the use of his seal. Any agreement we make here and now will be binding to the Empire, both in my father's reign and in mine.\"\n\"Then let's start agreeing,\" smiled Almalexia.\n16 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Wroth%20Naga\"&gt;Wroth Naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe tiny hamlet of Wroth Naga greeted &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; with its colorful houses perched on a promontory overlooking the stretch of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian mountain&lt;/a&gt; plain and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; beyond. Had he been in a better mood, the sight would have been breathtaking. As it was, he could only think that in practical terms, a small village like this would have meager provisions for himself and his horse.\nHe rode down into the main square, where an inn called the &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Cry\"&gt;Eagle's Cry&lt;/a&gt; stood. Directing the stable boy to house and feed his horse, Cassyr walked into the inn and was surprised by its ambience. A minstrel he had heard play once in &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; was performing a jaunty old tune to the clapping of the mountain men. Such forced merriment was not what Cassyr wanted at that moment. A glum Dunmer woman was seated at the only table far from the noise, so he took his drink there and sat down without invitation. It was only when he did so that he noticed that she was holding a newborn baby.\n\"I've just come from Morrowind,\" he said rather awkwardly, lowering his voice. \"I've been fighting for Vivec and the Duke of Mournhold against the Imperial army. A traitor to my people, I guess you'd call me.\"\n\"I am also a traitor to my people,\" said the woman, holding up her hand which was scarred with a branded symbol. \"It means that I can never go back to my homeland.\"\n\"Well, you're not thinking of staying here, are you?\" laughed Cassyr. \"It's certainly quaint, but come wintertide, there's going to be snow up to your eyelashes. It's no place for a new baby. What is her name?\"\n\"Bosriel. It means 'Beauty of the Forest.' Where are you going?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, on the bay in High Rock. You're welcome to join me, I could use the company.\" He held out his hand. \"&lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr Whitley&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the woman after a pause. She was going to use her family's name first, as is tradition, but she realized that it was no longer her name. \"I would love to accompany you, thank you.\"\n19 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nFive men and two women stood in the silence of the Great Room of the castle, the only sound the scrawl of quill on parchment and the gentle tapping of rain on the large picture window. As the Prince set the seal of Cyrodiil on the document, the peace was made official. The Duke of Mournhold broke out in a roar of delight, ordering wine brought in to commemorate the end of eighty years of war.\nOnly Sotha Sil stood apart from the group. His face betrayed no emotion. Those who knew him best knew he did not believe in endings or beginnings, but in the continuous cycle of which this was but a small part.\n\"My Prince,\" said the castle steward, unhappy at breaking the celebration. \"There is a messenger here from your mother, the Empress. He asked to see your father, but as he did not arrive --\"\nJuilek excused himself and went to speak with the messenger.\n\"The Empress does not live in the Imperial City?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No,\" said Almalexia, shaking her head sadly. \"Her husband has imprisoned her in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that she was plotting a revolution against him. She is extremely wealthy and has powerful allies in the western &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20estates\"&gt;Colovian estates&lt;/a&gt; so he could not marry another or have her executed. They've been at an impasse for the last seventeen years since Juilek was a child.\"\nThe Prince returned a few minutes later. His face betrayed his anxiety, though he took troubles to hide it.\n\"My mother needs me,\" he said simply. \"I'm afraid I must leave at once. If I may have a copy of the treaty, I will bring it with me to show the Empress the good we have done today, and then I will carry it on to the Imperial City so it may be made official.\"\nPrince Juilek left with the fond farewells of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. As they watched him ride out into the rainswept night south towards Black Marsh, Vivec said, \"&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; will be much healed when he has the throne.\"\n1 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dorsza Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Black Marsh\nThe moon was rising over the desolate quarry, steaming with swamp gas from a particularly hot summer as the Prince and his two guard escort rode out of the forest. The massive piles of earth and dung had been piled high in antiquity by some primitive, long-dead tribe of Black Marsh, hoping to keep out some evil from the north. Evidently, the evil had broken through at Dorsza Pass, the large crack in the sad, lonely rampart that stretched for miles.\nThe black twisted trees that grew on the barrier cast strange shadows down, like a net tangling. The Prince's mind was on his mother's cryptic letter, hinting at the threat of an invasion. He could not, of course, tell the Dunmer about it, at the very least until he knew more and had notified his father. After all, the letter was meant for him. It was its urgent tone that made him decide to go directly to &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Empress had also warned him about a band of former slaves who attacked caravans going into Dorsza Pass. She advised him to be certain to make his Imperial shield visible, so they would know he was not one of the hated Dunmer slavers. Upon riding into the tall weeds that flooded through the pass like a noxious river, the Prince ordered that his shield be displayed.\n\"I can see why the slaves use this,\" said the Prince's captain. \"It's an excellent location for an ambush.\"\nJuilek nodded his head, but his thoughts were elsewhere. What threat of invasion could the Empress have discovered? Were the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; on the seas again? If so, how could his mother from her cell in Castle Giovese know of it? A rustle in the weeds and a single sharp human cry behind him interrupted his ponderings.\nTurning around, the Prince discovered that he was alone. His escort had vanished.\nThe Prince peered over the stretch of the moonlit sea of grass which waved in almost hypnotic patterns to the ebb and flow of the night wind billowing through the pass. It was impossible to tell if a struggling soldier was beneath this system of vibrations, a dying horse behind another. A high, whistling wind drowned out any sound the victims of the ambush might be making.\nJuilek drew his sword, and thought about what to do, his mind willing his heart not to panic. He was closer to the exit of the pass than the entrance. Whatever had slain his escort must have been behind him. If he rode fast enough, perhaps he could outrun it. Spurring his horse to gallop, he charged for the hills ahead, framed by the mighty black piles of dirt.\nWhen he was thrown, it happened so suddenly, he was hurtling forward before he was truly conscious of the fact. He landed several yards beyond where his horse had fallen, breaking his shoulder and his back on impact. A numbness washed over him as he stared at his poor, dying steed, its belly sliced open by one of several spears jutting up just below the surface of the grass.\nPrince Juilek was not able to turn and face the figure that emerged from the grass, nor able to move to defend himself. His throat was cut without ceremony.\n&lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt; cursed when he saw the face of his victim more clearly in the moonlight. He had seen the Emperor at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; when he had fought in His Imperial Majesty's command, and this was clearly not the Emperor. Searching the body, he found the letter and a treaty signed by Vivec, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and the Duke of Mournhold representing Morrowind and the Prince Juilek Cyrodiil, representing the Cyrodiil Empire.\n\"Curse my luck,\" muttered Miramor to himself and the whispering grass. \"I've only killed a Prince. Where's the reward in that?\"\nMiramor destroyed the letter, as &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; had instructed him to do, and pocketed the treaty. At the very least, such a curiosity would have some market value. He disassembled the traps as he pondered his next step. Return to Gideon and ask his employer for a lesser reward for killing the heir? Move on to other lands? At the very least, he considered, he had picked up two useful skills from the Battle of Bodrum. From the Dunmer, he had learned the excellent spear trap. And abandoning the Imperial army, he had learned how to skulk in the grass.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2009%20-%20Hearth%20Fire\"&gt;Hearth Fire&lt;/a&gt;\n2920, vol 09 - Hearth Fire.\n2 Hearth Fire, 2920&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress Tavia&lt;/a&gt; lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars. Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands. Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovese, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation. One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; stood at the doorway and shook his head.\n\"She's just heard that her son is dead,\" he said quietly.\n5 Hearth Fire, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;The Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Your Imperial Majesty,\" said the &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; through the door. \"You can open the door. I assure you, you're perfectly safe. No one wants to kill you.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;'s blood!\" came the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt;'s voice, muffled, hysterical, tinged with madness. \"Someone assassinated the Prince, and he was holding my shield! They could have thought he was me!\"\n\"You're certainly correct, your Imperial Majesty,\" replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously. \"And we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death. But we cannot do it without you. You must be brave for your Empire.\"\nThere was no reply.\n\"At the very least, come out and sign the order for Lady &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt;'s execution,\" called the Potentate. \"Let us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.\"\nA brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor. Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye. Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in Thurzo Fortress.\n\"Hand me the order,\" the Emperor snarled. \"I'll sign it with pleasure.\"\n6 Hearth Fire, 2920\nGideon, Cyrodiil\nThe strange blue glow of the &lt;a href=\"will%20o%27%20the%20wisps\"&gt;will o' the wisps&lt;/a&gt;, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Tavia&lt;/a&gt; as she looked out her window. Now it seemed strangely comforting. Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon. It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it every day for seventeen years.\n\"Can you think of anything I've forgotten?\" she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.\n\"I know exactly what to do,\" he said simply. He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin. She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.\n\"Make certain you aren't followed,\" she warned. \"I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years. And do take your share of it. You've been a good friend.\"\nThe Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists. Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed. With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.\n9 Hearth Fire, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;\nThe strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire. The &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;wrothgarian mountains&lt;/a&gt; were fading into the misty afternoon. Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture. Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel. For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it. Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.\nAs the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest. So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state. A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder. Cassyr opened his eyes.\n\"Where are we?\" he hissed.\n\"I don't know,\" Turala stammered, wide-eyed. \"What is that sound?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;,\" he whispered. \"A hunting party. Head for the thicket quickly.\"\nTurala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted. He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes. A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer. Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse. All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed. Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried. Now she was grateful for it. With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field. Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.\n\"With luck,\" he murmured. \"They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.\"\nAs he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns. Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence. Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid. The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds. Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded. One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.\nCassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could. His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could. Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.\nSuddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind. The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs. Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.\n\"I thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,\" she whispered, smiling. \"Best come with me.\"\nThe three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill. As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.\n\"That horse yours?\" she asked. When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. \"That's rich meat, that is. Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning. Serves 'em right.\"\n\"Shouldn't we keep moving?\" whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.\n\"They won't come up here,\" she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. \"They're too afraid of us.\"\nTurala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. \"Witches. Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;Farm&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"You are, pet,\" the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. \"I am Mynista Skeffington.\"\n\"What did you do to those orcs?\" asked Turala. \"Back there in the thicket?\"\n\"Spirit fist right side the head,\" Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill. Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play. The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. \"Don't you have witches where you come from, child?\"\n\"None that I know of,\" she said.\n\"There are all sorts of wielders of magic in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;,\" she explained. \"The &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; magic like its their painful duty. The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows. We witches commune and &lt;a href=\"conjure\"&gt;conjure&lt;/a&gt; and celebrate. To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead. You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls. It's about fostering relations. Being friendly, you might say.\"\n\"Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,\" said Cassyr.\n\"As well you might,\" coughed Mynista. \"Your kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago. Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us. Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.\"\nWith that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.\n11 Hearth Fire, 2920\nThe Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nRijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect. It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the ax stroke. Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye. She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face. She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her. She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.\nThe first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed. The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.\nThe Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, \"Now that's done. You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n18 Hearth Fire, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, High Rock\nThe horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered. Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden. Still, there was little to complain about. With the Dunmer woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time. Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland. Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.\n\"How went the war?\" cried his cousin, running to the road. \"Is it true that &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?\"\n\"That's not how it was, was it?\" asked a friend, joining them. \"I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.\"\n\"Isn't there anything interesting happening here?\" Cassyr laughed. \"I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.\"\n\"You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,\" said his friend. \"She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.\"\n\"But that's nothing. What was Vivec like?\" asked his cousin eagerly. \"He supposed to be a living god.\"\n\"If &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,\" said Cassyr haughtily.\n\"And the women?\" asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmer ladies on very rare occasions.\nCassyr merely smiled. Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away. She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for. But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever. Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2010%20-%20Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;\n2920, vol 10 - Frostfall.\n10 Frostfall, 2920&lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;\nThe creature before them blinked, senseless, its eyes glazed, mouth opening and closing as if relearning its function. A thin glob of saliva burbled down, hanging suspended between its fangs. Turala had never seen anything of its kind before, reptilian and massive, perched on its hind legs like a man. Mynistera applauded enthusiastically.\n\"My child,\" she crowed. \"You have come so far in so short a time. What were you thinking when you summoned this &lt;a href=\"daedroth\"&gt;daedroth&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nIt took Turala a moment to recall whether she was thinking anything at all. She was merely overwhelmed that she had reached out across the fabric of reality into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and plucked forth this loathsome creature, conjuring it into the world by the power of her mind.\n\"I was thinking of the color red,\" Turala said, concentrating. \"The simplicity and clarity of it. And then -- I desired, and spoke the charm. And this is what I conjured up.\"\n\"Desire is a powerful force for a young witch,\" said Mynistera. \"And it is well matched in this instance. For this daedroth is nothing if not a simple force of the spirits. Can you release your desire as easily?\"\nTurala closed her eyes and spoke the dismissal invocation. The monster faded away like a painting in sunlight, still blinking confusedly. Mynistera embraced her Dark Elf pupil, laughing with delight.\n\"I never would have believed it, a month and a day you've been with the coven, and you're already far more advanced than most of the women here. There is powerful blood in you, Turala, you touch spirits like you were touching a lover. You'll be leading this coven one day -- I have seen it!\"\nTurala smiled. It was good to be complimented. The Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; had praised her pretty face; and her family, before she had dishonored them, praised her manners. Cassyr had been nothing more than a companion: his compliments meant nothing. But with Mynistera, she felt she was home.\n\"You'll be leading the coven for many years yet, great sister,\" said Turala.\n\"I certainly intend to. But the spirits, while marvelous companions and faultless tellers of truth, are often hazy about the when and hows. You can't blame them really. When and how mean so little to them,\" Mynistera opened the door to the shed, allowing the brisk autumn breeze in to dispel the bitter and fetid smells of the daedroth. \"Now, I need you to run an errand to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. It's only a week's ride there, and a week's ride back. Bring Doryatha and Celephyna with you. As much as we try to be self-sufficient, there are herbs we can't grow here, and we seem to run through an enormous quantity of gems in no time at all. It's important that the people of the city learn to recognize you as one of the wise women of &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20coven\"&gt;Skeffington coven&lt;/a&gt;. You'll find the benefits of being notorious far outweigh the inconveniences.\"\nTurala did as she was bade. As she and her sisters climbed aboard their horses, Mynistera brought her child, little five-month-old Bosriel to kiss her mother good-bye. The witches were in love with the little Dunmer infant, fathered by a wicked Duke, birthed by wild &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; elves in the forest heart of the Empire. Turala knew her nursemaids would protect her child with their lives. After many kisses and a farewell wave, the three young witches rode off into the bright woods, under a covering of red, yellow, and orange.\n12 Frostfall, 2920&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, High Rock\nFor a Middas evening, the Least Loved Porcupine tavern was wildly crowded. A roaring fire in the pit in the center of the room cast an almost sinister glow on all the regulars, and made the abundance of bodies look like a punishment tapestry inspired by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcturian%20Heresy\"&gt;Arcturian Heresies&lt;/a&gt;. Cassyr took his usual place with his cousin and ordered a flagon of ale.\n\"Have you been to see the Baron?\" asked Palyth.\n\"Yes, he may have work for me in the palace of &lt;a href=\"Urvaius\"&gt;Urvaius&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Cassyr proudly. \"But more than that I can't say. You understand, secrets of state and all that. Why are there so many damned people here tonight?\"\n\"A shipload of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; just came in to harbor. They've come from the war. I was just waiting until you got here to introduce you as another veteran.\"\nCassyr blushed, but regained his composure enough to ask: \"What are they doing here? Has there been a truce?\"\n\"I don't know the full story,\" said Palyth. \"But apparently, the Emperor and Vivec are in negotiations again. These fellas here have investments they were keen to check on, and they figured things on the Bay were quiet enough. But the only way we can get the full story is to talk to the chaps.\"\nWith that, Palyth gripped his cousin's arm and pulled him to the other side of the bar so suddenly, Cassyr would have had to struggle violently to resist. The Dunmer travelers were spread out across four of the tables, laughing with the locals. They were largely amiable young men, well-dressed, befitting merchants, animated in gesture made more extravagant by liquor.\n\"Excuse me,\" said Palyth, intruding on the conversation. \"My shy cousin Cassyr was in the war as well, fighting for the living god, Vivec.\"\n\"The only Cassyr I ever heard of,\" said one of the Dunmer drunkenly with a wide, friendly smile, shaking Cassyr's free hand. \"Was a Cassyr Whitley, who Vivec said was the worst spy in history. We lost Ald Marak due to his bungling intelligence work. For your sake, friend, I hope the two of you were never confused.\"\nCassyr smiled and listened as the lout told the story of his failure with bountiful exaggerations which caused the table to roar with laughter. Several eyes looked his way, but none of the locals sought to explain that the fool of the tale was standing at attention. The eyes that stung the most were his cousin's, the young man who had believed that he had returned to Dwynnen a great hero. At some point, certainly, the Baron would hear about it, his idiocy increasing manifold with each retelling.\nWith every fiber in his soul, Cassyr cursed the living god &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\n21 Frostfall, 2920\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, in a robe of blinding whiteness, a uniform of the priestesses of the &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; conservatorium, arrived in the City just as the first winter storm was passing. The clouds broke with sunlight, and the beauteous teenaged Redguard girl appeared in the wide avenue with escort, riding toward the Palace. While her sister was tall, thin, angular, and haughty, Corda was a small, round-faced lass with wide brown eyes. The locals were quick to draw comparisons.\n\"Not a month after Lady Rijja's execution,\" muttered a housemaid, peering out the window, and winking to her neighbor.\n\"And not a month out of the nunnery neither,\" the other woman agreed, reveling in the scandal. \"This one's in for a ride. Her sister weren't no innocent, and look where she ended up.\"\n24 Frostfall, 2920\nDwynnen, High Rock\nCassyr stood on the harbor and watched the early sleet fall on the water. It was a pity, he thought, that he was prone to sea-sickness. There was nothing for him now in Tamriel to the east or to the west. Vivec's tale of his poor spycraft had spread to taverns everywhere. The Baron of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; had released him from his contract. No doubt they were laughing about him in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, too, and &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt;, probably in &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; for that matter. Perhaps it would be best to drop into the waves and sink. The thought, however, did not stay long in his mind: it was not despair that haunted him, but rage. Impotent fury that he could not assuage.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said a voice behind him, making him jump. \"I'm sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering whether you could recommend an inexpensive tavern for me to spend the night.\"\nIt was a young man, a Nord, with a sack over his shoulder. Obviously, he had just disembarked from one of the boats. For the first time in weeks, someone was looking at Cassyr as something other than a colossal, famous idiot. He could not help, black as his mood was, but be friendly.\n\"You've just arrived from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Cassyr.\n\"No, sir, that's where I'm going,\" said the fellow. \"I'm working my way home. I've come up from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and before that &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, and before that &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and before that &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset&lt;/a&gt;. Welleg's my name.\"\nCassyr introduced himself and shook Welleg's hand. \"Did you say you came from Artaeum? Are you a &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"No, sir, not anymore,\" the fellow shrugged. \"I was expelled.\"\n\"Do you know anything about summoning daedra? You see, I want to cast a curse against a particularly powerful person, one might say a living god, and I haven't had any luck. The Baron won't allow me in his sight, but the Baroness has sympathy for me and allowed me the use of their Summoning Chambers.\" Cassyr spat. \"I did all the rituals, made sacrifices, but nothing came of it.\"\n\"That'd be because of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, my old master,\" replied Welleg with some bitterness. \"The &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; princes have agreed not to be summoned by any amateurs at least until the war ends. Only the Psijics may counsel with the daedra, and a few nomadic sorcerers and witches.\"\n\"Witches, did you say?\"\n29 Frostfall, 2920\nPhrygias, High Rock\nPale sunlight flickered behind the mist bathing the forest as Turala, Doryatha, and Celephyna drove their horses on. The ground was wet with a thin layer of frost, and laden down with goods, it was a slippery way over unpaved hills. Turala tried to contain her excitement about coming back to the coven. Wayrest had been an adventure, and she adored the looks of fear and respect the cityfolk gave her. But for the last few days, all she could think of was returning to her sisters and her child.\nA bitter wind whipped her hair forward so she could see nothing but the path ahead. She did not hear the rider approach to her side until he was almost upon her. When she turned and saw Cassyr, she shouted with as much surprise as pleasure at meeting an old friend. His face was pale and drawn, but she took it to be merely from travel.\n\"What brings you back to Phrygias?\" she smiled. \"Were you not treated well in Dwynnen?\"\n\"Well enough,\" said Cassyr. \"I have need of the Skeffington coven.\"\n\"Ride with us,\" said Turala. \"I'll bring you to Mynistera.\"\nThe four continued on, and the witches regaled Cassyr with tales of Wayrest. It was evident that it was also a rare treat for Doryatha and Celephyna to leave Old Barbyn's Farm. They had been born there, as daughters and grand-daughters of Skeffington witches. Ordinary High Rock city life was exotic to them as it was to Turala. Cassyr said little, but smiled and nodded his head, which was encouragement enough. Thankfully, none of the stories they had heard were about his own stupidity. Or at the very least, they did not tell him.\nDoryatha was in the midst of a tale she had heard in a tavern about a thief who had been locked overnight in a pawnshop when they crossed over a familiar hill. Suddenly, she halted in her story. The barn was supposed to be visible, but it was not. The other three followed her gaze into the fog, and a moment later, they rode as fast as they could towards what was once the site of the Skeffington coven.\nThe fire had long since burned out. Nothing but ashes, skeletons, and broken weaponry remained. Cassyr recognized at once the signs of an orc raid.\nThe witches fell from their horses, racing through the remains, wailing. Celephyna found a tattered, bloody piece of cloth that she recognized from Mynistera's cloak. She held it to her ashen face, sobbing. Turala screamed for Bosriel, but the only reply was the high whistling wind through the ashes.\n\"Who did this?\" she cried, tears streaking down her face. \"I swear I'll conjure up the very flames of Oblivion! What have they done with my baby?\"\n\"I know who did it,\" said Cassyr quietly, dropping from his horse and walking towards her. \"I've seen these weapons before. I fear I met the very fiends responsible in Dwynnen, but I never thought they'd find you. This is the work of assassins hired by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nHe paused. The lie came easily. Adopt and improvise. What's more, he could tell instantly that she believed it. Her resentment over the cruelty the Duke had shown her had quieted, but never disappeared. One look at her burning eyes told him that she would summon the daedra and wreak his, and her, revenge upon Morrowind. And what's more, he knew they'd listen.\nAnd listen they did. For the power that is greater than desire is rage. Even rage misplaced.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2011%20-%20Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;\n2920, vol 11 - Sun's Dusk.\n\"2\u00a0Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\"\nA man to see you, Night Mother,\" said the guard. \"A &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; tribesman who presents his credentials as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Zuuk\"&gt;Lord Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, part of the Imperial Garrison of &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"What makes you think I'd have even the slightest possible interest in seeing him?\" asked the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; with venomous sweetness.\n\"He brings a letter from the late Empress of the Cyrodilic Empire.\"\n\"We are having a busy day,\" she smiled, clapping her hands together with delight. \"Show him in.\"\nZuuk entered the chamber. His metallic skin, though exposed only at his face and hands, caught the light of the fireplace and the lightning of the stormy night from the window. The Night Mother noted also that she could see herself as he saw her: serene, beautiful, fear-inspiring. He handed her his letter from the Empress without a word. Sipping her wine, she read it.\n\"The Duke of Morrowind also offered me an appreciable sum to have the Emperor murdered earlier this year,\" she said, folding the letter. \"His payment sunk, and never was delivered. It was a considerable annoyance, particularly as I had already gone to the trouble of putting one of my agents in the palace. Why should I assume that your more-than-generous payment, from a dead woman, will arrive?\"\n\"I brought it with me,\" said Zuuk simply. \"It is in the carriage outside.\"\n\"Then bring it in and our business is complete,\" smiled the Night Mother. \"The Emperor will be dead by year's end. You may leave the gold with Apaladith. Unless you'd care for some wine?\"\nZuuk declined the offer and withdrew. The moment he left the room, Miramor slipped noiselessly back from behind the dark tapestry. The Night Mother offered him a glass of wine, and he accepted it.\n\"I know that fellow, Zuuk,\" said Miramor carefully. \"I didn't know he worked for the old Empress though.\"\n\"Let's talk about you some more, if you don't mind,\" she said, knowing he would, in fact, not mind.\n\"Let me show you my worth,\" said Miramor. \"Let me be the one to do the Emperor in. I've already killed his son, and you saw there how well I can hide myself away. Tell me you saw one ripple in the tapestry.\"\nThe Night Mother smiled. Things were falling into place rather nicely.\n\"If you know how to use a dagger, you will find him at Bodrum,\" she said, and described to him what he must do.\n3 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Duke stared out the window. It was early morning, and for the fourth straight day, a red mist hung over the city, flashing lightning. A freakish wind blew through the streets, ripping his flags from the castle battlements, forcing all his people to close their shutters tightly. Something terrible was coming to his land. He was not a greatly learned man, but he knew the signs. So too did his subjects.\n\"When will my messengers reach the Three?\" he growled, turning to his castellan.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is far to the north, negotiating the treaty with the Emperor,\" the man said, his face and voice trembling with fear. \"&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; are in &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps they can be reached in a few days time.\"\nThe Duke nodded. He knew his messengers were fast, but so too was the hand of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\n6 Sun's Dusk, 2920Bodrum, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nTorchlight caught in the misting snow gave the place an otherworldly quality. The soldiers from both camps found themselves huddled together around the largest of the bonfires: winter bringing enemies of four score years of warring close together. While only a few of the Dunmer guard could speak Cyrodilic, they found common ground battling for warmth. When a pretty &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; maiden passed into their midst to warm herself before moving back to the treaty tent, many a man from both armies raised their eyes in approval.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; was eager to leave negotiations before they had ever begun. A month earlier, he thought it would be a sign of good will to meet at the site of his defeat to Vivec's army, but the place brought back more bad memories than he thought it would. Despite the protestations of Potentate Versidue-Shaie that the rocks of the river were naturally red, he could swear he saw splatters of his soldier's blood.\n\"We have all the particulars of the treaty,\" he said, taking a glass of hot yuelle from his mistress Corda. \"But here and now is not the place for signing. We should do it at the Imperial Palace, with all the pomp and splendor this historic occasion demands. You must bring Almalexia with you also; and that wizard fellow.\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" whispered the Potentate.\n\"When?\" asked Vivec with infinite patience.\n\"In exactly a month's time,\" said the Emperor, smiling munificently and clambering awkwardly to his feet. \"We will hold a grand ball to commemorate. Now I must take a walk. My legs are all cramped up with the weather. Corda, my dear, will you walk with me?\"\n\"Of course, your Imperial Majesty,\" she said, helping him toward the tent's entrance.\n\"Would you like me to come with you as well, your Imperial Majesty?\" asked Versidue-Shaie.\n\"Or I?\" asked King Dro'Zel of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, a newly appointed advisor to the court.\n\"That won't be necessary, I won't be gone a minute,\" said Reman.\nMiramor crouched in the same rushes he had hidden in nearly eight months before. Now the ground was hard and snow-covered, and the rushes slick with ice. Every slight movement he made issued forth a crunch. If it were not for the raucous songs of the combined Morrowind and Imperial army gathered about the bonfire, he would not have dared creep this close to the Emperor and his concubine. They were standing at the curve in the frozen creek below the bluff, surrounded by trees sparkling with ice.\nCarefully, Miramor removed the dagger from its sheath. He had slightly exaggerated his abilities with a &lt;a href=\"Short%20Blade%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;short blade&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;. True, he had used one to cut the throat of Prince Juilek, but the lad was not in any position to fight back at the time. Still, how difficult could it be to stab an old man with one eye? What sort of blade skill would such an easy assassination require?\nHis ideal moment presented itself before his eyes. The woman saw something deeper in the woods, an icicle of an unusual shape she said, and darted off to get it. The Emperor remained behind, laughing. He turned to the face of the bluff to see his soldiers singing their song's refrain, his back to his assassin. Miramor knew the moment had come. Mindful of the sound of his footfall on the icy ground, he stepped forward and struck. Very nearly.\nAlmost simultaneously, he was aware of a strong arm holding back his striking arm and another one punching a dagger into his throat. He could not scream. The Emperor, still looking up at the soldiers, never saw Miramor pulled back into the brush and a hand much more skilled than his slicing into his back, paralyzing him.\nHis blood pooling out and already crystallizing on the frozen ground, Miramor watched, dying, as the Emperor and his courtesan returned to join the camp up on the bluff.\n12 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nA gout of ever-erupting flame was all that remained of the central courtyard of Castle Mournhold, blasting skyward into the boiling clouds. A thick, tarry smoke rolled through the streets, igniting everything that was wood or paper on fire. Winged bat-like creatures harried the citizens from their hiding places out into the open, where they were met by the real army. The only thing that kept all of Mournhold from burning to the ground was the wet, sputtering blood of its people.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; smiled as he surveyed the castle crumbling.\n\"To think I nearly didn't come,\" he said aloud, his voice booming over the chaos. \"Imagine missing all this fun.\"\nHis attention was arrested by a needle-thin shaft of light piercing through his black and red shadowed sky. He followed it to its source, two figures, a man and a woman standing on the hill above town. The man in the white robe he recognized immediately as Sotha Sil, the sorcerer who had talked all the Princes of Oblivion into that meaningless truce.\n\"If you've come for the Duke of Mournhold, he isn't here,\" laughed Mehrunes Dagon. \"But you might find pieces of him the next time it rains.\"\n\"Daedra, we cannot kill you,\" said Almalexia, her face hard and resolute. \"But that you will soon regret.\"\nWith that, two living gods and a prince of Oblivion engaged in battle on the ruins of Mournhold.\n17 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\n\"Night Mother,\" said the guard. \"Correspondence from your agent in the Imperial Palace.\"\nThe Night Mother read the note carefully. The test had been a success: Miramor had been successfully detected and slain. The Emperor was in very unsafe hands. The Night Mother responded immediately.\n18 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nSotha Sil, face solemn and unreadable, greeted Vivec at the grand plaza in front of his palace. Vivec had ridden day and night after hearing about the battle in his tent in Bodrum, crossing mile after mile, cutting through the dangerous ground at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt; at blinding speed. To the south, during all the course of the journey, he could see the whirling red clouds and knew that the battle was continuing, day after day. In &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, he met a messenger from Sotha Sil, asking him to meet at Balmora.\n\"Where is Almalexia?\"\n\"Inside,\" said Sotha Sil wearily. There was a long, ugly gash running across his jaw. \"She's gravely injured, but Mehrunes Dagon will not return from Oblivion for many a moon.\"\nAlmalexia lay on a bed of silk, tended to by Vivec's own healers. Her face, even her lips, was gray as stone, and blood stained through the gauze of her bandages. Vivec took her cold hand. Almalexia's mouth moved wordlessly. She was dreaming.\nShe was battling Mehrunes Dagon again amid a firestorm. All around her, the blackened husk of a castle crumbled, splashing sparks into the night sky. The Daedra's claws dug into her belly, spreading poison through her veins while Almalexia throttled him. As she sank to the ground beside her defeated foe, she saw that the castle consumed by fire was not Castle Mournhold. It was the Imperial Palace.\n24 Sun's Dusk, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nA winter gale blew over the city, splashing the windows and glass domes of the Imperial Palace. Quivering light rays illuminated the figures within in surreal patterns.\nThe Emperor barked orders to his staff in preparations for the banquet and ball. This was what he enjoyed best, more than battle. King Dro'Zel was supervising the entertainment, having strong opinions on the matter. The Emperor himself was arranging the details of the dinner. Roast nebfish, vegetable marrow, cream soups, buttered helerac, codscrumb, tongue in aspic. &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; had made a few suggestions of his own, but the tastes of the Akaviri were very peculiar.\nThe Lady &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the Emperor to his chambers as night fell.\nThe Year is Concluded in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2012%20-%20Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;.\n2920, vol 12 - Evening Star.\n1 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nThe winter morning sun glinted through the cobweb of frost on the window, and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; opened her eyes. An ancient healer mopped a wet cloth across her head, smiling with relief. Asleep in the chair next to her bed was &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. The healer rushed to a side cabinet and returned with a flagon of water.\n\"How are you feeling, goddess?\" asked the healer.\n\"Like I've been asleep for a very long time,\" said Almalexia.\n\"So you have. Fifteen days,\" said the healer, and touched Vivec's arm. \"Master, wake up. She speaks.\"\nVivec rose with a start, and seeing Almalexia alive and awake, his face broke into a wide grin. He kissed her forehead, and took her hand. At last, there was warmth again in her flesh.\nAlmalexia's peaceful repose suddenly snapped: \"&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; --\"\n\"He's alive and well,\" replied Vivec. \"Working on one of his machines again somewhere. He would have stayed here too, but he realized he could do you more good working that peculiar sorcery of his.\"\nThe castellan appeared in the doorway. \"Sorry to interrupt you, master, but I wanted to tell you that your fastest messenger left late last night for the Imperial City.\"\n\"Messenger?\" asked Almalexia. \"Vivec, what has happened?\"\n\"I was to go and sign a truce with the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; on the sixth, so I sent him word that it had to be postponed.\"\n\"You can't do me any good here,\" said Almalexia, pulling herself up with effort. \"But if you don't sign that truce, you'll put Morrowind back to war, maybe for another eighty years. If you leave today with an escort and hurry, perhaps you can get to the Imperial City only a day or two late.\"\n\"Are you certain you don't need me here?\" asked Vivec.\n\"I know that Morrowind needs you more.\"\n6 Sun's Dusk, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt; sat on his throne, surveying the audience chamber. It was a spectacular sight: silver ribbons dangled from the rafters, burning cauldrons of sweet herbs simmered in every corner, &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;n swallowtails sweeping through the air, singing their songs. When the torches were lit and servants began fanning, the room would be transfigured into a shimmering fantasy land. He could smell the kitchen already, spices and roasts.\nThe Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; slithered into the room, both bedecked in the headdress and jewelry of the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;. There was no smile on their golden face, but there seldom was one. The Emperor still greeted his trusted advisor with enthusiasm.\n\"This ought to impress those savage &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;,\" he laughed. \"When are they supposed to arrive?\"\n\"A messenger's just arrived from Vivec,\" said the Potentate solemnly. \"I think it would be best if your Imperial Majesty met him alone.\"\nThe Emperor lost his laughter, but nodded to his servants to withdraw. The door then opened and the Lady &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt; walked into the room, with a parchment in her hand. She shut the door behind her, but did not look up to meet the Emperor's face.\n\"The messenger gave his letter to my mistress?\" said Reman, incredulous, rising to take the note. \"That's a highly unorthodox way of delivering a message.\"\n\"But the message itself is very orthodox,\" said Corda, looking up into his one good eye. With a single blinding motion, she brought the letter up under the Emperor's chin. His eyes widened and blood poured down the blank parchment. Blank that is, except for a small black mark, the sign of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. It fell to the floor, revealing the small dagger hidden behind it, which she now twisted, severing his throat to the bone. The Emperor collapsed to the floor, gasping soundlessly.\n\"How long do you need?\" asked Savirien-Chorak.\n\"Five minutes,\" said Corda, wiping the blood from her hands. \"If you can give me ten, though, I'll be doubly grateful.\"\n\"Very well,\" said the Potentate to Corda's back as she raced from the audience chamber. \"She ought to have been an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, the way the girl handles a blade is truly remarkable.\"\n\"I must go and establish our alibi,\" said Savirien-Chorak, disappearing behind one of the secret passages that only the Emperor's most trusted knew about.\n\"Do you remember, close to a year ago, your Imperial Majesty,\" the Potentate smiled, looking down at the dying man. \"When you told me to remember 'You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.' I remembered that, you see.\"\nThe Emperor spat up blood and somehow said the word: \"Snake.\"\n\"I am a snake, your Imperial Majesty, inside and out. But I didn't lie. There was a messenger from Vivec. It seems he'll be a little late in arriving,\" the Potentate shrugged before disappearing behind the secret passage. \"Don't worry yourself. I'm sure the food won't go bad.\"\nThe Emperor of Tamriel died in a pool of his own blood in his empty audience chamber decorated for a grand ball. He was found by his bodyguard fifteen minutes later. Corda was nowhere to be found.\n8 Sun's Dusk, 2920Caer Suvio, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nLord Gla, apologizing profusely for the quality of the road through the forest, was the first emissary to greet Vivec and his escort as they arrived. A string of burning globes decorated the leafless trees surrounding the villa, bobbing in the gentle but frigid night breeze. From within, Vivec could smell the simple feast and a high sad melody. It was a traditional &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; wintertide carol.\n&lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; greeted Vivec at the front door.\n\"I'm glad you received the message before you got all the way to the City,\" said the Potentate, guiding his guest into the large, warm drawing room. \"We are in a difficult transition time, and for the moment, it is best not to conduct our business at the capitol.\"\n\"There is no heir?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No official one, though there are distant cousins vying for the throne. While we sort the matter out, at least temporarily the nobles have decided that I may act in the office of my late master,\" Versidue-Shaie signaled for the servants to draw two comfortable chairs in front of the fireplace. \"Would you feel most comfortable if we signed the treaty officially right now, or would you like to eat something first?\"\n\"You intend to honor the Emperor's treaty?\"\n\"I intend to do everything as the Emperor,\" said the Potentate.\n14 Sun's Dusk, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, dusty from the road, flew into the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s arms. For a moment, they stayed locked together, the Night Mother stroking her daughter's hair, kissing her forehead. Finally, she reached into her sleeve and handed Corda a letter.\n\"What is it?\" asked Corda.\n\"A letter from the Potentate, expressing his delight at your expertise,\" replied the Night Mother. \"He's promised to send us payment, but I've already sent him back a reply. The late Empress paid us enough for her husband's death. &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; would not have us be greedy beyond our needs. You should not be paid twice for the same murder, so it is written.\"\n\"He killed &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt;, my sister,\" said Corda quietly.\n\"And so it should be that you struck the blow.\"\n\"Where will I go now?\"\n\"Whenever any of our holy workers becomes too famous to continue the crusade, we send them to an island called Vounoura. It's not more than a month's voyage by boat, and I've arranged for a delightful estate for your sanctuary,\" the Night Mother kissed the girl's tears. \"You meet many friends there, and I know you will find peace and happiness at last, my child.\"\n19 Sun's Dusk, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nAlmalexia surveyed the rebuilding of the town. The spirit of the citizens was truly inspirational, she thought, as she walked among the skeletons of new buildings standing in the blackened, shattered remains of the old. Even the plant life showed a remarkable resilience. There was life yet in the blasted remains of the &lt;a href=\"comberry\"&gt;comberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"roobrush\"&gt;roobrush&lt;/a&gt; shrubs that once lined the main avenue. She could feel the pulse. Come springtide, green would bolt through the black.\nThe Duke's heir, a lad of considerable intelligence and sturdy Dunmer courage, was coming down from the north to take his father's place. The land would do more than survive: it would strengthen and expand. She felt the future much more strongly than she saw the present.\nOf all the things she was most certain of, she knew that Mournhold was forever home to at least one goddess.\n22 Sun's Dusk, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"The Cyrodiil line is dead,\" announced the Potentate to the crowd gathered beneath the Speaker's Balcony of the Imperial Palace. \"But the Empire lives. The distant relatives of our beloved Emperor have been judged unworthy of the throne by the trusted nobility who advised his Imperial Majesty throughout his long and illustrious reign. It has been decided that as an impartial and faithful friend of Reman III, I will have the responsibility of continuing on in his name.\"\nThe Akaviri paused, allowing his words to echo and translate into the ears of the populace. They merely stared up at him in silence. The rain had washed through the streets of the city, but the sun, for a brief time, appeared to be offering a respite from the winter storms.\n\"I want to make it clear that I am not taking the title Emperor,\" he continued. \"I have been and will continue to be Potentate Versidue-Shaie, an alien welcomed kindly to your shores. It will be my duty to protect my adopted homeland, and I pledge to work tirelessly at this task until someone more worthy takes the burden from me. As my first act, I declare that in commemoration of this historical moment, beginning on the first of Morning Star, we will enter year one of the Second Era as time will be reckoned. Thus, we mourn the loss of our Imperial family, and look forward to the future.\"\nOnly one man clapped at these words. King Dro'Zel of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; truly believed that this would be the finest thing to happen to Tamriel in history. Of course, he was quite mad.\n31 Sun's Dusk, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the smoky catacombs beneath the city where &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; forged the future with his arcane clockwork apparatus, something unforeseen happened. An oily bubble seeped from a long trusted gear and popped. Immediately, the wizard's attention was drawn to it and to the chain that tiny action triggered. A pipe shifted half an inch to the left. A tread skipped. A coil rewound itself and began spinning in a counter direction. A piston that had been thrusting left-right, left-right, for millennia suddenly began shifting right-left. Nothing broke, but everything changed.\n\"It cannot be fixed now,\" said the sorcerer quietly.\nHe looked up through a crick in the ceiling into the night sky. It was midnight. The &lt;a href=\"second%20era\"&gt;second era&lt;/a&gt;, the age of chaos, had begun.\n2920, Vol. 13.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n2 Mid Year, 2920Balmora, Morrowind\n\"The Imperial army is gathered to the south,\" said Cassyr. \"They are a two week march from Ald Iuval and Lake Coronati, heavily armored.\"\nVivec nodded. Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake Ald Malak were strategically important fortresses. He had been expecting a move against them for some time. His captain pulled down a map of southwestern Morrowind from the wall and smoothed it out, fighting a gentle summer sea breeze wafting in from the open window.\n\"They were heavily armored, you say?\" asked the captain.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Cassyr. \"They were camped out near &lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt; in the Heartland, and I saw nothing but Ebony, Dwarven, and Daedric armor, fine weaponry, and siege equipment.\"\n\"How about spellcasters and boats?\" asked Vivec.\n\"A horde of battlemages,\" replied Cassyr. \"But no boats.\"\n\"As heavily armored as they are, it will take them at least two weeks, like you said, to get from Bethal Gray to Lake Coronati,\" Vivec studied the map carefully. \"They'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval. Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south.\"\n\"They'll be vulnerable along the straits,\" said the captain. \"Provided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the Heartland.\"\n\"Your intelligence has once again served us well,\" said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. \"We will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again.\"\n3 Mid Year, 2920Bethal Gray, Cyrodiil\n\"Will you be returning back this way after your victory?\" asked Lord Bethal.\nPrince Juilek barely paid the man any attention. He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds. All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.\n\"If we return shortly, it will be because of defeat,\" said the Prince. He could see down in the meadow, the Potentate Versidue-Shaie paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores. An army was an expensive thing, for certes.\n\"My Prince,\" said Lord Bethal with concern. \"Is your army beginning a march due east? That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati. You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits.\"\n\"You just make certain your merchants get their share of our gold,\" said the Prince with a grin. \"Let me worry about my army's direction.\"\n16 Mid Year, 2920Lake Coronati, Morrowind\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters. What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection. They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest. Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor, could not move invisibly or silently.\n\"Let me see the map again,\" he called to his captain. \"Is there no other way they could approach?\"\n\"We have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and get bogged down,\" said the captain. \"We would at least hear about it. But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits.\"\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him. Then he looked back on the map.\n\"Spy,\" said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. \"When you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?\"\n\"They were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them,\" explained Cassyr. \"I figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army? They couldn't have all been healers.\"\n\"You fool!\" roared Vivec. \"They're mystics schooled in the art of Alteration. They've cast a spell of water breathing on the entire army.\"\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north. Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, he could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak. Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.\n\"Return to Dwynnen,\" said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. \"Your services are no longer needed nor wanted.\"\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak. It had been taken by the Imperial Army.\n2920, Vol. 14.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n19 Mid Year, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nThe Potentate arrived in the Imperial City amid great fanfare, the streets lined with men and women cheering him as the symbol of the taking of Ald Marak. Truth be told, a greater number would have turned out had the Prince returned, and the Versidue-Shaie knew it. Still, it pleased him to no end. Never before had citizens of Tamriel cheered the arrival of an Akaviri into their land.\nThe Emperor Reman III greeted him with a warm embrace, and then tore into the letter he had brought from the Prince.\n\"I don't understand,\" he said at last, still joyous but equally confused. \"You went under the lake?\"\n\"Ald Marak is a very well-fortified fortress,\" explained the Potentate. \"As, I might add, the army of Morrowind has rediscovered, now that they are on the outside. To take it, we had to attack by surprise and with our soldiery in the sturdiest of armor. By casting the spell that allowed us to breathe underwater, we were able to travel faster than Vivec would have guessed, the weight of the armor made less by the aquatic surroundings, and attack from the waterbound west side of the fortress where their defenses were at their weakest.\"\n\"Brilliant!\" the Emperor crowed. \"You are a wonderous tactician, Versidue-Shaie! If your fathers had been as good at this as you are, Tamriel would be Akaviri domain!\"\nThe Potentate had not planned to take credit for Prince Juilek's design, but on the Emperor's reference to his people's fiasco of an invasion two hundred and sixteen years before, he made up his mind. He smiled modestly and soaked up the praise.\n21 Mid Year, 2920Ald Marak, Morrowind\nSavirien-Chorak slithered to the wall and watched through the arrow slit the Morrowind army retreating back to the forestland between the swamps and the castle grounds. It seemed like the idea opportunity to strike. Perhaps the forests could be burned and the army within them. Perhaps with Vivec in their enemies' hands, the army would allow them possession of Ald Iuval as well. He suggested these ideas to the Prince.\n\"What you seem to be forgetting,\" laughed Prince Juilek, \"is that I gave my word that no harm to the army or to their commanders during the truce negotiations. Do you not have honor during warfare on Akavir?\"\n\"My Prince, I was born here in Tamriel, I have never been to my people's home,\" replied the snake man. \"But even so, your ways are strange to me. You expected no quarter and I gave you none when we fought in the Imperial Arena five months ago.\"\n\"That was a game,\" replied the Prince, before nodding to his steward to let the Dunmer battle chief in.\nJuilek had never seen Vivec before, but he had heard he was a living god. What came before him was but a man. A powerfully built man, handsome, with an intelligent face, but a man nonetheless. The Prince was pleased: a man he could speak with, but not a god.\n\"Greetings, my worthy adversary,\" said Vivec. \"We seem to be at an impasse.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" said the Prince. \"You don't want to give us Morrowind, and I can't fault you for that. But I must have your coastline to protect the Empire from overseas aggressions, and certain key strategic border castles, such as this one, as well as Ald Umbeil, Tel Aruhn, Ald Lambasi, and Tel Mothrivra.\"\n\"And in return?\" asked Vivec.\n\"In return?\" laughed Savirien-Chorak. \"You forget we are the victors here, not you.\"\n\"In return,\" said Prince Juilek carefully. \"There will be no Imperial attacks on Morrowind, unless in return to an attack by you. You will be protected from invaders by the Imperial Navy. And your land may expand by taking certain estates in Black Marsh, whichever you choose, provided they are not needed by the Empire.\"\n\"A reasonable offer,\" said Vivec after a pause. \"You must forgive me, I am unused to Cyrodiils who offer something in return for what they take. May I have a few days to decide?\"\n\"We will meet again in a week's time,\" said the Prince, smiling. \"In the meantime, if your army provokes no attacks on mine, we are at peace.\"\nVivec left the Prince's chamber, feeling that Almalexia was right. The war was at an end. This Prince would make an excellent Emperor.\n2920, Vol. 15.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n4 Sun's Height, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nThe Emperor Reman III and his Potentate Versidue-Shaie took a stroll around the Imperial Gardens. Studded with statuary and fountains, the north gardens fit the Emperor's mood, as well as being the coolest acreage in the City during the heat of summertide. Austere, tiered flowerbeds of blue-gray and green towered all around them as they walked.\n\"Vivec has agreed to the Prince's terms for peace,\" said Reman. \"My son will be returning in two weeks' time.\"\n\"This is excellent news,\" said the Potentate carefully. \"I hope the Dunmer will honor the terms. We might have asked for more. The fortress at Black Gate, for example. But I suppose the Prince knows what is reasonable. He would not cripple the Empire just for peace.\"\n\"I have been thinking lately of Rijja and what caused her to plot against my life,\" said the Emperor, pausing to admire a statue of the Slave Queen Alessia before continuing. \"The only thing I can think of to account for it is that she admired my son too much. She may have loved me for my power and my personality, but he, after all, is young and handsome and will one day inherit my throne. She must have thought that if I were dead, she could have an Emperor who had both youth and power.\"\n\"The Prince \u2026 was in on this plot?\" asked Versidue-Shaie. It was a difficult game to play, anticipating where the Emperor's paranoia would strike next.\n\"Oh, I don't think so,\" said Reman, smiling. \"No, my son loves me well.\"\n\"Are you aware that Corda, Rijja's sister, is an initiate of the Morwha conservatorium in Hegathe?\" asked the Potentate.\n\"Morwha?\" asked the Emperor. \"I've forgotten: which god is that?\"\n\"Lusty fertility goddess of the Yokudans,\" replied the Potentate. \"But not too lusty, like Dibella. Demure, but certainly sexual.\"\n\"I am through with lusty women. The Empress, Rijja, all too lusty, a lust for love leads to a lust for power,\" the Emperor shrugged his shoulders. \"But a priestess-in-training with a certain healthy appetite sounds ideal. Now what were you saying about the Black Gate?\"\n6 Sun's Height, 2920Thurzo Fortress, Cyrodiil\nRijja stood quietly looking at the cold stone floor while the Emperor spoke. He had never before seen her so pale and joyless. She might at least be pleased that she was being freed, being returned to her homeland. Why, if she left now, she could be in Hammerfell by the Merchant's Festival. Nothing he said seemed to register any reaction from her. A month and a half's stay in Thurzo Fortress seemed to have killed her spirit.\n\"I was thinking,\" said the Emperor at last. \"Of having your younger sister Corda up to the palace for a time. I think she would prefer it over the conservatorium in Hegathe, don't you?\"\nReaction, at last. Rijja looked at the Emperor with animal hatred, flinging herself at him in a rage. Her fingernails had grown long since her imprisonment and she raked them across his face, into his eyes. He howled with pain, and his guards pulled her off, pummeling her with blows from the back of their swords, until she was knocked unconscious.\nA healer was called at once, but the Emperor Reman III had lost his right eye.\n23 Sun's Height, 2920Balmora, Morrowind\nVivec pulled himself from the water, feeling the heat of the day washed from his skin, taking a towel from one of his servants. Sotha Sil watched his old friend from the balcony.\n\"It looks like you've picked up a few more scars since I last saw you,\" said the sorcerer.\n\"Azura grant it that I have no more for a while,\" laughed Vivec. \"When did you arrive?\"\n\"A little over an hour ago,\" said Sotha Sil, walking down the stairs to the water's edge. \"I thought I was coming to end a war, but it seems you've done it without me.\"\n\"Yes, eighty years is long enough for ceaseless battle,\" replied Vivec, embracing Sotha Sil. \"We made concessions, but so did they. When the old Emperor is dead, we may be entering a golden age. Prince Juilek is very wise for his age. Where is Almalexia?\"\n\"Collecting the Duke of Mournhold. They should be here tomorrow afternoon.\"\nThe men were distracted at a sight from around the corner of the palace\u2014a rider was approaching through the town, heading for the front steps. It was evident that the woman had been riding hard for some time. They met her in the study, where she burst in, breathing hard.\n\"We have been betrayed,\" she gasped. \"The Imperial Army has seized the Black Gate.\"\n2920, Vol. 16.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n24 Sun's Height, 2920Balmora, Morrowind\nIt was the first time in seventeen years that the three members of the Morrowind Tribunal had met in the same place, since Sotha Sil had left for Artaeum. All three wished that the circumstances of their reunion were different.\n\"From what we've learned, while the Prince was returning to Cyrodiil to the south, a second Imperial Army came down from the north,\" said Vivec to his stony-faced compatriots. \"It is reasonable to assume Juilek didn't know about the attack.\"\n\"But neither would it be unreasonable to suppose that he planned on being a distraction while the Emperor launched the attack on Black Gate,\" said Sotha Sil. \"This must be considered a breach of the truce.\"\n\"Where is the Duke of Mournhold?\" asked Vivec. \"I would hear his thoughts on the matter.\"\n\"He is meeting with the Night Mother in Tel Aruhn,\" said Almalexia, quietly. \"I told him to wait until he had spoken with you, but he said that the matter had waited long enough.\"\n\"He would involve the Morag Tong? In outside affairs?\" Vivec shook his head, and looked to Sotha Sil: \"Please, do what you can. Assassination will only move us backwards. This matter must be settled with diplomacy or battle.\"\n25 Sun's Height, 2920Tel Aruhn, Morrowind\nThe Night Mother met Sotha Sil in her salon, lit only by the moon. She was cruelly beautiful, dressed in a simple silk black robe and lounging across her divan. With a gesture, she dismissed her red-cloaked guards and offered the sorcerer some wine.\n\"You've only just missed your friend, the Duke,\" she whispered. \"He was very unhappy, but I think we will solve his problem for him.\"\n\"Did he hire the Morag Tong to assassinate the Emperor?\" asked Sotha Sil.\n\"You are straightforward, aren't you? That's good. I love plain-speaking men: it saves so much time. Of course, I cannot discuss with you what the Duke and I talked about,\" she smiled. \"It would be bad for business.\"\n\"What if I were to offer you an equal amount of gold for you not to assassinate the Emperor?\"\n\"The Morag Tong murders for the glory of Mephala and for profit,\" she said, speaking into her glass of wine. \"We do not merely kill. That would be sacrilege. Once the Duke's gold has arrived in three day's time, we will do our end of the business. And I'm afraid we would not dream of entertaining a counter offer. Though we are a business as well as a religious order, we do not bow to supply and demand, Sotha Sil.\"\n27 Sun's Height, 2920The Inner Sea, Morrowind\nSotha Sil had been watching the waters for two days now, waiting for a particular vessel, and now he saw it. A heavy ship with the flag of Mournhold. The sorcerer took the air and intercepted it before it reached harbor. A caul of flame erupted over his figure, disguising his voice and form into that of a Daedra.\n\"Abandon your ship!\" he bellowed. \"If you would not sink with it!\"\nIn truth, Sotha Sil could have exploded the vessel with but a single ball of fire, but he chose to take his time, to give the crew a chance to dive off into the warm water. When he was certain there was no one living aboard, he focused his energy into a destructive wave that shook the air and water as it discharged. The ship and the Duke's payment to the Morag Tong sunk to the bottom of the Inner Sea.\n\"Night Mother,\" thought Sotha Sil, as he floated towards shore to alert the harbormaster that some sailors were in need of rescue. \"Everyone bows to supply and demand.\"\n2920, Vol. 17.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n1 Last Seed, 2920Mournhold, Morrowind\nThey were gathered in the Duke's courtyard at twilight, enjoying the smell and warmth of a fire of dry branches and bittergreen leaves. Tiny embers flew into the sky, hanging for a few moments before vanishing.\n\"I was rash,\" agreed the Duke, soberly. \"But &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; had his laugh, and all is well. The Morag Tong will not assassinate the Emperor now that my payment to them is at the bottom of the Inner Sea. I thought you had made some sort of a truce with the Daedra princes.\"\n\"What your sailors called a Daedra may not have been one,\" said Sotha Sil. \"Perhaps it was a rogue battlemage or even a lightning bolt that destroyed your ship.\"\n\"The Prince and the Emperor are en route to take possession of Ald Lambasi as our truce agreed. It is certainly typical of the Cyrodiils to assume that their concessions are negotiable, while ours are not,\" Vivec pulled out a map. \"We can meet them here, in this village to the northwest of Ald Lambasi, Fervinthil.\"\n\"But will we meet them to talk,\" ask Almalexia. \"Or to make war?\"\nNo one had an answer to that.\n15 Last Seed, 2920Fervinthil, Morrowind\nA late summer squall blew through the small village, darkening the sky except for flashes of lightning which leapt from cloud to cloud like acrobats across high wires. Water rushed down the narrow streets ankle-deep, and the Prince had to shout to be heard by his captains, who were but a few feet away from him.\n\"There's an inn up ahead! We'll wait there for the storm to pass before pressing on to Ald Lambasi!\"\nThe inn was warm and dry, and bustling with business. Barmaids were rushing back and forth, bringing greef and wine to a back room, evidently excited about a famous visitor. Someone who was attracting more attention than the mere heir to the Empire of Tamriel. Amused, Juilek watched them run until he overheard the name of \"Vivec.\"\n\"My Lord Vivec,\" he said, bursting into the back room. \"You must believe me, I knew nothing about the attack on Black Gate until after it happened. We will, of course, be returning it to your care forthwith. I wrote you a letter to that effect at your palace in Balmora, but obviously you're not there,\" he paused, taking in the many new faces in the room. \"I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Juilek Cyrodiil.\"\n\"My name is Almalexia,\" said the most beautiful woman the Prince had ever seen. \"Won't you join us?\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" said a serious-looking Dunmer in a white cloak, shaking the Prince's hand and showing him to a seat.\n\"Indoril Brindisi Dorom, Duke-Prince of Mournhold,\" said the massively built man next to him as he sat down.\n\"I recognize that the events of the last month suggest, at best, that the Imperial Army is not under my control,\" said the Prince after ordering some wine. \"This is true. The army is my father's.\"\n\"I understood that the Emperor was going to be coming to Ald Lambasi as well,\" said Almalexia.\n\"Officially, he is,\" said the Prince cautiously. \"Unofficially, he's still back in the Imperial City. He's met with an unfortunate accident.\"\nVivec glanced at the Duke quickly before looking at the Prince. \"An accident?\"\n\"He's fine,\" said the Prince quickly. \"He'll live, but it looks like he'll lose an eye. It was an altercation that has nothing to do with the war. The only good news is that while he recovers, I have the use of his seal. Any agreement we make here and now will be binding to the Empire, both in my father's reign and in mine.\"\n\"Then let's start agreeing,\" smiled Almalexia.\n2920, Vol. 18.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n16 Last Seed, 2920Wroth Naga, Cyrodiil\nThe tiny hamlet of Wroth Naga greeted Cassyr with its colorful houses perched on a promontory overlooking the stretch of the Wrothgarian mountain plain and High Rock beyond. Had he been in a better mood, the sight would have been breathtaking. As it was, he could only think that in practical terms, a small village like this would have meager provisions for himself and his horse.\nHe rode down into the main square, where an inn called the Eagle's Cry stood. Directing the stable boy to house and feed his horse, Cassyr walked into the inn and was surprised by its ambience. A minstrel he had heard play once in Gilverdale was performing a jaunty old tune to the clapping of the mountain men. Such forced merriment was not what Cassyr wanted at that moment. A glum Dunmer woman was seated at the only table far from the noise, so he took his drink there and sat down without invitation. It was only when he did so that he noticed that she was holding a newborn baby.\n\"I've just come from Morrowind,\" he said rather awkwardly, lowering his voice. \"I've been fighting for Vivec and the Duke of Mournhold against the Imperial Army. A traitor to my people, I guess you'd call me.\"\n\"I am also a traitor to my people,\" said the woman, holding up her hand which was scarred with a branded symbol. \"It means that I can never go back to my homeland.\"\n\"Well, you're not thinking of staying here, are you?\" laughed Cassyr. \"It's certainly quaint, but come wintertide, there's going to be snow up to your eyelashes. It's no place for a new baby. What is her name?\"\n\"Bosriel. It means 'Beauty of the Forest.' Where are you going?\"\n\"Dwynnen, on the bay in High Rock. You're welcome to join me, I could use the company.\" He held out his hand. \"Cassyr Whitley.\"\n\"Turala,\" said the woman after a pause. She was going to use her family's name first, as is tradition, but she realized that it was no longer her name. \"I would love to accompany you, thank you.\"\n19 Last Seed, 2920Ald Lambasi, Morrowind\nFive men and two women stood in the silence of the Great Room of the castle, the only sound the scrawl of quill on parchment and the gentle tapping of rain on the large picture window. As the Prince set the seal of Cyrodiil on the document, the peace was made official. The Duke of Mournhold broke out in a roar of delight, ordering wine brought in to commemorate the end of eighty years of war.\nOnly Sotha Sil stood apart from the group. His face betrayed no emotion. Those who knew him best knew he did not believe in endings or beginnings, but in the continuous cycle of which this was but a small part.\n\"My Prince,\" said the castle steward, unhappy at breaking the celebration. \"There is a messenger here from your mother, the Empress. He asked to see your father, but as he did not arrive\u2014\"\nJuilek excused himself and went to speak with the messenger.\n\"The Empress does not live in the Imperial City?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No,\" said Almalexia, shaking her head sadly. \"Her husband has imprisoned her in Black Marsh, fearing that she was plotting a revolution against him. She is extremely wealthy and has powerful allies in the western Colovian estates so he could not marry another or have her executed. They've been at an impasse for the last seventeen years since Juilek was a child.\"\nThe Prince returned a few minutes later. His face betrayed his anxiety, though he took troubles to hide it.\n\"My mother needs me,\" he said simply. \"I'm afraid I must leave at once. If I may have a copy of the treaty, I will bring it with me to show the Empress the good we have done today, and then I will carry it on to the Imperial City so it may be made official.\"\nPrince Juilek left with the fond farewells of the Three of Morrowind. As they watched him ride out into the rainswept night south towards Black Marsh, Vivec said, \"Tamriel will be much healed when he has the throne.\"\n2920, Vol. 19.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n5 Hearth Fire, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\"Your Imperial Majesty,\" said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie through the door. \"You can open the door.

The &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; were fading into the misty afternoon. Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture. Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel. For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it. Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reins.\nAs the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest. So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state. A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder. Cassyr opened his eyes.\n\"Where are we?\" he hissed.\n\"I don't know,\" Turala stammered, wide-eyed. \"What is that sound?\"\n\"Orcs,\" he whispered. \"A hunting party. Head for the thicket quickly.\"\nTurala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted. He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes. A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer. Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse. All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed. Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried. Now she was grateful for it. With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field. Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.\n\"With luck,\" he murmured. \"They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.\"\nAs he spoke, a horde of &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; surged into the field, blasting their horns. Turala had seen Orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence. Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid. The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds. Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded. One of the Orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.\nCassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could. His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could. Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.\nSuddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind. The Orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs. Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.\n\"I thought you were going to bring them right to me,\" she whispered, smiling. \"Best come with me.\"\nThe three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill. As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the Orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.\n\"That horse yours?\" she asked. When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. \"That's rich meat, that is. Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning. Serves 'em right.\"\n\"Shouldn't we keep moving?\" whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.\n\"They won't come up here,\" she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. \"They're too afraid of us.\"\nTurala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. \"Witches. Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?\"\n\"You are, pet,\" the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. \"I am Mynista Skeffington.\"\n\"What did you do to those Orcs?\" asked Turala. \"Back there in the thicket?\"\n\"Spirit fist right side the head,\" Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill. Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play. The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. \"Don't you have witches where you come from, child?\"\n\"None that I know of,\" she said.\n\"There are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,\" she explained. \"The Psijics study magic like it's their painful duty. The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows. We witches commune and conjure and celebrate. To fell those Orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead. You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls. It's about fostering relations. Being friendly, you might say.\"\n\"Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,\" said Cassyr.\n\"As well you might,\" coughed Mynista. \"Your kind destroyed the Orc homeland two thousand years ago. Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us. Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.\"\nWith that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.\n2920, Vol. 22.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n11 Hearth Fire, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nRijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect. It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the axe stroke. Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye. She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face. She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her. She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.\nThe first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed. The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.\nThe Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, \"Now that's done. You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named Corda?\"\n18 Hearth Fire, 2920\nDwynnen, High Rock\nThe horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered. Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden. Still, there was little to complain about. With the Dunmeri woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time. Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland. Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.\n\"How went the war?\" cried his cousin, running to the road. \"Is it true that Vivec signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?\"\n\"That's not how it was, was it?\" asked a friend, joining them. \"I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.\"\n\"Isn't there anything interesting happening here?\" Cassyr laughed. \"I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.\"\n\"You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,\" said his friend. \"She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.\"\n\"But that's nothing. What was Vivec like?\" asked his cousin eagerly. \"He supposed to be a living god.\"\n\"If Sheogorath steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,\" said Cassyr haughtily.\n\"And the women?\" asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmeri ladies on very rare occasions.\nCassyr merely smiled. Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away. She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for. But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever. Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the Iliac Bay.\n2920, Vol. 23.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n10 Frostfall, 2920Phrygias, High Rock\nThe creature before them blinked, senseless, its eyes glazed, mouth opening and closing as if relearning its function. A thin glob of saliva burbled down between its fangs, and hung suspended. Turala had never seen anything of its kind before, reptilian and massive, perched on its hind legs like a man. Mynistera applauded enthusiastically.\n\"My child,\" she crowed. \"You have come so far in so short a time. What were you thinking when you summoned this daedroth?\"\nIt took Turala a moment to recall whether she was thinking anything at all. She was merely overwhelmed that she had reached out across the fabric of reality into the realm of Oblivion, and plucked forth this loathsome creature, conjuring it into the world by the power of her mind.\n\"I was thinking of the color red,\" Turala said, concentrating. \"The simplicity and clarity of it. And then\u2014I desired, and spoke the charm. And this is what I conjured up.\"\n\"Desire is a powerful force for a young witch,\" said Mynistera. \"And it is well matched in this instance. For this daedroth is nothing if not a simple force of the spirits. Can you release your desire as easily?\"\nTurala closed her eyes and spoke the dismissal invocation. The monster faded away like a painting in sunlight, still blinking confusedly. Mynistera embraced her Dark Elf pupil, laughing with delight.\n\"I never would have believed it, a month and a day you've been with the coven, and you're already far more advanced than most of the women here. There is powerful blood in you, Turala, you touch spirits like you were touching a lover. You'll be leading this coven one day\u2014I have seen it!\"\nTurala smiled. It was good to be complimented. The Duke of Mournhold had praised her pretty face; and her family, before she had dishonored them, praised her manners. Cassyr had been nothing more than a companion: his compliments meant nothing. But with Mynistera, she felt she was home.\n\"You'll be leading the coven for many years yet, great sister,\" said Turala.\n\"I certainly intend to. But the spirits, while marvelous companions and faultless tellers of truth, are often hazy about the when and hows. You can't blame them really. When and how mean so little to them.\" Mynistera opened the door to the shed, allowing the brisk autumn breeze in to dispel the bitter and fetid smells of the daedroth. \"Now, I need you to run an errand to Wayrest. It's only a week's ride there, and a week's ride back. Bring Doryatha and Celephyna with you. As much as we try to be self-sufficient, there are herbs we can't grow here, and we seem to run through an enormous quantity of gems in no time at all. It's important that the people of the city learn to recognize you as one of the wise women of Skeffington coven. You'll find the benefits of being notorious far outweigh the inconveniences.\"\nTurala did as she was bade. As she and her sisters climbed aboard their horses, Mynistera brought her child, little five-month-old Bosriel to kiss her mother goodbye. The witches were in love with the little Dunmeri infant, fathered by a wicked duke, birthed by wild Ayleid Elves in the forest heart of the Empire. Turala knew her nursemaids would protect her child with their lives. After many kisses and a farewell wave, the three young witches rode off into the bright woods, under a covering of red, yellow, and orange.\n2920, Vol. 24.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n12 Frostfall, 2920Dwynnen, High Rock \nFor a Middas evening, the Least Loved Porcupine tavern was wildly crowded. A roaring fire in the pit in the center of the room cast an almost sinister glow on all the regulars, and made the abundance of bodies look like a punishment tapestry inspired by the Arcturian Heresies. Cassyr took his usual place with his cousin and ordered a flagon of ale.\n\"Have you been to see the Baron?\" asked Palyth.\n\"Yes, he may have work for me in the palace of Urvaius,\" said Cassyr proudly. \"But more than that I can't say. You understand, secrets of state and all that. Why are there so many damned people here tonight?\"\n\"A shipload of Dark Elves just came in to harbor. They've come from the war. I was just waiting until you got here to introduce you as another veteran.\"\nCassyr blushed, but regained his composure enough to ask: \"What are they doing here? Has there been a truce?\"\n\"I don't know the full story,\" said Palyth. \"But apparently, the Emperor and Vivec are in negotiations again. These fellas here have investments they were keen to check on, and they figured things on the Bay were quiet enough. But the only way we can get the full story is to talk to the chaps.\"\nWith that, Palyth gripped his cousin's arm and pulled him to the other side of the bar so suddenly, Cassyr would have had to struggle violently to resist. The Dunmeri travelers were spread out across four of the tables, laughing with the locals. They were largely amiable young men, well-dressed, befitting merchants, animated in gesture made more extravagant by liquor.\n\"Excuse me,\" said Palyth, intruding on the conversation. \"My shy cousin Cassyr was in the war as well, fighting for the living god, Vivec.\"\n\"The only Cassyr I ever heard of,\" said one of the Dunmer drunkenly with a wide, friendly smile, shaking Cassyr's free hand. \"Was a Cassyr Whitley, who Vivec said was the worst spy in history. We lost Ald Marak due to his bungling intelligence work. For your sake, friend, I hope the two of you were never confused.\"\nCassyr smiled and listened as the lout told the story of his failure with bountiful exaggerations which caused the table to roar with laughter. Several eyes looked his way, but none of the locals sought to explain that the fool of the tale was standing at attention. The eyes that stung the most were his cousin's, the young man who had believed that he had returned to Dwynnen a great hero. At some point, certainly, the Baron would hear about it, his idiocy increasing manifold with each retelling.\nWith every fiber in his soul, Cassyr cursed the living god Vivec.\n21 Frostfall, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nCorda, in a robe of blinding whiteness, a uniform of the priestesses of the Hegathe Morwha conservatorium, arrived in the City just as the first winter storm was passing. The clouds broke with sunlight, and the beauteous teenaged Redguard girl appeared in the wide avenue with escort, riding toward the Palace. While her sister was tall, thin, angular, and haughty, Corda was a small, round-faced lass with wide brown eyes. The locals were quick to draw comparisons.\n\"Not a month after Lady Rijja's execution,\" muttered a housemaid, peering out the window, and winking to her neighbor.\n\"And not a month out of the nunnery neither,\" the other woman agreed, reveling in the scandal. \"This one's in for a ride. Her sister weren't no innocent, and look where she ended up.\"\n2920, Vol. 25.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n24 Frostfall, 2920Dwynnen, High Rock\nCassyr stood on the harbor and watched the early sleet fall on the water. It was a pity, he thought, that he was prone to seasickness. There was nothing for him now in Tamriel to the east or to the west. Vivec's tale of his poor spycraft had spread to taverns everywhere. The Baron of Dwynnen had released him from his contract. No doubt they were laughing about him in Daggerfall, too, and Dawnstar, Lilmoth, Rimmen, Greenheart, probably in Akavir and Yokuda for that matter. Perhaps it would be best to drop into the waves and sink. The thought, however, did not stay long in his mind: it was not despair that haunted him, but rage. Impotent fury that he could not assuage.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said a voice behind him, making him jump. \"I'm sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering whether you could recommend an inexpensive tavern for me to spend the night.\"\nIt was a young man, a Nord, with a sack over his shoulder. Obviously, he had just disembarked from one of the boats. For the first time in weeks, someone was looking at Cassyr as something other than a colossal, famous idiot. He could not help, black as his mood was, but be friendly.\n\"You've just arrived from Skyrim?\" asked Cassyr.\n\"No, sir, that's where I'm going,\" said the fellow. \"I'm working my way home. I've come up from Sentinel, and before that Stros M'kai, and before that Woodhearth in Valenwood, and before that Artaeum in Summerset. Welleg's my name.\"\nCassyr introduced himself and shook Welleg's hand. \"Did you say you came from Artaeum? Are you a Psijic?\"\n\"No, sir, not anymore,\" the fellow shrugged. \"I was expelled.\"\n\"Do you know anything about summoning Daedra? You see, I want to cast a curse against a particularly powerful person, one might say a living god, and I haven't had any luck. The Baron won't allow me in his sight, but the Baroness has sympathy for me and allowed me the use of their Summoning Chambers.\" Cassyr spat. \"I did all the rituals, made sacrifices, but nothing came of it.\"\n\"That'd be because of Sotha Sil, my old master,\" replied Welleg with some bitterness. \"The Daedra princes have agreed not to be summoned by any amateurs at least until the war ends. Only the Psijics may counsel with the Daedra, and a few nomadic sorcerers and witches.\"\n\"Witches, did you say?\"\n2920, Vol. 26.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n29 Frostfall, 2920Phrygias, High Rock\nPale sunlight flickered behind the mist bathing the forest as Turala, Doryatha, and Celephyna drove their horses on. The ground was wet with a thin layer of frost, and laden down with goods, it was a slippery way over unpaved hills. Turala tried to contain her excitement about coming back to the coven. Wayrest had been an adventure, and she adored the looks of fear and respect the cityfolk gave her. But for the last few days, all she could think of was returning to her sisters and her child.\nA bitter wind whipped her hair forward so she could see nothing but the path ahead. She did not hear the rider approach to her side until he was almost upon her. When she turned and saw Cassyr, she shouted with as much surprise as pleasure at meeting an old friend. His face was pale and drawn, but she took it to be merely from travel.\n\"What brings you back to Phrygias?\" she smiled. \"Were you not treated well in &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Well enough,\" said Cassyr. \"I have need of the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20coven\"&gt;Skeffington coven&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Ride with us,\" said Turala. \"I'll bring you to Mynistera.\"\nThe four continued on, and the witches regaled Cassyr with tales of Wayrest. It was evident that it was also a rare treat for Doryatha and Celephyna to leave Old Barbyn's Farm. They had been born there, as daughters and grand-daughters of Skeffington witches. Ordinary High Rock city life was exotic to them as it was to Turala. Cassyr said little, but smiled and nodded his head, which was encouragement enough. Thankfully, none of the stories they had heard were about his own stupidity. Or at the very least, they did not tell him.\nDoryatha was in the midst of a tale she had heard in a tavern about a thief who had been locked overnight in a pawnshop when they crossed over a familiar hill. Suddenly, she halted in her story. The barn was supposed to be visible, but it was not. The other three followed her gaze into the fog, and a moment later, they rode as fast as they could towards what was once the site of the Skeffington coven.\nThe fire had long since burned out. Nothing but ashes, skeletons, and broken weaponry remained. Cassyr recognized at once the signs of an Orc raid.\nThe witches fell from their horses, racing through the remains, wailing. Celephyna found a tattered, bloody piece of cloth that she recognized from Mynistera's cloak. She held it to her ashen face, sobbing. Turala screamed for Bosriel, but the only reply was the high whistling wind through the ashes.\n\"Who did this?\" she cried, tears streaking down her face. \"I swear I'll conjure up the very flames of Oblivion! What have they done with my baby?\"\n\"I know who did it,\" said Cassyr quietly, dropping from his horse and walking towards her. \"I've seen these weapons before. I fear I met the very fiends responsible in Dwynnen, but I never thought they'd find you. This is the work of assassins hired by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nHe paused. The lie came easily. Adopt and improvise. What's more, he could tell instantly that she believed it. Her resentment over the cruelty the Duke had shown her had quieted, but never disappeared. One look at her burning eyes told him that she would summon the Daedra and wreak his, and her, revenge upon Morrowind. And what's more, he knew they'd listen.\nAnd listen they did. For the power that is greater than desire is rage. Even rage misplaced.\n2920, Vol. 27.\n2920: The Last Year of the First Era\nBy Carlovac Townway\n2 Sun's Dusk, 2920Tel Aruhn, Morrowind\n\"A man to see you, Night Mother,\u201d said the guard. \u201cA Kothringi tribesman who presents his credentials as Lord Zuuk of Black Marsh, part of the Imperial Garrison of Gideon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think I'd have even the slightest possible interest in seeing him?\u201d asked the Night Mother with venomous sweetness.\n\u201cHe brings a letter from the late Empress of the Cyrodilic Empire.\u201d\n\u201cWe are having a busy day,\u201d she smiled, clapping her hands together with delight. \u201cShow him in.\u201d\nZuuk entered the chamber. His metallic skin, though exposed only at his face and hands, caught the light of the fireplace and the lightning of the stormy night from the window. The Night Mother noted also that she could see herself as he saw her: serene, beautiful, fear-inspiring. He handed her his letter from the Empress without a word. Sipping her wine, she read it.\n\u201cThe Duke of Morrowind also offered me an appreciable sum to have the Emperor murdered earlier this year,\u201d she said, folding the letter. \u201cHis payment sunk, and never was delivered. It was a considerable annoyance, particularly as I had already gone to the trouble of putting one of my agents in the palace. Why should I assume that your more-than-generous payment, from a dead woman, will arrive?\u201d\n\u201cI brought it with me,\u201d said Zuuk simply. \u201cIt is in the carriage outside.\u201d\n\u201cThen bring it in and our business is complete,\u201d smiled the Night Mother. \u201cThe Emperor will be dead by year's end. You may leave the gold with Apaladith. Unless you'd care for some wine?\u201d\nZuuk declined the offer and withdrew. The moment he left the room, Miramor slipped noiselessly back from behind the dark tapestry. The Night Mother offered him a glass of wine, and he accepted it.\n\u201cI know that fellow, Zuuk,\u201d said Miramor carefully. \u201cI didn't know he worked for the old Empress though.\u201d\n\u201cLet's talk about you some more, if you don't mind,\u201d she said, knowing he would, in fact, not mind.\n\u201cLet me show you my worth,\u201d said Miramor. \u201cLet me be the one to do the Emperor in. I've already killed his son, and you saw there how well I can hide myself away. Tell me you saw one ripple in the tapestry.\u201d\nThe Night Mother smiled. Things were falling into place rather nicely.\n\u201cIf you know how to use a dagger, you will find him at Bodrum,\u201d she said, and described to him what he must do.\n3 Sun's Dusk, 2920Mournhold, Morrowind\nThe Duke stared out the window. It was early morning, and for the fourth straight day, a red mist hung over the city, flashing lightning. A freakish wind blew through the streets, ripping his flags from the castle battlements, forcing all his people to close their shudders tightly. Something terrible was coming to his land. He was not a greatly learned man, but he knew the signs. So too did his subjects.\n\"When will my messengers reach the Three?\" he growled, turning to his castellan.\n\u201cVivec is far to the north, negotiating the treaty with the Emperor,\u201d the man said, his face and voice trembling with fear. \u201cAlmalexia and Sotha Sil are in Necrom. Perhaps they can be reached in a few days time.\u201d\nThe Duke nodded. He knew his messengers were fast, but so too was the hand of Oblivion."}

Not until the sun burned through her window, infusing the light wood and flesh colors of her chamber in a milky glow did she open her eyes. It was quiet and serene, a stunning reverse of the flavor of her dreams, so full of blood and celebration. For a few moments, she simply stared at the ceiling, trying to sort through her visions.\nIn the courtyard of her palace was a boiling pool which steamed in the coolness of the winter morning. At the wave of her hand, it cleared and she saw the face and form of her lover &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; in his study to the north. She did not want to speak right away: he looked so handsome in his dark red robes, writing his poetry as he did every morning.\n\"Vivec,\" she said, and he raised his head in a smile, looking at her face across thousands of miles. \"I have seen a vision of the end of the war.\"\n\"After eighty years, I don't think anyone can imagine an end,\" said Vivec with a smile, but he grew serious, trusting Almalexia's prophecies. \"Who will win? &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;ic Empire?\"\n\"Without &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, we will lose,\" she replied.\n\"My intelligence tells me the Empire will strike us to the north in early springtide, by &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt; at the latest. Could you go to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; and convince him to return?\"\n\"I'll leave tomorrow,\" she said, simply.\n4 Morning Star, 2920&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; paced around her cell. Wintertide gave her wasteful energy, while in the summer she would merely sit by her window and be grateful for each breath of stale swamp wind that came to cool her. Across the room, her unfinished tapestry of a dance at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Court seemed to mock her. She ripped it from its frame, tearing the pieces apart as they drifted to the floor.\nThen she laughed at her own useless gesture of defiance. She would have plenty of time to repair it and craft a hundred more. The &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; had locked her up in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Giovesse\"&gt;Castle Giovesse&lt;/a&gt; seven years ago, and would likely keep her here until he or she died.\nWith a sigh, she pulled the cord to call her knight, &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared at the door within minutes, fully uniformed as befitted an Imperial Guard. Most of the native &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; tribesmen of Black Marsh preferred to go about naked, but Zuuk had taken a positive delight to fashion. His silver, reflective skin was scarcely visible, only on his face, neck, and hands.\n\"Your Imperial Highness,\" he said with a bow.\n\"Zuuk,\" said Empress Tavia. \"I'm bored. Lets discuss methods of assassinating my husband today.\"\n14 Morning Star, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe chimes proclaiming &lt;a href=\"South%20Wind%27s%20Prayer\"&gt;South Wind's Prayer&lt;/a&gt; echoed through the wide boulevards and gardens of the Imperial City, calling all to their temples. The &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; always attended a service at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, while his son and heir &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; found it more political to attend a service at a different temple for each religious holiday. This year, it was at the cathedral &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Benevolence 's services were mercifully short, but it was not until well after noon that the Emperor was able to return to the palace. By then, the arena combatants were impatiently waiting for the start of the ceremony. The crowd was far less restless, as the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; had arranged for a demonstration from a troupe of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"acrobat\"&gt;acrobat&lt;/a&gt;s.\n\"Your religion is so much more convenient than mine,\" said the Emperor to his Potentate by way of an apology. \"What is the first game?\"\n\"A one-on-one battle between two able warriors,\" said the Potentate, his scaly skin catching the sun as he rose. \"Armed befitting their culture.\"\n\"Sounds good,\" said the Emperor and clapped his hands. \"Let the sport commence!\"\nAs soon as he saw the two warriors enter the arena to the roar of the crowd, Emperor Reman III remembered that he had agreed to this several months before and forgotten about it. One combatant was the Potentate's son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, a glistening ivory-yellow eel, gripping his &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wakizashi\"&gt;wakizashi&lt;/a&gt; with his thin, deceptively weak looking arms. The other was the Emperor's son, Prince Juilek, in &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor\"&gt;Ebony armor&lt;/a&gt; with a savage &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Helmet\"&gt;Orcish helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Longswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;longsword&lt;/a&gt; at his side.\n\"This will be fascinating to watch,\" hissed the Potentate, a wide grin across his narrow face. \"I don't know if I've even seen a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; fight an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; like this. Usually it's army against army. At last we can settle which philosophy is better -- to create armor to combat swords as your people do, or to create swords to combat armor as mine do.\"\nNo one in the crowd, aside from a few scattered Akaviri counselors and the Potentate himself wanted &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; to win, but there was a collective intake of breath at the sight of his graceful movements. His swords seemed to be a part of him, a tail coming from his arms to match the one behind him. It was a trick of counterbalance, allowing the young serpent man to roll up into a circle and spin into the center of the ring in offensive position. The Prince had to plod forward the less impressive traditional way.\nAs they sprang at each other, the crowd bellowed with delight. The Akaviri was like a moon in orbit around the Prince, effortlessly springing over his shoulder to attempt a blow from behind, but the Prince whirled around quickly to block with his shield. His counter-strike met only air as his foe fell flat to the ground and slithered between his legs, tripping him. The Prince fell to the ground with a resounding crash.\nMetal and air melted together as Savirien-Chorak rained strike after strike upon the Prince, who blocked every one with his shield.\n\"We don't have shields in our culture,\" murmured Versidue-Shaie to the Emperor. \"It seems strange to my boy, I imagine. In our country, if you don't want to get hit, you move out of the way.\"\nWhen Savirien-Chorak was rearing back to begin another series of blinding attacks, the Prince kicked at his tail, sending him falling back momentarily. In an instant, he had rebounded, but the Prince was also back on his feet. The two circled one another, until the snake man spun forward, &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; extended. The Prince saw his foe's plan, and blocked the katana with his longsword and the wakizashi with his shield. Its short punching blade impaled itself in the metal, and Savirien-Chorak was thrown off balance.\nThe Prince's longblade slashed across the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;'s chest and the sudden, intense pain caused him to drop both his weapons. In a moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostate in the dust with the Prince's longsword at his throat.\n\"The game's over!\" shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause from the stadium.\nThe Prince grinned and helped Savirien-Chorak up and over to a &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor clapped his Potentate on the back, feeling relieved. He had not realized when the fight had begun how little chance he had given his son at victory.\n\"He will make a fine warrior,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"And a great emperor.\"\n\"Just remember,\" laughed the Emperor. \"You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.\"\n\"Oh, I'll remember that,\" nodded the Potentate.\n&lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; thought about that comment for the rest of the games, and had trouble fully enjoying himself. Could the Potentate be another enemy, just as the Empress had turned out to be? The matter would bear watching.\n21 Morning Star, 2920Mournhold, Morrowind\n\"Why don't you wear that green gown I gave you?\" asked the &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; of Mournhold, watching the young maiden put on her clothes.\n\"It doesn't fit,\" smiled &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt;. \"And you know I like red.\"\n\"It doesn't fit because you're getting fat,\" laughed the Duke, pulling her down on the bed, kissing her breasts and the pouch of her stomach. She laughed at the tickles, but pulled herself up, wrapping her red robe around her.\n\"I'm round like a woman should be,\" said Turala. \"Will I see you tomorrow?\"\n\"No,\" said the Duke. \"I must entertain Vivec tomorrow, and the next day the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; is coming. Do you know, I never really appreciated Almalexia and her political skills until she left?\"\n\"It is the same with me,\" smiled Turala. \"You will only appreciate me when I'm gone.\"\n\"That's not true at all,\" snorted the Duke. \"I appreciate you now.\"\nTurala allowed the Duke one last kiss before she was out the door. She kept thinking about what he said. Would he appreciate her more or less when he knew that she was getting fat because she was carrying his &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;? Would he appreciate her enough to marry her?\nThe Year Continues in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2002%20-%20Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;2920, Sun's Dawn (v2)&lt;/a&gt;"}

He took a moment while nodding his head in approval to admire the day. The whitewashed statue of &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, which the great mage was said to have posed for in ancient days, stood at the precipice of the cliff overlooking the bay. Pale purple &lt;a href=\"proscato%20flowers\"&gt;proscato flowers&lt;/a&gt; waved to and fro in the gentle breeze. Beyond, ocean, and the misty border between Artaeum and the main island of Summurset.\n\"By and large, acceptable,\" he proclaimed as the last student dropped her fruit in his hand. With a wave of his hand, the fruit and flowers were back in the tree. With another wave, the students had formed into position in a semicircle around the sorcerer. He pulled a small fibrous ball, about a foot in diameter from his white robes.\n\"What is this?\"\nThe students understood this test. It asked them to cast a spell of identification on the mysterious object. Each initiate closed his or her eyes and imagined the ball in the realm of the universal Truth. Its energy had a unique resonance as all physical and spiritual matter does, a negative aspect, a duplicate version, relative paths, true meaning, a song in the cosmos, a texture in the fabric of space, a facet of being that has always existed and always will exist.\n\"A ball,\" said a young &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; named Welleg, which brought giggles from some of the younger initiates, but a frown from most, including Sotha Sil.\n\"If you must be stupid, at least be amusing,\" growled the sorcerer, and then looked at a young, dark-haired &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; lass who looked confused. \"&lt;a href=\"Lilatha\"&gt;Lilatha&lt;/a&gt;, do you know?\"\n\"It's &lt;a href=\"grom\"&gt;grom&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Lilatha, uncertainly. \"What the &lt;a href=\"dreugh\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt; meff after they've k-k-kr-.krevinasim\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Karvinasim\"&gt;Karvinasim&lt;/a&gt;, but very good, nonetheless,\" said Sotha Sil. \"Now, tell me, what does that mean?\"\n\"I don't know,\" admitted Lilatha. The rest of the students also shook their heads.\n\"There are layers to understanding all things,\" said Sotha Sil. \"The common man looks at an object and fits it into a place in his way of thinking. Those skilled in the Old Ways, in the way of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, can see an object and identify it by its proper role. But one more layer is needed to be peeled back to achieve understanding. You must identify the object by its role and its truth and interpret that meaning. In this case, this ball is indeed grom, which is a substance created by the dreugh, an underwater race in the north and western parts of the continent. For one year of their life, they undergo karvinasim when they walk upon the land. Following that, they return to the water and meff, or devour the skin and organs they needed for land-dwelling. Then they vomit it up into little balls like this. Grom. Dreugh vomit.\"\nThe students looked at the ball a little queasily. Sotha Sil always loved this lesson.\n4 Sun's Dawn, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Spies,\" muttered the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, sitting in his bath, staring at a lump on his foot. \"All around me, traitors and spies.\"\nHis mistress &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; washed his back, her legs wrapped around his waist. She knew after all these many years when to be sensual and when to be sexual. When he was in a mood like this, it was best to be calmly, soothingly, seductively sensual. And not to say a word unless he asked her a direct question.\nWhich he did: \"What do you think when a fellow steps on his Imperial Majesty's foot and says 'I'm sorry, Your &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Majesty'? Don't you think 'Pardon me, Your Imperial Majesty' is more appropriate? 'I'm sorry,' well that almost sounds like the bastard &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; was sorry I am his Imperial Majesty. That he hopes we lose the war with Morrowind, that's what it sounds like.\"\n\"What would make you feel better?\" asked Rijja. \"Would you like him flogged? He is only, as you say, the Battlechief of &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;. It would teach him to mind where he's stepping.\"\n\"My father would have flogged him. My grandfather would have had him killed,\" the Emperor grumbled. \"But I don't mind if they all step on my feet, provided they respect me. And don't plot against me.\"\n\"You must trust someone.\"\n\"Only you,\" smiled the Emperor, turning slightly to give Rijja a kiss. \"And my son &lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Juilek&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose, though I wish he were a little more cautious.\"\n\"And your council, and the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Rijja.\n\"A pack of spies and a snake,\" laughed the Emperor, kissing his mistress again. As they began to make love, he whispered, \"As long as you're true, I can handle the world.\"\n13 Sun's Dawn, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; stood at the black, bejeweled city gates. A wind howled around her, but she felt nothing.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; had been furious upon hearing his favorite mistress was pregnant and cast her from his sight. She tried again and again to see him, but his guards turned her away. Finally, she returned to her family and told them the truth. If only she had lied and told them she did not know who the father was. A soldier, a wandering adventurer, anyone. But she told them that the father was the Duke, a member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. And they did what she knew they would have to do, as proud members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon her hand was burned the sign of Expulsion her weeping father had branded on her. But the Duke's cruelty hurt her far more. She looked out the gate and into the wide winter plains. Twisted, sleeping trees and skies without birds. No one in Morrowind would take her in now. She must go far away.\nWith slow, sad steps, she began her journey.\n16 Sun's Dawn, 2920&lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, Anequina (modern day &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;)\n\"What troubles you?\" asked Queen &lt;a href=\"Hasaama\"&gt;Hasaama&lt;/a&gt;, noticing her husband's sour mood. At the end of most &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Day\"&gt;Lovers' Days&lt;/a&gt; he was in an excellent mood, dancing in the ballroom with all the guests, but tonight he retired early. When she found him, he was curled in the bed, frowning.\n\"That blasted &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt;'s tale about Polydor and Eloisa put me in a rotten state,\" he growled. \"Why did he have to be so depressing?\"\n\"But isn't that the truth of the tale, my dear? Weren't they doomed because of the cruel nature of the world?\"\n\"It doesn't matter what the truth is, he did a rotten job of telling a rotten tale, and I'm not going to let him do it anymore,\" King &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zel\"&gt;Dro'Zel&lt;/a&gt; sprang from the bed. His eyes were rheumy with tears. \"Where did they say he was from again?\"\n\"I believe &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; in easternmost &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the Queen, shaken. \"My husband, what are you going to do?\"\nDro'Zel was out of the room in a single spring, bounding up the stairs to his tower. If Queen Hasaama knew what her husband was going to do, she did not try to stop him. He had been erratic of late, prone to fits and even occasional seizures.

And so cell one holds the gold key, right?\"\n\"No,\" said the carpenter. \"Let me start from the top.\"\n\"Mama?\" said the little boy, pulling on his mother's sleeve.\n\"Just one moment, dear, mother's talking,\" she said, concentrating on the riddle. \"You said 'cell three holds the golden key if cell two holds worthless brass,' right?\"\n\"No,\" said the carpenter patiently. \"Cell three holds worthless brass, if cell two --\"\n\"Mama!\" cried the boy.

The Emperor receives word of the army's failure.\nContents.\n15 First Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Caer%20Suvio\"&gt;Caer Suvio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nFrom their vantage point high in the hills, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt; could still see the spires of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but he knew he was far away from hearth and home. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Glavius\"&gt;Lord Glavius&lt;/a&gt; had a luxurious villa, but it was not close to being large enough to house the entire army within its walls. Tents lined the hillsides, and the soldiers were flocking to enjoy his lordship's famous hot springs. Little wonder: winter chill still hung in the air.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt;, your son, is not feeling well.\"\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; spoke, the Emperor jumped. How that &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; could slither across the grass without making a sound was a mystery to him.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;ed, I'd wager,\" grumbled Reman. \"See to it he gets a healer. I told him to hire a taster like I have, but the boy's headstrong. There are spies all around us, I know it.\"\n\"I believe you're right, your imperial majesty,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"These are treacherous times, and we must take precautions to see that Morrowind does not win this war, either on the field or by more insidious means. That is why I would suggest that you not lead the vanguard into battle. I know you would want to, as your illustrious ancestors &lt;a href=\"Reman%20I\"&gt;Reman I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brazollus%20Dor\"&gt;Brazollus Dor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; did, but I fear it would be foolhardy. I hope you do not mind me speaking frankly like this.\"\n\"No,\" nodded Reman. \"I think you're right. Who would lead the vanguard then?\"\n\"I would say Prince Juilek, if he were feeling better,\" replied the Akavir. \"Failing that, Storig of &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Naghea\"&gt;Queen Naghea&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Riverhold\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; at left flank, and Warchief &lt;a href=\"Ulaqth\"&gt;Ulaqth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; at right flank.\"\n\"A &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; at left flank and an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; at right,\" frowned the Emperor. \"I never do trust beastfolk.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; took no offense. He knew that \"beastfolk\" referred to the natives of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, not to the Tsaesci of Akavir like himself. \"I quite agree your imperial majesty, but you must agree that they hate the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Ulaqth has a particular grudge after all the slave-raids on his lands by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nThe Emperor conceded it was so, and the Potentate retired. It was surprising, thought Reman, but for the first time, the Potentate seemed trustworthy. He was a good man to have on one's side.\n18 First Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Erfoud\"&gt;Ald Erfoud&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\n\"How far is the Imperial Army?\" asked &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Two days' march,\" replied his lieutenant. \"If we march all night tonight, we can get higher ground at the &lt;a href=\"Pryai%20River\"&gt;Pryai&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow morning. Our intelligence tells us the Emperor will be commanding the rear, Storig of Farrun has the vanguard, Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.\"\n\"Ulaqth,\" whispered Vivec, an idea forming. \"Is this intelligence reliable? Who brought it to us?\"\n\"A &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; spy in the Imperial Army,\" said the lieutenant and gestured towards a young, sandy-haired man who stepped forward and bowed to Vivec.\n\"What is your name and why is a Breton working for us against the Cyrodiils?\" asked Vivec, smiling.\n\"My name is &lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr Whitley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the man. \"And I am working for you because not everyone can say he spied for a god. And I understood it would be, well, profitable.\"\nVivec laughed, \"It will be, if your information is accurate.\"\n19 First Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nThe quiet hamlet of Bodrum looked down on the meandering river, the Pryai. It was an idyllic site, lightly wooded where the water took the bend around a steep bluff to the east with a gorgeous wildflower meadow to the west. The strange flora of Morrowind met the strange flora of Cyrodiil on the border and commingled gloriously.\n\"There will be time to sleep when you've finished!\"\nThe soldiers had been hearing that all morning. It was not enough that they had been marching all night, now they were chopping down trees on the bluff and damming the river so its waters spilled over. Most of them had reached the point where they were too tired to complain about being tired.\n\"Let me be certain I understand, my lord,\" said Vivec's lieutenant. \"We take the bluff so we can fire arrows and spells down on them from above. That's why we need all the trees cleared out. Damming the river floods the plain below so they'll be trudging through mud, which should hamper their movement.\"\n\"That's exactly half of it,\" said Vivec approvingly. He grabbed a nearby soldier who was hauling off the trees. \"Wait, I need you to break off the straightest, strongest branches of the trees and whittle them into spears. If you recruit a hundred or so others, it won't take you more than a few hours to make all we need.\"\nThe soldier wearily did as he was bade. The men and women got to work, fashioning spears from the trees.\n\"If you don't mind me asking,\" said the lieutenant. \"The soldiers don't need any more weapons. They're too tired to hold the ones they've got.\"\n\"These spears aren't for holding,\" said Vivec and whispered, \"If we tired them out today, they'll get a good night's sleep tonight\" before he got to work supervising their work.\nIt was essential that they be sharp, of course, but equally important that they be well balanced and tapered proportionally. The perfect point for stability was a pyramid, not the conical point of some lances and spears. He had the men hurl the spears they had completed to test their strength, sharpness, and balance, forcing them to begin on a new one if they broke. Gradually, out of sheer exhaustion from doing it wrong, the men learned how to create the perfect wooden spears. Once they were through, he showed them how they were to be arranged and where.\nThat night, there was no drunken pre-battle carousing, and no nervous neophytes stayed up worrying about the battle to come. As soon as the sun sank beneath the wooded hills, the camp was at rest, but for the sentries.\n20 First Seed, 2920Bodrum, Morrowind\n&lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt; was exhausted. For last six days, he had gambled and whored all night and then marched all day. He was looking forward to the battle, but even more than that, he was looking forward to some rest afterwards. He was in the Emperor's command at the rear flank, which was good because it seemed unlikely that he would be killed. On the other hand, it meant traveling over the mud and waste the army ahead left in their wake.\nAs they began the trek through the wildflower field, Miramor and all the soldiers around him sank ankle-deep in cold mud. It was an effort to even keep moving. Far, far up ahead, he could see the vanguard of the army led by Lord Storig emerging from the meadow at the base of a bluff.\nThat was when it all happened.\nAn army of Dunmer appeared above the bluff like rising &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, pouring fire and floods of arrows down on the vanguard. Simultaneously, a company of men bearing the flag of the Duke of Mournhold galloped around the shore, disappearing along the shallow river's edge where it dipped to a timbered glen to the east. Warchief Ulaqth nearby on the right flank let out a bellow of revenge at the sight and gave chase. Queen Naghea sent her flank towards the embankment to the west to intercept the army on the bluff.\nThe Emperor could think of nothing to do. His troops were too bogged down to move forward quickly and join the battle. He ordered them to face east towards the timber, in case Mournhold's company was trying to circle around through the woods. They never came out, but many men, facing west, missed the battle entirely. Miramor kept his eyes on the bluff.\nA tall Dunmer he supposed must have been Vivec gave a signal, and the battlemages cast their spells at something to the west. From what transpired, Miramor deduced it was a dam. A great torrent of water spilled out, washing Naghea's left flank into the remains of the vanguard and the two together down river to the east.\nThe Emperor paused, as if waiting for his vanquished army to return, and then called a retreat. Miramor hid in the rushes until they had passed by and then waded as quietly as he could to the bluff.\nThe Morrowind army was retiring as well back to their camp. He could hear them celebrating above him as he padded along the shore. To the east, he saw the Imperial Army. They had been washed into a net of spears strung across the river, Naghea's left flank on Storig's vanguard on Ulaqth's right flank, bodies of hundreds of soldiers strung together like beads.\nMiramor took whatever valuables he could carry from the corpses and then ran down the river. He had to go many miles before the water was clear again, unpolluted by blood.\n29 First Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;\n\"You have a letter from the Imperial City,\" said the chief priestess, handing the parchment to &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;. All the young priestesses smiled and made faces of astonishment, but the truth was that Corda's sister &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; wrote very often, at least once a month.\nCorda took the letter to the garden to read it, her favorite place, an oasis in the monochromatic sand-colored world of the conservatorium The letter itself was nothing unusual: filled with court gossip, the latest fashions which were tending to winedark velvets, and reports of the Emperor's ever-growing paranoia.\n\"You are so lucky to be away from all of this,\" wrote Rijja. \"The Emperor is convinced that his latest battlefield fiasco is all a result of spies in the palace. He has even taken to questioning me. Ruptga keep it so you never have a life as interesting as mine.\"\nCorda listened to the sounds of the desert and prayed to &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; the exact opposite wish.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2004%20-%20Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;."}

All around him, nasty gelatinous creatures scurried into the reeds, bursts of white fire lit up the upper arches of the hall before disappearing, and smells assaulted him, rancid death one moment, sweet flowered perfume the next. Several times he had visited the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; princes in their &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, but every time, something different awaited him.\nHe knew his purpose, and refused to be distracted.\nEight of the more prominent &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20princes\"&gt;Daedra princes&lt;/a&gt; were awaiting him in the half-melted, domed room. &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Dusk and Dawn; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Plots; &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, Daedra of Knowledge; &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the Hunter; &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, God of Curses; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Disaster; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Rage; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the Mad One.\nAbove them, the sky cast tormented shadows upon the meeting.\n5 Rain's Hand, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset&lt;/a&gt;\nSotha Sil's voice cried out, echoing from the cave, \"Move the rock!\"\nImmediately, the initiates obeyed, rolling aside the great boulder that blocked the entrance to &lt;a href=\"the%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;the Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Sotha Sil emerged, his face smeared with ash, weary. He felt he had been away for months, years, but only a few days had transpired. &lt;a href=\"Lilatha\"&gt;Lilatha&lt;/a&gt; took his arm to help him walk, but he refused her help with a kind smile and a shake of his head.\n\"Were you ... successful?\" she asked.\n\"The Daedra princes I spoke with have agreed to our terms,\" he said flatly. \"Disasters such as befell &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; should be averted.

My exiled mother fears that my father will imagine me of being a traitor, covetous of the crown, and is having me &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;poisoned&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Prince sank back into his pillow, annoyed. \"The Emperor has insisted on me having a taster for all my meals as he does.\"\n\"There are many plots,\" agreed the Akavir. \"You have been abed for nearly three weeks with every healer in the empire shuffling through like a slow ballroom dance. At least, all can see that you're getting stronger.\"\n\"Strong enough to lead the vanguard against Morrowind soon, I hope,\" said Juilek.\n11 Rain's Hand, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset&lt;/a&gt;\nThe initiates stood quietly in a row along the arbor loggia, watching the long, deep, marble-lined trench ahead of them flash with fire. The air above it vibrated with the waves of heat. Though each student kept his or her face sturdy and emotionless, as a true Psijic should, their terror was nearly as palpable as the heat. Sotha Sil closed his eyes and uttered the charm of fire resistance. Slowly, he walked across the basin of leaping flames, climbing to the other side, unscathed. Not even his white robe had been burned.\n\"The charm is intensified by the energy you bring to it, by your own skills, just as all spells are,\" he said. \"Your imagination and your willpower are the keys. There is no need for a spell to give you a resistance to air, or a resistance to flowers, and after you cast the charm, you must forget there is even a need for a spell to give you resistance to fire. Do not confuse what I am saying: resistance is not about ignoring the fire's reality. You will feel the substance of flame, the texture of it, its hunger, and even the heat of it, but you will know that it will not hurt or injure you.\"\nThe students nodded and one by one, they cast the spell and made the walk through the fire. Some even went so far as to bend over and scoop up a handful of fire and feed it air, so it expanded like a bubble and melted through their fingers. Sotha Sil smiled. They were fighting their fear admirably.\nThe Chief Proctor &lt;a href=\"Thargallith\"&gt;Thargallith&lt;/a&gt; came running from the arbor arches, \"Sotha Sil! &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Artaeum. Iachesis told me to fetch you.\"\nSotha Sil turned to Thargallith for only a moment, but he knew instantly from the screams what had transpired. The Nord lad Wellig had not cast the spell properly and was burning. The smell of scorched hair and flesh panicked the other students who were struggling to get out of the basin, pulling him with them, but the incline was too steep away from the entry points. With a wave of his hand, Sotha Sil extinguished the flame.\nWellig and several other students were burned, but not badly. The sorcerer cast a healing spell on them, before turning back to Thargallith.\n\"I'll be with you in a moment, and give Almalexia the time to shake the road dust from her train,\" Sotha Sil turned back to the students, his voice flat. \"Fear does not break spells, but doubt and incompetence are the great enemies of any spellcaster. Master Welleg, you will pack your bags. I'll arrange for a boat to bring you to the mainland tomorrow morning.\"\nThe sorcerer found Almalexia and Iachesis in the study, drinking hot tea, and laughing. She was more beautiful than he had remembered, though he had never before seen her so disheveled, wrapped in a blanket, dangling her damp long black tresses before the fire to dry. At Sotha Sil's approach, she leapt to her feet and embraced him.\n\"Did you swim all the way from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;?\" he smiled.\n\"It's pouring rain from &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; down to the coast,\" she explained, returning his smile.\n\"Only a half a league away, and it never rains here,\" said Iachesis proudly. \"Of course, I sometimes miss the excitement of Summurset, and sometimes even the mainland itself. Still, I'm always very impressed by anyone out there who gets anything accomplished. It is a world of distractions. Speaking of distractions, what's all this I hear about a war?\"\n\"You mean the one that's been bloodying the continent for the last eighty years, Master?\" asked Sotha Sil, amused.\n\"I suppose that's the one I mean,\" said Iachesis with a shrug of his shoulders. \"How is that war going?\"\n\"We will lose it, unless I can convince Sotha Sil to leave Artaeum,\" said Almalexia, losing her smile. She had meant to wait and talk to her friend in private, but the old Altmer gave her courage to press on. \"I have had visions; I know it to be true.\"\nSotha Sil was silent for a moment, and then looked at Iachesis, \"I must return to Morrowind.\"\n\"Knowing you, if you must do something, you will,\" sighed the old Master. \"The Psijics' way is not to be distracted. Wars are fought, Empires rise and fall. You must go, and so must we.\"\n\"What do you mean, Iachesis? You're leaving the island?\"\n\"No, the island will be leaving the sea,\" said Iachesis, his voice taking on a dreamy quality. \"In a few years, the mists will move over Artaeum and we will be gone. We are counselors by nature, and there are too many counselors in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; as it is. No, we will go, and return when the land needs us again, perhaps in another age.\"\nThe old &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; struggles to his feet, and drained the last sip of his drink before leaving Sotha Sil and Almalexia alone: \"Don't miss the last boat.\"\nThe Year Continues in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2005%20-%20Second%20Seed\"&gt;2920, vol 05 - Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;"}

Instantly all sound outside the room was extinguished, echoing footsteps in the marble halls and birds in the springtide gardens.\n\"I've discovered that a notorious poisoner, an &lt;a href=\"Orma\"&gt;Orma&lt;/a&gt; tribeswoman from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Catchica\"&gt;Catchica&lt;/a&gt;, was with the army at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Suvio\"&gt;Caer Suvio&lt;/a&gt; while we were encamped there when my son was poisoned, before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle at Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure she would have preferred to kill me, but the opportunity didn't present itself,\" The Emperor fumed. \"The Council suggests that we need evidence of her involvement before we prosecute.\"\n\"Of course they would,\" said the Potentate thoughtfully. \"Particularly if one or more of them was in on the plot. I have a thought, your imperial majesty.\"\n\"Yes?\" said Reman impatiently. \"Out with it!\"\n\"Tell the Council you're dropping the matter, and I will send out the Guard to track this Catchica down and follow her. We will see who her friends are, and perhaps get an idea of the scope of this plot on your imperial majesty's life.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Reman with a satisfied frown. \"That's a capital plan. We will track this scheme to whomever it leads to.\"\n\"Decidedly, your imperial majesty,\" smiled the Potentate, parting the curtain so the Emperor could leave. In the hallway outside was Potentate Versidue-Shaie's son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;. The boy bowed to the Emperor before entering the Potentate's chamber.\n\"Are you in trouble, father?\" whispered the Akaviri lad. \"I heard the Emperor found out about whatshername, the poisoner.\"\n\"The great art of &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, my boy,\" said Versidue-Shaie to his son. \"Is to tell them what they want to hear in a way that gets them to do what you want them to do. I need you to get a letter to Catchica, and make certain that she understands that if she does not follow the instructions perfectly, she is risking her own life more than ours.\"\n13 Second Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup\"&gt;Mir Corrup&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nRijja sank luxuriantly into the burbling hot spring, feeling her skin tingle like it was being rubbed by millions of little stones. The rock shelf over her head sheltered her from the misting rain, but let all the sunshine in, streaming in layers through the branches of the trees. It was an idyllic moment in an idyllic life, and when she was finished she knew that her beauty would be entirely restored. The only thing she needed was a drink of water. The bath itself, while wonderfully fragrant, tasted always of chalk.\n\"Water!\" she cried to her servants. \"Water, please!\"\nA gaunt woman with rags tied over her eyes ran to her side and dropped a goatskin of water. Rijja was about to laugh at the woman's prudery\u2014she herself was not ashamed of her naked body\u2014but then she noticed through a crease in the rags that the old woman had no eyes at all. She was like one of those Orma tribesmen Rijja had heard about, but never met. Born without eyes, they were masters of their other senses. The Lord of Mir Corrup hired very exotic servants, she thought to herself.\nIn a moment, the woman was gone and forgotten. Rijja found it very hard to concentrate on anything but the sun and the water. She opened the cork, but the liquid within had a strange, metallic smell to it. Suddenly, she was aware that she was not alone.\n\"Lady Rijja,\" said the captain of the Imperial Guard. \"You are, I see, acquainted with Catchica?\"\n\"I've never heard of her,\" stammered Rijja before becoming indignant. \"What are you doing here? This body is not for your leering eyes.\"\n\"Never heard of her, when we saw her with you not a minute ago,\" said the captain, picking up the goatskin and smelling it. \"Brought you &lt;a href=\"neivous%20ichor\"&gt;neivous ichor&lt;/a&gt;, did she? To &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; the Emperor with?\"\n\"Captain,\" said one of the guards, running up to him quickly. \"We cannot find the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;. It is as if she disappeared into the woods.\"\n\"Yes, they're good at that,\" said the captain. \"No matter though. We've got her contact at court. That should please his Imperial Majesty. Seize her.\"\nAs the guards pulled the writhing naked woman from the pool, she screamed, \"I'm innocent! I don't know what this is all about, but I've done nothing! The Emperor will have your heads for this!\"\n\"Yes, I imagine he will,\" smiled the captain. \"If he trusts you.\"\n21 Second Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, Black Marsh\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Sow%20and%20Vulture\"&gt;The Sow and Vulture&lt;/a&gt; tavern was the sort of out-of-the-way place that &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; favored for these sorts of interviews. Besides himself and his companion, there were only a couple of old seadogs in the shadowy room, and they were more unconscious from drink than aware. The grime of the unwashed floor was something you felt rather than saw. Copious dust hung in the air unmoving in the sparse rays of dying sunlight.\n\"You have experience in heavy combat?\" asked Zuuk. \"The reward is good for this assignment, but the risks are great as well.\"\n\"Certainly I have combat experience,\" replied &lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt; haughtily. \"I was at the Battle of Bodrum just two months ago. If you do your part and get the Emperor to ride through &lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dozsa Pass&lt;/a&gt; with a minimal escort on the day and the time we've discussed, I'll do my part. Just be certain that he's not traveling in disguise. I'm not going to slaughter every caravan that passes through in the hopes that it contains Emperor Reman.\"\nZuuk smiled, and Miramor looked at himself in the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;'s reflective face. He liked the way he looked: the consummate confident professional.\n\"Agreed,\" said Zuuk. \"And then you shall have the rest of your &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nZuuk placed the large chest onto the table between them. He stood up.\n\"Wait a few minutes before leaving,\" said Zuuk. \"I don't want you following me. Your employers wish to maintain their anonymity, if by chance you are caught and tortured.\"\n\"Fine by me,\" said Miramor, ordering more grog.\nZuuk rode his mount through the cramped labyrinthine streets of Gideon, and both he and his horse were happy to pass through the gates into the country. The main road to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Giovesse\"&gt;Castle Giovese&lt;/a&gt; was flooded as it was every year in springtide, but Zuuk knew a shorter way over the hills. Riding fast under trees drooping with moss and treacherous slime-coated rocks, he arrived at the castle gates in two hours' time. He wasted no time in climbing to &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Tavia&lt;/a&gt;'s cell at the top of the highest tower.\n\"What did you think of him?\" asked the Empress.\n\"He's a fool,\" replied Zuuk. \"But that's what we want for this sort of assignment.\"\n30 Second Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nRijja screamed and screamed and screamed. Within her cell, her only audience was the giant gray stones, crusted with moss but still sturdy. The guards outside were deaf to her as they were deaf to all prisoners. The Emperor, miles away in the Imperial City, had likewise been deaf to her cries of innocence.\nShe screamed knowing well that no one would likely hear her ever again.\n31 Second Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Kavas%20Rim%20Pass\"&gt;Kavas Rim Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nIt had been days, weeks since &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; had seen another human face, Cyrodiil or &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. As she trod the road, she thought to herself how strange it was that such an uninhabited place as Cyrodiil had become the Imperial Province, seat of an Empire. Even the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; must have more populated forests than this &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt; wood.\nShe thought back. Was it a month ago, two, when she crossed the border from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; into Cyrodiil? It had been much colder then, but other than that, she had no sense of time. The guards had been brusque, but as she was carrying no weaponry, they elected to let her through. Since then, she had seen a few caravans, even shared a meal with some adventurers camping for the night, but met no one who would give her a ride to a town.\nTurala stripped off her shawl and dragged it behind her. For a moment, she thought she heard someone behind her and spun around. No one was there. Just a bird perched on a branch making a sound like laughter.\nShe walked on, and then stopped. Something was happening. The child had been kicking in her belly for some time now, but this was a different kind of spasm. With a groan, she lurched over to the side of the path, collapsing into the grass. Her child was coming.\nShe lay on her back and pushed, but she could barely see with her tears of pain and frustration. How had it come to this? Giving birth in the wilderness, all by herself, to a child whose father was the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;? Her scream of rage and agony shook the birds from the trees\nThe bird that had been laughing at her earlier flew down to the road. She blinked, and the bird was gone and in its place, a naked Elf man stood, not as dark as a Dunmer, but not as pale as the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. She knew at once it was an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;, a Wild Elf. Turala screamed, but the man held her down. After a few minutes of struggle, she felt a release, and then fainted away.\nWhen she awoke, it was to the sound of a baby crying. The child had been cleaned and was lying by her side. Turala picked up her baby girl, and for the first time that year, felt tears of happiness stream down her face.\nShe whispered to the trees, \"Thank you\" and began walking with babe in her arms down the road to the west.\nThe Year is continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20Mid%20Year%20%28v6%29\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;"}

Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt; were strategically important fortresses. He had been expecting a move against them for some time. His captain pulled down a map of southwestern Morrowind from the wall and smoothed it out, fighting a gentle summer sea breeze wafting in from the open window.\n\"They were heavily armored, you say?\" asked the captain.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Cassyr. \"They were camped out near &lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;, and I saw nothing but &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;, fine weaponry, and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Weapons\"&gt;siege equipment&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"How about spellcasters and boats?\" asked Vivec.\n\"A horde of battlemages,\" replied Cassyr. \"But no boats.\"\n\"As heavily armored as they are, it will take them at least two weeks, like you said, to get from Bethal Gray to Lake Coronati,\" Vivec studied the map carefully. \"They'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval. Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south.\"\n\"They'll be vulnerable along the straits,\" said the captain. \"Provided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the Heartland.\"\n\"Your intelligence has once again served us well,\" said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. \"We will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again.\"\n3 Mid Year, 2920&lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Will you be returning back this way after your victory?\" asked Lord Bethal.\n&lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; barely paid the man any attention. He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds. All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.\n\"If we return shortly, it will be because of defeat,\" said the Prince. He could see down in the meadow, the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores. An army was an expensive thing, for certes.\n\"My Prince,\" said &lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Lord Bethal&lt;/a&gt; with concern. \"Is your army beginning a march due east? That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati. You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits.\"\n\"You just make certain your merchants get their share of our &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; ,\" said the Prince with a grin. \"Let me worry about my army's direction.\"\n16 Mid Year, 2920&lt;a href=\"Lake%20Coronati\"&gt;Lake Coronati&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters. What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection. They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest. Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor could not move invisibly, silently.\n\"Let me see the map again,\" he called to his captain. \"Is there no other way they could approach?\"\n\"We have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and be bogged under,\" said the captain. \"We would at least hear about it. But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits.\"\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him. Then he looked back on the map.\n\"Spy,\" said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. \"When you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?\"\n\"They were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them,\" explained Cassyr. \"I figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army? They couldn't have all been healers.\"\n\"You fool!\" roared Vivec. \"They're mystics schooled in the art of &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;. They've cast a spell of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt; on the entire army.\"\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north. Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, they could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak. Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.\n\"Return to &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. \"Your services are no longer needed nor wanted.\"\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak. It had been taken by the Imperial Army.\n19 Mid Year, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nThe &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the Imperial City amid great fanfare, the streets lined with men and women cheering him as the symbol of the taking of Ald Marak. Truth be told, a greater number would have turned out had the Prince returned, and the &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; knew it. Still, it pleased him to no end. Never before had citizens of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; cheered the arrival of an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; into their land.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; greeted him with a warm embrace, and then tore into the letter he had brought from the Prince.\n\"I don't understand,\" he said at last, still joyous but equally confused. \"You went under the lake?\"\n\"Ald Marak is a very well-fortified fortress,\" explained the Potentate. \"As, I might add, the army of Morrowind has rediscovered, now that they are on the outside. To take it, we had to attack by surprise and with our soldiery in the sturdiest of armor. By casting the spell that allowed us to breathe underwater, we were able to travel faster than Vivec would have guessed, the weight of the armor made less by the aquatic surroundings, and attack from the waterbound west side of the fortress where their defenses were at their weakest.\"\n\"Brilliant!\" the Emperor crowed. \"You are a wonderous tactician, Versidue-Shaie! If your fathers had been as good at this as you are, Tamriel would be Akaviri domain!\"\nThe Potentate had not planned to take credit for Prince Juilek's design, but on the Emperor's reference to his people's fiasco of an invasion two hundred and sixteen years ago, he made up his mind. He smiled modestly and soaked up the praise.\n21 Mid Year, 2920Ald Marak, Morrowind\n&lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; slithered to the wall and watched through the arrow slit the Morrowind army retreating back to the forestland between the swamps and the castle grounds. It seemed like the idea [sic] opportunity to strike. Perhaps the forests could be burned and the army within them. Perhaps with Vivec in their enemies' hands, the army would allow them possession of Ald Iuval as well. He suggested these ideas to the Prince.\n\"What you seem to be forgetting,\" laughed Prince Juilek. \"Is that I gave my word that no harm to the army or to their commanders during the truce negotiations. Do you not have honor during warfare on &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"My Prince, I was born here in Tamriel, I have never been to my people's home,\" replied the snake man. \"But even so, your ways are strange to me. You expected no quarter and I gave you none when we fought in the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Imperial Arena&lt;/a&gt; five months ago.\"\n\"That was a game,\" replied the Prince, before nodding to his steward to let the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; battle chief in.\nJuilek had never seen Vivec before, but he had heard he was a living god. What came before him was but a man. A powerfully built man, handsome, with an intelligent face, but a man nonetheless. The Prince was pleased: a man he could speak with, but not a god.\n\"Greetings, my worthy adversary,\" said Vivec. \"We seem to be at an impasse.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" said the Prince. \"You don't want to give us Morrowind, and I can't fault you for that. But I must have your coastline to protect the Empire from overseas aggressions, and certain key strategic border castles, such as this one, as well as &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Umbeil\"&gt;Ald Umbeil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mothrivra\"&gt;Tel Mothrivra&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"And in return?\" asked Vivec.\n\"In return?\" laughed Savirien-Chorak. \"You forget we are the victors here, not you.\"\n\"In return,\" said Prince Juilek\u00a0carefully. \"There will be no Imperial attacks on Morrowind, unless in return to an attack by you. You will be protected from invaders by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial navy&lt;/a&gt;. And your land may expand by taking certain estates in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, whichever you choose, provided they are not needed by the Empire.\"\n\"A reasonable offer,\" said Vivec after a pause. \"You must forgive me, I am unused to Cyrodiils who offer something in return for what they take. May I have a few days to decide?\"\n\"We will meet again in a week's time,\" said the Prince, smiling. \"In the meantime, if your army provokes no attacks on mine, we are at peace.\"\nVivec left the Prince's chamber, feeling that &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; was right. The war was at an end. This Prince would make an excellent Emperor.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2007%20-%20Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;"}

Studded with statuary and fountains, the north gardens fit the Emperor's mood, as well as being the coolest acreage in the City during the heat of summertide. Austere, tiered flowerbeds of blue-gray and green towered all around them as they walked.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; agreed to the Prince's terms for peace,\" said Reman. \"My son will be returning in two weeks' time.\"\n\"This is excellent news,\" said the Potentate carefully. \"I hope the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; will honor the terms. We might have asked for more. The fortress at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;, for example. But I suppose the Prince knows what is reasonable. He would not cripple the Empire just for peace.\"\n\"I have been thinking lately of &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; and what caused her to plot against my life,\" said the Emperor, pausing to admire a statue of the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Queen%20Alessia\"&gt;Slave Queen Alessia&lt;/a&gt; before continuing. \"The only thing I can think of to account for it is that she admired my son too much. She may have loved me for my power and my personality, but he, after all, is young and handsome and will one day inherit my throne. She must have thought that if I were dead, she could have an Emperor who had both youth and power.\"\n\"The Prince ... was in on this plot?\" asked Versidue-Shaie. It was a difficult game to play, anticipating where the Emperor's paranoia would strike next.\n\"Oh, I don't think so,\" said Reman, smiling. \"No, my son loves me well.\"\n\"Are you aware that &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, Rijja's sister in [sic] an initiate of the &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; conservatorium in &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked the Potentate.\n\"Morwha?\" asked the Emperor. \"I've forgotten: which god is that?\"\n\"Lusty fertility goddess of the Yokudans,\" replied the Potentate. \"But not too lusty, like &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. Demure, but certainly sexual.\"\n\"I am through with lusty women. The Empress, Rijja, all too lusty, a lust for love leads to a lust for power,\" the Emperor shrugged his shoulders. \"But a priestess-in-training with a certain healthy appetite sounds ideal. Now what were you saying about the Black Gate?\"\n6 Sun's Height, 2920&lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nRijja stood quietly looking at the cold stone floor while the Emperor spoke. He had never before seen her so pale and joyless. She might at least be pleased that she was being freed, being returned to her homeland. Why, if she left now, she could be in Hammerfell by the &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20Festival\"&gt;Merchant's Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing he said seemed to register any reaction from her. A month and a half's stay in Thurzo Fortress seemed to have killed her spirit.\n\"I was thinking,\" said the Emperor at last. \"Of having your younger sister Corda up to the palace for a time. I think she would prefer it over the conservatorium in Hegathe, don't you?\"\nReaction, at last. Rijja looked at the Emperor with animal hatred, flinging herself at him in a rage. Her fingernails had grown long since her imprisonment and she raked them across his face, into his eyes. He howled with pain, and his guards pulled her off, pummeling her with blows from the back of their swords, until she was knocked unconscious.\nA healer was called at once, but the Emperor Reman III had lost his right eye.\n23 Sun's Height, 2920&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nVivec pulled himself from the water, feeling the heat of the day washed from his skin, taking a towel from one of his servants. &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; watched his old friend from the balcony.\n\"It looks like you've picked up a few more scars since I last saw you,\" said the sorcerer.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; grant it that I have no more for a while,\" laughed Vivec. \"When did you arrive?\"\n\"A little over an hour ago,\" said Sotha Sil, walking down the stairs to the water's edge. \"I thought I was coming to end a war, but it seems you've done it without me.\"\n\"Yes, eighty years is long enough for ceaseless battle,\" replied Vivec, embracing Sotha Sil. \"We made concessions, but so did they. When the old Emperor is dead, we may be entering a golden age. Prince Juilek is very wise for his age. Where is &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Collecting the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. They should be here tomorrow afternoon.\"\nThe men were distracted at a sight from around the corner of the palace - a rider was approaching through the town, heading for the front steps. It was evident that the woman had been riding hard for some time. They met her in the study, where she burst in, breathing hard.\n\"We have been betrayed,\" she gasped. \"The Imperial Army has seized the Black Gate.\"\n24 Sun's Height, 2920Balmora, Morrowind\nIt was the first time in seventeen years that the three members of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Morrowind Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had met in the same place, since Sotha Sil had left for &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. All three wished that the circumstances of their reunion were different.\n\"From what we've learned, while the Prince was returning to Cyrodiil to the south, a second Imperial Army came down from the north,\" said Vivec to his stony-faced compatriots. \"It is reasonable to assume Juilek didn't know about the attack.\"\n\"But neither would it be unreasonable to suppose that he planned on being a distraction while the Emperor launched the attack on Black Gate,\" said Sotha Sil. \"This must be considered a break of the truce.\"\n\"Where is the Duke of Mournhold?\" asked Vivec. \"I would hear his thoughts on the matter.\"\n\"He is meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Almalexia, quietly. \"I told him to wait until he had spoken with you, but he said that the matter had waited long enough.\"\n\"He would involve the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;? In outside affairs?\" Vivec shook his head, and looked to Sotha Sil: \"Please, do what you can. Assassination will only move us backwards. This matter must be settled with diplomacy or battle.\"\n25 Sun's Height, 2920Tel Aruhn, Morrowind\nThe Night Mother met Sotha Sil in her salon, lit only by the moon. She was cruelly beautiful dressed in a simple silk black robe, lounging across her divan. With a gesture, she dismissed her red-cloaked guards and offered the sorcerer some wine.\n\"You've only just missed your friend, the Duke,\" she whispered. \"He was very unhappy, but I think we will solve his problem for him.\"\n\"Did he hire the Morag Tong to assassinate the Emperor?\" asked Sotha Sil.\n\"You are straight-forward, aren't you? That's good. I love plain-speaking men: it saves so much time. Of course, I cannot discuss with you what the Duke and I talked about,\" she smiled. \"It would be bad for business.\"\n\"What if I were to offer you an equal amount of gold for you not to assassinate the Emperor?\"\n\"The Morag Tong murders for the glory of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and for profit,\" she said, speaking into her glass of wine. \"We do not merely kill. That would be sacrilege. Once the Duke's gold has arrived in three days time, we will do our end of the business. And I'm afraid we would not dream of entertaining a counter offer. Though we are a business as well as a religious order, we do not bow to supply and demand, Sotha Sil.\"\n27 Sun's Height, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nSotha Sil had been watching the waters for two days now, waiting for a particular vessel, and now he saw it. A heavy ship with the flag of Mournhold. The sorcerer took the air and intercepted it before it reached harbor. A caul of flame erupted over his figure, disguising his voice and form into that of a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Abandon your ship!\" he bellowed. \"If you would not sink with it!\"\nIn truth, Sotha Sil could have exploded the vessel with but a single ball of fire, but he chose to take his time, to give the crew a chance to dive off into the warm water. When he was certain there was no one living aboard, he focused his energy into a destructive wave that shook the air and water as it discharged. The ship and the Duke's payment to the Morag Tong sunk to the bottom of the Inner Sea.\n\"Night Mother,\" thought Sotha Sil, as he floated towards shore to alert the harbormaster that some sailors were in need of rescue. \"Everyone bows to supply and demand.\"\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2008%20-%20Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;."}

Tiny embers flew into the sky, hanging for a few moments before vanishing.\n\"I was rash,\" agreed the Duke, soberly. \"But &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; had his laugh, and all is well. The &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; will not assassinate the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; now that my payment to them is at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;.

It is certainly typical of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to assume that their concessions are negotiable, while ours are not,\" Vivec pulled out a map. \"We can meet them here, in this village to the north-west of Ald Lambasi, Fervinthil.\"\n\"But will we meet them to talk,\" ask &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. \"Or to make war?\"\nNo one had an answer to that.\n15 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Fervinthil\"&gt;Fervinthil&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nA late summer squall blew through the small village, darkening the sky except for flashing of lightning which leapt from cloud to cloud like acrobats. Water rushed down the narrow streets ankle-deep, and the Prince had to shout to be heard by his captains but a few feet away from him.\n\"There's an inn up ahead! We'll wait there for the storm to pass before pressing on to Ald Lambasi!\"\nThe inn was warm and dry, and bustling with business. Barmaids were rushing back and forth, bringing &lt;a href=\"greef\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt; and wine to a back room, evidently excited about a famous visitor. Someone who was attracting more attention than the mere heir to the Empire of Tamriel. Amused, Juilek watched them run until he overheard the name of \"&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"My Lord Vivec,\" he said, bursting into the back room. \"You must believe me, I knew nothing about the attack on &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; until after it happened. We will, of course, be returning it to your care forthwith. I wrote you a letter to that effect at your palace in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, but obviously you're not there,\" he paused, taking in the many new faces in the room. \"I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Juilek Cyrodiil.\"\n\"My name is Almalexia,\" said the most beautiful woman the Prince had ever seen. \"Won't you join us?\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" said a serious-looking Dunmer in a white cloak, shaking the Prince's hand and showing him to a seat.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Indoril Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;, Duke-Prince of Mournhold,\" said the massively-built man next to him as he sat down.\n\"I recognize that the events of the last month suggest, at best, that the Imperial Army is not under my control,\" said the Prince after ordering some wine. \"This is true. The army is my father's.\"\n\"I understood that the Emperor was going to be coming to Ald Lambasi as well,\" said Almalexia.\n\"Officially, he is,\" said the Prince cautiously. \"Unofficially, he's still back in the Imperial City. He's met with an unfortunate accident.\"\nVivec glanced the Duke quickly before looking at the Prince: \"An accident?\"\n\"He's fine,\" said the Prince quickly. \"He'll live, but it looks like he'll lose an eye. It was an altercation that has nothing to do with the war. The only good news is that while he recovers, I have the use of his seal. Any agreement we make here and now will be binding to the Empire, both in my father's reign and in mine.\"\n\"Then let's start agreeing,\" smiled Almalexia.\n16 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Wroth%20Naga\"&gt;Wroth Naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe tiny hamlet of Wroth Naga greeted &lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; with its colorful houses perched on a promontory overlooking the stretch of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian mountain&lt;/a&gt; plain and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; beyond. Had he been in a better mood, the sight would have been breathtaking. As it was, he could only think that in practical terms, a small village like this would have meager provisions for himself and his horse.\nHe rode down into the main square, where an inn called the &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Cry\"&gt;Eagle's Cry&lt;/a&gt; stood. Directing the stable boy to house and feed his horse, Cassyr walked into the inn and was surprised by its ambience. A minstrel he had heard play once in &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; was performing a jaunty old tune to the clapping of the mountain men. Such forced merriment was not what Cassyr wanted at that moment. A glum Dunmer woman was seated at the only table far from the noise, so he took his drink there and sat down without invitation. It was only when he did so that he noticed that she was holding a newborn baby.\n\"I've just come from Morrowind,\" he said rather awkwardly, lowering his voice. \"I've been fighting for Vivec and the Duke of Mournhold against the Imperial army. A traitor to my people, I guess you'd call me.\"\n\"I am also a traitor to my people,\" said the woman, holding up her hand which was scarred with a branded symbol. \"It means that I can never go back to my homeland.\"\n\"Well, you're not thinking of staying here, are you?\" laughed Cassyr. \"It's certainly quaint, but come wintertide, there's going to be snow up to your eyelashes. It's no place for a new baby. What is her name?\"\n\"Bosriel. It means 'Beauty of the Forest.' Where are you going?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, on the bay in High Rock. You're welcome to join me, I could use the company.\" He held out his hand. \"&lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr Whitley&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the woman after a pause. She was going to use her family's name first, as is tradition, but she realized that it was no longer her name. \"I would love to accompany you, thank you.\"\n19 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nFive men and two women stood in the silence of the Great Room of the castle, the only sound the scrawl of quill on parchment and the gentle tapping of rain on the large picture window. As the Prince set the seal of Cyrodiil on the document, the peace was made official. The Duke of Mournhold broke out in a roar of delight, ordering wine brought in to commemorate the end of eighty years of war.\nOnly Sotha Sil stood apart from the group. His face betrayed no emotion. Those who knew him best knew he did not believe in endings or beginnings, but in the continuous cycle of which this was but a small part.\n\"My Prince,\" said the castle steward, unhappy at breaking the celebration. \"There is a messenger here from your mother, the Empress. He asked to see your father, but as he did not arrive --\"\nJuilek excused himself and went to speak with the messenger.\n\"The Empress does not live in the Imperial City?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No,\" said Almalexia, shaking her head sadly. \"Her husband has imprisoned her in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that she was plotting a revolution against him. She is extremely wealthy and has powerful allies in the western &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian estates&lt;/a&gt; so he could not marry another or have her executed. They've been at an impasse for the last seventeen years since Juilek was a child.\"\nThe Prince returned a few minutes later. His face betrayed his anxiety, though he took troubles to hide it.\n\"My mother needs me,\" he said simply. \"I'm afraid I must leave at once. If I may have a copy of the treaty, I will bring it with me to show the Empress the good we have done today, and then I will carry it on to the Imperial City so it may be made official.\"\nPrince Juilek left with the fond farewells of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. As they watched him ride out into the rainswept night south towards Black Marsh, Vivec said, \"&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; will be much healed when he has the throne.\"\n31 Last Seed, 2920&lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dorsza Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Black Marsh\nThe moon was rising over the desolate quarry, steaming with swamp gas from a particularly hot summer as the Prince and his two guard escort rode out of the forest. The massive piles of earth and dung had been piled high in antiquity by some primitive, long-dead tribe of Black Marsh, hoping to keep out some evil from the north. Evidently, the evil had broken through at Dorsza Pass, the large crack in the sad, lonely rampart that stretched for miles.\nThe black twisted trees that grew on the barrier cast strange shadows down, like a net tangling. The Prince's mind was on his mother's cryptic letter, hinting at the threat of an invasion. He could not, of course, tell the Dunmer about it, at the very least until he knew more and had notified his father. After all, the letter was meant for him. It was its urgent tone that made him decide to go directly to &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Empress had also warned him about a band of former slaves who attacked caravans going into Dorsza Pass. She advised him to be certain to make his Imperial shield visible, so they would know he was not one of the hated Dunmer slavers. Upon riding into the tall weeds that flooded through the pass like a noxious river, the Prince ordered that his shield be displayed.\n\"I can see why the slaves use this,\" said the Prince's captain. \"It's an excellent location for an ambush.\"\nJuilek nodded his head, but his thoughts were elsewhere. What threat of invasion could the Empress have discovered? Were the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; on the seas again? If so, how could his mother from her cell in Castle Giovese know of it? A rustle in the weeds and a single sharp human cry behind him interrupted his ponderings.\nTurning around, the Prince discovered that he was alone. His escort had vanished.\nThe Prince peered over the stretch of the moonlit sea of grass which waved in almost hypnotic patterns to the ebb and flow of the night wind billowing through the pass. It was impossible to tell if a struggling soldier was beneath this system of vibrations, a dying horse behind another. A high, whistling wind drowned out any sound the victims of the ambush might be making.\nJuilek drew his sword, and thought about what to do, his mind willing his heart not to panic. He was closer to the exit of the pass than the entrance. Whatever had slain his escort must have been behind him. If he rode fast enough, perhaps he could outrun it. Spurring his horse to gallop, he charged for the hills ahead, framed by the mighty black piles of dirt.\nWhen he was thrown, it happened so suddenly, he was hurtling forward before he was truly conscious of the fact. He landed several yards beyond where his horse had fallen, breaking his shoulder and his back on impact. A numbness washed over him as he stared at his poor, dying steed, its belly sliced open by one of several spears jutting up just below the surface of the grass.\nPrince Juilek was not able to turn and face the figure that emerged from the grass, nor able to move to defend himself. His throat was cut without ceremony.\n&lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt; cursed when he saw the face of his victim more clearly in the moonlight. He had seen the Emperor at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; when he had fought in His Imperial Majesty's command, and this was clearly not the Emperor. Searching the body, he found the letter and a treaty signed by Vivec, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and the Duke of Mournhold representing Morrowind and the Prince Juilek Cyrodiil, representing the Cyrodiil Empire.\n\"Curse my luck,\" muttered Miramor to himself and the whispering grass. \"I've only killed a Prince. Where's the reward in that?\"\nMiramor destroyed the letter, as &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; had instructed him to do, and pocketed the treaty. At the very least, such a curiosity would have some market value. He disassembled the traps as he pondered his next step. Return to Gideon and ask his employer for a lesser reward for killing the heir? Move on to other lands? At the very least, he considered, he had picked up two useful skills from the Battle of Bodrum. From the Dunmer, he had learned the excellent spear trap. And abandoning the Imperial army, he had learned how to skulk in the grass.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2009%20-%20Hearth%20Fire\"&gt;Hearth Fire&lt;/a&gt;"}

Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands. Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Giovese\"&gt;Castle Giovese&lt;/a&gt;, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation. One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; stood at the doorway and shook his head.\n\"She's just heard that her &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; is dead,\" he said quietly.\n5 Hearth Fire, 2920&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;The Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Your Imperial Majesty,\" said the &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; through the door. \"You can open the door. I assure you, you're perfectly safe. No one wants to kill you.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;'s blood!\" came the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt;'s voice, muffled, hysterical, tinged with madness. \"Someone assassinated the Prince, and he was holding my shield! They could have thought he was me!\"\n\"You're certainly correct, your Imperial Majesty,\" replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously.\" And we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death. But we cannot do it without you. You must be brave for your Empire.\"\nThere was no reply.\n\"At the very least, come out and sign the order for Lady &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt;'s execution.\" called the Potentate. \"Let us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.\"\nA brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor. Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye. Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in &lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Hand me the order,\" the Emperor snarled. \"I'll sign it with pleasure.\"\n6 Hearth Fire, 2920Gideon, Cyrodiil [sic]\nThe strange blue glow of the &lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp\"&gt;will o' the wisps&lt;/a&gt;, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened Tavia as she looked out her window. Now it seemed strangely comforting. Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon. It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it every day for seventeen years.\n\"Can you think of anything I've forgotten?\" she asked, turning to look back on the loyal &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; Zuuk.\n\"I know exactly what to do,\" he said simply. He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin. She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.\n\"Make certain you aren't followed,\" she warned. \"I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years. And do take your share of it. You've been a good friend.\"\nThe Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists. Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed. With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.\n9 Hearth Fire, 2920&lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;\nThe strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire. The &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;wrothgarian mountains&lt;/a&gt; were fading into the misty afternoon. &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture. Behind her, head nodding against his chest, &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; slept, cradling &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt;. For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it. Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.\nAs the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest. So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state. A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder. Cassyr opened his eyes.\n\"Where are we?\" he hissed.\n\"I don't know,\" Turala stammered, wide-eyed. \"What is that sound?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;,\" he whispered. \"A hunting party. Head for the thicket quickly.\"\nTurala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted. He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes. A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer. Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse. All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed. Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried. Now she was grateful for it. With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field. Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.\n\"With luck,\" he murmured. \"They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.\"\nAs he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns. Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence. Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid. The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds. Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded. One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.\nCassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could. His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could. Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.\nSuddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind. The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs. Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.\n\"I thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,\" she whispered, smiling. \"Best come with me.\"\nThe three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill. As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.\n\"That horse yours?\" she asked. When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. \"That's rich meat, that is. Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning. Serves 'em right.\"\n\"Shouldn't we keep moving?\" whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.\n\"They won't come up here,\" she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. \"They're too afraid of us.\"\nTurala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. \"&lt;a href=\"Witches\"&gt;Witches&lt;/a&gt;. Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;Farm&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"You are, pet,\" the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. \"I am Mynista Skeffington.\"\n\"What did you do to those orcs?\" asked Turala. \"Back there in the thicket?\"\n\"Spirit fist right side the head,\" Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill. Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play. The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. \"Don't you have witches where you come from, child?\"\n\"None that I know of,\" she said.\n\"There are all sorts of wielders of magic in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;,\" she explained. \"The &lt;a href=\"Psijic\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;s magic like its their painful duty. The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows. We witches commune and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;conjure&lt;/a&gt; and celebrate. To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead. You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls. It's about fostering relations. Being friendly, you might say.\"\n\"Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us.\" said Cassyr.\n\"As well you might,\" coughed Mynista. \"Your kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago. Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us. Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.\"\nWith that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.\n11 Hearth Fire, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nRijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect. It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the ax stroke. Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye. She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face. She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her. She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.\nThe first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed. The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.\nThe Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, \"Now that's done. You said she had a pretty sister in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n18 Hearth Fire, 2920&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, High Rock\nThe horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered. Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden. Still, there was little to complain about. With the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time. Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland. Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.\n\"How went the war?\" cried his cousin, running to the road. \"Is it true that &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?\"\n\"That's not how it was, was it?\" asked a friend, joining them. \"I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.\"\n\"Isn't there anything interesting happening here?\" Cassyr laughed. \"I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.\"\n\"You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,\" said his friend. \"She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.\"\n\"But that's nothing. What was Vivec like?\" asked his cousin eagerly. \"He supposed to be a living god.\"\n\"If &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,\" said Cassyr haughtily.\n\"And the women?\" asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmer ladies on very rare occasions.\nCassyr merely smiled. Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away. She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for. But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever. Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2010%20-%20Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;"}

A thin glob of saliva burbled down, hanging suspended between its fangs. &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; had never seen anything of its kind before, reptilian and massive, perched on its hind legs like a man. Mynistera applauded enthusiastically.\n\"My child,\" she crowed. \"You have come so far in so short a time. What were you thinking when you summoned this &lt;a href=\"daedroth\"&gt;daedroth&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nIt took Turala a moment to recall whether she was thinking anything at all. She was merely overwhelmed that she had reached out across the fabric of reality into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and plucked forth this loathsome creature, &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;conjuring&lt;/a&gt; it into the world by the power of her mind.\n\"I was thinking of the color red,\" Turala said, concentrating. \"The simplicity and clarity of it. And then -- I desired, and spoke the charm. And this is what I conjured up.\"\n\"Desire is a powerful force for a young witch,\" said Mynistera. \"And it is well matched in this instance. For this daedroth is nothing if not a simple force of the spirits. Can you release your desire as easily?\"\nTurala closed her eyes and spoke the dismissal invocation. The monster faded away like a painting in sunlight, still blinking confusedly. Mynistera embraced her &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; pupil, laughing with delight.\n\"I never would have believed it, a month and a day you've been with the coven, and you're already far more advanced than most of the women here. There is powerful blood in you, Turala, you touch spirits like you were touching a lover. You'll be leading this coven one day -- I have seen it!\"\nTurala smiled. It was good to be complimented. The &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; had praised her pretty face; and her family, before she had dishonored them, praised her manners. &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; had been nothing more than a companion: his compliments meant nothing. But with Mynistera, she felt she was home.\n\"You'll be leading the coven for many years yet, great sister,\" said Turala.\n\"I certainly intend to. But the spirits, while marvelous companions and faultless tellers of truth, are often hazy about the when and hows. You can't blame them really. When and how mean so little to them,\" Mynistera opened the door to the shed, allowing the brisk autumn breeze in to dispel the bitter and fetid smells of the daedroth. \"Now, I need you to run an errand to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. It's only a week's ride there, and a week's ride back. Bring Doryatha and Celephyna with you. As much as we try to be self-sufficient, there are &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; we can't grow here, and we seem to run through an enormous quantity of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; in no time at all. It's important that the people of the city learn to recognize you as one of the wise women of &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20coven\"&gt;Skeffington coven&lt;/a&gt;. You'll find the benefits of being notorious far outweigh the inconveniences.\"\nTurala did as she was bade. As she and her sisters climbed aboard their horses, Mynistera brought her child, little five-month-old &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt; to kiss her mother good-bye. The witches were in love with the little Dunmer infant, fathered by a wicked Duke, birthed by wild &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; elves in the forest heart of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Turala knew her nursemaids would protect her child with their lives. After many kisses and a farewell wave, the three young witches rode off into the bright woods, under a covering of red, yellow, and orange.\n12 Frostfall, 2920&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, High Rock\nFor a &lt;a href=\"Day\"&gt;Middas&lt;/a&gt; evening, the Least Loved Porcupine tavern was wildly crowded. A roaring fire in the pit in the center of the room cast an almost sinister glow on all the regulars, and made the abundance of bodies look like a punishment tapestry inspired by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcturian%20Heresy\"&gt;Arcturian Heresies&lt;/a&gt;. Cassyr took his usual place with his cousin and ordered a flagon of ale.\n\"Have you been to see the Baron?\" asked Palyth.\n\"Yes, he may have work for me in the palace of &lt;a href=\"Urvaius\"&gt;Urvaius&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Cassyr proudly. \"But more than that I can't say. You understand, secrets of state and all that. Why are there so many damned people here tonight?\"\n\"A shipload of Dark Elves just came in to harbor. They've come from the war. I was just waiting until you got here to introduce you as another veteran.\"\nCassyr blushed, but regained his composure enough to ask: \"What are they doing here? Has there been a truce?\"\n\"I don't know the full story,\" said Palyth. \"But apparently, the Emperor and Vivec are in negotiations again. These fellas here have investments they were keen to check on, and they figured things on the Bay were quiet enough. But the only way we can get the full story is to talk to the chaps.\"\nWith that, Palyth gripped his cousin's arm and pulled him to the other side of the bar so suddenly, Cassyr would have had to struggle violently to resist. The Dunmer travelers were spread out across four of the tables, laughing with the locals. They were largely amiable young men, well-dressed, befitting merchants, animated in gesture made more extravagant by liquor.\n\"Excuse me,\" said Palyth, intruding on the conversation. \"My shy cousin Cassyr was in the war as well, fighting for the living god, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"The only Cassyr I ever heard of,\" said one of the Dunmer drunkenly with a wide, friendly smile, shaking Cassyr's free hand. \"Was a Cassyr Whitley, who Vivec said was the worst spy in history. We lost &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt; due to his bungling intelligence work. For your sake, friend, I hope the two of you were never confused.\"\nCassyr smiled and listened as the lout told the story of his failure with bountiful exaggerations which caused the table to roar with laughter. Several eyes looked his way, but none of the locals sought to explain that the fool of the tale was standing at attention. The eyes that stung the most were his cousin's, the young man who had believed that he had returned to Dwynnen a great hero. At some point, certainly, the Baron would hear about it, his idiocy increasing manifold with each retelling.\nWith every fiber in his soul, Cassyr cursed the living god &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\n21 Frostfall, 2920The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, in a robe of blinding whiteness, a uniform of the priestesses of the &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; conservatorium, arrived in the City just as the first winter storm was passing. The clouds broke with sunlight, and the beauteous teenaged &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; girl appeared in the wide avenue with escort, riding toward the Palace. While her sister was tall, thin, angular, and haughty, Corda was a small, round-faced lass with wide brown eyes. The locals were quick to draw comparisons.\n\"Not a month after &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Rijja\"&gt;Lady Rijja&lt;/a&gt;'s execution,\" muttered a housemaid, peering out the window, and winking to her neighbor.\n\"And not a month out of the nunnery neither,\" the other woman agreed, reveling in the scandal. \"This one's in for a ride. Her sister weren't no innocent, and look where she ended up.\"\n24 Frostfall, 2920Dwynnen, High Rock\nCassyr stood on the harbor and watched the early sleet fall on the water. It was a pity, he thought, that he was prone to sea-sickness. There was nothing for him now in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to the east or to the west. Vivec's tale of his poor spycraft had spread to taverns everywhere. The Baron of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; had released him from his contract. No doubt they were laughing about him in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, too, and &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt;, probably in &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; for that matter. Perhaps it would be best to drop into the waves and sink. The thought, however, did not stay long in his mind: it was not despair that haunted him, but rage. Impotent fury that he could not assuage.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said a voice behind him, making him jump. \"I'm sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering whether you could recommend an inexpensive tavern for me to spend the night.\"\nIt was a young man, a Nord, with a sack over his shoulder. Obviously, he had just disembarked from one of the boats. For the first time in weeks, someone was looking at Cassyr as something other than a colossal, famous idiot. He could not help, black as his mood was, but be friendly.\n\"You've just arrived from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Cassyr.\n\"No, sir, that's where I'm going,\" said the fellow. \"I'm working my way home. I've come up from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and before that &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, and before that &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and before that &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset&lt;/a&gt;. Welleg's my name.\"\nCassyr introduced himself and shook Welleg's hand. \"Did you say you came from Artaeum? Are you a &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"No, sir, not anymore,\" the fellow shrugged. \"I was expelled.\"\n\"Do you know anything about summoning daedra? You see, I want to cast a curse against a particularly powerful person, one might say a living god, and I haven't had any luck. The Baron won't allow me in his sight, but the Baroness has sympathy for me and allowed me the use of their Summoning Chambers.\" Cassyr spat. \"I did all the rituals, made sacrifices, but nothing came of it.\"\n\"That'd be because of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, my old master,\" replied Welleg with some bitterness. \"The &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20princes\"&gt;Daedra princes&lt;/a&gt; have agreed not to be summoned by any amateurs at least until the war ends. Only the Psijics may counsel with the &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and a few nomadic sorcerers and witches.\"\n\"Witches, did you say?\"\n29 Frostfall, 2920Phrygias, High Rock\nPale sunlight flickered behind the mist bathing the forest as Turala, Doryatha, and Celephyna drove their horses on. The ground was wet with a thin layer of frost, and laden down with goods, it was a slippery way over unpaved hills. Turala tried to contain her excitement about coming back to the coven. Wayrest had been an adventure, and she adored the looks of fear and respect the cityfolk gave her. But for the last few days, all she could think of was returning to her sisters and her child.\nA bitter wind whipped her hair forward so she could see nothing but the path ahead. She did not hear the rider approach to her side until he was almost upon her. When she turned and saw Cassyr, she shouted with as much surprise as pleasure at meeting an old friend. His face was pale and drawn, but she took it to be merely from travel.\n\"What brings you back to Phrygias?\" she smiled. \"Were you not treated well in Dwynnen?\"\n\"Well enough,\" said Cassyr. \"I have need of the Skeffington coven.\"\n\"Ride with us,\" said Turala. \"I'll bring you to Mynistera.\"\nThe four continued on, and the witches regaled Cassyr with tales of Wayrest. It was evident that it was also a rare treat for Doryatha and Celephyna to leave Old Barbyn's Farm. They had been born there, as daughters and grand-daughters of Skeffington witches. Ordinary High Rock city life was exotic to them as it was to Turala. Cassyr said little, but smiled and nodded his head, which was encouragement enough. Thankfully, none of the stories they had heard were about his own stupidity. Or at the very least, they did not tell him.\nDoryatha was in the midst of a tale she had heard in a tavern about a thief who had been locked overnight in a pawnshop when they crossed over a familiar hill. Suddenly, she halted in her story. The barn was supposed to be visible, but it was not. The other three followed her gaze into the fog, and a moment later, they rode as fast as they could towards what was once the site of the Skeffington coven.\nThe fire had long since burned out. Nothing but ashes, skeletons, and broken weaponry remained. Cassyr recognized at once the signs of an orc raid.\nThe witches fell from their horses, racing through the remains, wailing. Celephyna found a tattered, bloody piece of cloth that she recognized from Mynistera's cloak. She held it to her ashen face, sobbing. Turala screamed for Bosriel, but the only reply was the high whistling wind through the ashes.\n\"Who did this?\" she cried, tears streaking down her face. \"I swear I'll conjure up the very flames of Oblivion! What have they done with my baby?\"\n\"I know who did it,\" said Cassyr quietly, dropping from his horse and walking towards her. \"I've seen these weapons before. I fear I met the very fiends responsible in Dwynnen, but I never thought they'd find you. This is the work of assassins hired by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nHe paused. The lie came easily. Adopt and improvise. What's more, he could tell instantly that she believed it. Her resentment over the cruelty the Duke had shown her had quieted, but never disappeared. One look at her burning eyes told him that she would summon the daedra and wreak his, and her, revenge upon Morrowind. And what's more, he knew they'd listen.\nAnd listen they did. For the power that is greater than desire is rage. Even rage misplaced.\nThe Year is Continued in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2011%20-%20Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;"}

His metallic skin, though exposed only at his face and hands, caught the light of the fireplace and the lightning of the stormy night from the window. The Night Mother noted also that she could see herself as he saw her: serene, beautiful, fear-inspiring. He handed her his letter from the Empress without a word. Sipping her wine, she read it.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind also offered me an appreciable sum to have the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; murdered earlier this year,\" she said, folding the letter. \"His payment sunk, and never was delivered. It was a considerable annoyance, particularly as I had already gone to the trouble of putting one of my agents in the palace. Why should I assume that your more-than-generous payment, from a dead woman, will arrive?\"\n\"I brought it with me,\" said Zuuk simply. \"It is in the carriage outside.\"\n\"Then bring it in and our business is complete,\" smiled the Night Mother. \"The Emperor will be dead by year's end. You may leave the gold with Apaladith. Unless you'd care for some wine?\"\nZuuk declined the offer and withdrew. The moment he left the room, &lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt; slipped noiselessly back from behind the dark tapestry. The Night Mother offered him a glass of wine, and he accepted it.\n\"I know that fellow, Zuuk,\" said Miramor carefully. \"I didn't know he worked for the old Empress though.\"\n\"Let's talk about you some more, if you don't mind,\" she said, knowing he would, in fact, not mind.\n\"Let me show you my worth,\" said Miramor. \"Let me be the one to do the Emperor in. I've already killed his son, and you saw there how well I can hide myself away. Tell me you saw one ripple in the tapestry.\"\nThe Night Mother smiled. Things were falling into place rather nicely.\n\"If you know how to use a dagger, you will find him at &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;,\" she said, and described to him what he must do.\n3 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Duke stared out the window. It was early morning, and for the fourth straight day, a red mist hung over the city, flashing lightning. A freakish wind blew through the streets, ripping his flags from the castle battlements, forcing all his people to close their shutters tightly. Something terrible was coming to his land. He was not a greatly learned man, but he knew the signs. So too did his subjects.\n\"When will my messengers reach the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt;?\" he growled, turning to his castellan.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is far to the north, negotiating the treaty with the Emperor,\" the man said, his face and voice trembling with fear. \"&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; are in &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps they can be reached in a few days time.\"\nThe Duke nodded. He knew his messengers were fast, but so too was the hand of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\n6 Sun's Dusk, 2920Bodrum, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nTorchlight caught in the misting snow gave the place an otherworldly quality. The soldiers from both camps found themselves huddled together around the largest of the bonfires: winter bringing enemies of four score years of warring close together. While only a few of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; guard could speak Cyrodilic, they found common ground battling for warmth. When a pretty &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; maiden passed into their midst to warm herself before moving back to the treaty tent, many a man from both armies raised their eyes in approval.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; was eager to leave negotiations before they had ever begun. A month earlier, he thought it would be a sign of good will to meet at the site of his defeat to Vivec's army, but the place brought back more bad memories than he thought it would. Despite the protestations of &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; that the rocks of the river were naturally red, he could swear he saw splatters of his soldier's blood.\n\"We have all the particulars of the treaty,\" he said, taking a glass of hot yuelle from his mistress &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;. \"But here and now is not the place for signing. We should do it at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;, with all the pomp and splendor this historic occasion demands. You must bring Almalexia with you also; and that wizard fellow.\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" whispered the Potentate.\n\"When?\" asked Vivec with infinite patience.\n\"In exactly a month's time,\" said the Emperor, smiling munificently and clambering awkwardly to his feet. \"We will hold a grand ball to commemorate. Now I must take a walk. My legs are all cramped up with the weather. Corda, my dear, will you walk with me?\"\n\"Of course, your Imperial Majesty,\" she said, helping him toward the tent's entrance.\n\"Would you like me to come with you as well, your Imperial Majesty?\" asked Versidue-Shaie.\n\"Or I?\" asked King &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zel\"&gt;Dro'Zel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, a newly appointed advisor to the court.\n\"That won't be necessary, I won't be gone a minute,\" said Reman.\nMiramor crouched in the same rushes he had hidden in nearly eight months before. Now the ground was hard and snow-covered, and the rushes slick with ice. Every slight movement he made issued forth a crunch. If it were not for the raucous songs of the combined Morrowind and Imperial army gathered about the bonfire, he would not have dared creep this close to the Emperor and his concubine. They were standing at the curve in the frozen creek below the bluff, surrounded by trees sparkling with ice.\nCarefully, Miramor removed the dagger from its sheath. He had slightly exaggerated his abilities with a &lt;a href=\"Short%20Blade\"&gt;short blade&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;. True, he had used one to cut the throat of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt;, but the lad was not in any position to fight back at the time. Still, how difficult could it be to stab an old man with one eye? What sort of blade skill would such an easy assassination require?\nHis ideal moment presented itself before his eyes. The woman saw something deeper in the woods, an icicle of an unusual shape she said, and darted off to get it. The Emperor remained behind, laughing. He turned to the face of the bluff to see his soldiers singing their song's refrain, his back to his assassin. Miramor knew the moment had come. Mindful of the sound of his footfall on the icy ground, he stepped forward and struck. Very nearly.\nAlmost simultaneously, he was aware of a strong arm holding back his striking arm and another one punching a dagger into his throat. He could not scream. The Emperor, still looking up at the soldiers, never saw Miramor pulled back into the brush and a hand much more skilled than his slicing into his back, paralyzing him.\nHis blood pooling out and already crystallizing on the frozen ground, Miramor watched, dying, as the Emperor and his courtesan returned to join the camp up on the bluff.\n12 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nA gout of ever-erupting flame was all that remained of the central courtyard of Castle Mournhold, blasting skyward into the boiling clouds. A thick, tarry smoke rolled through the streets, igniting everything that was wood or paper on fire. Winged bat-like creatures harried the citizens from their hiding places out into the open, where they were met by the real army. The only thing that kept all of Mournhold from burning to the ground was the wet, sputtering blood of its people.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; smiled as he surveyed the castle crumbling.\n\"To think I nearly didn't come,\" he said aloud, his voice booming over the chaos. \"Imagine missing all this fun.\"\nHis attention was arrested by a needle-thin shaft of light piercing through his black and red shadowed sky. He followed it to its source, two figures, a man and a woman standing on the hill above town. The man in the white robe he recognized immediately as Sotha Sil, the sorcerer who had talked all the Princes of Oblivion into that meaningless truce.\n\"If you've come for the Duke of Mournhold, he isn't here,\" laughed Mehrunes Dagon. \"But you might find pieces of him the next time it rains.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, we cannot kill you,\" said Almalexia, her face hard and resolute. \"But that you will soon regret.\"\nWith that, two living gods and a prince of Oblivion engaged in battle on the ruins of Mournhold.\n17 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\n\"Night Mother,\" said the guard. \"Correspondence from your agent in the Imperial Palace.\"\nThe Night Mother read the note carefully. The test had been a success: Miramor had been successfully detected and slain. The Emperor was in very unsafe hands. The Night Mother responded immediately.\n18 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nSotha Sil, face solemn and unreadable, greeted Vivec at the grand plaza in front of his palace. Vivec had ridden day and night after hearing about the battle in his tent in Bodrum, crossing mile after mile, cutting through the dangerous ground at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt; at blinding speed. To the south, during all the course of the journey, he could see the whirling red clouds and knew that the battle was continuing, day after day. In &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, he met a messenger from Sotha Sil, asking him to meet at Balmora.\n\"Where is Almalexia?\"\n\"Inside,\" said Sotha Sil wearily. There was a long, ugly gash running across his jaw. \"She's gravely injured, but Mehrunes Dagon will not return from Oblivion for many a moon.\"\nAlmalexia lay on a bed of silk, tended to by Vivec's own healers. Her face, even her lips, was gray as stone, and blood stained through the gauze of her bandages. Vivec took her cold hand. Almalexia's mouth moved wordlessly. She was dreaming.\nShe was battling Mehrunes Dagon again amid a firestorm. All around her, the blackened husk of a castle crumbled, splashing sparks into the night sky. The Daedra's claws dug into her belly, spreading poison through her veins while Almalexia throttled him. As she sank to the ground beside her defeated foe, she saw that the castle consumed by fire was not Castle Mournhold. It was the Imperial Palace.\n24 Sun's Dusk, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\nA winter gale blew over the city, splashing the windows and glass domes of the Imperial Palace. Quivering light rays illuminated the figures within in surreal patterns.\nThe Emperor barked orders to his staff in preparations for the banquet and ball. This was what he enjoyed best, more than battle. King Dro'Zel was supervising the entertainment, having strong opinions on the matter. The Emperor himself was arranging the details of the dinner. Roast nebfish, vegetable marrow, cream soups, buttered helerac, codscrumb, tongue in aspic. Potentate Versidue-Shaie had made a few suggestions of his own, but the tastes of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; were very peculiar.\nThe Lady &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the Emperor to his chambers as night fell.\nThe Year is Concluded in &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2012%20-%20Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "18736", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18736", "title": "2920, vol 12 - Evening Star", "text": "2920, vol 12 - Evening Star is a book in , , and .\nContents.\n1 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nThe winter morning sun glinted through the cobweb of frost on the window, and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; opened her eyes. An ancient healer mopped a wet cloth across her head, smiling with relief. Asleep in the chair next to her bed was &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. The healer rushed to a side cabinet and returned with a flagon of water.\n\"How are you feeling, goddess?\" asked the healer.\n\"Like I've been asleep for a very long time,\" said Almalexia.\n\"So you have. Fifteen days,\" said the healer, and touched Vivec's arm. \"Master, wake up. She speaks.\"\nVivec rose with a start, and seeing Almalexia alive and awake, his face broke into a wide grin. He kissed her forehead, and took her hand. At last, there was warmth again in her flesh.\nAlmalexia's peaceful repose suddenly snapped: \"&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; --\"\n\"He's alive and well,\" replied Vivec. \"Working on one of his machines again somewhere. He would have stayed here too, but he realized he could do you more good working that peculiar sorcery of his.\"\nThe castellan appeared in the doorway. \"Sorry to interrupt you, master, but I wanted to tell you that your fastest messenger left late last night for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Messenger?\" asked Almalexia. \"Vivec, what has happened?\"\n\"I was to go and sign a truce with the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; on the sixth, so I sent him word that it had to be postponed.\"\n\"You can't do me any good here,\" said Almalexia, pulling herself up with effort. \"But if you don't sign that truce, you'll put Morrowind back to war, maybe for another eighty years. If you leave today with an escort and hurry, perhaps you can get to the Imperial City only a day or two late.\"\n\"Are you certain you don't need me here?\" asked Vivec.\n\"I know that Morrowind needs you more.\"\n6 Sun's Dusk, 2920The Imperial City, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20III\"&gt;Reman III&lt;/a&gt; sat on his throne, surveying the audience chamber. It was a spectacular sight: silver ribbons dangled from the rafters, burning cauldrons of sweet herbs simmered in every corner, &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;n swallowtails sweeping through the air, singing their songs. When the torches were lit and servants began fanning, the room would be transfigured into a shimmering fantasy land. He could smell the kitchen already, spices and roasts.\nThe Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; slithered into the room, both bedecked in the headdress and jewelry of the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;. There was no smile on their golden face, but there seldom was one. The Emperor still greeted his trusted advisor with enthusiasm.\n\"This ought to impress those savage &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;,\" he laughed. \"When are they supposed to arrive?\"\n\"A messenger's just arrived from Vivec,\" said the Potentate solemnly. \"I think it would be best if your Imperial Majesty met him alone.\"\nThe Emperor lost his laughter, but nodded to his servants to withdraw. The door then opened and the Lady &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt; walked into the room, with a parchment in her hand. She shut the door behind her, but did not look up to meet the Emperor's face.\n\"The messenger gave his letter to my mistress?\" said Reman, incredulous, rising to take the note. \"That's a highly unorthodox way of delivering a message.\"\n\"But the message itself is very orthodox,\" said Corda, looking up into his one good eye. With a single blinding motion, she brought the letter up under the Emperor's chin. His eyes widened and blood poured down the blank parchment. Blank that is, except for a small black mark, the sign of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. It fell to the floor, revealing the small dagger hidden behind it, which she now twisted, severing his throat to the bone. The Emperor collapsed to the floor, gasping soundlessly.\n\"How long do you need?\" asked &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Five minutes,\" said Corda, wiping the blood from her hands. \"If you can give me ten, though, I'll be doubly grateful.\"\n\"Very well,\" said the Potentate to Corda's back as she raced from the audience chamber. \"She ought to have been an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, the way the girl handles a blade is truly remarkable.\"\n\"I must go and establish our alibi,\" said Savirien-Chorak, disappearing behind one of the secret passages that only the Emperor's most trusted knew about.\n\"Do you remember, close to a year ago, your Imperial Majesty,\" the Potentate smiled, looking down at the dying man. \"When you told me to remember 'You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.' I remembered that, you see.\"\nThe Emperor spat up blood and somehow said the word: \"Snake.\"\n\"I am a snake, your Imperial Majesty, inside and out. But I didn't lie. There was a messenger from Vivec. It seems he'll be a little late in arriving,\" the Potentate shrugged before disappearing behind the secret passage. \"Don't worry yourself. I'm sure the food won't go bad.\"\nThe Emperor of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; died in a pool of his own blood in his empty audience chamber decorated for a grand ball. He was found by his bodyguard fifteen minutes later. Corda was nowhere to be found.\n8 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Caer%20Suvio\"&gt;Caer Suvio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nLord Gla, apologizing profusely for the quality of the road through the forest, was the first emissary to greet Vivec and his escort as they arrived. A string of burning globes decorated the leafless trees surrounding the villa, bobbing in the gentle but frigid night breeze. From within, Vivec could smell the simple feast and a high sad melody. It was a traditional Akaviri wintertide carol.\nPotentate Versidue-Shaie greeted Vivec at the front door.\n\"I'm glad you received the message before you got all the way to the City,\" said the Potentate, guiding his guest into the large, warm drawing room. \"We are in a difficult transition time, and for the moment, it is best not to conduct our business at the capitol.\"\n\"There is no heir?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No official one, though there are distant cousins vying for the throne. While we sort the matter out, at least temporarily the nobles have decided that I may act in the office of my late master,\" Versidue-Shaie signaled for the servants to draw two comfortable chairs in front of the fireplace. \"Would you feel most comfortable if we signed the treaty officially right now, or would you like to eat something first?\"\n\"You intend to honor the Emperor's treaty?\"\n\"I intend to do everything as the Emperor,\" said the Potentate.\n14 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nCorda, dusty from the road, flew into the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s arms. For a moment, they stayed locked together, the Night Mother stroking her daughter's hair, kissing her forehead. Finally, she reached into her sleeve and handed Corda a letter.\n\"What is it?\" asked Corda.\n\"A letter from the Potentate, expressing his delight at your expertise,\" replied the Night Mother. \"He's promised to send us payment, but I've already sent him back a reply. The late &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; paid us enough for her husband's death. &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; would not have us be greedy beyond our needs. You should not be paid twice for the same murder, so it is written.\"\n\"He killed &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt;, my sister,\" said Corda quietly.\n\"And so it should be that you struck the blow.\"\n\"Where will I go now?\"\n\"Whenever any of our holy workers becomes too famous to continue the crusade, we send them to an island called &lt;a href=\"Vounoura\"&gt;Vounoura&lt;/a&gt;. It's not more than a month's voyage by boat, and I've arranged for a delightful estate for your sanctuary,\" the Night Mother kissed the girl's tears. \"You meet many friends there, and I know you will find peace and happiness at last, my child.\"\n19 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nAlmalexia surveyed the rebuilding of the town. The spirit of the citizens was truly inspirational, she thought, as she walked among the skeletons of new buildings standing in the blackened, shattered remains of the old. Even the plant life showed a remarkable resilience. There was life yet in the blasted remains of the &lt;a href=\"comberry\"&gt;comberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"roobrush\"&gt;roobrush&lt;/a&gt; shrubs that once lined the main avenue. She could feel the pulse. Come springtide, green would bolt through the black.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke's&lt;/a&gt; heir, a lad of considerable intelligence and sturdy Dunmer courage, was coming down from the north to take his father's place. The land would do more than survive: it would strengthen and expand. She felt the future much more strongly than she saw the present.\nOf all the things she was most certain of, she knew that Mournhold was forever home to at least one goddess.\n22 Sun's Dusk, 2920The Imperial City, Cyrodiil\n\"The Cyrodiil line is dead,\" announced the Potentate to the crowd gathered beneath the Speaker's Balcony of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. \"But the Empire lives. The distant relatives of our beloved Emperor have been judged unworthy of the throne by the trusted nobility who advised his Imperial Majesty throughout his long and illustrious reign. It has been decided that as an impartial and faithful friend of Reman III, I will have the responsibility of continuing on in his name.\"\nThe Akaviri paused, allowing his words to echo and translate into the ears of the populace. They merely stared up at him in silence. The rain had washed through the streets of the city, but the sun, for a brief time, appeared to be offering a respite from the winter storms.\n\"I want to make it clear that I am not taking the title Emperor,\" he continued. \"I have been and will continue to be Potentate Versidue-Shaie, an alien welcomed kindly to your shores. It will be my duty to protect my adopted homeland, and I pledge to work tirelessly at this task until someone more worthy takes the burden from me. As my first act, I declare that in commemoration of this historical moment, beginning on the first of &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Morning Star&lt;/a&gt;, we will enter year one of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; as time will be reckoned. Thus, we mourn the loss of our Imperial family, and look forward to the future.\"\nOnly one man clapped at these words. King &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zel\"&gt;Dro'Zel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; truly believed that this would be the finest thing to happen to Tamriel in history. Of course, he was quite mad.\n31 Sun's Dusk, 2920&lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nIn the smoky catacombs beneath the city where Sotha Sil forged the future with his arcane clockwork apparatus, something unforeseen happened. An oily bubble seeped from a long trusted gear and popped. Immediately, the wizard's attention was drawn to it and to the chain that tiny action triggered. A pipe shifted half an inch to the left. A tread skipped. A coil rewound itself and began spinning in a counter direction. A piston that had been thrusting left-right, left-right, for millennia suddenly began shifting right-left. Nothing broke, but everything changed.\n\"It cannot be fixed now,\" said the sorcerer quietly.\nHe looked up through a crick in the ceiling into the night sky. It was midnight. The &lt;a href=\"second%20era\"&gt;second era&lt;/a&gt;, the age of chaos, had begun."}

By diverse methods, Lord &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, High Priest and Magecrafter of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, determined that this magical stone was the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; of the god &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, cast here in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; as punishment for his mischief in creating the mortal world. Determined to use its divine powers to create a new god for the exclusive benefit of the Dwemer, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; forged three great enchanted artifacts, which are called Kagrenac's Tools. &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted gauntlet to protect its wearer from destruction when tapping the heart's power. Sunder is an enchanted hammer to strike the heart and produce the exact volume and quality of power desired. &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted blade that is used to flay and focus the power that rises from the heart.\nOne account stated that the hammer Sunder was wielded by &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt; during his battle with &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; in the Red Mountain. Where &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt; was using &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; in a chest-plate form and was blinded by Wulfharth with a shout, Dumac used Sunder to make Wulfharth's &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; solid before being slain by him. &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; used &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; in a surprise attack to kill Wulfhearth and cut out his heart. Following Wulfharth's defeat, all three artifacts came into the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Almsivi%20Intervention\"&gt;Almsivi&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; wrested &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; and the Heart of Lorkhan from &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and used them to give themselves divine powers.

The right (east) path leads to a wall that can't be climbed, but contains three silver ore veins.\nThe straight (north) path leads to a spiked gate trap protecting a room with several mages (pyromancers, necromancers, etc.). At the opposite (north) end of the room, a small alcove to the right (east) contains an adept locked chest. Wooden steps lead up to the left (west), then left again (south) to a wooden bridge leading east. There is an apprentice locked chest to the right (west) before crossing the bridge.\nThe bridge leads to a T intersection. To the right (south) is a dead end. Turning left (north), then right (east) leads to a wooden door. Beyond, the path slopes down to a soul gem fire trap. Beyond that is a door to the right (south) that, when opened, springs a poison dart trap. Behind that door is a tiny room with a bookshelf containing a chest, soul gem, and random loot. Back out on the path, there is a combination cooking and sleeping area, with two enemy mages, an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt; and two cages against the right (south) wall. In the southeast corner is a small alcove to the east that contains a master locked chest that is half buried.\nFrom the southeast corner of the room, a path leads south, east, then south to a room that dead ends to the left (east), while to the right is an iron door.

A dead body of a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; lies in a small cage between the Word Wall and the exit to the cave. There is also a table with two dead bodies of a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; right in front of the wall \u2014 on the southwest corner of that table is a Stone of Barenziah. A chest with leveled loot and an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; are against the north wall.\nTo the south is a spear gate that can be dropped by pulling a chain to its left. Behind this gate is a small area with a number of books, an alchemy lab, and another pull chain (to the right of the lab) that drops the second spear gate, which opens the shortcut back to the entrance (jumping off the wall that could not be climbed earlier)."}

The arrows have glowing white tips with white fletching, and are stored in a silver &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; quiver.\nAcquisition.\nThey are given to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; after having obtained &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to obtain additional arrows, Gelebor provides a service where he will bless normal Elven Arrows with incantations and rituals to produce Sunhallowed Elven Arrows in groups of twenty. A good source for Elven Arrows is &lt;a href=\"Sorine%20Jurard\"&gt;Sorine Jurard&lt;/a&gt;. She typically sells around 200 at a time, but is only available as a merchant if the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; are sided with. If sided with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;, Elven Arrows can instead be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Hestla\"&gt;Hestla&lt;/a&gt;, who carries roughly the same amount. Alternatively, one can visit any &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; and buy elven arrows there. An example is &lt;a href=\"The%20Drunken%20Huntsman\"&gt;The Drunken Huntsman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchantment.\nThese arrows produce a unique effect when fired from &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;. When fired normally at an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; enemy, the arrows cause &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Damage%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Sun Damage&lt;/a&gt; and a small area-of-effect blast that will cause some damage to surrounding entities.\nShooting a Sunhallowed Arrow from Auriel's Bow at the sun will cause the sun to undergo an explosion, causing beams of harmful sunlight to rain down on all enemies (and allies) similar to the effect of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Call\"&gt;Storm Call&lt;/a&gt; shout.\nThese special effects only occur when the arrows are fired from Auriel's Bow. When fired from any other bow, they will behave just like the normal &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;elven arrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsage.\nDuring the battle with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harkon\"&gt;Lord Harkon&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunhallowed Arrows do not have to be fired. Auriel's Bow has the ability to destroy the barrier he uses to heal himself. Otherwise, he is untouchable while he heals."}

{"id": "954709", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=954709", "title": "Sunhold", "text": "Sunhold is one of the eight major cities in the province of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, situated along the southern coast of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, on the otherside of the southern mountains. Sunhold is a bustling port city, housing the province's strongest and most fearsome navy.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSunhold is one of the largest cities in the southwestern world, rivaling the likes of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;. Some consider that when Sunhold inevitably merges with the not so far city of Alinor, it would create a metropolis that was not seen since &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. The road between Sunhold and its twin city, &lt;a href=\"Dusk\"&gt;Dusk&lt;/a&gt; is a large forest with streams following about. It is a mountain pass, larger than the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Haven%20Pass\"&gt;King's Haven Pass&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Indrik\"&gt;Indrik&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; are known to occupy the area, though these animals are not necessarily prominent. Waterfalls are flowing from the nearby mountains of &lt;a href=\"Archon%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Archon's Grove&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks the entire road.\nThe entrance of Sunhold is somewhat obscure when compared to the rest of Summerset Isle, traveling from the road in the southeast will eventually end at the great gates of Sunhold. Beyond the entrance is a large park that slithers towards the central city. Farms and beaches in this area. Sunhold city can be compared to a vast labyrinth, with towering buildings and long bridges covered in vines and flowers. The streets are filled with merchants and passersby, and clothing is hanging above. To the southwest is the well-known harbor district, which is riddled with various warehouses, where boats are continually being built. The Sunhold Bay is small, so the rest of the harbor extends along the southwest mountain, being connected to the city via tunnels.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the early years of the Altmer, the people were always fascinated with the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s of the land, hoping to fly and tame them throughout the Summerset Isle. For years, many have tried but ultimately failed, realizing that the Gryphons are too fierce and prideful to be tamed by them. This would change when &lt;a href=\"Ulorome\"&gt;Ulorome&lt;/a&gt;, a tribesman from what would be modern-day Sunhold had founded an egg in an abandoned nest on one of their hunts. Because it did not hatch, Ulorome took the egg home, to prepare a feast with the entire tribe. With the egg nestled in the warm hearth, the tribe sang ancient songs of hearth and family until the egg had hatched into a fledgling Gryphon, with crimson red feathers, as if it were a Phoenix. Ulorome, feeling blessed for this creature had adopted him, christening him as &lt;a href=\"Cel-hinwe\"&gt;Cel-hinwe&lt;/a&gt;. Cel-hinwe would bring about Sunhold's famous Gryphon line, which became well-renowned throughout the region. Ulorome's lineage would continue as Sunhold's modern-day Kinlords.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Sunhold was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Helenaere\"&gt;Kinlady Helenaere&lt;/a&gt;, utilizing the prized Gryphon of the city's famous line, &lt;a href=\"Sunnawel\"&gt;Sunnawel&lt;/a&gt;. Sunhold was used as the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;'s port of choice, housing the alliance's fearsome navy. But with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; raging in the east, Sunhold was left vulnerable, which &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Viscarne\"&gt;Admiral Viscarne&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Sharks\"&gt;Storm Sharks&lt;/a&gt; used to invade Sunhold. Viscarne had invaded the city before, albeit it failed when the defensive force emptied the city, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;i open. Sunhold had been the prized target of &lt;a href=\"King%20Orgnum\"&gt;King Orgnum&lt;/a&gt;, due to Sunhold's main involvement against any Maormer invasion. Viscarne's second attempt was able to subdue the defense, gaining nigh complete control over Sunhold. Desperate to regain the city, Helenaere utilized &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;travelers&lt;/a&gt; in retaking Sunhold. As time went on, citizens were freed, and Sunnawel was able to escape the Storm Sharks. Before Sunhold was freed, Viscarne had kidnapped Helenaere but was ultimately killed. With their leader dead, the Maormer forces were losing will, which Helenaere used in re-capturing the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Sunhold in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Sunhold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Saruriil\"&gt;King Saruriil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the provinces of Tamriel were invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Sunhold, like the rest of the Summerset Isles, was sacked by the Daedra, and so many refugees fled, ideally to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt;. One such refuge was &lt;a href=\"Lathenil%20of%20Sunhold\"&gt;Lathenil of Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;, who documented the time during and after the Crisis, regarding the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Lathenil survived the destruction of the Crystal Tower and fled to Cyrodiil. During his time there, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; had risen to power, and Lathenil warned the people about their plans of conquest, but to no avail. Lathenil had submitted his notes to the officials in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but he was ultimately assassinated, likely by Thalmor Agents. During his lifetime, he was very outspoken about the Thalmor, yet very few ever listened, his efforts were in vain when &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; had commenced several years later."}

Ancient treasures and mortal danger both await within this mysterious ruin.\"\nWalkthrough.\nRecruitement.\nTalk to Famia Mercius at the Lilmoth market. She will give out an invitation to meet her and her group at Lilmoth's western gate to participate in the expedition of a nearby ancient Argonian temple, the Ixtaxh Xanmeer. \nThe Swamps.\nUpon arrival at the gate, speak to &lt;a href=\"Zadaza\"&gt;Zadaza&lt;/a&gt;, a Khajiit mercenary and employee of Famia. After the conversation Famia will arrive and ask you to follow her to gather two &lt;a href=\"Vakka%20Stone\"&gt;Vakka Stones&lt;/a&gt; that are needed to open the Xanmeer's doors. She will lead the way to the first and eventually the second at a hut, where you'll have to speak to her again. \nIxtaxh Xanmeer.\nTravel to the Xanmeer in the east. In front of it Zadaza and two other expedition members, &lt;a href=\"Kirstaleth\"&gt;Kirstaleth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varo%20Hosidias\"&gt;Varo Hosidias&lt;/a&gt; and enter it. Inside activate the lever Famia points to, which will result in the floor breaking open and your party falling into different rooms. Pick the lock on the nearby door. Proceed and after some swimming you will arrive at a bridge that requires a puzzle to be solved to lower. \nHead north until you reach a great hall. To save the trapped Kirstaleth you have to collect four vines to craft a ladder. The vines are guarded by Hoarvor, River Trolls and plant life. Return to Famia and place down the ladder. Proceed until you reach Varo Hosidias and defend him from the attacking spiders. Go through the next door and cross the furnace to the next room. There Famia will take the &lt;a href=\"Kajin-Jat%20Crystal\"&gt;Kajin-Jat Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, which will trigger a trap and cause the Ixtaxh Varoplam to attack. It is best defeated by luring it over the furnaces to damage it and quickly deal with any smaller versions of itself that it spawns. After its defeat the ruin will fill with toxic gas and you have about one minute to escape. It is possible to acquire additional loot from locked chests on the escape route, up to three relics, but taking to long will result in death. After escaping Varo and Kirstaleth announce they will not work for Famia anymore and leave. Go to the headquarters of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Collections%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic Collections&lt;/a&gt; in Lilmoth and speak to Famia to finish the quest and receive your reward. Any relics collected on the escape yield a gold bonus."}

The barkeep in the first large section of the cave can be looted to find a chest key which opens an apprentice level locked chest in the north-western corner of the bar and contains &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt;, skooma, as well as the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wolf%20Queen%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;The Wolf Queen, Book I&lt;/a&gt;\" which increases the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; skill by one point.\nOnce the cavern has been cleared of all humanoid enemies, the Dragonborn can return to the Jarl of Riften who will thank them for their service and award them with a leveled enchanted weapon, saying: \"Your continued efforts have been of great benefit to the people of Riften.\" If &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; is the Jarl, she will, in addition to the enchanted weapon give the player a sum of , saying: \"We can't have that substance falling into the wrong hands now, can we? This should suffice as tour cut of the... or rather, a reward for your actions.\""}

They sent me to Minerva Lauzon, who is gathering survivors in the sewers.\"\nWalkthrough.\nNorth of the city of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, you will find an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Fights-With-Tail\"&gt;Fights-With-Tail&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that the city has been overrun by mad &lt;a href=\"Blackcaster%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Blackcaster Mages&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Yamanu-ko\"&gt;Yamanu-ko&lt;/a&gt;, has locked herself in the Apex Tower while the other mages went mad and started killing everyone, even each other. Fights-With-Tail will tell you about one good mage who has been trying to save people, someone named &lt;a href=\"Minerva%20Lauzon\"&gt;Minerva Lauzon&lt;/a&gt;. She is currently in the sewers; your task is to go look for her. \nYou can find the sewer entrance just west of the destroyed bridge. Head in and start looking for Minerva; she can be found in the northwesternmost room, alongside other survivors. Talk to her and she will tell you that in order to stop this madness, you will need to kill Yamanu-ko, but her tower is protected by ancient magic. To dispel the magic, you will have to destroy ancient devices guarded by Yamanu-ko's apprentices, &lt;a href=\"Leta%20Doniticus\"&gt;Leta Doniticus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Avys%20Areleth\"&gt;Avys Areleth&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead out of the sewers; there is a ladder in the northwest. Once outside, head south and you will find the West Tower. You will have to fight some enemies to reach the portal to the second floor, but from there, you can reach the portal to the third floor without violence. On the third floor, you will find Leta guarding the device. Leta's HP bar is comparable to a world boss, but her offensive prowess is not. She will summon zombies and skeletons to her aid, but these are not challenging either. Once she is dead, destroy the artifact and take the portal to the tower entrance. Leave and head to the southeast of the city for the second tower, the East Tower. This tower is similar to the first one, except that you will be fighting Daedra rather than zombies, including a strong Clannfear named &lt;a href=\"Nazullu\"&gt;Nazullu&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a puzzle on the second floor; you have to use the guidance projector on your left and follow the ghost that appears; any other path will teleport you back to the start. Once you reach the third floor, kill Avys and destroy the device. \nOnce both devices have been destroyed, head to the tower in the south of town to meet up with Minerva. She will be able to dispel the ward now, but it will take most of her strength, meaning she cannot go in with you. Once she has dispelled the ward, head through the gates and fight your way through to the Apex Tower. In the tower itself, there will be no enemies guarding your way to Yamanu-ko. Head up and face her in battle. Kill her, then head back down and speak with Minerva to finish the quest."}

The road goes into Suran from the north and into the south. It is walled off making it a secure place to stay; it is also the first town upon arriving or entering into the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; Ashlands in southeastern Vvardenfell.

At the time, a masked vigilante that went by the name of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Judge\"&gt;Scarlet Judge&lt;/a&gt; began to investigate any evidence that could incarcerate her.

The governor of Suran was a House Hlaalu nobleman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Serjo%20Avon%20Oran\"&gt;Serjo Avon Oran&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign, he had ownership of the &lt;a href=\"Inanius%20Egg%20Mine\"&gt;Inanius Egg Mine&lt;/a&gt; located east-southeast of Suran.

When &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, the Tribunal Religion began to fall apart, and many temples were remade into temples dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reclamations\"&gt;House of Reclamations&lt;/a&gt;. Suran's temple was no exception.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of Vvardenfell erupts, and the resulting lava flows destroyed all of Vvardenfell's life and cities. Many settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and Suran were destroyed in the midst of the eruption. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; councilman from &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; decided to start a relief effort to rebuild the settlements on Vvardenfell including Suran.

A gaudy, alien coat of arms marked each carriage, the lacquer glistening in the light of the moons. \"Who do you suppose they are?\"\n\"They're obviously well-off,\" smiled his partner, Heriah. \"Perhaps some new &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the acquisition of wealth?\"\n\"Go into town and find out what you can about the castle,\" said Indyk. \"I'll see if I can learn anything about who these strangers are. We meet on this hill tomorrow night.\"\nHeriah had two great skills: picking locks and picking information. By dusk of the following day, she had returned to the hill. Indyk joined her an hour later.\n\"The place is called Ald Olyra,\" she explained. \"It dates back to the second era when a collection of nobles built it to protect themselves during one of the epidemics. They didn't want any of the diseased masses to get into their midst and spread the plague, so they built up quite a sophisticated security system for the time. Of course, it's mostly fallen into ruin, but I have a good idea about what kind of locks and traps might still be operational. What did you find out?\"\n\"I wasn't nearly so successful,\" frowned Indyk. \"No one seemed to have any idea about the group, even that that there [sic] were here. I was about to give up, but at the charterhouse, I met a monk who said that his masters were a hermetic group called the Order of St Eadnua. I talked to him for some time, this fellow name of Parathion, and it seems they're having some sort of ritual feast tonight.\"\n\"Are they wealthy?\" asked Heriah impatiently.\n\"Embarrassingly so according to the fellow. But they're only at the castle for tonight.\"\n\"I have my picks on me,\" winked Heriah. \"Opportunity has smiled on us.\"\nShe drew a diagram of the castle in the dirt: the main hall and kitchen were near the front gate, and the stables and secured armory were in the back. The thieves had a system that never failed. Heriah would find a way into the castle and collect as much loot as possible, while Indyk provided the distraction. He waited until his partner had scaled the wall before rapping on the gate. Perhaps this time he would be a bard, or a lost adventurer. The details were most fun to improvise.\nHeriah heard Indyk talking to the woman who came to the gate, but she was too far away to hear the words exchanged. He was evidently successful: a moment later, she heard the door shut. The man had charm, she would give him that.\nOnly a few of the traps and locks to the armory had been set. Undoubtedly, many of the keys had been lost in time. Whatever servants had been in charge of securing the Order's treasures had brought a few new locks to affix. It took extra time to maneuver the intricate hasps and bolts of the new traps before proceeding to the old but still working systems, but Heriah found her heart beating with anticipation. Whatever lay beyond the door, she thought, must be of sufficient value to merit such protection.\nWhen at last the door swung quietly open, the thief found her avaricious dreams paled to reality. A mountain of golden treasure, ancient relics glimmering with untapped magicka, weaponry of matchless quality, gemstones the size of her fist, row after row of strange potions, and stacks of valuable documents and scrolls. She was so enthralled by the sight, she did not hear the man behind her approach.\n\"You must be Lady Tressed,\" said the voice and she jumped.\nIt was a monk in a black, hooded robe, intricately woven with silver and gold threads. For a moment, she could not speak. This was the sort of encounter that Indyk loved, but she could think to do nothing but nod her head with what she hoped looked like certainty.\n\"I'm afraid I'm a little lost,\" she stammered.\n\"I can see that,\" the man laughed. \"That's the armory. I'll show you the way to the dining hall. We were afraid you weren't going to arrive. The feast is nearly over.\"\nHeriah followed the monk across the courtyard, to the double doors leading to the dining hall. A robe identical to the one he was wearing hung on a hook outside, and he handed it to her with a knowing smile. She slipped it on. She mimicked him as she lowered the hood over her head and entered the hall.\nTorches illuminated the figures within around the large table. Each wore the uniform black robe that covered all features, and from the look of things, the feast was over. Empty plates, platters, and glasses filled every inch of the wood with only the faintest spots and dribbles of the food remaining. It was a breaking of a fast it seemed. For a moment, Heriah stopped to think about poor, lost Lady Tressed who had missed her opportunity for gluttony.\nThe only unusual item on the table was its centerpiece: a huge golden hourglass which was on its last minute's worth of sand.\nThough each person looked alike, some were sleeping, some were chatting merrily to one another, and one was playing a lute. Indyk's lute, she noticed, and then noticed Indyk's ring on the man's finger. Heriah was suddenly grateful for the anonymity of the hood. Perhaps Indyk would not realize that it was she, and that she had blundered.\n\"Tressed,\" said the young man to the assembled, who turned as one to her and burst into applause.\nThe conscious members of the Order arose to kiss her hand, and introduce themselves.\n\"Nirdla.\"\n\"Suelec.\"\n\"Kyler.\"\nThe names got stranger.\n\"Toniop.\"\n\"Htillyts.\"\n\"Noihtarap.\"\nShe could not help laughing: \"I understand. It's all backwards. Your real names are Aldrin, Celeus, Relyk, Poinot, Styllith, Parathion.\"\n\"Of course,\" said the young man. \"Won't you have a seat?\"\n\"Sey,\" giggled Heriah, getting into the spirit of the masque and taking an empty chair. \"I suppose that when the hourglass runs out, the backwards names go back to normal?\"\n\"That's correct, Tressed,\" said the woman next to her. \"It's just one of our Order's little amusements. This castle seemed like the appropriately ironic venue for our feast, devised as it was to shun the plague victims who were, in their way, a walking dead.\"\nHeriah felt herself light-headed from the odor of the torches, and bumped into the sleeping man next to her. He fell face forward onto the table.\n\"Poor Esruoc Tsrif,\" said a neighboring man, helping to prop the body up. \"He's given us so much.\"\nHeriah stumbled to her feet and began walking uncertainly for the front gate.\n\"Where are you going, Tressed?\" asked one of the figures, his voice taking on an unpleasant mocking quality.\n\"My name isn't Tressed,\" she mumbled, gripping Indyk's arm. \"I'm sorry, partner. We need to go.\"\nThe last crumb of sand fell in the hour glass as the man pulled back his hood. It was not Indyk. It was not even human, but a stretched grotesquerie of a man with hungry eyes and a wide mouth filled with tusk-like fangs.\nHeriah fell back into the chair of the figure they called Esruoc Tsrif. His hood fell open, revealing the pallid, bloodless face of Indyk. As she began to scream, they fell on her.\nIn her last living moment, Heriah finally spelled \"Tressed\" backwards."}

We grew up together, ran races through the desert, played with sticks that were swords in our minds, and made gold fighting in other people's wars for years. When we settled on guard duty for the &lt;a href=\"Shields%20of%20Senchal\"&gt;Shields&lt;/a&gt;, it was like an early retirement.\nUntil the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; came.\nWe were on patrol, just like every other day. The &lt;a href=\"terror%20bird\"&gt;terror bird&lt;/a&gt;s were in their breeding season, so the beasts were particularly ornery. Aken had this great trick he learned from an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, though. You take a dried gourd and punch a few holes in it, then tie it to a long string. I told him he was crazy, but when he whipped that thing overhead it screamed like a pack of &lt;a href=\"jackal\"&gt;jackal&lt;/a&gt;s and sent the birds running.\nI never told him what a good idea it was, damn fool me. Good idea, but ...\nAken, you damned idiot. There was no way it was going to scare off a Dragon. It ate him in one gulp and all I could do was stand there slack-jawed and pissing down the side of my leg while he screamed.\nI ran. I'm sorry, Aken. I'm a coward.\nAs it happens, you can't find absolution in the bottom of a bottle of &lt;a href=\"jagga\"&gt;jagga&lt;/a&gt;, or a jug of cheap &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; wine, or even in that &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; crap. You just get a hangover and the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;-shakes, then your throat feels like it's covered in hair. If you look to the &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; instead, the priests will just give you some garbage sermon on how it is the will of &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; and you can only find salvation in prayer.\nIt's all hogwash. They don't know a damn thing.\nI'm going to make it right, Aken. You always trusted me to watch your back and when it counted, I froze. I've strangled a gods-damned cannibal &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; with my bare hands while he was eating my finger and rode down a rabid &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, but that Dragon was the one time my courage failed me.\nI've seen the Dragon flying in the distance for a few hours now. Circling. I think it knows I'm out here. I won't avenge you, but at least the ghost of our father won't curse me for a coward the rest of my days.\nI love you, brother. I won't be long now."}

It is located north of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and northeast of &lt;a href=\"Beldaburo\"&gt;Beldaburo&lt;/a&gt;. Sutch was once a well-established settlement in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; throughout the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, but it has since been in disrepair and abandoned. The Fort Sutch Abbey is all that remains.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSutch is located on the northern grasslands of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, and was built on the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt; near the border to &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the city of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;. Sutch is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, a government operating out of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; that co-exists alongside the Empires of Cyrodiil. Some sources claim that Sutch is located in Hammerfell whereas other sources claim it exists in Cyrodiil. There may also be two different locations with the same name, one in each province, or the borders of the provinces shifted throughout history. In Cyrodiil, Sutch is the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sutch\"&gt;Fort Sutch&lt;/a&gt; and the city of Sutch was on the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, where the road continues northwards to the Brena River. East of what was the city is a road where it leads into a small lake. The seat of power in Sutch was &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Sutch\"&gt;Castle Sutch&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nA well-known legend takes place in Sutch in which a would-be thief came to steal the Baron's gold coins and fell in love with the Baroness instead.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Sutch was active in the warring of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. However, Sutch was not a part of the independent region of the Gold Coast, despite being one of the three main settlements. Regardless, the people of Sutch continued their daily routine and hunters along the &lt;a href=\"Brena%20River\"&gt;Brena River&lt;/a&gt; would continue to sell their wares. The city-state of Sutch was also notorious for dealing with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and the conduit of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; operated out of Sutch. At some point before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; had traveled to Sutch, seeking artistic and philosophical pursuits.\nSutch remained as a city throughout the Interregnum and was still standing, even four-hundred years during the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Hammerfell Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Before the Tiber Wars, &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; was able to unite the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; under a single banner. Sutch, along with the other cities in Colovia were among the first to be established under the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Cuhlecain would be assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who would unite the provinces of Tamriel under his Empire. The last recorded date that Sutch was still a city was in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of Fort Sutch were left abandoned by the denizens of the Imperial Province. A squadron of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; soldiers were stationed at the ruins of Fort Sutch when an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; opened east of the structure. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, the group was able to destroy the gate and save the area from another invasion. At some point, the ruins of Fort Sutch were used as a redoubt by the bandits of the Gold Coast. They were led by a warlord, &lt;a href=\"Roderick\"&gt;Roderick&lt;/a&gt;, who had fallen sick from an unknown illness. Roderick died from ingesting poison instead of his medicine and his death was orchestrated by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;."}
