The inconsistencies in his origin story may be seen as falsehoods, but one may also interpret them as examples of Xarxes' manifold nature.\nXarxes supposedly tracks not just the lives of individual Altmer, but he also keeps track of their lineages. Lineages are deemed important by the Altmer, so this role explains why he is a prominent god in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. It is supposedly through his will that Aldmeri society is among the most structured in Tamriel through his gift of the written word. He has commanded the altmer to keep an everscriven scroll to memorize their lives, for recording one's actions is a sacred duty to Xarxes.\nArtifacts.\nThe Oghma Infinium, though commonly attributed to Hermaeus Mora, was actually written by Xarxes. It contains the knowledge of the ages as revealed to Xarxes. It has throughout the ages been given to many questing heroes who performed a service for Hermaeus Mora."}

They are also personable and in tune with the needs of others, as well as skilled traders.\nOn the rare occasion that Healers wield weapons, they tend to utilize &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maces%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;maces&lt;/a&gt; and other short range, defensive type weapons.\nDescription and use.\nHealers obviously aren't fighters; at most they stay in the background using &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells as weapons, &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; spells as a &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Oblivion%20Spell%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spells for disabling opponents and &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; spells for healing. While most would think of the Healer as being a support class, it has suitable major skills to be a full-on damage dealer.\nIn combat, the best use for a Healer is to stick with distance. As with all mages, the most they can really do is to cast a shield to reduce melee damage. Although useful, this isn't exactly efficient. Destruction and Restoration are the Healer's trump cards. Healers are most effective using touch spells with Destruction, and when their health is low are able to use an &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Absorb Health&lt;/a&gt; spell quickly to regain lost health. Using their Alchemy skill creating healing &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; for combat, and a Healer may also equip a quick weapon such as a dagger to use for poisoning enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; skills will not be of great use in the beginning, but Mercantile can be very useful when trying to get a better deal out of a rare item.\nThe Healer is an effective class if used properly. Unfortunately, they have a serious weakness: without &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; as a main &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;, the Healer will have trouble getting the required &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; for stronger spells. Playing as an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; or using gear that fortifies Intelligence can help with this disadvantage.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ritual\"&gt;The Ritual&lt;/a&gt; birthsign is recommended for the healer as they will be blessed by a plethora of greater powers dedicated to healing once they find the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ritual%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;related Doomstone&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most powerful skills in the game, which Healers possess. Poisons, healing potions, invisibility and burden, to name a few, can be used to great advantage.\nA Healer makes a good role-playing class. They're doctors and alchemists. In , they took solemn oaths to heal the afflicted, cure the diseased, and relied on deadly force only in extreme circumstances. In , they're not much different, with the exception of destruction magic. &lt;a href=\"Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Traveling&lt;/a&gt; can be very extensive and dangerous for them, since they may be required to journey many miles to tend to a sick person, or collect &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; for their potions. So over the years, this is the prime reason the healer learned and developed the deadly art of Destruction. In addition, their skills are all very well-balanced. Alchemy of course is used for mixing healing potions, &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;cure disease&lt;/a&gt; potions, and poisons to coat their dagger with for that extra personal protection. Illusion is very useful for the healer. In times of extreme danger, they can cast an invisibility spell and escape before they come to any harm. The art of alteration is also a fine tool for the healer, from opening locked doors and chests, to casting powerful protection spells upon themselves. Restoration is the best ally to the healer. In battle, they can use it on themselves or a companion/ally to virtually save each other from possible death. Restoration is also good for buffing and absorb spells. Lastly, Speechcraft and Mercantile are essential to a healer and their survival. From getting someone to like them better, to making extra coin at the market with the potions they create."}

I have set up a temporary healing center in the old tower located on &lt;a href=\"Hinault%20Farm\"&gt;Hinault Farm&lt;/a&gt;. Here, I am treating the injuries suffered by Shornhelm Guard soldiers in the aftermath of an unwarranted attack by forces bearing the colors and tabards of &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt;.\nAldred Berri: Stab wound to the right abdomen, applied a healing poultice and wrapped the wound tightly.\nFinia Derone: Took an arrow in her right arm, just above the elbow. Applied a healing poultice and wrapped the wound tightly. She should be ready for duty as needed.\nMarbenn Dugot: Sword slash across the stomach exposed his intestines and he lost much blood. I have done what I can, but I do not believe he will last the night.\nLeobert Favret: A spear his left lung. I have given him a tincture to relieve his pain, but there is little more I can do for him. I expect the end to come quickly.\nRolbert Emain: I have not determined the exact nature of his wound, for it doesn't resemble any weapon I am familiar with. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he was gutted by the claws of a large animal. I have applied healing tinctures to the wound, and remarkably it appears to be closing. I'll need to watch Rolbert closely to see if there are any adverse effects.\nPixot Gane: Another strange wound, this one along the left side of the neck and down the back. It appears to be a combination of bites and scratches, but the soldier claims he doesn't remember how the wounds were inflicted. He &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;burns with fever&lt;/a&gt;, and nothing I have provided has yet to alleviate his discomfort.\nVivie Donze: This soldier received a shallow cut across her right side and should be capable of returning to duty immediately. However, she claims that the wound burns and her stomach hurts. Is she faking these symptoms or did I miss something in my examination?\nI must also report that I was apparently hurt as well, though I don't remember how. I discovered a deep scratch along my left arm, as though something with long, sharp nails drew a line down my arm. The cut isn't that serious, which is why I haven't informed &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Fairfax\"&gt;Lieutenant Fairfax&lt;/a&gt; as yet, but it does burn. And I find myself unusually hungry, although food doesn't appeal to me."}

Although sometimes you can buy them from alchemists.\"\nAs mentioned, taproot can be either bought from an &lt;a href=\"Alchemists%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; or obtained from the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;. The unmarked &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Nirnroot%20Island\"&gt;Giant Nirnroot Island&lt;/a&gt; is a convenient location to obtain taproot as it is home to three leveled spriggans.\nOnce they have been obtained, proceed to the &lt;a href=\"Headwaters%20of%20Harstrad\"&gt;Headwaters of Harstrad&lt;/a&gt;. Another spriggan lives in this small cave, but once it has been killed activate the headwaters to soak the taproot. Once this has been done, return to Elynea. She will keep two of the &lt;a href=\"Soaked%20Taproot\"&gt;Soaked Taproot&lt;/a&gt; and request that the other be planted in the withered interior wall of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;.\nTravel up the tower and plant the Taproot into the large dark bulge on the wall. Return to Elynea, who replies \"Good. Now maybe Neloth will get off my back about it.\" and grants a reward. This completes the quest. Elynea rewards the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; with two leveled &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Well-being\"&gt;Potions of Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;. These potions restore a certain amount of Health, Magicka and Stamina. The potency of potion that is received is based on &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt;."}

I have agreed to help the Wyresses in Jackdaw Cove toward this end.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"Destroying%20the%20Dark%20Witnesses\"&gt;Destroying the Dark Witnesses&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Freyda\"&gt;Wyress Freyda&lt;/a&gt; will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Uela\"&gt;Uela&lt;/a&gt; is here, but that her wards are weakening Wyrd magic. She will task you with destroying the Reachmen totems, alongside her sister &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Rashan\"&gt;Wyress Rashan&lt;/a&gt;. She will call Rashan to her after you are done talking. \nRachan is the wolf. Speak with her and she will say she will help you destroy the totems. The first totem is to your north, unguarded in a circle of fences. Destroy it, then head west for the second totem, which will be west of the crossroads among similar fences. South of this totem is &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Shannia\"&gt;Wyress Shannia&lt;/a&gt;, who will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Spriggan\"&gt;The Last Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;.\" That quest takes place in the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously. Either way, head further west and you will find the third totem, though there will be many Reachmen and &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurchers&lt;/a&gt; in your way. Once all of the totems are gone, speak with Wyress Rashan and she will confirm that the magic is returning to the forest. She will tell you to meet her by the old tower to deal with Uela. After you are done talking, a &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Crow\"&gt;Strange Crow&lt;/a&gt; will appear to act as Uela's spokesperson. She will warn you that only the crows can find out her location, and they will never help you. \nHead to the tower and speak with Rashan. She will be in her human form now. She will tell you that Uela has taken control of the crows' physical forms, and that their spirits can only watch from the &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Realm\"&gt;nature realm&lt;/a&gt; what happens to their bodies. She will then use her forest magic to bring you into the nature realm in the form of a wolf, so that you may speak with the crows.\nThe Vestige must then talk to several &lt;a href=\"Crow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crows&lt;/a&gt;. The first one approached will have the following to say:\n\"Must be nice to be able to travel between this realm and the physical realm. I'm stuck here. Yes. I'm stuck here.\"\nThe second crow will say:\n\"A wolf tried to eat me once, you know. Just because we're in the nature realm, you think we can be friends now? Maybe. Did that Hagraven trap your spirit here as well?\"\nThe third crow will finish:\n\"We can dispense with the small talk. I know why you're here. Even in the nature realm, news travels fast among crows. Getting to Uela is impossible though. Even if you break her wards, entering her domain will corrupt your soul.\"\nWith this information, head to the island tower in the south. There, speak with Wyress Rashan and she will tell you that she is going to need you to return with Uela's heart so that she can perform the ritual to cleanse the forest. When you are done talking, she will return to the physical realm to break the ward on the door. Head in. You will no longer be in wolf form; rather you will return to being your normal self. Head along the path to the big room, where Uela will be waiting. She is hostile and will put up quite a fight, but once she is dead, you should take out her heart and then talk to the crow at the entrance.\nWhen Uela is dead, the crow will remark:\n\"Freedom. Freedom at last! And Uela dead. Dead!\"\nWhen Uela is killed, the crow will also say \"You killed her. You freed us. Haha!\"\nAfter talking to the crow, head outside and speak with Wyress Rashan. She will tell you that Uela's death prompted infighting among the Reachmen, allowing the wyresses to easily dispose of them. She will then ask you to do the honours of partaking in the ritual to cleanse the land. The wyresses will create a ritual circie; throw Uela's heart into it and the forest will be cleared of the Reachmen's vines. Talk to Rashan after this to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Parley\"&gt;The Parley&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Its most prominent appearance was during . The Heart of Lorkhan is known to be the &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; Stone of the Red Mountain.\nHistory.\nDawn Era.\nFollowing the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s heart was taken from him as a punishment for his creating the mortal plane. Not all myths state this is a punishment. Several &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; were said to have tried to destroy the heart, but could not, so it was cast down into the depths of Nirn, never meant to be found. It landed in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, forming a large &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; that would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Era.\nSometime in the First Era, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; discovered the heart while excavating under &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, the Chief &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt; and High Priest of the Dwemer began to experiment with the Heart. He created three tools: &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; to work with the heart. He would soon order the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, a massive mechanical golem. He hoped to use the Heart as a power source for extracting the divine power from the Heart and in the experiments for improving the Dwemer race.\nThis plan was interrupted by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, his generals (&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;), and an army of &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. Nerevar and Dagoth fought the Dwemer king and Kagrenac in the heart chamber beneath Red Mountain. When the Dwemer were bested in combat, Kagrenac used the tools on the heart, and the entire Dwemer race &lt;a href=\"Disappearance%20of%20the%20Dwarves\"&gt;vanished&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother account stated that King &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected as &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;'s avatar and amassed an army comprising of &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the Heart of Lorkhan, which to the Nords was considered the Heart of Shor. In the climactic battle at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Wulfharth had obtained the Heart but needed time to acclimate to its power. During this time, he and Voryn Dagoth faced Nerevar and his two companions, &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;. Wulfharth blinded Alandro Sul with a shout and slew Dumac, but was weakened by a blow from Dumac's warhammer, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;. Neravar took the opportunity to finish Wulfharth off and slay him with a surprise side attack with &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;. With Keening, Nerevar cut out Wulfharth's heart.\nNerevar entrusted the tools to Voryn Dagoth (who had requested that the tools be destroyed) and met with his other generals. They agreed to keep the tools but to not use them. In some accounts of this event, Nerevar then dies of his wounds from the battle with the Dwemer. Upon returning to the heart chamber, those who return discover that Voryn Dagoth had gone mad and refused to relinquish the tools, stating the Nerevar had commanded him to keep them from falling into the wrong hands. In the ensuing battle (by some accounts involving Nerevar), Dagoth was driven away, forced to surrender the artifacts.\nThis turn of events concerned Nerevar and he decided to ask the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; for guidance. However, his generals murdered him during the ritual. Azura still came and cursed the Tribunal for their crimes, claiming that she would use her powers to resurrect Nerevar. She then changed the Chimer into the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; used the Tools on the heart and became living gods; they did many great deeds for their people. Since their deeds worked against the evil nature of the heart, they needed to return to it from time to time to rejuvenate their powers. At some later point, they discovered that Voryn Dagoth (now styling himself as Dagoth Ur) yet lived and had connected himself directly to the heart's power. He drove them away, and on subsequent attempts to recover the heart chamber for themselves, they lost control of Keening and Sunder to him and barely escaped alive, supposedly due to the quick actions of Vivec.\nOver time, the Tribunal became weaker and weaker, whilst Dagoth Ur became stronger still. They disappeared from public view, and their influence faded. Their sole attempt at restraining Dagoth Ur (the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;) consumed much of their remaining power and was largely ineffective at containing the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;. They also could not prevent Dagoth Ur's forces from flying or tunneling past the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTowards the end of the Third Era, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; came face to face with his old ally and broke him. However, while sustained by the heart, Dagoth Ur could not truly die. By using the tools &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; on the heart again, without a proper ritual, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; freed the Heart from its bindings, and is believed to have caused its destruction. This enabled the Nerevarine to officially slay Dagoth Ur and destroy his great weapon, &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Heart is briefly mentioned during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;.\" When &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt; discovers a Dwemer Lockbox brought in by the sudden flood in &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, he believes the Lockbox contains the Heart of Lorkhan. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; found an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; and inscribed the encryption into a &lt;a href=\"Lexicon\"&gt;Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;. The Elder Scroll and its knowledge was apparently held in &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;. The quest may only be started by meeting Septimus Signus at his &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27s%20Outpost\"&gt;outpost&lt;/a&gt; north of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Upon completion of the quest the Dragonborn and Septimus Signus discovered the Lockbox does not contain the Heart but instead the &lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Heart was also mentioned as being requested by &lt;a href=\"Wylandriah\"&gt;Wylandriah&lt;/a&gt; in her letter to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Although the College did not possess the Heart, experimentation similar to that of Kagrenac was indeed going on in the College, performed by &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt;. However, Arniel was only using an &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;approximate model&lt;/a&gt; of the Heart made from a soul gem.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, there were stones of unknown origin known as &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone%20Deposit\"&gt;Heart Stones&lt;/a&gt; that appeared after the eruption of Red Mountain, suggesting they may be somehow related to the Heart.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Citadels%20of%20the%20Sixth%20House\"&gt;The Citadels of the Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; is equipped, attack the heart until it loses its power.\n&lt;a href=\"Discerning%20the%20Transmundane\"&gt;Discerning the Transmundane&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt; believes the heart to be located inside the Dwemer contraption within &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27%20Outpost\"&gt;his outpost&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is true that in the heart of the forest there is a magnificent tree, through which courses the metaphorical lifeblood of Valenwood. But to say that the tree is the heart is to vastly limit one's understanding of the Heart.\nIn truth, the Heart is more akin to the forest's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;. The magnificent tree is just the physical symbol of that soul, but like a soul in the body, the Heart is not in one place in the body, but suffused through the entire thing.\nStill, it's been apparent to anyone who wished to look that the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; site of &lt;a href=\"Hectahame\"&gt;Hectahame&lt;/a&gt; holds immense power, far outstripping the rest of Valenwood. As a consequence, that particular location is often referred to in older texts as the \"Heart of Valenwood\" and has become the target of numerous plots to harness that power for purposes both good and ill.\nOne of the earliest of these plots while the Ayleids first came to Valenwood. A &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; (his cursed name long lost to history) invaded Valenwood with an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army, and perverted the life-giving power of the heart to raise up a formidable force of undead Ayleid spirits. The Ayleids fought a long and protracted battle to defeat the army, but in the end they were unable to defeat the army, only contain it.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;welkynd stones&lt;/a&gt;, the Ayleids created powerful necromantic wards to seal off Hectahame, and the once great city became a prison for the army that had sought to conquer it. The undead were returned to the ground and trapped there. None who have attempted to break the wards have managed, and it is speculated that only an object that could cancel magic itself could undo the Ayleids' incredible handiwork.\nBut it is because of the powerful wards on Hectahame that the Heart of Valenwood is little understood and rarely spoken of. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; view Hectahame with a mix of superstition and awe, fearing the ancient past and revering the life-giving power that seems to emanate from within.\nIt is said that the last Wood Elf to enter Hectahame and behold the heart was a &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; from over two hundred years ago. But even accounts from that time suggest that he was viewed as mad by his contemporaries."}

She also has something else to tell you, but she will not tell you in front of her assistants, so she will ask you to follow her to the other side of the room. She will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Ukaezai\"&gt;Ukaezai&lt;/a&gt; is known for controlling the minds of others, and that she suspects hes is controlling the mind of &lt;a href=\"Tedryni\"&gt;Tedryni&lt;/a&gt;. She will run some tests on Tedryni while you and &lt;a href=\"Behelir\"&gt;Behelir&lt;/a&gt; investigate the Hall of Might. \nHead into the Hall of Might, on the east side of the ruins.

First is \"Remnants of Cyrod\", second is \"Keeper of Tomes\" and last is \"The Black Year\". \nThis will reveal the way into the reliquary.

She will grab the Heart and flee; pursue her through the ruins until you run into Laranalda. Speaking with her is optional; she will tell you that if Ukaezai has the Heart of Anumaril, she can use it to restore her spirit to her body. Ukaezai headed through the door ahead; head through and continue your pursuit. In here, you will find Ukaezai's spirit reconnecting with her body; confront her and she will cause the ceiling to collapse. When you come to, you will find the Heart of Anumaril lying on the ground next to you. Pick it up, then head south to the central room to confront Ukaezai; there is a passage in the southwest of the room you are in. At several points in the fight, Ukaezai will turn into fractured energy, which you will have to absorb with the Heart of Anumaril. \nOnce Ukaezai has been slain, head outside and speak with Laranalda to finish the quest."}

It has a temperate climate, with frequent rain and thunderstorms.\nAll of the Cyrodiil's &lt;a href=\"roads\"&gt;roads&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;) meet in the Heartlands, joining the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt; like spokes in a wheel.

Heavy Armor provides the most protection in the game. At the start of the game, Heavy Armor can heavily encumber a player, but once they get the skill perks all that goes away. Heavy Armor is just one of the three Endurance boosting skills which go great together.\nTraining.\nOne way to speed level one's Heavy Armor skill is to gather a group of low level &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;, adjust the difficulty slider to the lowest possible, and observe while the creatures attack them. Rats don't wield weapons so they don't have the problems caused by characters weapons breaking, four rats can be found in &lt;a href=\"Arvena%20Thelas\"&gt;Arvena Thelas&lt;/a&gt;'s house in Anvil.\n&lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bandit archers&lt;/a&gt; are also convenient when they are forced into close &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. While they do not cause much damage, their high rate of attack lets the Heavy Armor skill level very quickly. In either case it is advisable to have a few potions of healing on hand to restore oneself. While one's armor will become damaged and eventually destroyed, they will continue to gain skill points as long as they let them attack.\nAs mentioned in the article about light armor, one can travel to &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hackdirt&lt;/a&gt; and enter the underground caverns through any of the houses and there will be 5 men with clubs who attack on sight. If one cannot find Hackdirt then go to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Arena\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt;, battle through to the end and then fight the animals as the champion. Another good place to train is &lt;a href=\"Derelict%20Mine\"&gt;Derelict Mine&lt;/a&gt; tunnels (the area with the goblin war chief). One could have as many as 10 or more goblins attacking them at once. But make sure to kill the goblin archers and take their bows, since they will end up killing the other goblins."}

Heavy Armor skill is raised by the use of certain kinds of armor that the in-game character can equip. Heavy armor typically weighs more than &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt;, injuring speed and &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;carrying capacity&lt;/a&gt; at the offset of added protection. Penalties to speed and carrying capacity can be countered using &lt;a href=\"The%20Steed%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Steed Stone&lt;/a&gt;, consuming &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Potions of Carry Weight&lt;/a&gt;, or using the Conditioning perk.\nLeveling.\nLeveling up armor skills is relatively simple: take physical damage in combat while wearing armor pieces of that type. To level up the Heavy Armor skill most efficiently, wear a full set of Heavy Armor (head, hands, feet, chest). The rate of skill gain is based on the total amount of damage incoming before armor is applied. Thus, taking multiple attacks from a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; levels heavy armor at a significantly slower rate than blows from &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mammoths&lt;/a&gt; would. Being the victim of power attacks likewise grants more experience than a standard attack. Conversely increasing armor rating does not decrease the rate at which the skill advances.\nOne can rapidly level up the skill simply by finding an enemy (or group of enemies) which uses physical attacks and allowing them to attack without attacking back. &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; are useful in this regard, as they have low health yet can do enough damage, especially the larger varieties. &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; magic and &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;healing potions&lt;/a&gt; can be used to restore any damage taken (thus one can also level up the Restoration skill simultaneously). If you have a shield of the appropriate armor type, one can also upgrade the &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; skill as well during this process. Taking on larger groups and/or more powerful enemies will level the skill(s) faster, but one has to balance their ability to restore their own health against the amount of damage they will be taking.\nTo level up the skill in complete safety, especially at low levels, one can find a &lt;a href=\"Brawling\"&gt;brawl&lt;/a&gt; opponent willing to brawl repeatedly without charging a wager - usually during a quest such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Hired%20Muscle\"&gt;Hired Muscle&lt;/a&gt;\" quest often dispensed near the beginning of the Companions questline or the \"&lt;a href=\"Taking%20Care%20of%20Business\"&gt;Taking Care of Business&lt;/a&gt;\" quest for the Thieves Guild.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Heavy Armor skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Heavy Armor Skill:\nDamage reduction.\nArmor increases the Dragonborn's armor rating, which decreases how much physical damage is dealt to them. The maximum damage reduction is capped at 80%, which is achieved:\nPerks.\nThe following are the &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available to select as the skill is leveled up.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTraining.\nLeveling up armor skills is relatively simple: take physical damage in combat while wearing armor pieces of that type.

Heimlyn serves as a fortress to the Great House Telvanni, and because of this, Heimlyn is heavily fortified, and it looks over northern Stonefalls. It has only one entrance in the north, and upon entering, you are greeted with the town square and surrounding homes. Advancing more inward is the inner temple that leads to the Reliquary.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in the Stonefalls region of Morrowind. The Covenant was able to besiege the city of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and was able to conquer &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant raided various settlements throughout Zabamat, and this included Heimlyn Keep. The Keep was under the control of House Telvanni, who was neutral in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; and did not associate with the Ebonheart Pact, whatsoever. The Covenant was not aware of this and attacked Heimlyn Keep with ferocity. This triggered a defense mechanism created by the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and ancient spirits drove away from the Covenant and took control of Heimlyn Keep and its citizens.\nA mysterious traveler that was known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; arrived into Heimlyn Keep and was asked by &lt;a href=\"Beron%20Telvanni\"&gt;Beron Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; to help Heimlyn Keep and to disable the reliquary. The Vestige traversed the Keep and disabled the Daedric Ruins set forth by the Chimer. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Vildras\"&gt;Keeper Vildras&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige entered the reliquary and defeated the spirit guarding the inner sanctum. The battle to beat the Daggerfall Covenant moved northwards in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"General%20Serien\"&gt;General Serien&lt;/a&gt; and his army is stationed.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the Heimlyn Keep township existed in Morrowind in between the towns of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oaktown\"&gt;Oaktown&lt;/a&gt;.

If you seek knowledge about mighty Talos, you have most certainly come to the right person. In mortal life, Talos was a Nord possessed of unmatched tactical skill, limitless wisdom and the power to see into men's hearts. Talos mastered the power of the Voice, and with it he united the lands of men into a great Empire. In southern lands, he was known by the name Tiber Septim. Here in Skyrim, we honor him by his proper Nord name. So great was his reign in life, when he ascended to the heavens he was made lord of the Divines. If you want to know more, I'm sure you can find any number of tomes on the subject.\"\nSermon.\nDuring the day, Heimskr can be found under the statue of Talos giving a passionate sermon to the passing townsfolk:\nTalos the mighty! Talos the unerring! Talos the unassailable! To you we give praise!\nWe are but maggots, writhing in the filth of our own corruption! While you have ascended from the dung of mortality, and now walk among the stars!\nBut you were once man! Aye! And as man, you said, \"Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter. I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.\" \nAye, love. Love! Even as man, great Talos cherished us. For he saw in us, in each of us, the future of Skyrim! The future of Tamriel!\nAnd there it is, friends! The ugly truth! We are the children of man! Talos is the true god of man! Ascended from flesh, to rule the realm of spirit!\nThe very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!\nToday, they take away your faith. But what of tomorrow? What then? Do the elves take your homes? Your businesses? Your children? Your very lives?\nAnd what does the Empire do? Nothing! Nay, worse than nothing! The Imperial machine enforces the will of the Thalmor! Against its own people!\nSo rise up! Rise up, children of the Empire! Rise up, Stormcloaks! Embrace the word of mighty Talos, he who is both man and Divine!\nFor we are the children of man! And we shall inherit both the heavens and the earth! And we, not the Elves or their toadies, will rule Skyrim! Forever!\nTerrible and powerful Talos! We, your unworthy servants, give praise! For only through your grace and benevolence may we truly reach enlightenment!\nAnd deserve our praise you do, for we are one! Ere you ascended and the Eight became Nine, you walked among us, great Talos, not as god, but as man!\nTrust in me, Whiterun! Trust in Heimskr! For I am the chosen of Talos! I alone have been anointed by the Ninth to spread his holy word!"}

Our gleaming city is filled with scholars, but do any of them think to come down to ole Slag Town to help the poor, tarnished masses? Course not.\nSometimes I help the little ones learn their letters, between jobs. They're the only ones who give me the time of day. But I know soon they'll be off with jobs of their own, and they won't have time to listen to their dear old deputy natter on about vowels and verbs.

And no, we certainly ain't deserving of our lot. Don't you go listening to them up in that shining city, those scholars who think they're so far above us. We got the kind of smarts that gets you out of close calls. Guts aplenty, cunning to spare. You don't survive long without something driving you.\nOh, sure, there's a way out. Muster up enough magic, show some technical know-how, and there you go. Had me an aunt who was real keyed in with machines, just somehow everything lined up in her head. She would take apart automatons and put them back together, just by looking at its guts. Wasn't long before she was whisked away, never to return. My mum received not one visit, not even a single letter. Once you leave the Slag, you don't look back, and who could really blame them? Not much of a sight.\nSometimes I envy the &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;factotums&lt;/a&gt;. All they need is a quick windup and some sort of instruction, and off they go! I'd rather that some days, then the dreary path I'm walking. Barely enough to eat, living off the so-called charity of those who think they're better than us. Enough to make you sick. Enough to make you want to leave it all behind, but where do you go? Ain't nowhere to go. Not the city, not the wastelands that surround us. You sit in the muck and you try to get by."}

If you are that prey, too bad for you! But grab hold of the tail and the senche-tiger does exactly as you want, so long as your grip remains firm.\nIn theory one could lead a senche-tiger about by its tail forever, but Azmu-ra does not recommend it. Senches are quite fast, very strong, and entirely capable of holding a grudge! Much better to sieze the mind, but how to do this?\nFirst understand that, like &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, the senche-tigers have a powerful sweet tooth. They also have fine noses and will track &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon-sugar&lt;/a&gt; down wherever it hides. In pockets, through walls, in the bellies of close friends\u2014anywhere.\nFortunately, the senche-tiger's appetite for sugar is only so great. By keeping your senche-tiger on a steady diet, you can manage its more aggressive desires with more useful pursuits, like &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;-catching. You need only know how much moon-sugar is enough moon-sugar.\nThis is where it gets tricky. The senche sweet tooth waxes and wanes with the moons, starting with the phase under which it was born and ending with its lunar opposites. Size is a factor, also, as larger senche require more moon-sugar!\nSome trainers can determine a senche-tiger's appetite for moon-sugar by consulting the local Two Moons, but Azmu-ra does not recommend this. A priestess is not always on hand, and keeping both the temple and your senche supplied with moon-sugar is an expensive proposition!\nAlso, senche-tigers grow swiftly. Unless fully grown, their appetites will change. Many would-be trainers have little time to regret a low stock of moon-sugar! The resulting carnage is never pretty.\nBetter to keep a stockpile of moon-sugar on hand. The senche eats until sated, and what is left can be used to ice the sweet roll, spice the pudding, or make delectable moon candy.\nOnce full of moon-sugar, a senche-tiger wants only two things: meat to fill its belly and a sunny place to bask. This makes them suited to guarding fields and hunting game, but this is about all they can do without years of training. Even then, training can only go so far.\nFor example, motivating senches to pull farming equipment is not recommended. If your senche-tiger should deign to endure the harness, it will still be inclined to chase anything larger than a field mouse that it spots across the fields. Save yourself the trouble of collecting scattered plows!\nWhile other trainers have had some success with watch-senche and battle-senche, Azmu-ra would strongly discourage training them to eat people unless you are strong and good at fighting. Even then, this one would not recommend it. A senche-tiger's loyalty reaches only so far as its belly, yes?\nHopefully this guide helped you avoid being eaten by your favorite senche-tiger. If not, well \u2026 Azmu-ra made no promises!"}

The Urshilaku shall name you Nerevarine, but you must concern yourself with the other tribes: the meek Ahemmusa, the wily &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainab&lt;/a&gt;, and the war-loving Erabenimsun. They may not be so quick in naming the Nerevarine as the Urshilaku.\"\"(After completing the Fifth Trial during \"&lt;a href=\"Hortator%20and%20Nerevarine\"&gt;Hortator and Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;\") \"Thus are joined the four tribes of the Ashlanders under one leader, [PC Name], the Nerevarine. Ahemmusa, Zainab, Erabenimsun, and Urshilaku, together, will hunt the creatures of Dagoth Ur.\"\nFourth Trial:\"The Fourth Trial is to join the three Great Houses of Vvardenfell under one Hortator. You must be named Hortator in turn by House Redoran, House Hlaalu, and House Telvanni. I know little of the ways of the Great Houses. But first I would try the Redoran, for they are warriors, hard-willed, but straightforward. Then I'd try the Hlaalu, for though they are weak and spoiled, they are cunning and crafty. Save the Telvanni for last. Anyone who is not afraid of a 2000-year-old wizard is a fool.\"(After completing the Fourth Trial during \"Hortator and Nerevarine\") \"You have fulfilled the Fourth Trial of the prophecy of the Seven Visions. You are Hortator of all three Great Houses, Redoran, Hlaalu, and Telvanni. So I greet you, [PC Name], Hortator and Nerevarine.\"\nHouse Hlaalu: \"The khans of the Great Houses are called 'councilors.' The khans of House Hlaalu meet in a place on a river far away. They call the place 'Balmora' -- 'stonewood' in our speech. You must find these councilors and persuade them to name you Hortator. I can tell you nothing about these people. You must go there and learn for yourself.\"\nHouse Redoran: \"The khans of the Great Houses are called 'councilors.' The khans of House Redoran meet in a great crab shell in a place called Ald'ruhn. You must find these councilors and persuade them to name you Hortator. I know little of the settled people. You must go there and learn for yourself.\"\nHouse Telvanni: \"The khans of the Great Houses are called 'councilors.' The khans of House Telvanni meet in a very strange place, I'm told. They call it 'Sadrith Mora,' which means 'forest of the mushrooms' in our tongue. I have heard the Telvanni live in giant mushrooms. I'm sure it is a very bad place. But you must go and find their councilors and persuade them to name you Hortator.\"\ninitiation rite:\"To be adopted into the tribe, you must undergo a harrowing. In a harrowing, you will be judged by the spirits and ancestors to see if you are worthy. Go to the Urshilaku Burial Caverns and fetch me Sul-Senipul's Bonebiter Bow. Sul-Senipul was my father, and his spirit guards his bonemold long bow deep in the burial caverns. Return to me with this bow, and I will adopt you into the Ashlander tribes as a Clanfriend.\"(When spoken to again, without the Bonebiter Bow) \"Until you bring me the Bonebiter Bow, you may not go before Nibani Maesa to be tested for the Nerevarine prophecies.\"(After acquiring the Bonebiter Bow) \"This is my father's Bonebiter Bow. You have completed the initiation rite. I name you [PC Name], Clanfriend of the Ashlanders. Keep my father's bow, and bear it with honor. You are a friend of our tribe, and may rest in any Urshilaku bed, but do not harm other tribe members, or take their things. And now I will fulfill my other promise. Go to the wise woman's yurt, and Nibani Maesa shall examine you, and test you against the Nerevarine prophecies.\"(After completing the rite) \"You have already completed the initiation rite.\"\nMoon-and-Star: \"You wear the Moon-and-Star of Nerevar. The legend of Moon-and-Star is known to all loremasters. No man but Nerevar may wear that ring and live. This is a true sign. This is a miracle, a blessing of Azura, and no man may deny it.\"\nmy trade: \"I do not like to boast, but my people call me a champion, a noble warrior of the Ashlanders. I have the duty of protecting the honor of the tribe in peace and war.\"\nnaming the Nerevarine: \"For you to fulfill the prophecy and unite the four tribes, you must be named as the Nerevarine by each of the four Vvardenfell tribes. When you tell your story to the ashkhan of each tribe, and show them your proofs, he should acknowledge you as Nerevarine on behalf of his tribe. But it may not be so simple. An ashkhan may take the opportunity to extract a favor or service from you. Or the Erabenimsun may not be so ready to accept an outlander as Nerevarine.\"\nThird Trial:\"You have entered the path of the Nerevarine. This is a hard thing to believe. But Nibani Maesa has spoken to me at length of this, and I have had time to consider. Therefore I shall keep my own counsel, and set before you my own test. I do not dispute with the wise women, but their ways are not the ways of the warrior. Many before have tried the path of the Nerevarine, but all have failed the warrior's test. You must have strength, courage, and cunning. These things I would test.\"\n(When spoken to again, before acquiring all three tokens) \"When you bring me the three tokens from the ruins of Kogoruhn, I shall tell you the secret of the Third Trial.\"(After bringing him the three tokens) \"I am impressed. These three tokens you have brought me. You may keep them. You have passed the Warrior's Test. And I will give you the secret of the Third Trial. 'In caverns dark Azura's eye sees/and makes to shine the moon and star.' This is the Third Vision. And you must go to the Cavern of the Incarnate, a place sacred to Azura, and look for the moon and star. The secret of the Cavern of the Incarnate is set in a riddle:\"\n(When spoken to again, before completing the Third Trial during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20the%20Incarnate\"&gt;The Path of the Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;\") \"Seek the Third Trial in the Cavern of the Incarnate. You have my blessing, and the blessing of the tribe.\"(After completing the Third Trial during \"The Path of the Incarnate\")\"So? You have faced the Third Trial in the Cavern of the Incarnate? Tell me what you saw and heard there. [He listens carefully, with no sign of his feelings.] It is as Nibani Maesa says. Perhaps you are the chosen one. We shall see.\"\nthoughtful gift: (If &lt;a href=\"Zallay%20Subaddamael\"&gt;Zallay Subaddamael&lt;/a&gt; is dead) \"This outcast ashlander you have killed, Zallay Subaddamael, betrayed Urshilaku hospitality and killed the husband of our trader Kurapli. I had promised her justice, and my failure to obtain it for her has troubled me. This gift pleases me, and does you honor.\"\nZainab: \"\"The wily Zainab of the Grazelands are proud, arrogant, and greedy, and none more than their Ashkhan &lt;a href=\"Kaushad\"&gt;Kaushad&lt;/a&gt;. But they are likable rogues, strong and self-assured. Show them you are strong and proud. Satisfy their greed and pride. The Ashlanders of &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainab camp&lt;/a&gt; are clever and cunning, and you, too, must be clever and cunning to outwit them.\"\nZainab camp: \"Zainab Camp is in northeast Vvardenfell, southwest of &lt;a href=\"Vos%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt; village, in the rolling plains of the Grazelands. Here. Let me mark it on your map. Head southwest from Vos across the Grazelands until you strike the foothills, then head south, keeping the foothills on your right. When you pass the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20ruins\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nchuleft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nchuleft&lt;/a&gt; on the western edge of the Grazelands, you'll cross an east-west road; Zainab Camp is eight or ten yurts east of the hills and south of that road.\"\""}

She offers to help storm the prison, as &lt;a href=\"Foolkillers%20Clan\"&gt;her clan&lt;/a&gt; suffered defeat at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Warden%20Dusk\"&gt;Lord Warden&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrisoners can be freed along the way using the cell levers to earn an achievement. Head into the dungeon to meet the &lt;a href=\"Overfiend\"&gt;Overfiend&lt;/a&gt;, who will be accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"Harvester\"&gt;Harvester&lt;/a&gt; at low health.\nThe next boss is &lt;a href=\"Ibomez%20the%20Flesh%20Sculptor\"&gt;Ibomez the Flesh Sculptor&lt;/a&gt;, who will summon prisoners into the pool in the center at each quarter of his remaining health. They will turn into &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;flesh atronachs&lt;/a&gt; if not defeated quickly. The prisoners can be quickly dispatched with flesh grenades that Ibomez throws around. The boss also takes reduced damage while the prisoners are present. All atronachs, including the one that accompanies him at the beginning, should be killed quickly as they will deal increasingly heavy damage. Finally, the boss will fear the party and stun a random player \u2014 a teammate must &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt; his charged attack to prevent instant death.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gravelight%20Sentry\"&gt;Gravelight Sentry&lt;/a&gt; now needs to be dispatched. Next, the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Abomination%20%28Imperial%20City%29\"&gt;Flesh Abomination&lt;/a&gt; must be killed, which summons large &lt;a href=\"Necrotic%20Hoarvor\"&gt;Necrotic Hoarvor&lt;/a&gt;s. Ranged AoE attacks are helpful here to avoid the poison pools and explosions.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord-Warden%27s%20Council\"&gt;Lord-Warden's Council&lt;/a&gt;, a group of four &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn\"&gt;Xivkyn&lt;/a&gt;, stand guard in the area with traps. They will be immune to damage while any Bone Totems are present.\nFinally, Lyranth and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; confront Lord Warden Dusk. He will periodically split into four &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;s, which must all be killed. Portals will appear on the floor, which will send anyone they touch high into the air, and will likely die from fall damage if the \"Brace For Impact\" &lt;a href=\"synergy\"&gt;synergy&lt;/a&gt; isn't used. Note that using the portals are necessary to avoid his channeled Darklight Burst attack, although he may not use this attack if defeated quickly enough.\nWith the warden defeated, Lyranth captures his &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; anima, just as he did to her clan."}

It takes up the entire northwestern portion of its parenting province, the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and is the largest of the three islands. The capital of the province, &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, can be found here. The island is overrun with red, pink and vibrant green trees, as well as numerous rocky cliffs, while its cities can commonly be found on Summerset's long coastlines. The architecture of Summerset's cities includes pointy spires and white walls.\nBackground.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;, Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, is the ruling monarch over all of the Summerset Isles, the capital of the Dominion is instead situated in the &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;. As Ayrenn is often far from Summerset's shores, her cousin, &lt;a href=\"Proxy%20Queen%20Alwinarwe\"&gt;Proxy Queen Alwinarwe&lt;/a&gt;, administers the province from Alinor in her stead. For much of its history, outsiders were not allowed to enter Summerset without explicit permission, but in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Ayrenn issued a degree allowing free entry to any who wished to make the voyage, much to the chagrin of the island's nobility.\nCoinciding with the Queen's decree, a triad of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; conspired to invade Summerset to their own ends after attacks in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. The Daedric forces, allied with &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Sload\"&gt;Sea Sload&lt;/a&gt;, began forming &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Geysers\"&gt;Abyssal Geysers&lt;/a&gt; across the island and enacting their plan for domination. The Daedric forces comprised of the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bedlam\"&gt;Court of Bedlam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yaghra\"&gt;Yaghra&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Sloads and would perpetrate attacks across the island against its people and the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Summerset and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nSummerset features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20War\"&gt;Daedric War&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and carries on from the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Summerset. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nEighteen Skyshards can be found in Summerset totaling in six &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Summerset and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The province is home to the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i people. The islands were considered part of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Tamrielic Empire&lt;/a&gt;, although they reside in the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople.\nThe Altmer.\nThe Altmer, also known as High Elves and Salache/Saliache, are a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; that are native to the Summerset Isles.\nThe Altmer are among the tallest of the humanoid races; taller than humans and even the other mer races. Their skin maintains a very pale golden hue, not quite the pale white of the northern human races such as &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, but far lighter than the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. On average, Altmer are of smaller build than humans, and thus generally not as strong. Their tall stature also makes them less agile than their Bosmeri cousins. However, Altmer are among the most intelligent and magically-inclined races on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin and first settlements.\nSummerset Isles is the traditional home of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, or High Elves, and the possible first landing place of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; arriving from their ancient homeland. The Altmeri people are directly bred from the Aldmeri people before they died off. The Altmer of the lands have allowed little in the way of exploration of their own, beyond the capital of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; by Ambassadors of the Second Empire of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, travel into the Isles has been more frequent, as &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, forced it into the Third Empire, but most of the Isle is still unknown. It is also noted that &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship in the Summerset Isle is quite prevalent.\nFirst and Second Eras.\nAlthough the circumstances are unclear, the Summerset Isles were incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; in the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this however, all outsiders aside from Imperial Emissaries and traders were prohibited from traveling to the isles, and these few were only allowed in the capital of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eric%20of%20Guis\"&gt;Eric of Guis&lt;/a&gt;, the personal ambassador of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt;, noted that while the Altmer reliably paid Imperial tithes, they did so to minimize human contact rather than out of fear of war.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, Queen &lt;a href=\"Ayrenn\"&gt;Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; joined with &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; to oppose the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;. Many Altmer opposed this, as they saw it as a threat to the purity of their isles and a betrayal of Altmer values. As Queen Ayrenn was often away from the isles to deal with issues in other parts of the Dominion, she appointed her cousin &lt;a href=\"Proxy%20Queen%20Alwinarwe\"&gt;Alwinarewe&lt;/a&gt; as a Proxy Queen to rule Summerset Isles in her absence. However, the Dominion ultimately failed in their endeavor to rule Tamriel and was later dissolved.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20830\"&gt;2E 830&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer intervened in Valenwood because of a dynastic dispute, and they formed the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; sent peace delegations to the king of Alinor early on. The Altmer were very resistant to the taint of humanity on their isles and merely accommodated Reman on their own account, and Septim knew that conquering the isles in totality would have been next to impossible. However, Tiber Septim received the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and used it to invade Alinor and forced them to surrender within an hour, an event remembered by many Altmer with horror.\nThird Era.\nIn the last years of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Summerset Isle had been at peace with its neighbors, save a near war with the Empire over trade tariffs. On a cultural level, however, the upheaval of Tiber's conquest was not resolved, resulting in several extremist movements emerging within Summerset's political and cultural landscape.\nFourth Era.\nXenophobia.\nFor thousands of years, the Altmer have implicitly believed in their superiority to all other races and cultures in Tamriel. But after the incorporation of Summerset Isle into the Empire, doubts began to creep in. With the insularity of the Summerset decisively broken, many Altmer, particularly the young, began to take a more critical view of the rigid hierarchy of Altmer society and its strict cultural xenophobia. While there had always been discontent on the fringes of Altmer society, which was traditionally resolved by the exile of the malcontents, for the first time a significant element of Altmer began to agitate for social change.\nThis nascent revolution in the Summerset Isle has taken many forms. Most apparent is the acceptance of new cultures and races onto its shores, some occupying positions that would have been forbidden just a century ago. The Queen of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is the Dunmer Morgiah, daughter of Barenziah and sister of the King of Morrowind, Helseth. Her children, Goranthir and Rinnala, though half-Altmer, are fully Dunmer in appearance, and stand to inherit the throne.\nA more radical side of this movement, however, is exhibited by a shadowy group who call themselves the Beautiful. Originally a salon for artists with the philosophy that Summerset must let go of its past in order to move forward, the Beautiful became a revolutionary group dedicated to the destruction of the greatest monuments of Altmer civilization. The Crystal Tower was naturally an early target, but while attempts against it have failed, many other ancient sculptures and emblems of the past have been vandalized. Since, the Beautiful have turned their attention to living symbols of the Isle, the royalty of Summerset. The particularly gruesome murder of the daughter of the King of Shimmerene has horrified and outraged the public.\nFinally, some of the Summerset's youth continue to rebel against their present, ironically, by embracing their past. The Imperial Geographical Society is not allowed to visit the isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; to survey and document it, but there is little doubt that the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; is increasingly popular among the young, and is willing to exploit this. Over the past thousand years, only seventeen new initiates were brought into the order. In the past two years, however, another thirty have joined. Thirty new members of an Order may not be enough to be considered a surprising trend in most circles, but to the tradition-bound graycloaks of Artaeum, it raises many questions. What is the Psijics' aim in this recent recruitment, however, is anyone's guess at this time.\nThe Great War.\nAfter the political chaos of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; declared war against the Empire, nearly destroying it. However, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; surrendered to the Dominion, signing a treaty known as the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. The treaty, which heavily favored the Aldmeri Dominion, outlaws worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; throughout the Empire, allows the Thalmor free movement throughout the Empire and authority to apprehend anyone worshiping the outlawed god. The province was renamed Alinor, in honor of the isles' capital, during this period by the Thalmor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; and its base, the Isle of Artaeum, disappeared from Tamriel during this period. Despite this sudden disappearance, their influence as a group continues to be felt by many practitioners of magic in the present through certain visions and premonitions of the future. These sporadic appearances would later aid the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; during their work with the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; mentions after a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; victory during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; that an invasion of the Summerset Isles resides in the near future for the Nords.\nPolitics.\nThe Summerset Isles forms part of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the union of Valenwood, the Summerset Isles and the client states of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt;). Prior to the coup d'\u00e9tat in &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;, the isles were ruled by a monarch, who, after the isles\u2019 assimilation into the Cyrodilic Empire was subordinate to the Emperor.\nThe aforementioned coup d'\u00e9tat was orchestrated by the nationalist political party known as the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; who've since ruled over the islands as well as the Dominion. The party takes its name from ruling party of the First Aldmeri Dominion, made up of Altmeri Canonreeves, Bosmeri Treethanes, and a handful of Khajiiti Chieftains, who served as the ruling party in the Dominion as well as the diplomatic corps, a para-military unit and the Committee of Alliance Relations.\nThe Thalmor handle all processes of government and project their nationalist dogma through these channels. It is unclear whether the Thalmor serve as the \"inner-sanctum\" of the Dominion, or as a sort of oligarchy class of aristocrats and warlocks. However the Thalmor are generally regarded as the established elite thanks to their magicka affinity genetically predisposed in the Altmeri race. It is also known that the second most powerful governor of the Isles, and one of the most powerful sorcerers in Tamriel, is the Arcane Arch-Magister, the leader of the great &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Aldmeri Dominion.\nRise to power, 4E 22.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer organization that would become the Thalmor were little more than a loud mouthed fringe group mocked openly by Altmeri society. In the waning years of the Third Era, they led numerous boycotts of Imperial goods.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; began opening all over Tamriel, the Summerset Isles were thrown into anarchy. Refugees were slaughtered by the thousands. Those who tried to flee by boat found the Daedra had conjured storms to prevent escape and were cut down on the wharves and docks. Many were forced into the raging sea and drowned. Towards the end of what would become forever known as \"The Oblivion Crisis,\" only the legendary Crystal Tower of the High Elves stood fast against the Daedric hordes. It was there they made their last stand, in the ensuing battle the Altmer Sorcerers and Archers killed so many Daedra that they scaled the walls over mounds of their own dead. It was not enough however, and the Crystal Tower fell, literally torn asunder by Daedric machines. In those final moments, the hordes of Daedra vanished completely.\nThough many disputed the Thalmor's miraculous claims, one by one they had their reputations ruined by Thalmor perpetuated rumors and were exiled. Those who continued, even in exile were often assassinated. One such famous example was the great seer-mage &lt;a href=\"Rynandor%20the%20Bold\"&gt;Rynandor the Bold&lt;/a&gt;. He had commanded the defense of the Crystal Tower, and was considered a great hero of the Oblivion Crisis. Rynandor was quickly assassinated aboard a ship bound for Anvil thereafter.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;, in the wake of the Oblivion Crisis and the resulting &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the government of the Summerset Isles, a monarchy of which formed a part of the Tamrielic Empire was buckling under the pressure exerted by an angry populace. Many people felt cheated by this foreign power; they stood without the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; and were victims of the increasing corruption of the administrative powers left to control the province all while the tax collectors ran the peoples pockets dry, all to cater for the needs of others far away. They overthrew the rightful Kings and Queens of the Altmer in a violent uprising. Then the first of many pogroms descended on Summerset Isle. They slaughtered any who were not \"of the blood of the Aldmer\" as well as many remaining dissidents.\nContinental expansion, 4E 29\u2013100.\nThe Thalmor, following the steps of the Altmeri before them, soon infecting that of neighboring &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, spreading their nationalistic ideas to the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i peoples. As with the Summerset Isles, the Empire did not concern themselves with the territory, they had more pressing matters to attend to. By &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;, the Thalmor had gathered enough support to challenge the government of Valenwood, of which was swiftly overthrown, leading to Valenwood becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and cutting all ties with the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;The Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; constituted a two-year period in the Fourth Era (&lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"4E%20100\"&gt;4E 100&lt;/a&gt;), during which the two moons of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, disappeared. Given the significance of the moons to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, there was large panic and unrest amongst them. The Khajiit religion is based loosely on the moons, as it determines the birth patterns of the Khajiit race. When the moons did return, the Thalmor took credit, claiming to have used previously undiscovered Mythic Magics, and the Khajiit considered them their saviors, causing a massive decline in &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; influence in the region. A coup then overthrew the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt;, creating the two kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt;, which the Aldmeri Dominion accepted as client states.\nThe Great War and the White-Gold Concordat, 4E 171\u2013175.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, tensions between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion reached a breaking point as the Thalmor denounced the Empire and ordered them to cease espionage, halt militarization and cede a vast amount of land in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; amongst other demands lest they provoke war. The Empire resisted, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; between the Third Aldmeri Dominion and the remnants of the Empire of Tamriel began.\nBoth &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; were attacked quickly and much to the Empire's surprise, from Elsweyr. The Thalmor moved quickly, taking the city of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and besieging &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. Hammerfell was disorganized and ravaged by civil conflict, and the southern coast was quickly taken, driving the Empire north across the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt;, all of the Southern coast of Hammerfell was in Aldmeri hands, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, which was besieged and later taken - as was &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Aldmeri forces in Hammerfell were severely weakened by their victory and the subsequent advance into the Alik'r; and was withdrawn and focused on Cyrodiil. Both Bravil and &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; fell to the Aldmeri, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; became the centre-point of the Great War. After a climactic battle, the Imperial City fell to the Aldmeri Dominion.\nBy &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire focused the amassed strength of all of its forces on retaking the Imperial City. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmeri force in Cyrodiil was destroyed and for a while it appeared that the Empire had won. However, it soon came to their attention that the heavy losses at the Battle of the Red Ring had pushed the Empire's forces beyond continuing the war. A treaty was negotiated which ceded parts of Hammerfell to the Aldmeri Dominion and allowed the Thalmor the ability to outlaw &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship throughout the Empire. This was called the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, and was a catalyst for both of the subsequent rebellions in Hammerfell and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, whose cultures suffered directly as a result of the treaty, much to the amusement of the Thalmor.\nAftermath and Dominion Superiority, 4E 176\u20134E 201.\nThe Thalmor invaded &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; of the Mede Dynasty. This conflict ended in the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, which among other things criminalized the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Tiber Septim's god-form&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly thereafter, the Dominion sent the Thalmor to intervene in both &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, empowered by their wish for total rule of Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; was signed in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, twenty years before the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim, ending the war in Hammerfell. Prior to the Dragon Crisis, the influence of the Thalmor in Skyrim is unclear. It is known that the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;'s support for either the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial loyalists&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Nordic nationalists&lt;/a&gt; changed the tide of the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; present there.\nReligion.\nThe Altmeri religion is a very interesting one due to its mix of culture, heroes, Aedra, and Daedra. Their chief gods are Auri-El, Trinimac, Magnus, Syrabane, Y'ffre, Xarxes, Mara, Stendarr, and Phynaster. Doom Drum, or Lorkhan, is their devil figure.\nNotable locations.\nAlinor.\nThe of the Isle, Alinor, has been described by human traders as \"made from glass or insect wings.\" Other accounts, by diplomats of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, say that it is \"a hypnotic swirl of ramparts and impossibly high towers, designed to catch the light of the sun and break it to its component colors, which lie draped across its stones until you are thankful for nightfall.\" The province of the Summerset Isles was named after its capital city by the Thalmor during the forming of the Third Aldmeri Dominion.\nCrystal Tower.\nA monument to the spirit of the elven people. Within the glittering walls of the Tower are housed the graves of the early Aldmeri settlers, preserved forever as a lasting symbol of the power of the people for that brief moment in history, fully unified.\nFirsthold.\nThe largest city in Auridon and the second largest city in the province. Firsthold is a City built upon the cliffs of the Vafe Region in Auridon and with Waterways built from the Diceto River. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; High Kinlady Estre made a deal with Mehrunes Dagon and summoned Four Oblivion Gates to wreak havoc onto the city until she was assassinated by the Soulless One.\nSkywatch.\nA port city in the east of the Summerset Isles. In &lt;a href=\"1E%201301\"&gt;1E 1301&lt;/a&gt;, the city was &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Skywatch\"&gt;sieged&lt;/a&gt; by the Sloads during their invasion on the High Elves' homeland.\nIslands.\nMajor Islands.\nIsle of Summerset.\nThe Isle of Summerset, also informally called \"the mainland\" or the \"big island,\" is the largest island in the archipelago where a majority of its population and resources are located. The Crystal Tower resides on the island, as well as many of the larger cities.\nAuridon.\nAuridon is the second largest island in the Summerset Isles. The cities of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt; are located here. Auridon is also where High King Torinaan landed when leaving &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtaeum.\nArtaeum is the third largest island in the Summerset Isles. It is home to the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient monastic order that has existed for millennia. The island has a tendency to disappear off the face of Nirn.\nMinor Islands.\nEyevea.\nEyevea is a small island located northwest in the Summerset Isles. It was settled by &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; in the Second Era to be a safe haven for Mages from the troubles of war. &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; once tricked Shalidor into giving up the island as part of the Shivering Isles, but it was later returned in the Second Era.\nErrinorne.\nErrinorne Isle is located off the eastern coast of Skywatch and Auridon. It is used as a shipping complex and a warehouse for incoming ships to Skywatch. The Sload used the Island as a base for the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Skywatch\"&gt;Sack of Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuraniim.\nBuraniim is an isolated island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Mathiisen\"&gt;Mathiisen&lt;/a&gt;, it was once the central hub for &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; commerce before becoming abandoned by their descendants. A large ruin exists on the island.\nSilatar.\nSilatar is an island far from the Isle of Summerset. It was created by an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Aranias\"&gt;Aranias&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Rock Witch of Silatar,\" who was recorded to have strange magic that allowed her to pull the island from the sea. The island has been abandoned for a long time.\nDranil Kir.\nThe Isle of Dranil Kir is a mysterious island covered by storms off the coast of Auridon, that was once inhabited by the Psijic Order. It housed the Psijic Obscuros, a powerful scrying device."}

Speak to &lt;a href=\"Torsten%20Cruel-Sea\"&gt;Torsten Cruel-Sea&lt;/a&gt;, who will request the return of the silver locket that was taken from his daughter &lt;a href=\"Fjotli%20Cruel-Sea\"&gt;Fjotli's&lt;/a&gt; corpse.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Niranye\"&gt;Niranye&lt;/a&gt; for more information. With a high enough &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill, she can be Persuaded to cooperate, but if this fails, she must be fought. Intimidating her is a more reliable option. Otherwise, the Dragonborn will need \"leverage\" to get her to talk, which can be found in the form of two notes in her house from &lt;a href=\"Linwe\"&gt;Linwe&lt;/a&gt;. To find the notes, enter &lt;a href=\"Niranye%27s%20House\"&gt;Niranye's House&lt;/a&gt;. The south wall of the dining area is a false panel. Open it, descend the stairs, pick a master lock to enter her basement. Once in the basement, find Niranye's safe, pick another expert lock, and retrieve Linwe's notes.\nReturn to Niranye, and she will instantly become cooperative, fearful of her own life, explaining that she had to cooperate with the rival guild to save her own neck as she used to fence for the Thieves Guild, but when Linwe and his group showed up, they forced her to fence for them or be killed if she refused. She then asks to be spared as she would return to fencing for the Thieves Guild once Linwe and his crew were eliminated. Due to the Thieves Guild's code with not killing anyone during their jobs, the Dragonborn spares Niranye, who asks that the Dragonborn return so they can discuss her rejoining the Thieves Guild as one of their fences to restore their influence in Windhelm after Linwe is terminated.\nAfter getting the location, go to the guild's headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Uttering%20Hills%20Cave\"&gt;Uttering Hills Cave&lt;/a&gt;. The goal is to kill the group's leader Linwe and retrieve &lt;a href=\"Fjotli%27s%20Silver%20Locket\"&gt;Fjotli's Silver Locket&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering the cave tunnels, there will be a fork with left and right paths. Taking the right path will avoid two &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Shadows%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Summerset Shadows&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the tunnel. High-&lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; characters can also sneak past the thieves if taking the left path. Killing the Summerset Shadows only earns minor loot as their armor cannot be stripped from them, but their weapons can.\nThe locket is found on Linwe's corpse, along with &lt;a href=\"Linwe%27s%20Armor%20Set\"&gt;Linwe's Armor&lt;/a&gt;, which is a unique set of armor similar in appearance to what some Thieves Guild members wear, such as &lt;a href=\"Tonilia\"&gt;Tonilia&lt;/a&gt;.\nBurning the flag.\nIn order to accomplish the extra objective, the Summerset Shadows' banner must be burned. To complete this, simply use a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; on the banner, e.g. &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;) or the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;. After that, watch the banner slowly burn up until it has been completely incinerated and nothing is left.\nReturn to Torsten to finish the quest. Afterwards, upon returning to the Ragged Flagon to tell Delvin of the special job being completed, he will be very impressed, as now the Thieves Guild is regaining influence in Skyrim; a merchant moves back into one of the niches outside The Ragged Flagon."}

The wait time between uses of this shout is five minutes.\nDuring the first three summonings, Durnehviir will fly into the sky after teaching the Dragonborn the \"Soul Tear\" word; however, he will return to engage in combat during the duration of the shout. \nDurnehviir can be summoned inside buildings, much like many other creatures from the &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; school of magic.\nAcquisition.\nDurnehviir initially teaches the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; all three &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Power\"&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; of the shout during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Death\"&gt;Beyond Death&lt;/a&gt;.\" Unlike other shouts, all three Words of Power must be unlocked with &lt;a href=\"dragon%20soul\"&gt;dragon soul&lt;/a&gt;s before the shout can be used. Unlocking the first word, for example, results in the Dragonborn shouting \"Dur,\" but nothing else happens. After unlocking the third word, the Dragonborn may successfully summon Durnehviir by fully using all three words of the shout and aiming at the ground. If combat is in progress, will not appear. \nThe miscellaneous quest \"Learn the first word of Durnehviir's shout\" is actually referring to &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Tear%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Tear&lt;/a&gt;, an entirely different shout that Durnehviir will teach to the Dragonborn, one word at a time, during his first three summonings."}

Once a slave of House Telvanni, Sun-in-Shadow remains in history as the only Argonian member of House Telvanni, rising to the rank of Oathman and acquiring property that became &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSun-in-Shadow was born into slavery under &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, just like her parents before her. Before she was able to pick up the broom, she studied in the arcane arts and spellcrafting. She grew up in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, meeting with other Argonian slaves, including &lt;a href=\"Eoki\"&gt;Eoki&lt;/a&gt;, whom she fell in love with. As time went on, Sun-in-Shadow had garnered the attention of &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Therana\"&gt;Magister Therana&lt;/a&gt;, having more potential than other aspiring Telvanni mages. Knowing this, Sun-in-Shadow hatched a plan where she would rise through the ranks of House Telvanni until she can free slaves. On a fateful day in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Sun-in-Shadow encountered an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Outlander&lt;/a&gt;, who held the potential of carrying out the mission. The Argonian slave sent the Outlander to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zaintiraris%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zaintiraris&lt;/a&gt;, to retrieve the finger bone of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Felms\"&gt;St. Felms&lt;/a&gt; and bring it to Therana at her new home, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;. With the bone given, Magister Therana created an endorsement that was given to the Telvanni Council in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Sun-in-Shadow was freed from slavery and became a hireling of House Telvanni. Though her journey didn't end here.\nNow that she was a hireling, she sought out a piece of property for a new Telvanni tower located on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Vos\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt;. Though the deed was taken by a Telvanni wizard named &lt;a href=\"Jinrisa\"&gt;Jinrisa&lt;/a&gt;, though it was stolen and taken to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Firuth\"&gt;Master Firuth&lt;/a&gt;, who was originally looking for the land. When the Outlander visited Firuth at &lt;a href=\"Hanud\"&gt;Hanud&lt;/a&gt;, the Telvanni Master gave Sun-in-Shadow the endorsement for the land and sponsored her elevation to Retainer. It was at the point, Sun-in-Shadow had become a Retainer of House Telvanni and acquired property that would eventually become &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;. After becoming Retainer, she quickly submitted a petition for to become an Oathman and both she and the Outlander were brought before the Council quickly. Unfortunately, Archmagister &lt;a href=\"Gothren\"&gt;Gothren&lt;/a&gt; had forbidden any more progress for Sun-in-Shadow, prompting both the Argonian and the Outlander to convene with Gothren at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore meeting with Gothren, the Outlander spoke with &lt;a href=\"Ralasa%20Delvi\"&gt;Ralasa Delvi&lt;/a&gt;, the Mouth of Archmagister Gothren, who told them that Gothren had opposed any more petitions, believing that &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; are not allowed among the Telvanni. With that in mind, the Outlander and Sun-in-Shadow travel to Tel Aruhn, where they meet &lt;a href=\"Arith%20Sendrul\"&gt;Arith Sendrul&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant of Gothren. The three convene with each other and come up with a plan to make Sendrul, Gothren's mouth. If they retrieved stolen relics from escaped slaves that left for &lt;a href=\"Shashpilamat\"&gt;Shashpilamat&lt;/a&gt;, then it will get them closer to their goal. As the Outlander found the slave, Ralasa's people had followed them, taking the slaves, opposing the Outlander's intentions. Because of this, Sun-in-Shadow would send the Outlander to assassinate Ralasa Delvi, since it is common among the Telvanni. Delvi would be killed, either through the Outlander's hand or poisoned &lt;a href=\"Marshmerrow\"&gt;Marshmerrow&lt;/a&gt; cake. Regardless, Sendrul was promoted to Mouth of Gothren and Sun-in-Shadow was able to become an Oathman, but Gothren himself did not take this lightly, whatsoever.\nMagister Gothren had ordered his henchmen to kidnap Sun-in-Shadow from her home in Sadrith Mora. Because of this, Gothren blackmailed the Outlander to get information on &lt;a href=\"Nelos%20Otheri\"&gt;Nelos Otheri&lt;/a&gt;, the Archmagister of Sadrith Mora. The Outlander stole his journal from the tower of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt;, even taking Otheri's Dwarven Prism from the &lt;a href=\"Zalkin-Sul%20Egg%20Mine\"&gt;Zalkin-Sul Egg Mine&lt;/a&gt;, which connects to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mzanchend\"&gt;Mzanchend&lt;/a&gt;. With these items in his grasp, Sun-in-Shadow was released from Gothren's hold. But she enters a crossroad, whether she must continue her endeavor as a Telvanni Oathman or continue her relationship with &lt;a href=\"Eoki\"&gt;Eoki&lt;/a&gt;, the love of her life. Eoki stormed out of her home, accusing her of abandoning their fellow Argonian slaves. Behind the scenes, Eoki has been in contact with the &lt;a href=\"Ropefish%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Ropefish&lt;/a&gt;, an abolitionist group that operates in Vvardenfell. As the Outlander made contact with &lt;a href=\"Atarga\"&gt;Atarga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lagdabash\"&gt;Lagdabash&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Inn\"&gt;Gateway Inn&lt;/a&gt;, their plan of taking the Argonians out of Vvardenfell was going successfully. Eoki and the Outlander travel to &lt;a href=\"Vassamsi%20Grotto\"&gt;Vassamsi Grotto&lt;/a&gt; where they met with the Ropefish and the Argonian slaves. Though, they were followed by Sun-in-Shadow and &lt;a href=\"Slavemaster%20Arenim\"&gt;Slavemaster Arenim&lt;/a&gt;, with a brigand of guards. In the Outlander was able to defeat Arenim, but the fate of Eoki is unknown. Sun-in-Shadow remained an Oathman of House Telvanni, but Eoki was either kept as her slave or had escaped to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nAs of now, Sun-in-Shadow is the only non-Dunmer and former slave that became an Oathman of House Telvanni. The property that she occupied near Vos would become the tower of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the other Magisters in House Telvanni, she has sympathy for the lesser races of Tamriel, which becomes a trend of Tel Vos owners, as seen with &lt;a href=\"Aryon\"&gt;Aryon&lt;/a&gt;. Her rise to Oathman goes to show how little the House Telvanni care about other races, considering their mistreatment to the beastfolk and human races. Sun-in-Shadow is a prime example of success, starting from the bottom of the caste, to a substantial level.

They gained most of their power by dealing with Daedra. The family spawned many important political figures, such as &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus' court sorceress, and &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, who has been said to have created the art of &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable members.\nAsliel Direnni.\nAsliel Direnni harkened back to the humble beginnings of Clan Direnni, in the tiny farming village of &lt;a href=\"Tyrigel\"&gt;Tyrigel&lt;/a&gt; on the banks of the &lt;a href=\"River%20Caomus\"&gt;River Caomus&lt;/a&gt; which was then called the Diren, hence the family name. Like all in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; in those days, he was a simple planter of the fields. But while others only grew enough to sustain their immediate kin, even distant cousins of the Dirennis worked together. They would decide as a group which fields were best for wheat, orchard, vine, livestock, or apiary, and thereby always have the best yields of any farm which worked alone, doing the best as it could with what it had. Asliel wrote a book known as \"Compendious Almanac of Reagents,\" and became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; sometime in his life.\nCygnus Direnni.\nKnown as the \"Swan of &lt;a href=\"Tyrigel\"&gt;Tyrigel&lt;/a&gt;,\" Cygnus was the Direnni Clansmen who discovered the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; and claimed them for the Bloodline.\nRaven Direnni.\nThe witch &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, who with her cousins &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Direnni\"&gt;Aiden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain&lt;/a&gt;, brought an end to the tyranny of the latter &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that before the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, she created the art of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;, learning how to bind a soul into a gem and use that to ensorcel all manners of weaponry. Raven created the \"Rules of Eldritch Binding,\" which made the reletively new art of enchanting much easier.\nAiden Direnni.\nThe warrior Aiden Dirreni, who with his lesser known cousins &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain&lt;/a&gt;, brought an end to the tyranny of the latter Alessian Empire. He fought and killed the Alessian Emperor &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt;, who was a military genius and an expert swordsman. He led the Direnni forces to victory at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt;, which effectively ended Alessian power.\nRyain Direnni.\nAlso known as Ryan, Ryain was a battlemage and diplomat who, with his better known cousin Aiden and his lesser known cousin Raven, held back the armies of the Alessian Order. He was responsible for many of the strategies and tactics used against the Alessians. Ryain had conquered lands as far as &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;.\nPelladil Direnni.\nPelladil Direnni was the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; for the first &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; Potentate, &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, during the Second and &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;s. He also was responsible for getting the Potentate's approval for the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Act\"&gt;Guild Act&lt;/a&gt;, without there would not have been all the professional organizations exist today. Pelladil was also known for building the &lt;a href=\"Blackrose%20Prison\"&gt;Blackrose Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nUtheilla Direnni.\nUtheilla Direnni was the wife of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Magnus\"&gt;Emperor Magnus&lt;/a&gt; I and mother of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jolethe%20Septim\"&gt;Jolethe Septim&lt;/a&gt;. She played a role in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Potema\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt; the Wolf Queen during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, and fought with Potema herself on the battlements of the Palace of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nJovron Direnni.\nJovron Direnni was the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; to the court of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; Empress of Tamriel, &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, assisting her in creating peace in a time of turmoil. He later perished while fighting bravely, and was made a saint by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedora Direnni.\nMedora was an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of the Direnni Clan. She lived in &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as the Adamantine Tower. She was the personal sorceress and secret mistress of a former King of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lysandus%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of King Lysandus, the dowager Queen &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Mynisera&lt;/a&gt; banished her from the Daggerfall court. She then went back to her island kingdom, known as the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;. However, her bad luck did not end there. &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, in her madness, cursed the tower, where as a result the tower was then inhabited by liches and vampires alike, which made it a prison for Medora.\nVorian Direnni.\nVorian Direnni was a famous alchemist who was renowned across Tamriel. He was also the author of the famous book \"\"&lt;a href=\"De%20Rerum%20Dirennis\"&gt;De Rerum Dirennis&lt;/a&gt;\".\" For a while, he was an advisor to Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, before he was assassinated, and &lt;a href=\"Ocato%20of%20Firsthold\"&gt;Ocato of Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeregrine Direnni.\nPeregrine fought off the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; invasion of Balfiera during &lt;a href=\"1E%20907\"&gt;1E 907&lt;/a&gt; by merging her very will with the waves of the Iliac Bay. She was also responsible for summoning the first-ever &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20Camel\"&gt;Flame Atronach Camel&lt;/a&gt; as part of her master conjurors test.\nCorvus Direnni.\nCorvus codified the rules of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; and wrote a rare book known as \"Grimoire.\" He also devised and promulgated the standard \"portal\" spells now popularized by the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; (his work was based on the pioneering research of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer known to history as \"The Transmigrant\"), and theorized that the locations of wayshrines on Tamriel correspond to the pattern of stars in the night sky, because &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; is a reflection of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that the wayshrines could be used as a permanent portal network by which one could travel rapidly across Tamriel."}

The Hegemony gained its namesake due to the massive significance of the ruling &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt;, in which controlled the Hegemony throughout its entire duration from their great stronghold on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The Hegemony would collapse in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20498\"&gt;1E 498&lt;/a&gt; with the rapid ascendancy of the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; population.\nBackground.\nThe Direnni Hegemony's authority was for the most part decentralized, with its sworn vassals given a significant amount of autonomy. Feudalistic social castes were widespread throughout the Hegemony, with this method of organization being heavily reflected later on through the ruling families of Breton society. Contrary to earlier beliefs, the Elves of High Rock did not outright enslave the humans of the lands they dominated. Rather, Nedic peoples found within their lands were made subject to the Elven aristocracy and were placed in the lowest levels of the Hegemony's social hierarchy. The low societal standing held by humans saw to it that many of them were forced into servitude, working for their Elven overlords. Due to the Direnni's unorthodox liberal attitude towards fornication with humans, many Elven lords would compete to collect the most attractive human concubines. Laws were eventually established that gave the Elven nobility permission to mate with any human they desired, contributing heavily to the creation of the Breton race.\nHistory.\nWhile some sources state that the Direnni's rise to power began with &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, who, in the early fifth century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, was said to have bought Balfiera and conquered High Rock. The Direnni's influence in the area is in fact much older, finding its earliest roots back in the middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Cygnus%20Direnni\"&gt;Cygnus Direnni&lt;/a&gt; discovered the Adamantine Tower and claimed it for her clan. Since then, the Direnni Clan would become the most prominent noble family within the region. Certain sources seem to imply the Direnni may have conquered the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s of High Rock prior to their settlement of Balfiera, however these may be in reference towards Elves in general. Despite the clan's long history, the Direnni Hegemony itself was not formed until much later. It was only in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20355\"&gt;1E 355&lt;/a&gt; that Clan Direnni managed to consolidate all the other Elven noble families under their rulership through questionable political maneuvers.\nFor years the Elves of High Rock were a large enough economic and military power to hold back the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Elven holdings remained safe from foreign incursion until the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;conquests&lt;/a&gt; of High King &lt;a href=\"Vrage\"&gt;Vrage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20240\"&gt;1E 240&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the annexation of almost the entire region into the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. However, around the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20358\"&gt;1E 358&lt;/a&gt;, only three years after the Elves of High Rock united under the leadership of the Direnni Bloodline, the Hegemony began to push back against the invading Nordic forces in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. This effort was miraculously achieved even while the Nords received committed military aid from the Alessian Empire. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, the unexpected death of High King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; and its subsequent succession crisis erupted Skyrim into the bloody &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, making the Nordic Empire incapable of defending its outlying territories. With the entirety of Skyrim at war with itself, the First Empire of the Nords began to collapse. The Direnni took advantage of this opportune moment and began further reclaiming Elven territories that had been lost to the Nords decades ago. By the year 1E 401, the Hegemony had completely removed all Nordic influence from High Rock. With its neighboring lands still in turmoil, the Direnni Hegemony began its own conquest, seizing large portions of Skyrim and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, stretching as far as &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;. Conflicts with Skyrim would continue long after the War of Succession, with the Direnni Hegemony facing off with the armies of &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; sometime in between the years 1E 461 and &lt;a href=\"1E%20477\"&gt;1E 477&lt;/a&gt;. In the year 1E 477, the Hegemony reached the height of its power, then spanning a fourth of the entire continent.\nThe Direnni Hegemony had greatly benefited from the mass displacement of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s into their territories, fleeing the growing influence of the anti-elven &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;. The Ayleids who began leaving Cyrodiil for Direnni lands as early as &lt;a href=\"1E%20361\"&gt;1E 361&lt;/a&gt;, would come to dramatically bolster the Direnni's military power perhaps even allowing for the Direnni's coinciding expansion. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;, the Alessian Empire suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt;'s widespread &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n revolt. Ryain Direnni, the presiding head of the Direnni Hegemony, saw the defeat as a sign of weakness in the Empire, and took the opportunity to outlaw the Alessian Reform, which had taken root within the Breton population. The emboldened Ryain even began launching assaults on Alessian controlled territories. The Alessian Empire responded to the Direnni aggression with an all out invasion of the Hegemony, eventually culminating in &lt;a href=\"1E%20482\"&gt;1E 482&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt;, where Hoag Merkiller set aside his hatred for the Elves to help defeat the Alessians, resulting in a crushing defeat for the Alessian Order. Though the Hegemony was victorious in its war against the Alessian Empire, the battle was so costly that the Direnni could no longer keep the vast reaches of their kingdom in check. &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; began reconquering the lands of Skyrim that had been lost to the Hegemony in previous wars, and within two decades, Breton nobility began seizing power all across High Rock. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20498\"&gt;1E 498&lt;/a&gt;, the Direnni Hegemony collapsed, with Elven sovereignty diminished to the Isle of Balfiera and a few heavily fortified bastions in the Western Reach. These Elven holdouts in the Western Reach would eventually fall during a bloody uprising of the native &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; population, leaving only Balfiera under Direnni control.\nIt is generally accepted that the Bretons rose to prominence in High Rock through a great widespread rebellion against their Elven masters around &lt;a href=\"1E%20500\"&gt;1E 500&lt;/a&gt;, when the Hegemony was in decline. However, others claim that this event was much less a rebellion and more so a natural process brought about by the waning Direnni power over and already severely over-extended territory. From this historical view, in order to justify their claims to their holdings, the Breton populace began severely vilifying their former masters, causing the Direnni Clan of Balfiera to isolate themselves from the rest of High Rock. The Breton defamation of the Direnni may have led to the creation of myths that the Bretons, rather than gradually take the land from the Direnni, resisted their rulers through rebellion. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; arrived in &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;, Clan Direnni had already fully retreated to their Island holdout of Balfiera. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20907\"&gt;1E 907&lt;/a&gt; The &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; attempted to invade the isle, but failed due to the Direnni's superior magical abilities."}

That the Dwemer disappeared during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; is something of a coincidence; perhaps spurred on by the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and his generals &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;.

It may also explain how Dwemer artifacts do not appear to age, and how much of their machinery (and their &lt;a href=\"Centurion\"&gt;Centurion&lt;/a&gt;s) are still operable today (and in one documented case, how they react at various distances from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere is also mention of how the Dwemer thought it unfashionable for their deities to be less important, less powerful, and less influential, than the other gods of the realm; and thus allowing for a general desire to experiment on the Heart, once discovered.\nThe books themselves have very different purposes in this reasoning. \"Divine Metaphysics\" explains how to create a god through sorcery; \"The Egg of Time\" argues that it is not dangerous to interrupt a link to a divine source of power (which appears to be quite to the contrary, given how the Dwemer vanished so suddenly and almost completely, with Yagrum Bagarn being the last living Dwemer). \"Hanging Gardens\" is little more than a tourist guide of sorts; barely useful beyond its value as help in translating &lt;a href=\"Dwemeris\"&gt;Dwemeris&lt;/a&gt; and other Dwemer books."}

The invasion of Akavir began in 3E 288, and the two invading legions initially met little resistance. Ionith itself was the renamed second city taken in the invasion, and served as the headquarters of the campaign.\nUnable to bring the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; to a decisive battle or establish diplomatic contact, the war dragged on into the winter of 288, which had unusually strong storms, which wiped out much of the Imperial fleet.\nDestruction of the Expeditionary Force.\nDiplomatic contact with the Tsaesci was established during the winter months, and the remainder of the Imperial fleet was dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to secure supplies, along with the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s present in the expeditionary force. The decision was made at this point to not transport part of the Legions present on Akavir (or the Emperor) back to Tamriel, in order to preserve troop morale.\nFollowing a sortie of the legions from Ionith, the Tsaesci are reported to have marched on the town, forcing Uriel to return to Ionith to mount a defensive siege and unable to bring more reinforcements from Tamriel due to continuing storms, held at bay by the Battlemage Corps. The emperor was able to break the siege and bring a remnant of the legions back to the port of Septima to return to Tamriel, but was himself killed commanding the rearguard before reaching the port."}

He's directed me to a Dwarven observatory that supposedly houses an Elder Scroll. He doesn't care about the Scroll itself, but wants me to use some kind of machine there to inscribe a Dwarven lexicon with the Scroll's knowledge and bring it to him.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAlthough this quest can be started at any level, such as during the main quest \"Elder Knowledge,\" the second part involving the harvesting of blood can only be initiated after level 15.\nIt can be started by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt;, a brilliant but mad scholar who has devoted his life to studying the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. He can be found in &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus%27s%20Outpost\"&gt;Septimus Signus's Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, an ice cave north of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. He explains that the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; lockbox buried within the outpost holds \"&lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;the heart&lt;/a&gt;\" and he wishes to access it to learn its secrets.\nWhat brings you to this remote place? \"The ice entombs the heart. The bane of Kagrenac and Dagoth Ur. To harness it is to know. The fundamentals. The Dwemer lockbox hides it from me. The Elder Scrolls gives insight deeper than the deep ones, though. To bring about the opening.\"\nHe gives the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20Sphere\"&gt;Attunement Sphere&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Blank%20Lexicon\"&gt;Blank Lexicon&lt;/a&gt; which must be inscribed with the Dwemer mechanism located within the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt;. The tower can only be accessed via Blackreach, the underground ruins of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer city&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlftand Glacial Ruins.\nThe first step is to travel to the Dwemer ruin of &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, located in the snowy mountains southwest of Winterhold. Enter the Alftand Glacial Ruins and progress through the tunnels of ice. Eventually, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; addict, named &lt;a href=\"J%27darr\"&gt;J'darr&lt;/a&gt;, will attack. His &lt;a href=\"J%27zhar%27s%20Journal\"&gt;brother's journal&lt;/a&gt; reveals that he, along with several others, were members of a failed expedition to the ruins. Proceed through the caves and past two &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven spiders&lt;/a&gt; until the Alftand Animonculory is reached.\nAlftand Animonculory.\nProceed through the ruins and fight past the various &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; that reside here. Several dead members of the failed expedition can be found here. Eventually, the Alftand Cathedral will be reached which grants access to Blackreach.\nThe Alftand Cathedral.\nHead past the traps and Falmer who guard this section. Past a set of double doors opens into a large room patrolled by several enemies. Head through the main gate where two &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurions&lt;/a&gt; can be found. One Centurion lies on the floor inactive, however, the other will awaken when approached. Defeat the Centurion and take the key from its corpse. Proceed to the next gate where a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Umana\"&gt;Umana&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Sulla%20Trebatius\"&gt;Sulla Trebatius&lt;/a&gt; will exchange accusations and then begin to fight. They are the only surviving members of the expedition the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; found while navigating the Dwemer ruins. If either is killed, the survivor will turn and attack the Dragonborn. Once both are dead, Umana's body can be looted for the unique shield, &lt;a href=\"Targe%20of%20the%20Blooded\"&gt;Targe of the Blooded&lt;/a&gt;. This is the only chance to obtain this shield..\nProceed towards the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20mechanism\"&gt;Dwarven mechanism&lt;/a&gt; located in the center of the room. Activate the mechanism with the Attunement Sphere which causes the floor to retract into stairs. Head down the stairs and into Blackreach.\nBlackreach.\nProgress through the vast cavern towards the objective marker, fighting off the various creatures within, which will mostly consist of Falmer. Once the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt; is reached, near the southwest corner of Blackreach, proceed inside and through the corridors to the main room. Head up the spiral stairs until the Dwemer mechanism is reached. Place the Blank Lexicon inside the receptacle and begin the inscription puzzle. While exploring Blackreach, it might be a good idea to unlock the Great Elevators for the Dwemer ruins of Alftand, &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar\"&gt;Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt; to get them marked on the overworld map if one wants an easier way to reenter Blackreach without going through the Dwemer ruins themselves, but expect the elevators to respawn with their gates closed after some time so you have to reopen them from Blackreach.\nLexicon puzzle.\nSolving the puzzle involves pushing four buttons on the podium in a certain order. After the Lexicon is placed on the designated receptacle, the two buttons on the right side will light up.\nTo decipher the code, press the third button from the left a few times until the Lexicon opens and button two lights up. Press the second button from the left twice (until the overhead lenses are seen directing light onto the sphere), then the first button lights up. Press this button to reveal the scroll.\nPick up the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"runed%20lexicon\"&gt;runed lexicon&lt;/a&gt; from the receptacle. Exit the Tower through the door beneath the button console, followed by taking the elevator back up to Skyrim, exiting near where &lt;a href=\"Heljarchen%20Hall\"&gt;Heljarchen Hall&lt;/a&gt; is found, and return to Septimus.\nReturn to Septimus.\nThe next part of this quest is dependent on &lt;a href=\"character%20level\"&gt;character level&lt;/a&gt;. Returning to Septimus at under level 15 will cause him to dismiss the Dragonborn until he has had time to study the Lexicon. When level 15 is reached, he will send a &lt;a href=\"courier\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt; to summon the Dragonborn back to the outpost. If the Dragonborn returns before the required level, Septimus will be found pacing his room. At this stage, he also reveals that he is in the service of Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince of Knowledge.\nTalking to Septimus before level 15:\nI've inscribed the lexicon. \"Give it, quickly. Oh, but the Dwemer had more than even Septimus expected. This will take time to decryptify. Be on your way, and Septimus will find you if he has further need.\"\nWhy are you so eager to open the box? \"The box contains the heart. The essence of a god. I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity. The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.\"\nAfter recieving the &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;:\nYou sent for me? \"Extraordinary. I see it now. The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals. Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remains to bear it. A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them. The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key. Bear you hence this extractor. It will drink the fresh blood of elves. Come when its set is complete.\"\nReturning to Septimus at level 15 or higher will prompt him to begin immediately reading the Lexicon:\nI've inscribed the lexicon. \"Give it, quickly. Extraordinary. I see it now. The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals. Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remains to bear it. A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them. The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer and Orsimer.

I have devoted my life to the Elder Scrolls, but their knowledge is a passing awareness when compared to the encompassing mind of divinity. The Dwemer were the last to touch it. It was thought to have been destroyed by the Nerevarine, but my lord told me otherwise.\"\nAfter studying the Runed Lexicon, he explains that Dwemer blood is needed to open the Dwemer lockbox. Since the Dwemer are , blood from the various &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; races must be collected to create a facsimile. Specifically, the blood of &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;. Septimus then gives the Dragonborn an &lt;a href=\"Essence%20Extractor\"&gt;Essence Extractor&lt;/a&gt; and requests that the blood be collected for him.\nHermaeus Mora's intervention.\nUpon trying to leave the iceberg, Hermaeus Mora confronts the Dragonborn and reveals that as soon as the lockbox is opened, Septimus' usefulness will be over. He then offers the Dragonborn Septimus' position. Responding either way has no discernible consequences.\n\"Come closer. Bask in my presence.\"\nHarvesting blood.\nTo harvest the blood, loot the corpse of a deceased person with the Essence Extractor in the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt;. Blood samples can be acquired from any dead body in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Liar%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;Liar's Retreat&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few locations where all blood types, except Altmer, can be found. If this location is used, then the quickest way to obtain the missing Altmer blood is from the corpse of the Altmer inside the spiked pit trap in &lt;a href=\"Halted%20Stream%20Camp\"&gt;Halted Stream Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The pit trap can be accessed without entering the mine itself, though it is advisable to go through the mine as falling on the spikes from above can kill the Dragonborn instantly.\nOther locations.\nThe following is a list of locations that contain corpses or enemies that can be freely slain and used to harvest blood.\nOpening the lockbox.\nOnce the blood has been harvested, return to Septimus. He enthusiastically asks for the extractor and presses it into his abdomen, injecting the blood into his body.\nI've brought all the blood you require. \"I can almost... hear them. I feel their life energy. Come, I will make the mixture.\"\nHe then approaches the lockbox and the locking mechanism begins to spin. A tunnel-like entrance appears and Septimus runs inside, but much to his dismay he does not find the answers he was looking for.\n\"What is this... it's... it's just a book?! I can see. The world beyond burns in my mind. It's marvelous...\"\nRather than the \"heart of a god,\" all he finds is a pedestal on which the &lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt; sits. Amidst the confusion, he begins to levitate and Hermaeus Mora disintegrates him into a pile of ash.\nApproach the pedestal and take the Oghma Infinium. Upon leaving the chamber, the &lt;a href=\"Wretched%20Abyss\"&gt;Wretched Abyss&lt;/a&gt; appears again as a manifestation of Hermaeus Mora. He greets the Dragonborn as his Champion and an option is presented to agree or disagree with his assertion. Again, either answer has no ramifications.\nAfter the conversation is over the Wretched Abyss dissipates and the quest is completed."}

None of these are pleasant, but they are all controllable if a warrior takes the proper steps. As an accomplished &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; with ten years of experience on the battlefield, I've seen the worst of war camps, and I have developed several methods that lessen the occurrence of common threats to health. If you follow my advice, you will be able to avoid the problems that many soldiering types simply accept as the part of the cost of battle.\nFirst and foremost, it is critical to bathe. Yes, bathe. Truly, there may not be many opportunities to do so, but as soon as it is possible after a day's march or a battle, bathing and applying a salve of &lt;a href=\"Shalk%20Resin\"&gt;shalk resin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Seeds\"&gt;crushed bergamot seeds&lt;/a&gt; have been proven to repel parasites such as toe-borers, grassfleas, and fleshbloats. Anyone who has seen battle knows that soldiers' camps are breeding grounds for such vile creatures, and prevention is surely the best remedy.\nAnother important factor to consider is your environment. In order to avoid several types of discomfort, you must be prepared to do combat with the landscape as well as your enemy. For travel in desert regions, apply a powder of dragon's tongue to prevent chafing. In swamps, use waxes and thoroughly waterproof your boots to prevent fungal assailants. Remember that insects often carry disease, and keep repellant salves and potions to treat common sicknesses handy\u2014don't rely on your superiors to provide them!\nThough my advice will help any soldier or adventurer, I'd like to devote a few words to &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; in particular. Some individuals have negative reactions to leathers, and many never even know their armor may be suspect! I see this particularly with &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Leather\"&gt;netch armor&lt;/a&gt; and leathers crafted from bears or sabre cats native to Skyrim (especially if any fur is present). If you are issued armor and do not have a choice in what to wear, always carry with you a tincture of &lt;a href=\"Elf%20Cup%20Cap\"&gt;elf cup cap&lt;/a&gt; to apply to irritated areas.\nWith just a few simple, inexpensive preparations, you can avoid these lesser horrors of war and focus your energy on combat and marching without distraction. Take care of yourself on the battlefield. If you don't, you're guaranteed a miserable experience that will compound the fatigue of war. Be aware and always be prepared!"}

I sit here now, studying some unearthed &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; artifacts, yet I feel a nagging call to see how the dig is progressing. The other day without thinking, I picked up a shovel and started digging myself. Fortunately, no one seemed to find this unusual, which is a blessing. I'd hate for the Vigilants of Minorne to think that I'd lost my senses!\nAs we dig, we uncover more Nordic ruins and architecture, but have yet to hit the main chamber. Everyday I dream we'll finally reach Ruunvald, and I can't help but reflect on what this will mean to my reputation! My family will be so proud, especially my father, Minorne. He and mother have always been interested in my studies, even if my sister Minorne was not. But I'm most excited to reveal my findings to my colleagues, Minorne and Minorne, and perhaps my mentor Minorne. Oh, won't they all be pleased?\nM. Sidrey"}

Having obtained the package and orders (which Neminda tells the Nerevarine that they should be delivered to &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt;), the Nerevarine must take them to Dorvayn, who will reward the Nerevarine with 500 and her thanks. The Nerevarine may also keep the helm."}

Disposition is based on a number of factors, including &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"personality\"&gt;personality&lt;/a&gt;, reputation, &lt;a href=\"Factions\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; affiliations, and past encounters with that character, their friends, and their enemies. Disposition can also be affected by non-magical abilities related to the &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; or through the use of &lt;a href=\"Charm\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn and , disposition is indicated with a scale from 0 (with the subject really hating the player) to 100 (with the subject really adoring the player). In these games, the player is able to attempt to persuade almost every character in the game.\nThe system works differently in , wherein disposition is indicated with a scale from -4 to +4, with -4 standing arch nemesis and +4 for lover. Another difference is that disposition in \"Skyrim\" is invisible to the player. Disposition in \"Skyrim\" depends entirely on &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;factions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; done, if the person is a merchant, how often the player buys and sells at their store, and more realistically how often they are interacted with.\nDisposition in \"Morrowind\".\nDisposition begins at a set value depending on each character's base value, &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; reactions, as well as other factors.\nInitial disposition in \"Morrowind\" is influenced by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;'s race, global reputation, and the reputation they have within certain factions. The latter affects characters belonging to a faction and factions related to it, be it positively or negatively. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; are strongly opposed by the xenophobic &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;. If the Nerevarine rises within the Mages Guild, characters belonging to House Telvanni will drop in disposition. On the other hand, other characters belonging to other &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; factions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; will like the player more for it. The apparel being worn also has some influence on persuasion. Wearing a full suit of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric Armor&lt;/a&gt; (whose value reaches a total of thousands of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt;) will cause characters to take the player much more seriously compared to wearing &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;cheap clothing&lt;/a&gt;.\nDisposition can then be altered from the initial value through the persuasion menu. This menu can be accessed by pressing \"Persuade\" at the upper left corner of the dialogue menu. When the player attempts to persuade another character, they have the following options:\nUntil the disposition reaches zero, these persuade actions can be performed indefinitely, in particular using Taunt to lower disposition and the others to raise it. This can be used to retry a failed Taunt roll or level in &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers skilled in the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; have access to Charm spells, which influence disposition. &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; spells will raise disposition. The amount raised is equal to the magnitude of the spell. It is possible to purchase or create charm spells potent enough to raise anyone to maximum disposition long enough to sway their buying power, complete a quest, or extract secrets from them. Disposition returns to normal at the expiry of the spell.\nDisposition in \"Oblivion\".\nSpeaking with a character causes the camera to zoom on their face. Once this occurs, clicking the icon with the face opens a screen that shows current disposition and gives access to the persuasion minigame and bribery options. The number in the center of the wheel marks the character's current disposition. From this menu, a minigame can be played which alters the disposition of the character. The Hero is rewarded with skill gains in &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; whether disposition is gained or lost.\nWhile the character's disposition slowly declines, the player must quickly select either a Boast, Joke, Admire or Coerce wedge. Each can only be chosen once each round. One of these actions is Loved, one Liked, one Disliked, and one Hated, as can be seen by the character's facial expressions. This preference does not change. Positive reactions improve disposition and negatives subtract from it. The colored segments rotate clockwise each turn, with larger segments having a greater effect.\nAn important factor in persuading is their facial expression. For example, when speaking to a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, if they do not like the option that the player is about to select, they lower their ears and hiss. Hovering the cursor over the \"Joke\" option causes this response in Khajiit, as many of them do not appreciate humor. Whatever tactics are chosen, the strategy is obviously to minimize losses and maximize gains; matching as closely as possible the actions that lose disposition to the smaller segments, and gains to the larger ones.\nWhen entering the persuasion menu, the player also has the option to bribe a character. Unlike in \"Morrowind\", the player has no choice in how much money will be spent on a bribe. One coin raises disposition by approximately 10 points, depending on the Speechcraft skill; higher levels grant higher bonuses. The amount of disposition granted by each bribe lowers every time it is performed, until the maximum amount of disposition is reached.\nThe player's disposition is also determined by their fame and infamy. Having a high fame will result in characters on the right side of the law liking the player more, while criminal characters will start to dislike the player, while having a high infamy will result in the opposite. Like in \"Morrowind\", a player character skilled in &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; in \"Oblivion\" also has access &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to magically raise a character's disposition.\nHaving a high disposition with a character can cause them to look the other way when stealing. Even better; if the player's disposition with a guard is above 90, he or she will let the player go free after witnessing them committing a crime. This does slightly lower their disposition, but not by much.\nDisposition in \"Skyrim\".\nThe disposition system in \"Skyrim\" is completely overhauled compared to that of \"Morrowind\" and \"Oblivion\". As mentioned before, the 0\u2013100 scale the previous games dealt with are replaced with an invisible scale ranging from -4 to +4. The ranks of this scale are as follows:\nThese ranks are invisible in the game itself and can only be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Kit\"&gt;Creation Kit&lt;/a&gt;. They are used to determine the behavior a character has towards the player. Hostile characters, such as &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, will be designated as -3 Enemy, resulting in them attacking the player on sight. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;married&lt;/a&gt; someone, said character will be raised to +4 Lover, which causes them to treat the player as a loved one in their dialogue.\nWithin the game itself, the disposition is simply indicated by the way the player is treated by the character. A character with good disposition towards the player will, for example, say \"It's a fine day with you around\" whenever the player is near. Characters with high disposition will also allow the player to freely take items from them, with the worth determined by disposition.\nUnlike the previous games, there is also no way to influence disposition through the &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to directly influence disposition is by either helping characters with quests or other favors (including &lt;a href=\"Investor\"&gt;Investing&lt;/a&gt;), resulting in a raise of disposition, or committing violent crimes against them, lowering it. Another difference is that persuasion, intimidation and bribery are only used in a limited amount of scenes and are not influenced by disposition. Only the Speech skill and associated perks seem to influence how good a player is at persuasion."}

They believe that the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; gained their Godhood through treachery towards the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. The Dissident Priests are persecuted by the Temple. They play an important role during the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt; in .\nBackground.\nThe members of the secret order of the Dissident Priests originally belonged to the Tribunal Temple. However, they started to have doubts about several of the Temple's official doctrines. They also think that political interests and love for authority and luxury has corrupted the Temple and many of its higher-ranking officials, which also tarnishes the realization of some of the Temple's fundamental doctrines the Dissident Priests support. The goddess &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;'s change from a warm and motherly to a harsh and unsympathetic patron has also provoked discontent within the Temple and helped the group of the Dissident Priests to form and gain members.\nThe Dissident Priests are persecuted by the Temple, and known members of the order are being imprisoned.\nChallenged doctrines.\nThe Dissident Priests describe the doctrines they challenge and their reasons to do so in their book \"&lt;a href=\"Progress%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Progress of Truth&lt;/a&gt;\". The following is mainly a summary of what can be read there.\nThe Dissident Priests raise questions about the divinity of the Tribunal gods and the source of their power. They fear that the powers of the three \"gods\" might not be divine, but sorcerous. These powers, according to them, might come from the same source as those of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, the Tribunal's arch-enemy.\nSecondly, the Dissident Priests accuse the Tribunal of hiding the truth from the public, a truth that can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Apographa\"&gt;Apographa&lt;/a&gt;, the hidden writing. They doubt the Tribunal's ability to protect &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; from Dagoth Ur and suspect that the true nature of this threat is kept a secret.\nTaking &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; traditions into consideration, the Dissident Priests challenge the Tribunal Temple's official account of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and thus the doctrine of how the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Almsivi&lt;/a&gt; gained their divine status. They doubt this divine status, and propose instead to recognize them as saints.\nLastly, the Dissidents also challenge the authority of the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;. They believe that those authorities are not acting in the interest of the Tribunal but their own.\nActivities.\nThe Dissident Priests seek to find out the truth about events like those surrounding the Battle of Red Mountain, so as to understand better the true nature of the powers of the Tribunal and of those of Dagoth Ur. One part of this is to track down and collect the Apographa, the hidden writings of the Temple usually accessible only to high-ranking members.\nTo reveal incongruities of many of the Temple's official traditions, they perform textual criticism and collation between different traditions of the same events. For example, when talking to &lt;a href=\"Gilvas%20Barelo\"&gt;Master Gilvas Barelo&lt;/a&gt; about \"Nerevar,\" they will give them one copy of each \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Real%20Nerevar\"&gt;The Real Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Nerevar%20Moon-and-Star\"&gt;Nerevar Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Saint%20Nerevar\"&gt;Saint Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;\", thus demonstrating the very different impressions they draw of the historical figure of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, and revealing their sensitivity of observing such contradictoriness arising from different traditions. Also, their book \"Progress of Truth\" points out major discrepancy in the traditions surrounding the Battle of Red Mountain, the death of Nerevar, and the origin of the Tribunal's divinity.\nAnother source for their investigations are the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecies\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecies&lt;/a&gt; and the accounts of Ashlander traditions in general.\nThe Dissident Priest's intellectual efforts result in written texts, \"Progress of Truth\" being one example.\nBooks.\nThe following books originate from within the order of the Dissident Priests:\nOrganization.\nThe Dissident Priests have a spiritual and administrative center in the monastery of Holamayan. The abbot of that monastery and at the same time leader of the order is Master Gilvas Barelo, who can be found within it.\nMembers.\nThe following are known members of the Dissident Priests. Most of them can be encountered within Holamayan Monastery.\nMain quest.\nThe Dissident Priests are a source of information for the Nerevarine during the main quest. &lt;a href=\"Mehra%20Milo\"&gt;Mehra Milo&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple library in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; acts as the main informant. In the second main quest connected with the Dissident Priests, she must be rescued from the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;. After that, the Nerevarine is granted access to the main quarter of the order in Holamayan Monastery. There, Master Barelo gives them texts from the Apographa, which must be brought to the &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman\"&gt;Wise Woman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following main quests involve the Dissident Priests, in the order of their occurrence:\nSources.\nPeople.\nApart from various citizens of Morrowind, who provide information, the following have more specific things to say about the secret order:"}

Divad is the most well known of the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; heroes. &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding's&lt;/a&gt; son, probably the most accomplished &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt; who ever lived. Yet early in his life, Divad appeared to thoroughly have rejected The Way of the Sword.\nDivad was the only son of Frandar Hunding, and was born late in Hunding's life (2396 in the old way of reckoning, probably about &lt;a href=\"1E%20760\"&gt;1E 760&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic calendar), when he was away most of the time fighting the last of his duels and engaging in the many battles and insurrections of the period. At eleven, Divad entered the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Virtues%20of%20War\"&gt;Hall of the Virtues of War&lt;/a&gt; and began training, but at 16, he finally let his anger at growing up essentially fatherless get the better of him. Divad broke his swords and left the Hall to become an acrobat in a traveling circus.\nThe life in the circus was unsatisfying to Divad, and after two years, his innate artisan heritage drove him to become a musician and finally a &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;. For two more years he traveled, singing in the cities of the empire -- gaining no small amount of fame and recognition for his stirring and popular songs and music.\nAlthough Divad had publicly forsaken the Way of the Sword, it would appear that he continued to practice the compulsory forms of training he was taught in the Hall. He carried no sword, but in the late evening, bright lights could be often be seen in his tent (my source says nothing more about this, but it may be assumed that the writer was suggesting that Divad was practicing the form of the Way known as Shehai Shen She Ru -- the Way of the Spirit Sword, or simply the Shehai).\nDivad was very popular with the people of the empire, and his music and concerts were well attended. Still he could not escape his heritage of the sword. When the Last Emperor ascended to power and began to persecute the &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Sword-Singers&lt;/a&gt;, Divad was among the first to attract his attention.\nOnce the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Hira\"&gt;Hira&lt;/a&gt; and his consort decided to go to war with the Singers for control of the empire, he moved swiftly against those Singers who were visibly a part of empire society. Most he had killed, but Divad's music and fame were so wide spread that he sent a team of his personal guards to arrest him.\nThe Emperor's men were either very lucky or very unlucky depending on how you choose to view it. Being no fool, Hira sent 100 of his best guards, for even an unarmed Singer was a very dangerous foe. The luck was that they were able to capture Divad and place him in chains, for they came at him as he sat dining with his elderly mother. The disaster was that as he surrendered, they rashly struck the pleading old woman. Too hard, it would seem, for she fell dead with that single blow.\nThat single thoughtless deed, as is often the case in war, was the one pivotal factor causing their eventual defeat. That act ignited in Divad the spirit of the Way. Up until that careless stroke, Divad was an ordinary artisan, no, an artist, a great artist, but no warrior.\nThe moment of her death, Divad rose from his seat, took his chains between his two hands and began swinging the heavy chain in a deadly arc. He slew four of the guards, gaining enough space to run and dive through the window and into the river. He disappeared into the night.\nFrom that point, Divad was spotted many times and told of in many more rumors all across the empire -- far more places than a mere mortal man could have ever been. At every point where Hira's men gathered to do mischief, the resistance was attributed to Divad.\nAs Hira moved against the Singers and began forming his army to invade High Desert, it was Divad who carried the news to the Singers. Divad was among those who climbed &lt;a href=\"Hattu\"&gt;Hattu&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Hunding\"&gt;Hunding&lt;/a&gt; in his cave. What is not well known is that Hunding, at first refused to take leadership of the Singers. The first attempt to interrupt him at his death poem cause him to drive the elders from his cave, he even formed the Shehai in his anger. It was Divad who reentered the cave alone to speak with Hunding. To this day, no one knows what was said, what happened in that cave. Scribes of the time reported bright flashes of light and angry voices. Five long hours came and went, then both emerged from the cave, Divad, at Hunding's side. The rest, as they say, is history ...\nDivad, who had not completed training in the Hall of the Virtues of War, became an advisor to Hunding and spent his time reading the newly completed &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt;, but his role in the Hammer and Anvil strategy was as a simple Sword-Singer and fighter. It was not till the Singers fled their native empire and landed In &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;New Land&lt;/a&gt; that his story truly begins."}

He refers to them as his \"daughters\" while they call themselves his \"wives,\" but they are in fact his clones.\nBiography.\nFirst Era.\nDivayth Fyr was born in the early\u00a0&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. In his youth as an apprentice, Fyr experimented with &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; on a few corpses, though had a distaste for the art as he grew older. He studied with &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; prior to his &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;apotheosis&lt;/a&gt;, though insisted on not calling him by any of his new titles after his ascent to godhood. Following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disappearance%20of%20the%20Dwarves\"&gt;Disappearance of the Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, Divayth along with the rest of the Chimer became &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. He later studied with the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the isle as a \"sharp-elbowed upstart.\"\nSecond Era.\nIn the later years of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien Chorak&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, Fyr assisted his good friend &lt;a href=\"Morian%20Zenas\"&gt;Morian Zenas&lt;/a&gt; with the transliminal sojourn project, the final goal being a trip into the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. During a visit to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, Fyr attempted to become romantically involved with Zenas' associate, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Alfidia%20Lupus\"&gt;Doctor Alfidia Lupus&lt;/a&gt;, and Lupus later told Fyr that she and Zenas had already eloped. Fyr and Zenas later succeeded in travelling to Oblivion, though only Fyr returned to Tamriel, with Zenas remaining in &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime around the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; and crisis on Vvardenfell, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; granted Fyr membership into their house and gave him the tower of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt; as a gift. In one of his expeditions to the caverns below, a rift leading out from the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; opened into the caves and began to pour out &lt;a href=\"fabricant\"&gt;fabricant&lt;/a&gt;s and other creatures from the city, injuring and killing many who accompanied him. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, the rift was later closed. Fyr also assisted in saving the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; and thwarting &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;'s capture of Sotha Sil, again with the Vestige. Sil later gave Fyr the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping, and Fyr departed, marking the last time he and Sil directly met.\nThird Era.\nThough being one of the oldest and most powerful members of House Telvanni, Divayth often preferred to stay out of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; politics. He showed no interest in joining the Council, but &lt;a href=\"Master%20Aryon\"&gt;Master Aryon&lt;/a&gt; remarked that Fyr was so well respected by the House he could have gotten a seat on the Council by merely asking, and was more powerful than &lt;a href=\"Neloth\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gothren\"&gt;Gothren&lt;/a&gt;. Fyr trained Aryon as his student before Aryon became the owner of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; and elevated to the rank of magister.\nHe cloned himself and created female versions of him,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alfe%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Alfe Fyr&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Beyte%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Beyte Fyr&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Delte%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Delte Fyr&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Uupse%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Uupse Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, apparently using jars and his own flesh. While he calls them his daughters, they call themselves his wives. Divayth Fyr kept an extensive collection of rare items in Corprusarium, claiming that when one gets old, one must have a \"hobby.\" These items included &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifact\"&gt;Daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt; such as the legendary &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0disseminated the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus Disease&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, Divayth Fyr created the Corprusarium within the caverns beneath his home to house victims of Corprus while he worked on finding a cure. The last known living Dwemer, &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, was a close friend of Fyr's and resided in the Corprusarium after contracting &lt;a href=\"the%20Blight\"&gt;the Blight&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; contracted the &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; disease, Fyr gave them an experimental cure after retrieving a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Coherer\"&gt;Dwemer Coherer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Boots%20of%20Flying\"&gt;Dwemer Boots of Flying&lt;/a&gt; for him. The potion was successful, and while not curing Corprus completely, it did remove the adverse effects of the disease.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; fell and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted, causing the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; and subsequent &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Divayth Fyr managed to survive."}

However, the beasts got the best of him, so he fled to draw the Nix-Hounds away from her, while she played dead. He will, then, ask the Nerevarine to help find her.\nIf the Nerevarine wanders directly towards the east, down the hill, a pack of Nix-Hounds may be encountered. After dealing with the pack, beyond the next little hill, eastward, on a slop, stands Flalanu, behind which, Ald'ruhn's &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt; can be seen.\nAfter escorting him back to her, he will thank the Nerevarine, and offer a skill book named \"A Dance in Fire, Book II\"."}

They must make their way over to the Summoning Chamber and wait for Canon Llevule to summon his Ancestor, and proceed to ask her Lord Vivec's questions. Once done, Canon Llevule would want to speak to the Vestige outside. After the conversation, they must head over to Vivec City and go straight to Vivec's Palace. Vivec will talk to the Vestige about their conducted research, and he will ask them to help him perform a divination ritual. The Vestige must then speak to Archcanon Tarvus and help him acquire a Blessing Stone for the ritual by agreeing to rescue several workers from a failed ziggurat construction site. Once this is done, they must return to the palace and perform the ritual. The ritual has an unexpected result, however, and appears to have failed. Speaking to Vivec will grant the Vestige their reward, and they can advance to the next quest."}

Our earliest beliefs were thought to have originated in &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and revolved around the worship of animal totems. These animals\u2014&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hawk\"&gt;Hawk&lt;/a&gt;, She-&lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snake\"&gt;Snake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moth\"&gt;Moth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Owl\"&gt;Owl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Whale\"&gt;Whale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fox%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fox&lt;/a&gt;\u2014seem to correspond to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the Dragon rose to prominence and gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;. It was either during or soon after the move to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; that the Dragon Cult became more malevolent and forced its will throughout the land. It took the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; to overthrow the Dragons and their &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt;, but that's a tale for another time.\nEventually, the animal-totem gods transformed into the eight gods we worship today. We call them by their true names: &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;. We understand that our gods are as cyclical as the world itself, so we also remember the Dead Gods (Shor and &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;) who fought and died to bring about the current world, the Hearth Gods (Kyne, Mara, Dibella, Stuhn, and Jhunal) who watch over the present cycle, and the Twilight God (Alduin) who ushers in the next cycle. Add to these our so-called Testing Gods, who we do not worship but instead guard against to protect the hearth. These include &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; arrived, they brought with them their southern religion and worked to unify the worship of the Eight Divines. That's how we got this wonderful &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt; that graces our fair city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. We agree with the general notion that there are eight gods, more or less, but we view them quite differently and call them by different names. Our temple has adjusted to the needs and desires of the current rulers time and again, yet we have grown used to some of the more prominent Imperial notions and practices even though we no longer find ourselves beholden to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nProbably our biggest difference relates to the head of the pantheon. We Nords consider Kyne as the leader of the gods and find the Imperial fascination with Alduin (who they call &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;) to be both perplexing and mildly disturbing. We work diligently to keep Alduin asleep, while our southern neighbors try time and time again to get his attention! Which is why I begin every service in the temple with a prayer to praise Alduin (oh great god of time!), followed by a prayer to keep him at bay (may your slumber stretch on for a thousand generations!)."}

They were living on the northern side of the island and had domesticated the native &lt;a href=\"Durzog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Durzog&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the time of &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; the Dogeater Clan was lead by the warmongering &lt;a href=\"King%20Demog\"&gt;King Demog&lt;/a&gt;. Goblins held control over a camp south of the &lt;a href=\"Rash%20Merchant%27s%20Plummet\"&gt;Rash Merchant's Plummet&lt;/a&gt;, a large &lt;a href=\"Dogeater%20Goblin%20Camp\"&gt;Dogeater Goblin Camp&lt;/a&gt; north of the &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt; and a small forward camp on the Northeastern coast of the island.\nKing Demog's plans involved and attack on Port Hunding and murder of its inhabitants. However the threat remained unnoticed by the &lt;a href=\"Bhosek%20the%20Bloody\"&gt;Headman Bhosek&lt;/a&gt;, who was in charge of the port.\nAs a result, a couple of &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Gugnir\"&gt;Gugnir&lt;/a&gt; and his brothers\u2014decided to take matters into their own hands. After hiring bodyguards they attempted to murder the Goblin king, but failed. Gugnir was the last surviving member of the party. Luckily, King Demog was slain before the assault on Port Hunding could be realized.\nGoblins of the clan were also used as guardians for the gem rogue &lt;a href=\"Jakarn\"&gt;Jakarn&lt;/a&gt; had stolen from the Headman Bhosek. Jakarn was assured, that the Goblins were too stupid to trade the gem away, but would certainly kill anyone who got close. Recovery of the gem from its hideout resulted in death of the clan member &lt;a href=\"Gornog\"&gt;Gornog&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder effects of his own special brew, a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marq\"&gt;Marq&lt;/a&gt; had successfully integrated among the Goblins. After a leaving the clan, Marq still praised his time among the Goblins, claiming that the food was free and clothing optional."}

The old snake-charmer will recount the events, and how &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;'s soul snare prevents his mother &lt;a href=\"Saban\"&gt;Saban&lt;/a&gt; from completing the Song of Passage required for his soul to pass on to &lt;a href=\"The%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;The Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;. After gaining Coyle confidence, he will explain that normally this task would be quite easy for a powerful witchmother such as herself, but because Hayle was born under the Serpent, his path is unpredictable. Cyrus can learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns\"&gt;constellations&lt;/a&gt;, the Guardians and their Charges, from dialogue with Coyle or from the book \"Ffoulkes Firmament\".\nTraveling to the Observatory, the eccentric &lt;a href=\"bosmer\"&gt;bosmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Erasmo\"&gt;Erasmo&lt;/a&gt; will explain that while he managed to fix the orrey, the telescope remains broken and needs a special gear to function. For information on acquiring the Dwarven Gear, see \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dwarven%20Mines\"&gt;The Dwarven Mines&lt;/a&gt;\".\nReturning to the Observatory with gear in hand, Cyrus will be tasked with going down into the gear room itself and replacing the broken cog. An elevator activated by a rectangular button with take him down. Their are two methods of reaching the far-side: The first is to go to Erasmo's room, turning off the steam, heading south from the elevator, following the walkway straight ahead, climbing up and walking around to the other side, avoiding the red-hot pipe and jumping to the platform below. The second way is to drop down from the gap where the elevator is, dropping down again where the swinging pistons are, jumping on top of the first piston and then jumping to the next piston when it swings around. Carefully position Cyrus on the pistons arm to avoid being knocked off, then turn around and he can easily jump up into the final room.\nWhichever method is chosen, Cyrus should find a slot to insert the gear, which will activate a nearby elevator taking Cyrus up to the orrey floor. With the telescope now functioning, Cyrus can begin his search of the night sky. If Cyrus has read \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Firmament\"&gt;The Firmament&lt;/a&gt;\", he may recognize that &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes are lit up, suggesting that The Serpent is threatening one of his Charges. Starring straight ahead across to &lt;a href=\"The%20Lord\"&gt;The Lord&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrus can maneuver the telescope to observe The Serpent threatening him. Using the wheel on the back of the platform, Cyrus can move the telescope up and down to get the full view. Noting the rune like symbols associated with the signs, the starchart on the Orrey's ceiling is reminiscent of the circle at the Yokudan camp.\nWith this knowledge, Cyrus can return to Saban and is now able to confidently pick up the starstones and adjust their position, though cautiously for if Cyrus leaves the circle at anytime, he will put the stones back where they originally were. With the stones correctly placed where the Serpent constellation appears on the chart, Hayle's soul is finally free from the Sload necromancer's snare and the elderly Yokundan sorceress cheers with joy. Coyle thanks Cyrus and offers their help in anyway that they can. Provided that Cyrus has already fully completed &lt;a href=\"The%20Goblin%20Caves%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Goblin Caves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Recovering%20the%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Recovering the Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;, he can then proceed to the quest &lt;a href=\"Resurrecting%20Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Resurrecting Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOtherwise, he'll need to return later."}

She suspects that Adima is using potions to bring Hosni into a special kind of dreaming sleep and then seduces him inside that dream, using the &lt;a href=\"Dream%20Shard\"&gt;Dream Shard&lt;/a&gt; to do so. She will ask you to find and consume one of those potions so you can enter the dream and save Hosni. She will point you to Hosni's good friend &lt;a href=\"Destane%20the%20Bard\"&gt;Destane the Bard&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point. \nDestane will be in the courtyard. Speak with him, and he will tell you to check the shrine to Vaermina in Hosni's house for the potion. Intimidate him for more information and he will give you a riddle:\n\"if what's right is wrong, then what's left is right\"\nEither way, head into Hosni's house. The shrine should be to your left, around the corner. There are three potions here; you can determine from Destane's riddle that you need to take either the right one or the left one. the right one does nothing; the left one brings you into the dream. There, you will see a dream version of Lady Sirali; speak with her and she will tell you that to free Hosni, you must kill the &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Omen of Blood&lt;/a&gt; that resides somewhere in this dream. \nHead out and you will find yourself in a twisted version of &lt;a href=\"At-Tura%20Estate\"&gt;At-Tura Estate&lt;/a&gt;, filled with Spectres of Bloodlust. Make your way across and you will hear the voices of Hosni, Adima and Hosni's former fiancee &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Safia\"&gt;Sister Safia&lt;/a&gt; reenacting scenes from the past. At the entrance to Hosni's residence, you will encounter a dream version of Lady Adima, who will transform into the Omen of Blood and attack you. The Omen is a powerful &lt;a href=\"Wispmother\"&gt;Wispmother&lt;/a&gt;; she will sommon ice wraiths and split into three when weakened, so take care. Once it's dead, the dream shard will appear; grab it, and a portal will appear leading you back to the waking world. \nBack in the real world, speak with Hosni. He has been cured of his madness; speaking with him will finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Return%20of%20the%20Dream%20Shard\"&gt;The Return of the Dream Shard&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

As with \"&lt;a href=\"Retrieve%20N%27Gasta%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Retrieve N'Gasta's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;,\" the first step is to reach the end of &lt;a href=\"the%20Spine\"&gt;the Spine&lt;/a&gt; and pay the &lt;a href=\"Boatman\"&gt;boatman&lt;/a&gt; his fare to cross the sea. Arriving on the Isle, Cyrus can pass through the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; and make his way directly to &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta%27s%20Tower\"&gt;N'Gasta's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The gate which before was closed will open, the dark worm beckoning the young Redguard to come forth. Entering the Tower, Cyrus faces off against two of N'Gasta's servants; the &lt;a href=\"Vermai%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Vermai&lt;/a&gt;. Their clawing attacks have great reach and do 10 points of damage that cannot be blocked or parried against. However, they in turn cannot defend against Cyrus' attacks and with careful maneuvering can even be tricked into falling into the central pit, killing them instantly. However they are dealt with, Cyrus needs to make his way to the upper level, which will prove difficult given the broken staircase. In one room contains the skeletal remains of some unfortunate victim, but nothing of use. In the other, a room lined with bookcases of necromancer trinkets and tomes, and a pot containing some mysterious yellow liquid. On the table with a large red gem can be found a &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Vial\"&gt;empty glass vial&lt;/a&gt; which Cyrus may take to fill with the elixir. Approaching the central pit, Cyrus may pour the contents of the vial into it, creating an explosive reaction. Backing up and with a well-timed jump, Cyrus can use the eruption to propel himself upwards and onto the staircase. \nThe path is straight forward from here; up. Reaching the final room, the door closes behind Cyrus. Here Iszara can be found, seemingly confined to a lucid state and entirely unresponsive. Suddenly, N'Gasta appears from the ether, cackling wickedly. Here, the dark worm reveals his intentions: that he took Iszara's soul in exchange for resurrecting prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; and gave her over to his patron, the child-god of the Morningstar and the Prince of Bargains, lord Clavicus Vile. However, he reneged on his deal and instead took A'Tor's &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; and fashioned it into an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;amulet&lt;/a&gt; for governor &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Richton&lt;/a&gt;; the very amulet Cyrus delivered to him earlier. With this, the battle begins in earnest. N'Gasta is immune to physical attacks and will teleport around the room casting hostile spells. However, with the Flask of Lillandril, Cyrus can adsorb the necromancer's magic and fling it back at him. After a couple times of doing this, the diabolic &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; will dissolve into a fetid puddle, either to be trapped in his own soul snare or going straight to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to enter &lt;a href=\"The%20Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;Vile's realm&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrus must decipher the cryptic text within N'Gasta's &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta%27s%20Necromancy%20Book\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt; which reads:\n \n\"The jacinth wakes the rising sun.\"\n\"and snow blankets the grass\".\n\"But night o'ertakes the mid-day sky\".\n\"and the gate is opened last.\"\nThe \"jacinth...rising sun\" refers to Amber and &lt;a href=\"Orc%27s%20Blood%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Orc's Blood&lt;/a&gt;. The \"snowblankets...grass\" refers to Unicorn Horn and &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt;. The \"night...mid-day sky\" refers to Daedra Heart and &lt;a href=\"Ectoplasm%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;. Mixing these reagents and pouring them onto the symbol in this order will open the portal to Vile's Realm. \nEntering the gateway, Cyrus is met with a peculiarly idyllic landscape: a floating green island with a river running through, a bridge, and a small cabin. There is no hidden areas or loot so Cyrus might as well make his way straight to the Daedra lord himself. Sitting on a tree stump with his \"dog\" &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; beside him, he congratulates Cyrus on his success and begins to pry at the Redguard's motivations, be they guilt of &lt;a href=\"Hakan\"&gt;Hakan&lt;/a&gt;'s murder or his choice to run away, much to his chagrin. In order to earn Clavicus' favor and talk of Iszara's soul in earnest, Cyrus must offer the Flask of Lillandril as a gift. With this, Vile is happy to discuss the terms: a game of riddles with Cyrus' soul covering the wager: Two doors and two guardians standing beside them\u2014one who always lies and the other who always tells the truth\u2014only one question can be asked of either one of them. This is a popular logic puzzle known as \",\" specifically the \"Fork in the road\" variant. To solve this, Cyrus must approach either of the Guardians and ask \"Which Door Would the Other Say is Correct?\" Regardless of which Guardian is asked this, both will respond \"The left door.\" Because their truthful/lying natures cancel each other out, the answer will invariably be the door on the right.\nAll the guard dialogue options are:\nA cutscene plays of Cyrus returning to the mortal realm with Iszara's soul, releases her from her catatonia, from which she immediately wakes and rushes downstairs to return to the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League%27s%20Hideout\"&gt;League's Hideout&lt;/a&gt;. Aboard &lt;a href=\"Yaeli\"&gt;Yaeli&lt;/a&gt;'s ship, Iszara is reluctant to reconnect with her long-gone brother. Back with the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt;, Iszara recounts her experiances and the loss of the gem, to which Cyrus interjects and admits that the gem was given to Richton by him, unaware of it's significance. Promising to recover the soul and find a sorcerer powerful enough to bring the prince back to life, Cyrus departs for &lt;a href=\"Saintsport%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Saintsport&lt;/a&gt;. Iszara forgives Cyrus for his past transgressions but still admonishes him, threatening to hunt him down and kill him if he should choose to run away again. He promises not to fail her\u2014\"not like last time.\""}

That's right, the humble boot-knife, the weapon favored by thieves and, yes, even assassins. It's easy to see why the short blade has a poor reputation among those who dream of charging into battle to gain glory by lopping off heads with a greatsword, but it can save you in a pinch.\nThe well-rounded soldier is prepared for any situation, and that means familiarity with weapons large and small. A dagger can be your best friend\u2014a concealed blade can cut your bonds free in the event of capture, it can give you a fighting chance should you become disarmed, it can skin a quick meal on the trail, and practicing with one can teach you volumes about mobility and close combat.\nIf you want to be fully prepared for the battlefield, you'll practice these simple exercises at least once a week. Listen to my advice, and you'll improve your survivability tenfold.\nThe Quick Draw: Strap a few small daggers where you can reach them easily. You might want one strapped to your thigh, one near your sword, or one at your shoulder. All you're going to do is draw them and bring them to the ready as fast as you can. Seems simple, but you need to master this step. If you can't get to them fast, you're as good as dead.\nTarget Practice: Bows are fine weapons, but what happens when you run out of arrows and the foe is charging in? Practice some throws at the archery range, keeping your wrist stiff and making sure to follow through, releasing the hilt when it aligns with the target. This is especially useful when coupled with the Quick Draw exercise.\nThe Reed: You'll need a partner with a practice weapon for this one. Keep a hand behind your back, hold your dagger in the other, and have them charge you with their best attacks. Your goal is to keep your feet planted and bend out of the way quickly. Don't back up; try to end up on the inside of the attack, where your dagger can be deadly.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get out there are spend some time with your dagger\u2014you can thank me when it saves your life."}

During the event, the Dragonborn is temporarily stunned and blinded. Upon waking, he or she finds Mirabelle wounded in the Hall. She instructs the Dragonborn to search for Savos. In the courtyard, the other students and staff surround his body, which was transported there by the combined effort of Ancano's magic and the Eye's power.

The fixed rate is 20 sawn logs for 200 . The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may also ask permission to cut logs for free from mill owners. Each log cut will yield ten sawn logs. Mill owners will only allow the Dragonborn to use their mill and take the freshly sawn logs if they view him or her as a friend. The easiest way to do this is to sell them some &lt;a href=\"firewood\"&gt;firewood&lt;/a&gt;, which can often be cut nearby. They are more likely to agree if they are at home, instead of working at the mill.\nUnlike other building materials, sawn logs are not added to the inventory. Rather, they are delivered to the building site of the &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn owns more than one homestead, the sawn logs are shared; they can be accessed from any of the homesteads. At the building site, they exist as a physical object called a \"Log Pile.\" It is possible to see how many are available by looking at the logs, if the log pile has less than five sawn logs. Log piles may be activated, however, doing so has no use.\n&lt;a href=\"Lumber%20Mill\"&gt;Lumber Mill&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe following is a full list of mills around Skyrim:"}

Each piece can be crafted using &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; amenities, and each piece can be improved with &lt;a href=\"corundum%20ingot\"&gt;corundum ingot&lt;/a&gt;s.\nScaled armor consists of a cuirass and pauldrons of leather scale mail, along with a skirt and belt made of leather decorated with animal fur and reinforced with metal rivets. The boots and armbands have metal plates decorated with knot patterns, and the leather helmet is decorated with a pair of goat horns.\nAcquisition.\nSmithing.\nScaled Armor can be crafted at a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Advanced%20Armors\"&gt;Advanced Armors&lt;/a&gt; perk, which is available with a &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; skill of 50 or above. The required materials to craft it are Corundum Ingots, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather%20strips\"&gt;leather strips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel ingots&lt;/a&gt;. Scaled armor can be crafted in the steel section of the forge menu.\nWhile it is craftable after unlocking the Advanced Armor perk, Scaled Armor is one of the few armors you can improve to \"Legendary.\"\nComparison with other sets.\nIt provides less armor rating than &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;glass armor&lt;/a&gt;, but more than &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven armor&lt;/a&gt;, while being heavier in weight than the latter. &lt;a href=\"Elven%20gilded%20armor\"&gt;Elven gilded armor&lt;/a&gt;, when wearing the full set, reaps benefits equal to that of Scaled Armor. The scaled armor seems to be an upgraded version of the &lt;a href=\"studded%20armor\"&gt;studded armor&lt;/a&gt;, as it has extra protection, and looks similar.\nImproving.\nScaled Armor can be improved at a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt; with one Corundum Ingot per piece. This increases the armor rating provided by the item. The factor of the improvement is modified by the Smithing skill and Advanced Armors perk.\nVariants.\nThere is also an alternative version of the cuirass, the &lt;a href=\"scaled%20horn%20armor\"&gt;scaled horn armor&lt;/a&gt;. It is identical to the stats of the original, but cannot be crafted or improved."}

Anyway: dryskins ride their beloved furry mounts into &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and then their steeds disappear into sudden-sand, or catch sloughskin from the fleshflies, or eat a spotted toadstool, and sploosh! They're dead, and the dryskins leak water from their eyes.\nYes, a terrible situation for the sad beek-ojel, and one so easily avoided! For almost every stablemaster of the Marsh has fine, scaly lizard mounts available for purchase in various forms, all familiar to dryskins but specifically adapted to deep swamp conditions! So convenient, our lizard-steeds, so scaly and personable. Who would not want one? Or even several?\nMore than once I have been asked by inquisitive beek-ojel, \"Ukaspa, why are your lizard-steeds shaped like mounts from other parts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;? Why are there &lt;a href=\"Horse-Lizard%20Steed\"&gt;horse-lizards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camel-Lizard%20Steed\"&gt;camel-lizards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Senche-Lizard%20Steed\"&gt;senche-lizards&lt;/a&gt;? Why aren't your so-very-handsome mounts shaped like, well, lizards?\" These are good questions, and I, Ukaspa, will answer them, except for the parts that are a Big Mystery.\nYou know that we &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt; are different from you dryskins because we are the children of the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, right? But what, you wonder, does that mean, since the Hist are trees and we are clearly not saplings? Well, the Hist are much-more-than-trees, they are the wisdom with roots! They grow tall, wide, and very, very wise, but must stay where they grow, which is sometimes inconvenient. But the Hist see humans and Elves with their walking legs and clever hands, and wisely think, oh, good idea! Now, scurrying over their roots and everywhere in the Marsh are the kind of lizards we call \"useful.\" And a happening happens where the Hist take the kind of lizards we call \"useful\" and make from them the kind of people you call Argonians.\nYou see where the current is taking us, do you not? The Hist have Argonians who are their children of the walking legs and clever hands, and they are the best people ever because they lack all the flaws of humans and Elves. But sometimes they want to travel a long way for a long time, and how do people-shaped-people do that? On mounts! And so useful lizards happen to become lizard-steeds of proven shapes, and then Argonians can ride, tall in the saddle and proud!\nBut I know you beek-ojel, you always want to know more, as if knowledge moistens the scales (it does not, by the way). Knowing that useful lizards happen to become children of the Hist and also lizard-steeds is not enough, you want to know all the details, especially if they are what dryskins call \"sexy.\" However, that is where Ukaspa cannot help, because all of that is a Big Mystery. Oh, not from Argonians of the Hist, because how could it be a Big Mystery to us, who know All the Clues? But you have no clues, because you are not our egg-siblings. Sorry? Anyway, that's what I can tell you about lizard-steeds, so you can go now. Wallow with joy, stay moist, and don't wander around loose in the deep swamp like fools, all right?"}

Yet, due to sources such as &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; verbal lore, some important and perhaps salacious stories of earlier high kings and their families pass through family lines, unrecorded in mediums such as treatises, books, and scrolls. Herein are a couple of the more, shall we say, scandalous tales of the royal families of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bloody End of \"Head-Rolling\" &lt;a href=\"Roleke\"&gt;Roleke&lt;/a&gt;\nSometime in the late &lt;a href=\"first%20era\"&gt;first era&lt;/a&gt;, a young &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Irthvyd%20the%20Impassive\"&gt;Irthvyd the Impassive&lt;/a&gt;, so called for his stoic reserve and calm presence, rose to prominence among the Nords. Though Irthvyd's native hold's name is lost to the ages, he helped Solitude regain order after the ruling high king, \"Head-Rolling\" Roleke, decapitated over twenty rebels in less than five minutes \u2026 by herself. (Some sources state that her then-spouse numbered among these twenty\u2014she went through a succession of many spouses during her reign.) Shortly after, the population of Solitude rose up, having dealt with enough of this behavior from their leader, and besieged Roleke within the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; itself!\nIrthvyd, along with his warriors, heard of the rising disquiet due to being in the area, so he headed toward Solitude. When he reached the gate, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; appeared to Irthvyd, stating Roleke had died at the hands of her progeny only hours before. Sadly, these sons and daughters also died due to wounds dealt by the fierce and bloodthirsty Roleke. Thus, Solitude had no high king or blood heirs in residence any longer.\nIn rode Irthvyd, with the favor of Kyne, ready to help the citizens of Solitude untangle the resulting snarl. Mere hours later, he was crowned High King of Solitude, with the blessings of Kyne upon him!\nThanks to Irthvyd's steady rule, peace settled upon the holds after years of Roleke's bloody reign. Decades passed, and young Irthvyd became middle-aged Irthvyd, with no spouse. While the lack of heirs is not an inordinate problem among Nord royalty, it did raise questions. Irthvyd steadfastly refused both a spouse and the possibility of blood heirs. The title of high king eventually passed to Irthvyd's most senior advisor, &lt;a href=\"Temylda\"&gt;Temylda&lt;/a&gt;, who battled several &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl&lt;/a&gt;s in single combat and won. This, of course, led to my next bit of gathered verbal lore.\n&lt;a href=\"Alldimar%20the%20Ghostmaker\"&gt;Alldimar the Ghostmaker&lt;/a&gt;\nForty years after Temylda's reign ended, a new high king took the throne through bloodshed and violence. Alldimar, a Nord with many skirmishes against the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; under his belt, succeeded at wresting the title from an untested child heir primarily through a good sense of battle tactics and a knowledge of arcane matters that most Nords would sneer at. Despite his blood-drenched ascent, as he settled into his rule, peace spread throughout the land, and none could complain about his administrative and diplomatic behaviors after he took Solitude. As it stood, many had questioned the wisdom of passing rulership to a child, whose name and provenance is lost to history. Additionally, it suits the Nord's battle-seeking nature to have such a heroic and field-tested figure as their leader.\nYet, all was not completely well with Alldimar. Sometimes servants caught their liege talking to someone who wasn't there. They also whispered about one of his advisors, an icy-eyed woman named Freiretta, who kept to herself when not in Alldimar's presence. None were allowed in her quarters.\nAs these stories spread among Solitude's people, a sense of unease grew. Had Alldimar been hit on the head one too many times in battle? And who was Freiretta really? Was something more going on here?\nA year and a day after he ascended to the throne, the accidents started. Each week, another person in Solitude would die in a bizarre fashion. One was pinned to &lt;a href=\"the%20Lonely%20Troll\"&gt;the Lonely Troll&lt;/a&gt; by a badly aimed arrow that was carried by the wind oddly. Another simply tripped, landed on his arse, and died. Yet another got trampled by &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horkers&lt;/a&gt; fleeing some unseen threat.\nAnd servants whispered that they started hearing disembodied voices around the high king's quarters.\nOnly after Alldimar's death a year and a day after the first accident did his secret get revealed: the skulls of every single one of those \"accident\" victims nestled together on a secret shelf within the high king's quarters. To what purpose, though?\nWhatever the reason, High King Alldimar gained the moniker \"Ghostmaker\" due to this finding.\nMy sources note that priests saw to the proper rites for these displaced remains, though servants claim that they hear voices and see shapes out of the corners of their eyes within the Blue Palace to this day."}

She wanted to be brave like her friends, but she frightened much too easily. The world was a big, spooky place to the Scared Little Snow Moth. She avoided venturing into it as much as she could.\nOne day, however, she left her cozy tree to search for food. It was a cold, blustery day. Scared Little Snow Moth did not mind the snow, or the chilly wind against her wings, but she feared what the blizzard concealed. She did not want to run into a monster.\nAs she flew, she saw a light in the snow. She thought it might be the eye of some horrible monster, but when she got closer, she realized it was just a tiny &lt;a href=\"torchbug\"&gt;torchbug&lt;/a&gt;.\nMean Old Torchbug had grown tired of his adventures in the &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt; mine. He traveled far until he reached a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; covered in snow and ice, but now he was quite bored. Then, he spotted the Scared Little Snow Moth. A wicked thought popped into his head as he watched her float among the glittering snowflakes.\n\"Hello, Little Snow Moth,\" Torchbug called out, his voice popping like flames in the cold, \"What are you doing out in this storm?\"\n\"I'm hungry,\" Scared Little Snow Moth said in small voice, \"I don't want any trouble.\"\n\"If you're hungry, you should explore that cave over there,\" Torchbug sang, \"It's full of delicious food!\"\nScared Little Snow Moth spotted the cave. It didn't look very safe. In fact, it looked quite dangerous! She knew of a place that was much less frightening where she could gather food more safely.\n\"Come now,\" sang Torchbug, \"I'll stay nearby and make sure nothing happens to you. Don't you want a tasty feast?\"\nScared Little Snow Moth thought about this for a long moment. She was frightened, but not foolish.\n\"I don't believe you,\" she said, \"You just want me to go into that cave and get hurt.\"\n\"Not hurt, just eaten! I think I would like to see someone make a feast out of you, Little Snow Moth.\"\n\"Not today, Torchbug,\" Scared Little Snow Moth said in a slightly bigger voice than before, \"I am much too frightened to be eaten.\"\n\"If you insist, Little Snow Moth. Goodbye,\" Torchbug sang.\nAnd Scared Little Snow Moth flew as fast as her wings would carry her through the snow, leaving Torchbug behind. She did not speak to anyone else. As soon as she gathered her food, she raced back to her cozy tree and huddled up against the bark where she knew she was safe."}

She is supervising a group of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; spies. She wants to find out what they think of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt a meeting of the three Argonian leaders, &lt;a href=\"Slim-Jah\"&gt;Slim-Jah&lt;/a&gt; yells \"Hail &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;\" and kills &lt;a href=\"Uta-Tei\"&gt;Uta-Tei&lt;/a&gt; because Uta-Tei and &lt;a href=\"No-Fingers\"&gt;No-Fingers&lt;/a&gt; want to ally with the Dominion. Slim-Jah was once a &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;, and No-Fingers asks for help in killing her hunters. He gives the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Comes-When-Called\"&gt;Comes-When-Called&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt;, to help track them down.\nThe Vestige kills the hunters, and No-Fingers finds where Slim-Jah is hiding. He was a Shadowscale, so he can't kill her, but he gives one &lt;a href=\"Eager-Teeth\"&gt;Eager-Teeth&lt;/a&gt;, a feisty guar, to fight by their side.\nBackground.\n\"Dominion soldiers erected barricades around a tribe of Argonian refugees living in the Gray Mire. Officer Parwinel needs help resolving the Argonians' situation.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOutside the barricades to &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Mire\"&gt;The Gray Mire&lt;/a&gt;, you will find a woman named &lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Alque\"&gt;Soldier Alque&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that the Argonian tribe here is being contained until their intentions are clear, and will direct you to speak with &lt;a href=\"Officer%20Parwinel\"&gt;Officer Parwinel&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to help resolve the situation. \nParwinel will be in the big tent to the south. Speak with her and she will tell you that these Argonians are former slaves; they have more reason to hate the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; than anyone in the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Her superiors do not trust them though, hence the barricades. Their leaders refuse to speak with the Dominion officers, so Parwinel will send you in to talk to them. \nHead in and speak with the leaders. &lt;a href=\"Uta-Tei\"&gt;Uta-Tei&lt;/a&gt; will be just beyond the barricade; speak with her and she will tell you that in her eyes, there is little difference between the Dominion and the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; who gave them these lands. She hopes that one day the Dominion will see that they are in fact allies. East of here, you will find &lt;a href=\"No-Fingers\"&gt;No-Fingers&lt;/a&gt; sleeping. To wake him up, grab a bucket of water from the table to the east and drop it on him. Near the bucket, you will also find a copy of the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"War%20Customs%20of%20the%20Tribal%20Bosmer\"&gt;War Customs of the Tribal Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;\", so be sure to take it with you. No-Fingers will not be thrilled about being woken up this way, but he will talk to you and answer your questions. He has no issues with the dominion, so long as they leave him and his tribe alone. Finally, seek out &lt;a href=\"Slim-Jah\"&gt;Slim-Jah&lt;/a&gt; in the south of the area. She will not want to speak with you, but you can persuade her to speak. If you do not persuade her, . Slim-jah does not approve of the Dominion, and sees them as no better than their former slavemasters. \nOnce you have spoken with all three, the tribe will hold a meeting to determine what to do about the barricades. You should attend this meeting in the center of the area. At the meeting, Slim-Jah will murder Uta-Tei and then flee. Speak with No-Fingers about this and he will tell you that Slim-Jah was once a &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;, and that this assassination was probably part of a larger plan. If even one Dominion soldier gets attacked by Slim-Jah or her hunters, the tribe will most likely be slaughtered. To help track down Slim-Jah's hunters, No-Fingers will lend you his pet &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Guar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Comes-When-Called\"&gt;Comes-When-Called&lt;/a&gt;. \nSearch the beaches for the hunters. Comes-When-Called will follow the scent of the hunter there and guide you to them. Once this hunter is dead, search the Breakpoint to the west; the guar will once again be your guide. Next, head north from here to the Backshore and hunt the hunters there; there are two this time. Finally, head southwest and clear out the hunters at the Foreshore; these will attack you outright so you will not need your guar pal. Once all of the hunters have been killed, meet up with No-Fingers in a cave to the southwest. \nNo-Fingers will tell you that Slim-Jah is deeper in these caves, and that she is trying to use the &lt;a href=\"Wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wamasu&lt;/a&gt; matron &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Lightning\"&gt;Mother Lightning&lt;/a&gt; to her advantage. Your job is to kill them both, though you will get another pet guar, &lt;a href=\"Eager-Teeth\"&gt;Eager-Teeth&lt;/a&gt;, to help you in the fighting. You will have to fight your way through many hunters and wild beasts before you reach the bosses, who are located in the northwest of the cave. Slim-Jah will not be too tough to take down, but Mother Lightning may put up some resistance. Once both are dead, head out of the cave and back to the Gray Mire. \nOnce back, speak with No-Fingers. He will tell you that Officer Parwinel is growing impatient, and that someone has to speak with her. He is afraid that she will hear about the fighting and decide that the Argonians have no place in this land, so he will ask you to go lie to her. She will be just up ahead; you can either lie to her or tell her the truth. If you tell her the truth, you can still persuade her to let the Argonians stay, but if you lie, you will not have to persuade. If you neither lie nor persuade, the Argonians will be forced off this land. Either way, the quest will end here."}

Valen Dreth is the same prisoner who taunted the Hero at the beginning of the game. The bonus is earned by not killing any guards during the course of the mission.\nWalkthrough.\nFirst, enter through the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City Sewers&lt;/a&gt;, open the gate with the key provided by Vicente. Once inside, follow the marker and go to the tunnel to the right from the entrance and continue through the sewers through another door to more sewers. There are two locked doors. Both of them are Average locks.\nThe Sanctum.\nGo down the stairs and go right through the gate, down the hallway, and then make another right at that room. Make yet another right down the hallway, up the stairs, and up the ladder to The Sanctum (the locks difficulty depends on the Hero's current level, at level five it's an Average lock). Either use a &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;, or use an &lt;a href=\"Open%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Open&lt;/a&gt; Hard Lock spell. An &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; level of Expert is required in order to use the spell. The spell can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Gaspar%20Stegine\"&gt;Gaspar Stegine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, or from &lt;a href=\"Orintur\"&gt;Orintur&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Another option is to visit &lt;a href=\"the%20Tower%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;the Tower Stone&lt;/a&gt;, which grants the power to open a Hard lock once a day.\nThere will be guards in the next few areas. The sewer network is dark, and the guards seem to have poor detection skills, so even a Hero with a relatively poor &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill can evade them as long as they stay in the shadows, avoid line of sight, and sneak slowly. The guards will move around their posts a bit, but patience may be needed.\nOnce inside, sneak and wait for the two guards to stop talking and walk away. This conversation is worth hearing at least for the humor, and it only takes a short while. There are now two options: either sneak forward or to the right. Ahead there are several guards to evade, however, the Hero can access the chamber the assassin jumped out of to attack the Emperor. This chamber is now lit by candles and leads to a sort of shrine to the Emperor where the guard captain in charge has set up his office. He is engrossed in whatever he is doing at his desk, and so will rarely notice his keys being taken. These keys open doors to all sorts of restricted areas across the Imperial City, and so are worth having.\nThe other option is to sneak forward down the hall. Go left, a guard patrols that walkway, and go to the area where the final ambush occurred (the place where the gate is locked from the other side, forcing a detour). There is a guard stationed at the staircase, but he can be evaded with relative ease provided the player uses good sneak technique.\nImperial Subterrane.\nGo through the door to the Imperial Subterrane. There is one guard patrolling this area and he's carrying a torch. Avoid him in the shadows until he passes, then go to the Imperial Prison. Go straight up the stairs and down the hall, make a left, up some more stairs, turn around to the right, and go through the tunnels directly into the prison cell where the Hero started the game.\nA guard and a prisoner will be talking just outside of the cell. That prisoner is the target, &lt;a href=\"Valen%20Dreth\"&gt;Valen Dreth&lt;/a&gt;. The guard will speak to him for a short while, with Dreth's taunting voice reminding the guard that he will be gone in a few days, while the guard will still be stuck in 'this hole'.\nThe guard will leave when the conversation is done, leaving Valen alone. Kill him with ranged &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic, arrows, or open his cell and kill him. If the player decides to converse with Dreth, the speech options include repeating Dreth's taunts from the beginning of the game, \"You're going to die in here,\" or mentioning that the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; sent them, to which Dreth will respond \"The Night Mother? Oh.. No! Guards! Guards! Assassin!,\" hinting that he was aware of the possibility of an assassination attempt. Kill him in whatever manner desired, but be sure to do it quickly or he can run back through the entire sewer, alerting the guards.\nAfter Dreth is dead, either exit through the sewers, or take the key on the table to the right from Dreth's cell and exit through the Bastion. The guards there will not be hostile, and this route is much faster and safer.\nAlternate methods.\n Instead of attempting to sneak past the guards in the sewers, pickpocket one of them for the Imperial Prison Key. After obtaining it, exit the sewers, enter the Imperial Prison from the front door, enter the Bastion, then go down the left door that says it requires a key to unlock. (This does not work on the Xbox 360 version and possibly the PS3 version.) It opens right next to Valen's cell with a single guard between Valen and death. This guard will not move, run past him, kill Valen, and exit as quickly as possible.\nAlternately, allow the guard to attack. Then yield to him by holding block and talking to him. He will stop attacking, allowing the conversation with Valen. After he leaves, kill Valen."}

Who knew that the work of the Mages Guild could be so dangerous or so exciting? Anyway, this is accurate and up to date as of the time that I write this. Anything that turns out to be proven false or revealed at a later date I'll have to deal with in a later volume. Unless I can devise a spell that automatically updates my writing\u2014no, no, I need to focus on one thing at a time!\nAngof has a number of associates helping him to complete his plans. I think he calls them \"Minions.\" Let's review the ones I suspect to be working with this vile necromancer.\nFaolchu, who seems to be associated with &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;were-creatures&lt;/a&gt; and has launched an assault on &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, appears to me to be following the orders of a more-powerful individual. I believe that individual to be Angof, but I have no proof of this connection as yet.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; obviously has ties to Angof. Whether he leads the cult or is simply a member I haven't yet determined, but I'm positive that the two are connected. The cultists scour the land for relics and items of power, and they seem to count a large number of necromancers as part of their order. I wouldn't be surprised if they had ties to some Daedric Princes or other. &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, if I had to hazard a guess.\nDaedra, too, appear to be arrows in Angof's quiver. He casts them out into the world as a farmer throws seeds into the wind. I'm sure there are more of Angof's minions hiding in plain sight, but anything else I put forth at this point would be beyond pure speculation. Instead, let me turn to what I have discovered about the Reachmage himself.\nFirst, he seems to be poisoning the land in some way. The vile vines that grow wherever he has passed demonstrate how his foul magic pollutes the countryside. His very name\u2014Gravesinger\u2014speaks to his fascination and fluency with death magic. Death and decay are his domains, and he seeks power over life and death.\nHis followers consider him a strong and persuasive leader. Many of them would literally die to please him. Such devotion isn't healthy, and I find it more than a little scary that someone could have such an effect on people.\nAngof seeks to cause as much chaos and mayhem as possible.

In addition to their great size and power, they give birth by laying eggs in nests instead of experiencing live births and carrying their young on their backs. I'm sure this has something to do with the sheer size and number of offspring the adult scorpion matron can produce at a time. Still, these sorts of differences make for amazing and interesting study.\nFor this part of the project, I have chosen a powerful scorpion matron who commands the nesting grounds deep inside &lt;a href=\"Fearfangs%20Cavern\"&gt;Fearfangs Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Her brood will provide exactly the predatory traits we require for this stage of the alchemical process. When combined with the traits provided by the mighty wamasu eggbearer and the flawless crocodile matriarch, the scorpion material will increase the power of the mantikora in ways I can barely imagine!\nI've collected the first of the matron's eggs. The material within each shell should infuse the spawning pools with traits that will easily be passed on to our new creature. I wonder, are any of the Serpent's other regents having as much success as I am? I think not! Perhaps when the mantikora progenitor emerges from the spawning pools, the Serpent will award me with command of the entire &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the fifth quest in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; questline. There may be a line on the person or persons who have been working against the Guild. An old Guild collaborator in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; may have some information.\nBackground.\n\"After the revelations at Honningbrew Meadery and Goldenglow Farm, it's time to put the pieces together and shed some light on the Thieves Guild's anonymous adversary.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest begins by speaking to Mercer Frey. He thinks he may have finally caught the Guild's anonymous adversary slipping up. From the note provided by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, he deduces that they are likely using an old Guild contact at the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude as a go-between. He\u00a0figures it is Gulum-Ei and wants him shaken down for information.\nIf the Dragonborn chooses to speak to Brynjolf before leaving, he will give more details of who Gulum-Ei is and his involvement with the Guild. He says that Gulum-Ei has no honor and in order to gain any useful information from him, he will need to either be bought off or followed in order to gain information that could be used as leverage against him. If Gulum-Ei is killed, there will be no reward from Mercer Frey.\nGulum-Ei.\nGulum-Ei will most likely be in &lt;a href=\"the%20Winking%20Skeever\"&gt;the Winking Skeever&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude. It is possible to persuade him with a high enough &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill. Otherwise, he plays stupid at first, in which case bribing him is the only way to get information. If the bribe option is selected, he will say that he has a client that wants a case of &lt;a href=\"Firebrand%20Wine%20Case\"&gt;firebrand wine&lt;/a&gt;, which can be stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting the wine is easy enough\u2014it can just be picked up at the Blue Palace. It is relatively close to the entrance, so the Dragonborn should be able to follow the quest marker.\nAfter getting him the wine, he claims not to know anything except that the woman in question has a grudge against Mercer Frey.\nAt this point, he heads out of Solitude down towards the docks and into the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;. He can be pickpocketed for the key to the warehouse.\nEast Empire Company Warehouse.\nFollowing him into the warehouse requires stealth. It may be easiest to stay on top of the shelves to follow him since the guards are always patrolling, and there is a ramp just behind the small hut near the entrance. An alternative is to remain in the water below the docks. If the guards or Gulum-Ei catch\u00a0the Dragonborn, they will attack, but they can be killed for no\u00a0bounty. However, should the Dragonborn be detected by one of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Warden\"&gt;East Empire Warden&lt;/a&gt;s, they will tell them to leave and give them several seconds to do so, with a second warning. If no action is taken to do as ordered by the warden, they will raise the alarm, triggering a 5 bounty for trespassing in a restricted area, hence the \"Danger\" &lt;a href=\"Shadowmarks\"&gt;Shadowmark&lt;/a&gt; that was seen next to the door before entering.\nUpon reaching the end of the shelves, up the stairs and straight on is a small ledge. It is possible to walk across then drop down onto the walkway. At this stage the easiest way to follow him is just to drop into the water and move as slowly and quietly as possible. He can then be followed out of the water, up a ramp through a hidden door.\nAt the farthest northern point is an elevated building. To get to the building there is another ramp leading up to the left of the one to the hidden door. Inside the building on a table is the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Shipping%20Map\"&gt;East Empire Shipping Map&lt;/a&gt;, which can be sold to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can swim directly across the bay and wait for him under the docks, then follow him into &lt;a href=\"Brinewater%20Grotto\"&gt;Brinewater Grotto&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrinewater Grotto.\nInside the grotto are several hostile &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. There is a bandit swimming in the water, so sneaking can be tricky, but it is possible to sneak past him underwater. There is a chest underwater where he is. A way to get by the bandit in the water and the one on top is, after seeing the two bandits on the dock talking to each other and right before going up those stairs, to the right is a spider web which can be cut down with a weapon. Beyond are three &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen confronted at the end of the line, Gulum-Ei identifies the real target, &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;. She murdered the former Guild Master and is now after Mercer. Gulum-Ei pleads innocent. He can be killed, but if spared, he becomes available as a fence. Killing him will also forfeit the reward from Mercer, so sparing him is the better option.\nReturn to Mercer Frey.\nReturning to Mercer with the location Gulum-Ei said Karliah was headed (\"Where the End Began\") completes this quest and begins the next, \"&lt;a href=\"Speaking%20With%20Silence\"&gt;Speaking With Silence&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dark elves&lt;/a&gt; deserve our condolences, but thus far they do not show themselves deserving of the simplest acts of charity. There are very different approaches to how to deal with the imminent problem of Morrowind, and I offer two options as seen in practice in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. One should serve as an exemplar, the other a cautionary tale.\nConsider &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, which shares a border with the ruined province. A number of the dark elves have made their homes there, but they are expected to earn their livelihoods as is any other citizen of the great city. They ply trades as merchants, work in the temple, and serve in the keep. Honest labor, to be admired from a race that was so recently in such dire straits as to even warrant this discussion. Today the city still has its share of problems, but they are not traceable to any influx of outsiders in their presence. In short, the dark elves have properly assimilated themselves into the Skyrim way of life, to be expected from any newcomer to these lands.\nFor an alternative approach, we only have to look at the once-proud city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, to see what can happen when our arms are cast too wide open in welcome. To think that the city of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, whose very name was made in driving out the elves from our sacred home, would open itself as a welcome destination for any refugee from the smoking sulphur, is a disgrace to the very idea of being a Nord.\nAnd what has become of this? Predictably, the lazy, discontented rabble has descended into squalor in an area now delicately referred to as \"the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Quarter\"&gt;Gray Quarter&lt;/a&gt;\" of the city. They were not expected to contribute and so have not. That they attempt to make over a proud Nord city into a little pocket of Morrowind is insulting enough, but the amount of unrest they have provoked even within the proper city walls should give any other &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; reason to fear.\nThe Nords I talk to in the city speak of constant strife and crime coming from the Gray Quarter, with no respite in sight. The city guard barely patrol there, leaving the dark elves to mete out whatever passes for justice in their native customs. The respectable families of the city, the Cruel-Seas and Shatter-Shields, speak with an almost parental affection of the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; in their employ, but the dark elves have made no effort to ingratiate or assimilate themselves to the proper city-dwellers.\nThere is cause for optimism though, as &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Jarl Ulfric&lt;/a&gt; is not nearly so tolerant of these substandard beings as his fathers were. Indeed, the soft hand of &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the Argonian population as well; the fish-men, at least, have learned how to best contribute to their new home. They have proven themselves as models, toiling at the docks with utmost efficiency and bright smiles. It would do the dark elves well to pay heed to their scaly cousins. I would expect in due course that they will find themselves either contributing more directly or once again wandering the land in search of roof and warmth."}

{"id": "18516", "revid": "2287356", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18516", "title": "Scout (Oblivion)", "text": "The Scout is a premade &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription and use.\nThe Scout is a light combat-oriented class. Like the &lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;, they are based around agile and speedy skirmish &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, rather than the strong and slow combat of &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s. The Scout excels at avoiding damage by dodging, rolling and blocking.\nLong treks in the wilderness are the forte of the Scout. This requires them to have the ability to move quickly and navigate tough terrain, so the Scout must be skilled in &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;. Scouts usually have traveled far and wide, and know the geography of the land very well.\nScouts also have to know names and usage of the plants and wildlife they meet on their expeditions, so &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; is another of the Scout's skills. This skill is very useful for making &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;. A poisoned blade can give the extra damage needed for difficult battles and the use of potions allows for the versatility and &lt;a href=\"heal\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt;ing powers of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nScouts are often required to fight hostile creatures or people while travelling. For this reason, a Scout knows how to use a &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;, how to &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; incoming attacks and the use of &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt; to provide protection while not significantly hindering movement. The best method of fighting as a Scout is to attack quickly with a &lt;a href=\"Shortswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shortsword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Longswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;longsword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; have too short of a &lt;a href=\"Reach%20%28Combat%29\"&gt;reach&lt;/a&gt; and give too little damage for hit-and-run, while &lt;a href=\"Claymores%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;claymores&lt;/a&gt; are generally too slow for skirmish tactics), then run from or dodge any incoming counter-attacks. If the attack cannot be dodged, quickly block with a light &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;; the protection afforded by lighter armor is not enough to be completely dependent on the armor absorbing the damage like a suit of &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; would.\nWhile on a reconnaissance mission for long periods, a Scout's equipment will need to be kept in good condition without the luxury of a nearby blacksmith. A good Scout knows how to be his or her own &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armorer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to sew back the dents and scrapes done to his light hide like armor, which is easier to mend than metal.\nUnlike some classes which give you multiple weapon and armor styles, the scout's skills are well balanced. Alchemy for potions, Blade for fighting, Block for avoiding damage, Light Armor\u00a0for defense without hindrance, &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; for jumping in and out of trouble, Athletics for either escaping a powerful foe or running/swimming\u00a0great distances without getting winded, and Armorer for repairing their weapons and armor on the fly. As you can see,\u00a0scout's are survivors and will stand the test of whatever Oblivion throws at them."}
