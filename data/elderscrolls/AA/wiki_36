It is notable that while the series has sixteen books, only three are known.\nContents.\nSixteen Accords of Madness, Book VI.\nHircine's Tale.\nEver proud and boastful, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Mad Prince&lt;/a&gt; stood one fifth day of &lt;a href=\"mid%20year\"&gt;mid year&lt;/a&gt; among the frigid peaks of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and beckoned forth &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; for parlay. The Huntsman God materialized, for this was his day, and the boldness of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; intrigued him.\nWry without equal, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; holds in his realm giggling loons, flamboyant auteurs, and craven mutilators. The Mad Prince will ply profitless bargains and promote senseless bloodshed for nothing more than the joy of another's confusion, tragedy, or rage. So it was that Sheogorath had set a stage on which to play himself as rival to Hircine.\nWithout haste, the coy Prince proffered his contest; each Prince was to groom a beast to meet at this place again, three years to the hour, and do fatal battle. Expressionless behind his fearsome countenance, Hircine agreed, and with naught but a dusting of snow in the drift, the Princes were gone to their realms.\nConfident, but knowing Sheogorath for a trickster, Hircine secretly bred an abomination in his hidden realm. An ancient &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; he summoned, and imbued it with the foul curse of &lt;a href=\"lycanthropy\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;. Of pitch heart and jagged fang, the unspeakable horror had no peer, even among the great hunters of Hircine's sphere.\nIn the third year, on the given day, Hircine returned, where Sheogorath leaned, cross-legged on a stone, whistling with idle patience. The Prince of the Hunt struck his spear to the ground, bringing forth his unnatural, snarling behemoth. Doffing his cap, sly as ever, Sheogorath stood and stepped aside to reveal a tiny, colorful bird perched atop the stone. Demurely it chirped in the bristling gusts, scarcely audible.\nIn a twisted, springing heap, the Daedroth was upon the stone, leaving only rubble where the boulder had been. Thinking itself victorious, the monster's bloodied maw curled into a mock grin, when a subdued song drifted in the crisp air. The tiny bird lightly hopped along the snout of the furious Daedroth. Sheogorath looked on, quietly mirthful, as the diminutive creature picked at a bit of detritus caught in scales betwixt the fiery eyes of the larger beast. With howling fury, the were-thing blinded itself trying to pluck away the nuisance. And so it continued for hours, Hircine looking on in shame while his finest beast gradually destroyed itself in pursuit of the seemingly oblivious bird, all the while chirping a mournful tune to the lonesome range.\nLivid, but beaten, Hircine burned the ragged corpse and withdrew to his realm, swearing in forgotten tongues. His curses still hang in those peaks, and no wayfarer tarries for fear of his wrathful aspect in those obscured heights.\nTurning on his heel, Sheogorath beckoned the miniscule songbird to perch atop his shoulder, and strolled down the mountain, making for the warm breezes and vibrant sunsets of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20coast\"&gt;Abecean coast&lt;/a&gt;, whistling in tune with the tiniest champion in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nSixteen Accords of Madness, Book IX.\nVaermina's Tale.\n&lt;a href=\"Darius%20Shano\"&gt;Darius Shano&lt;/a&gt; found himself running as fast as he could.\nHe had no idea what he was running from or towards, but he didn't care. The desire saturated his mind -- there was nothing in the world except flight. He looked around for landmarks, anything to place himself or to use as a target, but to no avail -- the featureless grasslands through which he was sprinting extended as far as the eye could see. \"Just have to keep running\", he thought to himself. \"I have to run as fast as I can\". On and on he ran, with no end in sight or in mind...\nStanding over Darius Shano while he lay quietly in his bed were his mistress, &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; the Dreamweaver, and the Madgod &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. Vaermina looked down with pride at this disciple of hers, and was boastful of her little jewel.\n\"Such potential in this one! Through dreams of inspiration, I have nurtured literary talent into fruition, and now he stands in acclaim as an emerging bard and poet! He will gain much favor before I tire of him.\" Sheogorath, too, gazed at the young &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; artist and saw that he was indeed famous among the other mortals.\n\"Hmmm,\" mused Sheogorath, \"but how many are there who hate this mortal whom you have built? It is the hatred of the mortals which confirms greatness, and not their love. Surely you can accomplish this as well?\"\n eyes narrowed. \"Yes, the mortals are indeed often foolish and petty, and it is true that many of their most bold have been despised. Do not worry, mad one, for I have the power to achieve many forms of greatness with this one, hatred among them.\"\n\"Perhaps, Dreamweaver, it would be amusing to show who has this power? Inspire foolish, arrogant hatred of this mortal for ten years, and then I will do the same. We shall see whose talents are most efficient, free of aid or interference from any of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAt this, she relaxed into confident pleasure. \"The Madgod is indeed powerful, but this task is suited to my skills. The mortals are repulsed by madness, but rarely think it worthy of hate. I shall take pleasure in revealing this to you, as I bring the more subtle horrors out of this mortal's subconscious.\"\nAnd so, in the 19th year of his life, the dreams Darius Shano had been experiencing began to change. Fear had always been part of the night for him, but now there was something else. A darkness began to creep into his slumber, a darkness that sucked away all feeling and color, leaving only emptiness behind. When this happened, he opened his mouth to scream, but found that the darkness had taken his voice as well. All he had was the terror and the void, and each night they filled him with a new understanding of death. Yet, when he woke, there was no fear, for he had faith that his Lady had a purpose.\nIndeed, one night Vaermina herself emerged from the void. She leaned in close to whisper into his ear.\n\"Watch carefully, my beloved!\" With that, she pulled the void away, and for hours each night she would reveal to Darius the most horrible perversions of nature. Men being skinned and eaten alive by other men, unimaginable beasts of many limbs and mouths, entire populations being burned -- their screams filled his every evening. In time, these visions gnawed at his soul, and his work began to take on the character of his nightmares. The images revealed to him at night were reproduced on the page, and the terrible cruelty and hollow vice that his work contained both revolted and fascinated the public. They reveled in their disgust over every detail. There were those who openly enjoyed his shocking material, and his popularity among some only fed the hatred of those who found him abhorrent. This continued for several years, while the infamy of Darius grew steadily. Then, in his 29th year, without warning, the dreams and nightmares ceased.\nDarius felt a weight lifted, as he no longer endured the nightly tortures, but was confused. \"What have I done to displease my Mistress?\", he wondered aloud. \"Why has she abandoned me?\" Vaermina never answered his prayers. No one ever answered, and the restless dreams faded away to leave Darius in long, deep sleeps.\nInterest in the works of Darius Shano waned. His prose became stale and his ideas failed to provoke the shock and outrage they once had. As the memory of his notoriety and of his terrible dreams faded, the questions that raced in his mind eventually produced resentment against Vaermina, his former mistress. Resentment grew into hatred, from hatred came ridicule, and over time ridicule became disbelief. Slowly it became obvious -- Vaermina had never spoken to him at all; his dreams were simply the product of a sick mind that had righted itself. He had been deceived by his own subconscious, and the anger and shame overwhelmed him. The man who once conversed with a deity drifted steadily into heresy.\nIn time, all of the bitterness, doubt, and sacrilege focused in Darius a creative philosophy that was threaded throughout all of his subsequent work. He challenged the Gods themselves, as well as the infantile public and corrupt state for worshiping them. He mocked them all with perverse caricatures, sparing no one and giving no quarter. He challenged the Gods in public to strike him down if they existed, and ridiculed them when no such comeuppance was delivered. To all of this, the people reacted with outrage far greater than they had shown his previous work. His early career had offended only sensibilities, but now he was striking directly at the heart of the people.\nHis body of work grew in size and intensity. Temples, nobles, and commoners were all targets of his scorn. Finally, at age 39, Darius wrote a piece entitled \"The Noblest Fool,\" ridiculing The Emperor God &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; for integrating into the pathetic &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; cult. The local King of &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt;, who had been humiliated by this upstart in the past, saw his chance -- for his sacrilege against the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Darius Shano was executed, with a ceremonial blade, in front of a cheering crowd of hundreds. His last, bitter words were gurgled through a mouthful of his own blood.\n20 years after their wager was first placed, Vaermina and Sheogorath met over Darius Shano's headless corpse. The Dreamweaver had been eager for this meeting; she had been waiting for years to confront the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; over his lack of action.\n\"I have been deceived by you, Sheogorath! I performed my half of the bargain, but during your ten years you never contacted the mortal once. He owes none of his greatness to you or your talents or your influence!\"\n\"Nonsense,\" croaked the Madgod. \"I was with him all along! When your time ended and mine began, your whispers in his ear were replaced with silence. I severed his link to that from which he found the most comfort and meaning, and withheld the very attention the creature so desperately craved. Without his mistress, this man's character could ripen under resentment and hatred. Now his bitterness is total and, overcome by a madness fueled by his rage, he feeds me in my realm as an eternal servant.\"\nSheogorath turned and spoke to the empty space by his side.\n\"Indeed; Darius Shano was a glorious mortal. Despised by his own people, his kings, and even by the Gods he mocked. For my success, I shall accept three-score followers of Vaermina into my service. And the dreamers will awaken as madmen.\"\nAnd thus did Sheogorath teach Vaermina that without madness, there are no dreams, and no creation. Vaermina will never forget this lesson.\nSixteen Accords of Madness, Book XII.\nMalacath's Tale.\nIn the days before the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium's&lt;/a&gt; founding, the spurned &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc-folk&lt;/a&gt; were subjected to ostracism and persecutions even more numerous and harsh than their progeny are accustomed to in our own age. So it was that many champions of the Orsimer traveled, enforcing what borders they could for the proliferation of their own people. Many of these champions are spoken of yet today, among them the Cursed Legion, Gromma the Hairless, and the noble Emmeg Gro-Kayra. This latter crusader would have certainly risen to legendary status throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, had he not been subject to the attention of certain &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmmeg Gro-Kayra was the bastard son of a young maiden who was killed in childbirth. He was raised by the shaman of his tribe, the Grilikamaug in the peaks of what we now call &lt;a href=\"Normar%20Heights\"&gt;Normar Heights&lt;/a&gt;. Late in his fifteenth year, Emmeg forged by hand an ornate suit of &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Armor\"&gt;scaled armor&lt;/a&gt;, a rite of ascension among his tribe. On a blustery day, he pounded the final rivet, and draping a heavy cloak over the bulky mantle, Emmeg set out from his village for the last time. Word of his exploits always returned home, whether defending merchant caravans from brigands or liberating enslaved beast folk. News of the noble Orc crusader began to grace even the lips of &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, often with a tinge of fear.\nLess than two years after ascending to maturity, Gro-Kayra was making camp when a thin voice called out from the thickening night. He was surprised to hear the language of his people spoken by a tongue that obviously did not belong to an Orc.\n'Lord Kayra', said the voice, 'tales of your deeds have crossed the lips of many, and have reached my ears.' Peering into the murk, Emmeg made out the silhouette of a cloaked figure, made wavy and ephemeral by the hazy campfire. From the voice alone he had thought the interloper an old hag, but he now decided that he was in the presence of a man of slight and lanky build, though he could discern no further detail.\n'Perhaps,' the wary Orc began, 'but I seek no glory. Who are you?'\nIgnoring the question, the stranger continued, 'Despite that, Orsimer, glory finds you, and I bear a gift worthy of it.' The visitor's cloak parted slightly, revealing nothing but faintly glinting buttons in the pale moonlight, and a bundle was withdrawn and tossed to the side of the fire between the two. Emmeg cautiously removed the rags in which the object was swathed, and was dazzled to discover the item to be a wide, curved blade with ornately decorated handle. The weapon had heft, and Emmeg realized on brandishing it that the elaborate pommel disguised the more practical purpose of balancing the considerable weight of the blade itself. It was nothing much to look at in its present condition, thought the Orc, but once the tarnish was cleaned away and a few missing jewels restored, it would indeed be a blade worthy of a champion ten times his own worth.\n'Her name is 'Neb-Crescen' spoke the thin stranger, seeing the appreciation lighting Gro-Kayra's face. 'I got her for a horse and a secret in warmer climes, but in my old age I'd be lucky to even lift such a weapon. It's only proper that I pass her on to one such as yourself. To possess her is to change your life, forever.' Overcoming his initial infatuation with the arc of honed steel, Emmeg turned his attention back to the visitor.\n'Your words are fine, old man,' Emmeg said, not masking his suspicion, 'but I'm no fool. You traded for this blade once, and you'll trade for it again tonight. What is it that you want?' The stranger's shoulders slumped, and Emmeg was glad to have unveiled the true purpose of this twilight visit. He sat with him a while, eventually offering a stack of furs, warm food, and a handful of coins in exchange for the exotic weapon. By morning, the stranger was gone.\nIn the week following Emmeg's encounter with the stranger, Neb-Crescen had not left its scabbard. He had encountered no enemy in the woods, and his meals consisted of fowl and small game caught with &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;. The peace suited him fine, but on the seventh morning, while fog still crept between the low-hanging boughs, Emmeg's ears pricked up at the telltale crunch of a nearby footfall in the dense snow and forest debris.\nEmmeg's nostrils flared, but he was upwind. Being unable to see or smell his guest, and knowing that the breeze carried his scent in that direction, Emmeg's guard was up, and he cautiously drew Neb-Crescen from its sheath. Emmeg himself was not entirely sure of all that happened next.\nThe first moment of conscious memory in Emmeg Gro-Kayra's mind after drawing Neb-Crescen was the image of the curved blade sweeping through the air in front of him, spattering blood over the virginal powder coating the forest floor. The second memory was a feeling of frenzied bloodlust creeping over him, but it was then that he saw for the first time his victim, an Orc woman perhaps a few years younger than himself, her body a canvas of grisly wounds, enough to kill a strong man ten times over.\nEmmeg's disgust overwhelmed the madness that had overtaken him, and with all his will enlisted, he released Neb-Crescen from his grip and let the blade sail. With a discordant ringing it spun through the air and was buried in a snowdrift. Emmeg fled the scene in shame and horror, drawing the hood of his cloak up to hide himself from the judging eyes of the rising sun.\nThe scene where Emmeg Gro-Kayra had murdered one of his own kind was a macabre one. Below the neck, the body was flayed and mutilated almost beyond recognition, but the untouched face was frozen in a permanent expression of abject terror.\nIt was here that &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; performed certain rites that summoned &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, and the two Daedric Lords held court in the presence of the disfigured corpse.\n'Why show me this, Mad One?' began Malacath, once he recovered from his initial, wordless outrage. 'Do you take such pleasure in watching me grieve the murder of my children?' His guttural voice rumbled, and the patron of the Orismer looked upon his counterpart with accusing eyes.\n'By birth, she was yours, brother outcast,' began Sheogorath, solemn in aspect and demeanor. 'But she was a daughter of mine by her own habits. My mourning here is no less than your own, my outrage no less great.'\n'I am not so sure,' grumbled Malacath, 'but rest assured that vengeance for this crime is mine to reap. I expect no contest from you. Stand aside.' As the fearsome Prince began to push past him, Lord Sheogorath spoke again.\n'I have no intention of standing between you and vengeance. In fact, I mean to help you. I have servants in this wilderness, and can tell you just where to find our mutual foe. I ask only that you use a weapon of my choosing. Wound the criminal with my blade, and banish him to my plane, where I can exact my own punishment. The rights of honor-killing here belong to you.'\nWith that, Malacath agreed, took the wide blade from Sheogorath, and was gone.\nMalacath materialized in the path of the murderer, the cloaked figure obscured through a blizzard haze. Bellowing a curse so foul as to wilt the surrounding trees, the blade was drawn and Malacath crossed the distance more quickly than a wild &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;. Frothing with rage, he swung the blade in a smooth arc which lopped the head of his foe cleanly off, then plunged the blade up to its hilt in his chest, choking off the spurts of blood into a steady, growing stain of red bubbling from beneath the scaled armor and heavy cloak.\nPanting from the unexpected immediacy and fury of his own kill, Malacath rested on a knee as the body before him collapsed heavily backwards and the head landed roughly upon a broad, flat stone. The next sound broke the silence like a bolt.\n'I - I'm sorry...' sputtered the voice of Emmeg Gro-Kayra. Malacath's eyes went wide as he looked upon the severed head, seeping blood from its wound, but somehow kept alive. Its eyes wavered about wildly, trying to focus on the aspect of Malacath before it. The once-proud eyes of the champion were choked with tears of grief, pain, and confused recognition.\nTo his horror, Malacath recognized only now that the man he had killed was not only one of his Orismer children, but very literally a son he had blessed an Orc maiden with years hence. For achingly long moments the two looked upon each other, despondent and shocked.\nThen, silent as oiled &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath strode into the clearing. He hefted Emmeg Gro-Kayra's disembodied head and bundled it into a small, grey sack. Sheogorath reclaimed Neb-Crescen from the corpse and turned to walk away. Malacath began to stand, but kneeled again, knowing he had irreversibly damned his own offspring to the realm of Sheogorath, and mourned his failure as the sound of his son's hoarse pleas faded into the frozen horizon."}

All he had was the terror and the void, and each night they filled him with a new understanding of death. Yet, when he woke, there was no fear, for he had faith that his Lady had a purpose.\nIndeed, one night Vaermina herself emerged from the void. She leaned in close to whisper into his ear.\n\"Watch carefully, my beloved!\" With that, she pulled the void away, and for hours each night she would reveal to Darius the most horrible perversions of nature. Men being skinned and eaten alive by other men, unimaginable beasts of many limbs and mouths, entire populations being burned -- their screams filled his every evening. In time, these visions gnawed at his soul, and his work began to take on the character of his nightmares. The images revealed to him at night were reproduced on the page, and the terrible cruelty and hollow vice that his work contained both revolted and fascinated the public. They reveled in their disgust over every detail. There were those who openly enjoyed his shocking material, and his popularity among some only fed the hatred of those who found him abhorrent. This continued for several years, while the infamy of Darius grew steadily. Then, in his 29th year, without warning, the dreams and nightmares ceased.\nDarius felt a weight lifted, as he no longer endured the nightly tortures, but was confused. \"What have I done to displease my Mistress?\", he wondered aloud. \"Why has she abandoned me?\" Vaermina never answered his prayers. No one ever answered, and the restless dreams faded away to leave Darius in long, deep sleeps.\nInterest in the works of Darius Shano waned. His prose became stale and his ideas failed to provoke the shock and outrage they once had. As the memory of his notoriety and of his terrible dreams faded, the questions that raced in his mind eventually produced resentment against Vaermina, his former mistress. Resentment grew into hatred, from hatred came ridicule, and over time ridicule became disbelief. Slowly it became obvious -- Vaermina had never spoken to him at all; his dreams were simply the product of a sick mind that had righted itself. He had been deceived by his own subconscious, and the anger and shame overwhelmed him. The man who once conversed with a deity drifted steadily into heresy.\nIn time, all of the bitterness, doubt, and sacrilege focused in Darius a creative philosophy that was threaded throughout all of his subsequent work. He challenged the Gods themselves, as well as the infantile public and corrupt state for worshiping them. He mocked them all with perverse caricatures, sparing no one and giving no quarter. He challenged the Gods in public to strike him down if they existed, and ridiculed them when no such comeuppance was delivered. To all of this, the people reacted with outrage far greater than they had shown his previous work. His early career had offended only sensibilities, but now he was striking directly at the heart of the people.\nHis body of work grew in size and intensity. Temples, nobles, and commoners were all targets of his scorn. Finally, at age 39, Darius wrote a piece entitled \"The Noblest Fool,\" ridiculing The Emperor God &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; for integrating into the pathetic &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; cult. The local King of &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt;, who had been humiliated by this upstart in the past, saw his chance -- for his sacrilege against the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Darius Shano was executed, with a ceremonial blade, in front of a cheering crowd of hundreds. His last, bitter words were gurgled through a mouthful of his own blood.\n20 years after their wager was first placed, Vaermina and Sheogorath met over Darius Shano's headless corpse. The Dreamweaver had been eager for this meeting; she had been waiting for years to confront the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; over his lack of action.\n\"I have been deceived by you, Sheogorath! I performed my half of the bargain, but during your ten years you never contacted the mortal once. He owes none of his greatness to you or your talents or your influence!\"\n\"Nonsense,\" croaked the Madgod. \"I was with him all along! When your time ended and mine began, your whispers in his ear were replaced with silence. I severed his link to that from which he found the most comfort and meaning, and withheld the very attention the creature so desperately craved. Without his mistress, this man's character could ripen under resentment and hatred. Now his bitterness is total and, overcome by a madness fueled by his rage, he feeds me in my realm as an eternal servant.\"\nSheogorath turned and spoke to the empty space by his side.\n\"Indeed; Darius Shano was a glorious mortal. Despised by his own people, his kings, and even by the Gods he mocked. For my success, I shall accept three-score followers of Vaermina into my service. And the dreamers will awaken as madmen.\"\nAnd thus did Sheogorath teach Vaermina that without madness, there are no dreams, and no creation. Vaermina will never forget this lesson."}

The Huntsman God materialized, for this was his day, and the boldness of Sheogorath intrigued him.\nWry without equal, Sheogorath holds in his realm giggling loons, flamboyant auteurs, and craven mutilators. The Mad Prince will ply profitless bargains and promote senseless bloodshed for nothing more than the joy of another's confusion, tragedy, or rage. So it was that Sheogorath had set a stage on which to play himself as rival to Hircine.\nWithout haste, the coy Prince proffered his contest; each Prince was to groom a beast to meet at this place again, three years to the hour, and do fatal battle. Expressionless behind his fearsome countenance, Hircine agreed, and with naught but a dusting of snow in the drift, the Princes were gone to their realms.\nConfident, but knowing Sheogorath for a trickster, Hircine secretly bred an abomination in his hidden realm. An ancient &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; he summoned, and imbued it with the foul curse of &lt;a href=\"lycanthropy\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;. Of pitch heart and jagged fang, the unspeakable horror had no peer, even among the great hunters of Hircine's sphere.\nIn the third year, on the given day, Hircine returned, where Sheogorath leaned, cross-legged on a stone, whistling with idle patience. The Prince of the Hunt struck his spear to the ground, bringing forth his unnatural, snarling behemoth. Doffing his cap, sly as ever, Sheogorath stood and stepped aside to reveal a tiny, colorful bird perched atop the stone. Demurely it chirped in the bristling gusts, scarcely audible.\nIn a twisted, springing heap, the Daedroth was upon the stone, leaving only rubble where the boulder had been. Thinking itself victorious, the monster's bloodied maw curled into a mock grin, when a subdued song drifted in the crisp air. The tiny bird lightly hopped along the snout of the furious Daedroth. Sheogorath looked on, quietly mirthful, as the diminutive creature picked at a bit of detritus caught in scales betwixt the fiery eyes of the larger beast. With howling fury, the were-thing blinded itself trying to pluck away the nuisance. And so it continued for hours, Hircine looking on in shame while his finest beast gradually destroyed itself in pursuit of the seemingly oblivious bird, all the while chirping a mournful tune to the lonesome range.\nLivid, but beaten, Hircine burned the ragged corpse and withdrew to his realm, swearing in forgotten tongues. His curses still hang in those peaks, and no wayfarer tarries for fear of his wrathful aspect in those obscured heights.\nTurning on his heel, Sheogorath beckoned the miniscule songbird to perch atop his shoulder, and strolled down the mountain, making for the warm breezes and vibrant sunsets of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20coast\"&gt;Abecean coast&lt;/a&gt;, whistling in tune with the tiniest champion in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "11053", "revid": "7075644", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11053", "title": "Sixteen Accords of Madness, Book XII", "text": "Sixteen Accords of Madness, Book XII is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nContents.\nMalacath's Tale.\nIn the days before the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium's&lt;/a&gt; founding, the spurned &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc-folk&lt;/a&gt; were subjected to ostracism and persecutions even more numerous and harsh than their progeny are accustomed to in our own age. So it was that many champions of the Orsimer traveled, enforcing what borders they could for the proliferation of their own people. Many of these champions are spoken of yet today, among them the Cursed Legion, Gromma the Hairless, and the noble Emmeg Gro-Kayra. This latter crusader would have certainly risen to legendary status throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, had he not been subject to the attention of certain &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEmmeg Gro-Kayra was the bastard son of a young maiden who was killed in childbirth. He was raised by the shaman of his tribe, the Grilikamaug in the peaks of what we now call &lt;a href=\"Normar%20Heights\"&gt;Normar Heights&lt;/a&gt;. Late in his fifteenth year, Emmeg forged by hand an ornate suit of &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Armor\"&gt;scaled armor&lt;/a&gt;, a rite of ascension among his tribe. On a blustery day, he pounded the final rivet, and draping a heavy cloak over the bulky mantle, Emmeg set out from his village for the last time. Word of his exploits always returned home, whether defending merchant caravans from brigands or liberating enslaved beast folk. News of the noble Orc crusader began to grace even the lips of &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, often with a tinge of fear.\nLess than two years after ascending to maturity, Gro-Kayra was making camp when a thin voice called out from the thickening night. He was surprised to hear the language of his people spoken by a tongue that obviously did not belong to an Orc.\n'Lord Kayra', said the voice, 'tales of your deeds have crossed the lips of many, and have reached my ears.' Peering into the murk, Emmeg made out the silhouette of a cloaked figure, made wavy and ephemeral by the hazy campfire. From the voice alone he had thought the interloper an old hag, but he now decided that he was in the presence of a man of slight and lanky build, though he could discern no further detail.\n'Perhaps,' the wary Orc began, 'but I seek no glory. Who are you?'\nIgnoring the question, the stranger continued, 'Despite that, Orsimer, glory finds you, and I bear a gift worthy of it.' The visitor's cloak parted slightly, revealing nothing but faintly glinting buttons in the pale moonlight, and a bundle was withdrawn and tossed to the side of the fire between the two. Emmeg cautiously removed the rags in which the object was swathed, and was dazzled to discover the item to be a wide, curved blade with ornately decorated handle. The weapon had heft, and Emmeg realized on brandishing it that the elaborate pommel disguised the more practical purpose of balancing the considerable weight of the blade itself. It was nothing much to look at in its present condition, thought the Orc, but once the tarnish was cleaned away and a few missing jewels restored, it would indeed be a blade worthy of a champion ten times his own worth.\n'Her name is 'Neb-Crescen' spoke the thin stranger, seeing the appreciation lighting Gro-Kayra's face. 'I got her for a horse and a secret in warmer climes, but in my old age I'd be lucky to even lift such a weapon. It's only proper that I pass her on to one such as yourself. To possess her is to change your life, forever.' Overcoming his initial infatuation with the arc of honed steel, Emmeg turned his attention back to the visitor.\n'Your words are fine, old man,' Emmeg said, not masking his suspicion, 'but I'm no fool. You traded for this blade once, and you'll trade for it again tonight. What is it that you want?' The stranger's shoulders slumped, and Emmeg was glad to have unveiled the true purpose of this twilight visit. He sat with him a while, eventually offering a stack of furs, warm food, and a handful of coins in exchange for the exotic weapon. By morning, the stranger was gone.\nIn the week following Emmeg's encounter with the stranger, Neb-Crescen had not left its scabbard. He had encountered no enemy in the woods, and his meals consisted of fowl and small game caught with &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;. The peace suited him fine, but on the seventh morning, while fog still crept between the low-hanging boughs, Emmeg's ears pricked up at the telltale crunch of a nearby footfall in the dense snow and forest debris.\nEmmeg's nostrils flared, but he was upwind. Being unable to see or smell his guest, and knowing that the breeze carried his scent in that direction, Emmeg's guard was up, and he cautiously drew Neb-Crescen from its sheath. Emmeg himself was not entirely sure of all that happened next.\nThe first moment of conscious memory in Emmeg Gro-Kayra's mind after drawing Neb-Crescen was the image of the curved blade sweeping through the air in front of him, spattering blood over the virginal powder coating the forest floor. The second memory was a feeling of frenzied bloodlust creeping over him, but it was then that he saw for the first time his victim, an Orc woman perhaps a few years younger than himself, her body a canvas of grisly wounds, enough to kill a strong man ten times over.\nEmmeg's disgust overwhelmed the madness that had overtaken him, and with all his will enlisted, he released Neb-Crescen from his grip and let the blade sail. With a discordant ringing it spun through the air and was buried in a snowdrift. Emmeg fled the scene in shame and horror, drawing the hood of his cloak up to hide himself from the judging eyes of the rising sun.\nThe scene where Emmeg Gro-Kayra had murdered one of his own kind was a macabre one. Below the neck, the body was flayed and mutilated almost beyond recognition, but the untouched face was frozen in a permanent expression of abject terror.\nIt was here that &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; performed certain rites that summoned &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, and the two Daedric Lords held court in the presence of the disfigured corpse.\n'Why show me this, Mad One?' began Malacath, once he recovered from his initial, wordless outrage. 'Do you take such pleasure in watching me grieve the murder of my children?' His guttural voice rumbled, and the patron of the Orismer looked upon his counterpart with accusing eyes.\n'By birth, she was yours, brother outcast,' began Sheogorath, solemn in aspect and demeanor. 'But she was a daughter of mine by her own habits. My mourning here is no less than your own, my outrage no less great.'\n'I am not so sure,' grumbled Malacath, 'but rest assured that vengeance for this crime is mine to reap. I expect no contest from you. Stand aside.' As the fearsome Prince began to push past him, Lord Sheogorath spoke again.\n'I have no intention of standing between you and vengeance. In fact, I mean to help you. I have servants in this wilderness, and can tell you just where to find our mutual foe. I ask only that you use a weapon of my choosing. Wound the criminal with my blade, and banish him to my plane, where I can exact my own punishment. The rights of honor-killing here belong to you.'\nWith that, Malacath agreed, took the wide blade from Sheogorath, and was gone.\nMalacath materialized in the path of the murderer, the cloaked figure obscured through a blizzard haze. Bellowing a curse so foul as to wilt the surrounding trees, the blade was drawn and Malacath crossed the distance more quickly than a wild &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;. Frothing with rage, he swung the blade in a smooth arc which lopped the head of his foe cleanly off, then plunged the blade up to its hilt in his chest, choking off the spurts of blood into a steady, growing stain of red bubbling from beneath the scaled armor and heavy cloak.\nPanting from the unexpected immediacy and fury of his own kill, Malacath rested on a knee as the body before him collapsed heavily backwards and the head landed roughly upon a broad, flat stone. The next sound broke the silence like a bolt.\n'I - I'm sorry...' sputtered the voice of Emmeg Gro-Kayra. Malacath's eyes went wide as he looked upon the severed head, seeping blood from its wound, but somehow kept alive. Its eyes wavered about wildly, trying to focus on the aspect of Malacath before it. The once-proud eyes of the champion were choked with tears of grief, pain, and confused recognition.\nTo his horror, Malacath recognized only now that the man he had killed was not only one of his Orismer children, but very literally a son he had blessed an Orc maiden with years hence. For achingly long moments the two looked upon each other, despondent and shocked.\nThen, silent as oiled &lt;a href=\"steel\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath strode into the clearing. He hefted Emmeg Gro-Kayra's disembodied head and bundled it into a small, grey sack. Sheogorath reclaimed Neb-Crescen from the corpse and turned to walk away. Malacath began to stand, but kneeled again, knowing he had irreversibly damned his own offspring to the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;realm of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, and mourned his failure as the sound of his son's hoarse pleas faded into the frozen horizon."}

At one stage in his life, he became the chieftain of his tribe, and in &lt;a href=\"2E%20533\"&gt;2E 533&lt;/a&gt; raised a massive horde and invaded Cyrodiil, seizing the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; with it. With this, he became the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, beginning a decades long dynasty of Reachmen Emperors known as the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;. He married &lt;a href=\"Veraxia%20Tharn\"&gt;Veraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of the prominent &lt;a href=\"Tharn%20Family\"&gt;Tharn&lt;/a&gt; family of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; to bring himself closer to power and to legitimize his claim to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Durcorach produced an heir, &lt;a href=\"Moricar\"&gt;Moricar&lt;/a&gt;, who later succeeded him. Moricar also had a son named &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, who was Durcorach's grandson. Despite this, Durcorach and his subsequent dynasty were hated by the populace of Cyrodiil because they were seen as alien and foreigners.\nInvasion of High Rock and Death.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 8 years into his reign, Durcorach began his own attempt at conquering &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Durcorach amassed an army of Reachmen from his tribe and ravaged the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. After only a three day siege, the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; was overrun, its lands pillaged and people slaughtered. &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; held out longer, but it too fell to the Reachmen hoard. Within a week or so, Bangkorai had been captured and Durcorach's horde crossed the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt; and headed towards &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe subsequent &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20542%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; lasted for 57 days. The &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; militia, led by &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, repulsed any attacks the Reachmen brought down upon the city. The newly constructed walls of Wayrest posed a big problem for the invaders, as the Reachmen lacked the proper siege equipment to assault the walls and lacked boats to corner and starve Wayrest from the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The siege ended in a stalemate, although Wayrest technically emerged as the victors. Ducorach lost his patience, leaving enough troops in the revetments around the city to keep them inside the city, and marched west into &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. The new city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; was taken by surprised and was sacked. Then Ducorach turned his eyes south, towards &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Reachmen massed at the gates of Daggerfall, they were taken utterly by surprise by &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, who personally led a charge into the rear of the Reachmen ranks. In the desperate fighting that ensued, Emeric slew Ducorach at the city's walls, before the Knights of Daggerfall emerged from the gates and finished what Emeric had started. Without their leader, the broken Reachmen army fled. As a direct result of the failed invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; was created two weeks later to prevent another foreign incursion into High Rock.\nDurcorach's heir Moricar inherited the throne after his father's death, and eventually the throne passed on to Durcorach's grandson Leovic, who ruled until &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt; when he took his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing is known of what happened to Veraxia Tharn."}

His wish was to raise armies of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; for his own ends, so he made a pact with the Ideal Masters to gain access to their realm's undead. The pact specified that Durnehviir was to serve as the keeper of the Soul Cairn, and guard &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt; until her eventual death - terms to which Durnehviir, being an immortal dragon, agreed. But the Ideal Masters had deceived Durnehviir, as Valerica was a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, and thus also immortal. As a result, Durnehviir was doomed to guard the Soul Cairn for eternity.\nPhysical appearance.\nDurnehviir is unique in appearance, and does not appear to be of any breed of Dragon previously encountered. His body bears a resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Dragon\"&gt;Frost Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, with massive protruding spikes from the back of his neck and extending down to his tail. Four horns sprout from his head.\nAs an undead Dragon, Durnehviir's flesh is greatly decayed and his wings look extremely weathered. He is grey-green in complexion, and his scales are constantly dripping and oozing. Flies can be seen around his body, and yellowish drool can be seen constantly dripping from his mouth.\nWhen he is defeated by the Dragonborn, his body burns with a unique, purplish fire, though his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; is not absorbed.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Death\"&gt;Beyond Death&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore receiving the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana's&lt;/a&gt; mother &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is attacked by Durnehviir on the way into the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29%23Boneyard\"&gt;Boneyard&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, his unique &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shout&lt;/a&gt; can summon several &lt;a href=\"Boneman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Bonemen&lt;/a&gt; to his aid. After he is defeated, his body burns and he disappears; Valerica warns that he is unable to truly die and may reappear.\nAfter exiting the Boneyard, Durnehviir is found waiting outside. He tells the Dragonborn that they were a worthy adversary and calls them \"Qahnaarin,\" or \"Vanquisher\" in Dragon Language. If the Dragonborn has not yet &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;killed their first dragon&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt;, Durnehviir will say that it was his instinct to call the hero \"Dovah\" and that time will possibly clear it up for both of them. If the Dragonborn has finished the main quest line, he will speak about how he heard of the Dragonborn slaying &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater. He then explains how he was fooled by the &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt; into becoming trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; for eternity.\nSummon Durnehviir.\nHe also explains that he wishes to fly through the skies of Tamriel once again, but that his ties to the Soul Cairn prevent him from leaving for long periods of time. He thus teaches the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Durnehviir\"&gt;Summon Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt; shout to summon him.\nThe first three times he is summoned, he will teach the words for his Dragon Shout, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Tear%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Tear&lt;/a&gt;. As with all shouts, they must be unlocked with acquired &lt;a href=\"dragon%20soul\"&gt;dragon soul&lt;/a&gt;s.\n1st summon.\nAh! The free air of Vus at long last. As promised, I now teach you the first word of Soul Tearing: \"\" - the essence of your enemy's life force.\n2nd summon.\nI can feel my strength returning each time I am set free from that prison! Hear now the second word of Soul Tearing: \"\" - meaning to tear your enemy's soul from its living vessel.\n3rd summon.\nYou have kept your side of the bargain, now let me fulfill mine. Feel the last word of Soul Tearing within yourself: \"\" - the unlife that results when a soul is imprisoned in dead flesh.\nAfter this, whenever summoned, Durnehviir can aid the Dragonborn in battle. Durnehviir is the only Dragon able to use a unique shout that lets him summon Bonemen, &lt;a href=\"Mistmen\"&gt;Mistmen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrathman%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Wrathmen&lt;/a&gt;. The name of the Shout is &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20Summon\"&gt;Soul Cairn Summon&lt;/a&gt;, and the words of power are DIIL QOTH ZAAM \"(Undead, Tomb, Slave)\".\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Beyond%20Death\"&gt;Beyond Death&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Stay your weapons. I would speak with you, Qahnaarin.\"\nHow did you end up in the Soul Cairn? \"There was a time when I called Tamriel my home. But those days have long since passed. The dovah roamed the skies, vying for their small slices of territory that resulted in immense and ultimately fatal battles.\"\nWhy do you call me \"Qahnaarin?\" \"In my language, the Qahnaarin is the Vanquisher, the one who has bested a fellow dovah in battle.\""}

Dusk was originally an isolated tower, hidden in the southern mountains, but it has grown into a fully-fledged city-state.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nDusk Keep is situated on the southeastern coast of the Isle of Summerset, within a hidden rocky coastline off the road near &lt;a href=\"Sil-Var-Woad\"&gt;Sil-Var-Woad&lt;/a&gt;. The path that leads to Dusk Keep is filled with shallow water between the main island and an undisclosed island with no discernable landmarks, except for an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Geyser\"&gt;Abyssal Geyser&lt;/a&gt; on the northern end. On the lower end of the path, there is a dirt road that ascends to Dusk Keep. Silver Coral dots the shallow waters and trees extend along the mountain. The Dusk Keep overlooks the southern ocean, towards southern continents such as &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;. Dusk Keep is a typically Altmeri spire, that elevates all the way to the top, with four small towers holding it together. The tower is built on a rock formation in the water. It is connected to the main island by a large bridge, typical in the mainland Summerset cities. Beneath the arches of the bridge is a still lit campfire.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.

Grabbing the fragment causes the draugr in the room to attack, though there are 19 sarcophagi only 17 are inhabited by draugr. There are several urns and a chest in the altar room. To exit the dungeon, take the stairs to the upper level in the altar room and go through the opening in one of the coffins.

To see men and women the size of large children, all with beards, would be a most disturbing sight. Still, whatever wrath the Dwarves brought from the gods that consumed an entire civilization surely must have been an awe-inspiring thing to witness.\nThe remnants of their civilization lie buried in the hearts of mountains. Scholars and thieves the world over descend on the skeletal remains of Dwarven cities like vultures to scrape clean the bones of the past, old knowledge waiting to be exhumed, and treasures to be discovered. But many men lie murdered in those halls of the damned, because those &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven ruins&lt;/a&gt; do not release their treasures without a fight.\nMy kin would tell stories long ago, when I was just a child, about how adept the Dwarves were at building &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;machines&lt;/a&gt;. They would say that before our time, Dwarves harnessed the power of the earth. They wielded fire and hammers to reshape steel and bronze with a mechanical brilliance that breathed life into these now ancient constructs of metal and magic. In their dark halls and chambers, amid the ceaseless droning of grinding gears and venting steam, they lie in wait to confound or destroy would-be plunderers of the Dwarven sanctums, as the grim watchmen of the last vestiges of culture from a dead race.\nI descended into the humid darkness of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;. The slow hiss of steam, creaking of metal, and rattle of old gears powering an empty city would unnerve most men. I could hear things in the darkness, skittering across the floor just out of sight as I stepped over the bodies of plunderers or scholars who had not made it far. I knew it was not rats wandering these halls.\nSmall mechanical spiders set upon me with rapid movements. Machines sprouted from the walls and uncurled from spheres into contraptions that rolled on top of gears for legs and crossbows for arms. I could not help but marvel at these single purpose machines built for the murder of men. My sword and my shield are my strength, and I am undeterred by such things. I had heard of greater things roaming these depths, and indeed, something else in these chambers stirred, and it echoed with massive weight. As it lumbered closer, its feet struck the ground as if walking on massive pistons. As it loomed out of darkness, I could see it clear for the first time, axe for one hand, hammer for the other, as tall as five men, made of dull bronze with a face molded in the image of its masters. A &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Steam Centurion&lt;/a&gt;. The stories were true. These were the guardians of the greatest Dwarven treasures.\nWe fought, and the Dwarves must truly be extinct, because our battle was surely booming enough to wake the dead. It came at me with hammer and axe, inhuman strength, great fortitude, and a purpose of nothing but murder. I dodged as it crushed the stone around me with futile strikes. I thrust and slashed at it with my blade and took every opening afforded as we shook the halls with violence. I refuse to be undone by a machine.\nWhere the average man would be long dead, I stood over the husk of this dead automaton, its steam escaping like a final gasp. I could have taken the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20artifacts\"&gt;Dwarven artifacts&lt;/a&gt; and metal, but I left them there for others, for I would not hex my journey with the possessions of dead men. Maybe that is where countless others go wrong.\nI will continue on my journey across the lands. Perhaps one day Herebane will meet a worthy challenge, for I have yet to see what would make me tremble."}

Their giant bodies, undoubtedly designed for &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, are constructed of solid Dwemer blocks and armored with thick dwarven plates. Their arms are equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Warhammer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Warhammer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Battleaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Battleaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Their enormous body makes them move slowly, but this is balanced by the ability to take lots of damage and use very powerful attacks, making them extremely dangerous to low-level opponents.\nOf all the &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt; left behind by the ancient Dwemer, the Dwarven Centurions are the most elaborately constructed, well-armed, defensive, and arguably the most dangerous.\nCombat behavior.\nCenturions prefer to stay within melee range, which can stagger the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to other &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Dwemer automatons&lt;/a&gt;, they have a very high damage resistance. Like the other Dwemer automatons, they are highly resistant to magic and ranged attacks. Centurions can fire steam\u2014which is their only ranged attack\u2014as well as fight at melee range. The only weakness of the centurion is its lack of speed. Fire magic is useful against centurions, just as with other Dwemer automatons.\nThe steam attack fired by the centurion is considered a magical attack for purposes of magic resistance; a high magic resistance will significantly reduce the damage caused by the steam. A centurion's steam attack is a medium to short ranged weapon and can usually be avoided by staying out of range, but the attack can pass through doors and damage the Dragonborn on the other side.\nSubtypes.\nThere are three different models of Dwarven centurions.\nDwarven Centurion.\nThe basic centurions. They attack with melee and steam attacks, though have relatively low health compared to the other types.\nDwarven Centurion Guardian.\nThese use powerful melee attacks, as well as spraying hot steam at their opponents.\nDwarven Centurion Master.\nThe Centurion Master features a lot of armor, as well as the capability to do more damage to their opponents with attacks. This model also attacks with melee and steam.\nThe Forgemaster.\nA unique boss called the &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgemaster%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Forgemaster&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20to%20the%20Ages\"&gt;Lost to the Ages&lt;/a&gt;\" with the addition of . It is larger than normal centurions and spits fire instead of steam. It is also more resistant to fire than other centurions, but it has a weakness to frost."}

The Argonians attacked right down the center from the south, driving the Akaviri towards the sea where they were drowned or slain to the last man.\nThe Rift.\nHeita-Meen also had a minor role in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;, appearing with other &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; allies at the battle for &lt;a href=\"Honrich%20Tower\"&gt;Honrich Tower&lt;/a&gt;."}

He also refers to the dog as a \"war-dog,\" and rightfully so as he is from a litter of dogs that were bred for combat and protection.\nInteractions.\nFollower.\nAt the Markarth stables the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will encounter a man by the name of &lt;a href=\"Banning\"&gt;Banning&lt;/a&gt;, who offers the option to purchase the dog for 500 . It is also possible to ask a few questions about Vigilance. The dog is similar to a mercenary, as it must be paid the 500 fee each time it is requested to rejoin the Dragonborn.\nPet.\nVigilance can become a pet and stay at Dragonborn's home. With Vigilance as home pet, it can be asked to follow Dragonborn without having to pay the 500 .\nCombat.\nVigilance is fast and agile, meaning he can track down enemies rather easily. However, he inflicts very low damage on enemies. He also has the tendency to dart towards an enemy, which can be an annoyance for those who prefer ranged combat. However, if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; focuses on melee attacks, Vigilance can make a great distraction. Note that Vigilance has absolutely no armor rating and will go down rather fast to physical attacks.\nLike every other companion, Vigilance changes stance when the Dragonborn draws their hands, weapons, or spells. Instead of drawing a weapon like other followers, though, Vigilance starts to snarl and lower his body, creating an intimidating look.\nVigilance will level with the Dragonborn up to level 50 where he will have 500 &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, twice as much as &lt;a href=\"Meeko\"&gt;Meeko&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"stray%20dog\"&gt;stray dog&lt;/a&gt;s.

Long believed to be lost to time, it was recently uncovered by mining prospectors near &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;, after discovering a new deposit of &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon discovery, the miners say they witnessed a \"ghost, clad head to toe in armor\". While this alone was cause for concern, what they said next was even more foreboding: the spirit wielded a massive blade which seemed to whisper to them in their minds. This hints at the workings of a powerful Daedric artifact.\nThe only relic that matches this description is Umbra, once believed to be lost or, by some accounts, destroyed. Umbra is a sentient weapon who corrupts its bearer and compels them to a kill so that the blade may feast on the souls of those it slays. It appears to have resurfaced here, though why I cannot say.\nIf the apparition that haunts this site truly is the resurgence of Umbra, then it has grown very powerful, and Shor's Stone is in grave danger."}

The ruins of Rielle, specifically. They also asked about &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, which haven't been seen for hundreds of years.\nI'm sending a few scouts to the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; to keep an eye on things.

This time under the cover of night. They were followed but were lost in the shadow. Our agents set up a blockade to stop and question all who passed, but the group was not seen traveling through there again.\nIf they did return to Skyrim, they would have had to do so through the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; by moonlight. &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; have mercy upon anyone lost among those jagged slopes in the darkness.\n3rd Last Seed, 4E 201\nThe researcher in Bruma has gone missing, and I must assume it was at the hands of these mysterious travelers. If the rumors of the Mythic Dawn are true, Stendarr help us if they get their hands on a Great Welkynd Stone. What could they possibly need such a powerful artifact for?\nI have dispatched agents and spies to every corner of Skyrim to inquire among the townsfolk and track anyone who is remotely suspicious.\n10th Last Seed, 4E 201\nWe have begun following a man named Skorvild. We believe he may be a Daedra worshipper, and possibly a member of the Mythic Dawn. His brother was recently reported missing, along with numerous others in the same time frame.\nWe will follow his actions closely.\n16th Last Seed, 4E 201\nAfter several weeks of observing various suspects, we decided to capture an individual believed to be a high ranking member of the Mythic Dawn. She was clothed plainly, and kept the guise of a merchant by day.\nWe searched her quarters and found red robes bearing the sun symbol of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. We also found a journal which claims that an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gates\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; has been reforged, and attempts to open it are underway.\nI have decided to call for reinforcements. If what I read is true, the &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigil of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; alone may not be enough to stop what is unfolding.\nThis Mythic Dawn priest would not yield any information, and died during interrogation. It was a slow death, but the Vigil has no mercy for Daedra worshippers.\nCan the power of a Great Welkynd Stone be corrupted and used for their twisted purpose? This cannot happen. We must find this Oblivion Gate.\nWithin the journal was a &lt;a href=\"Torn%20Page%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;torn page&lt;/a&gt;, containing the following:\n\"In the shade of Velothi, where rivers run black &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; at our feet, Whiteshore at our back\n&lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; at our shoulders, beyond the fair night Before the dawn rises, red scars bleed the light\"\nThis could be a clue as to their location. I will send someone to investigate while I prepare a small regiment and determine our next move.\n17th Last Seed, 4E 201\nThree of my agents who were observing suspects went missing overnight. I believe they have been captured by the Mythic Dawn. Stendarr have mercy upon them. We should have been more careful when capturing one of their priests, but we needed to act quickly.\nI have assembled a group to descend upon Rielle. We must act now.

Despite this, most of the voluntarily Vigilants agreed that the discovery of Moric was not worth the effort, their attitude changed when word came that the main chamber had been hit. Which turned out to be a lie in order to draw more Vigilants to the ruin.

The Vigilants consider the Daedra profane creatures with no hope of redemption, believing they lure people to their deaths and corrupt their souls with a touch. For this reason the Vigilants try to hunt for &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20artifacts\"&gt;Daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prevent them from creating chaos and havoc on Tamriel. These artifacts, if found, are then brought to the Hall of the Vigilants, in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. If Vigilants believe Daedra worshippers are located in a house, they enter the building armed with a weapon in order to hunt them down.\nThe Vigilants are also willing to cure &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;d people from their ailments, so long as they promise to never work with the Daedra.

Vitellus died during a contract involving &lt;a href=\"Azani%20Blackheart%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Azani Blackheart&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since his death, Vilena has slacked on her duties as Guildmaster and refuses to send her younger son Viranus on any further jobs, fearing that something will happen to him as well.\nHer new attitude has caused many members of the guild to worry. The guild has always been connected to the Donton family, and with her refusal to let her son work, there is no leadership. Most of her duty has been taken up by &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt;, another member of the Guild.\nInteractions.\nVilena is one of the people who can accept new members into the guild. She will not accept any player with either high &lt;a href=\"infamy\"&gt;infamy&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; on their heads.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; reaches the rank of Journeyman, they will be pointed to Vilena to discuss how the actions of one guild member affects the guild as a whole; she will then point the Hero to Modryn and continue her daily routine.\nAfter the discovery of her son at &lt;a href=\"Trolls%20of%20Forsaken%20Mine\"&gt;Forsaken Mine&lt;/a&gt;, Vilena will blame the Hero and demote them (and fire Modryn for his part). From this point on, she has a very poor relationship with the Hero, and will not initiate further dialogue with them.\nAfter the demotion, several guild members start working in secret behind Vilena's back to find out what really happened to Viranus and the other guild members at &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Mine\"&gt;Forsaken Mine&lt;/a&gt;. They start looking for ways to stop the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; from stealing any more contracts.\nAfter the Hero stops the Blackwood Company and kills their leaders, they will reveal the truth. Despite being angry over the Hero defying her commands, she will see that her overprotective attitude was killing the guild and that it is time she stepped down and place a member who can lead the guild in charge. She will promote the Hero to &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; and restore Modryn's rank before retiring.\n&lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Business%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilena Donton sends the Hero to &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. She tells them that a rather undependable Guildmate named &lt;a href=\"Maglir\"&gt;Maglir&lt;/a&gt; has defaulted on a contract to recover a &lt;a href=\"Brenus%20Astis%27%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; from a mine infested with &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.

After opening a gate, they find a settlement which is inhabited by three more mercenaries. Advancing outside the village, three regular Forest Spiders and one Giant Forest Spider must be slain to continue. After defeating the spider, yet another small camp housing two mercenaries is found.

Going left follows the quest marker, while advancing further forwards leads to a Spriggan Matron.\nFollowing the left route, a cave is found with a Giant Cave Spider at the entrance. Inside the cave, a ruin is found with a mercenary being blocked by a locked door. Smashing the nearby urn provides the key.

He is the Master at Arms of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; and a member of &lt;a href=\"the%20Circle\"&gt;the Circle&lt;/a&gt;, the most formidable and experienced of their warriors. Like the rest of the Companions, he lives in &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt; in the Wind District of Whiterun. He is a Master-level &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; weaponry and serves as the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;shield-brother&lt;/a&gt; in several of the Companions' quests. He is also one of the Companions who can assign radiant quests to the Dragonborn.\nUpon completion of the Companions' main plotline, Vilkas can be recruited as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; and becomes a potential &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; candidate. He can be &lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Blades\"&gt;recruited&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn talks to &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; while having him as a follower, or as a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; if the DLC has been installed.\nBackground.\nVilkas and his twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Farkas\"&gt;Farkas&lt;/a&gt;, were both raised in Jorrvaskr by Jergen, who rescued them from a cult of necromancers. It is unknown if he was their biological father. According to Vilkas, Jergen left to fight in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; but never returned.\nEventually, Vilkas and\u00a0Farkas both officially joined the\u00a0Companions and rose to the ranks of the Circle. They were said to be the youngest members to ever join, though this may be a play on words by &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the twins' young age during their residence at Jorrvaskr rather than the age at which their membership became official.\nAs Master at Arms, Vilkas is in charge of training the younger members in weapon combat. He has a reputation of being hard on his students but is an excellent teacher.\nPersonality.\nAt first, Vilkas seems to think the Dragonborn is not worthy of being a Companion. He does eventually warm up to the idea after the\u00a0completion of \"Glory of the Dead.\"\nVilkas is well-spoken, and considered to be an intelligent man by the other Companions, the counterpart to his brother's physical prowess. He, along with his brother and Kodlak, resists the call of the beast-blood, choosing instead to refrain from transformations. However, he struggles with the side-effects more harshly than the others.\nHe resents Jergen leaving them, and looks down on his brother's rosy description of their childhood. He at first claims that it is the promise of coin that feeds his blade, but later admits his respect for what the Companions represent and upholding the legacy of Ysgramor. He has great respect for Kodlak and trusts his judgement, even when it disagrees with his own.\nVilkas is also thought of as a hot-tempered man. For example, during \"Purity of Revenge,\" he does not hesitate to avenge Kodlak's death. However, he does later show remorse for his rash actions, as seen in \"Glory of the Dead,\" during which he refuses to enter the rest of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, feeling himself unworthy.\nAfter the Companions' main questline is completed, Vilkas will eventually give the quest\u00a0\"Purity.\" In this quest, he will ask the Dragonborn to cure him of beast blood.\nHe wears a set of &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wolf Armor&lt;/a&gt; minus the helmet, and carries a &lt;a href=\"Vilkas%27s%20Sword\"&gt;unique Skyforge steel sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banded%20Iron%20Shield\"&gt;banded iron shield&lt;/a&gt;. After the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;,\" he carries a &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20Steel%20Greatsword\"&gt;Skyforge steel greatsword&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt; and after \"&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;,\" Vilkas can be randomly encountered in the wilds of Skyrim traveling with fellow Companion &lt;a href=\"Ria\"&gt;Ria&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dragonborn first approaches &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; to join the Companions, he and Vilkas are having a private conversation. Kodlak assigns Vilkas the task of testing the Dragonborn's skill. Vilkas escorts the Dragonborn to the training yard and endures a few swings, then tells the Dragonborn to deliver his sword to the Skyforge for sharpening.\n&lt;a href=\"Escaped%20Criminal\"&gt;Escaped Criminal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this radiant quest, Vilkas requires the Dragonborn to track down and kill an escaped prisoner in a specific hold.\n&lt;a href=\"Family%20Heirloom\"&gt;Family Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis radiant quest requires the Dragonborn to retrieve a random weapon or item from a radiant dungeon and deliver it back to Vilkas for payment.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Mission\"&gt;Rescue Mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn this radiant quest, Vilkas requires the Dragonborn to rescue a kidnapped citizen and escort the citizen home safely.\n&lt;a href=\"Purity%20of%20Revenge\"&gt;Purity of Revenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Vilkas informs the Dragonborn of Kodlak's death, he demands they accompany him to &lt;a href=\"Driftshade%20Refuge\"&gt;Driftshade Refuge&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Fragments%20of%20Wuuthrad\"&gt;Fragments of Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; and wipe out the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. Once the mission is complete and the two have returned to Whiterun, he informs the Dragonborn that all the Companions are meeting at the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt; for Kodlak's funeral.\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Kodlak's funeral, Vilkas accompanies the remaining members of the Circle to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt;. When the Dragonborn enters, he and Aela are arguing about granting Kodlak's final wish. The decision is made for the Circle to travel to &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; and cure Kodlak's spirit of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; so he may ascend to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Circle arrives and the tomb is opened, Vilkas chooses not to proceed, due to his grief clouding his judgement and making him unworthy. He cautions the others on what to expect and waits next to the statue of Ysgramor outside the burial chamber. Once the quest is complete, Vilkas decides to stay at the tomb with the other Circle members for a while.\n&lt;a href=\"Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilkas wishes to rid himself of his beast blood. To cure him, the Dragonborn must take him to Ysgramor's Tomb, throw a &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witch%20Head\"&gt;Glenmoril Witch Head&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0into the\u00a0fire, and then kill Vilkas's beast spirit.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Seekers\"&gt;Dragon Seekers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Vilkas's beast blood is removed, the Dragonborn can speak to him again for more radiant quests. Eventually, he will have the quest Dragon Seekers for the Dragonborn, indicated by the speech option \"Is there any work to be done?\"\nVilkas will tell the Dragonborn of people coming to Whiterun with rumors of dragons, and how he would like to see one for himself. He will then give the Dragonborn the location of one of the Word Walls to travel to and kill the dragon located there.\u00a0Once complete, he will elect to remain behind for a while so he can pay the proper respects to the fallen dragon.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Bonds%20of%20Matrimony\"&gt;The Bonds of Matrimony&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilkas is eligible for\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0after completion of the Companions' questline, if an &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Amulet of Mara&lt;/a&gt; is worn when talking to him:\n\"An Amulet of Mara? You're not married? [surprised chuckle] Surprising.\"\nInterested in me, are you? \"I am. I'd be glad to stand by your side until the Divines take us, i..if you'll have me.\"\nServices.\nTwo-Handed Training.\nVilkas can train up to level 90 in &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf recruited as a follower, his services as a trainer are still available. Any &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; paid can be taken out of his inventory afterwards, effectively making the training free.\nFollower.\nAs a follower, Vilkas has no tolerance for crime. If the Dragonborn has a bounty in any hold, Vilkas will draw his sword and advance on the Dragonborn, but will not attack unless provoked.\nDialogue.\n\"Great, another ambitious visitor. You think you can just wander in here and join us?\"\nConversations.\nLycanthropy.\nVilkas: \"But I still hear the call of the blood.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak&lt;/a&gt;: \"We all do. It is our burden to bear. But we can overcome.\"\nVilkas: \"You have my brother and I, obviously. But I don't know if the rest will go along quite so easily.\"\nKodlak: \"Leave that to me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilkas: \"Master, you're not truly considering accepting him?\"\nKodlak: \"I am nobody's master, Vilkas. And last I checked, we had some empty beds in Jorrvaskr for those with a fire burning in their hearts.\"\nVilkas: \"Apologies. But perhaps this isn't the time. I've never even heard of this outsider.\"\nKodlak: \"Sometimes the famous come to us. Sometimes men and women come to us to seek their fame. It makes no difference. What matters is their heart.\"\nVilkas: \"\"And their arm.\"\n[After speaking to Kodlak]\nKodlak: \"Vilkas, take him out to the yard and see what he can do.\"\nVilkas: \"Aye.\"\nKodlak's Burial.\nEorlund: \"Who will start?\"\nAela: \"I'll do it.

Members of the Circle, let us withdraw to the Underforge, to grieve our last together.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nVilkas: \"The old man had one wish before he died. And he didn't get it. It's as simple as that.\"\nAela: \"Being moon-born is not so much of a curse as you might think, Vilkas.\"\nVilkas: \"That's fine for you. But he wanted to be clean. He wanted to meet Ysgramor and know the glories of Sovngarde. But all that was taken from him.\"\nAela: \"And you avenged him.\"\nFarkas: \"Kodlak did not care for vengeance.\"\nVilkas: \"No, Farkas, he didn't. And that's not what this is about. We should be honoring Kodlak, no matter our own thoughts on the blood.\"\nAela: \"You're right. It's what he wanted, and he deserved to have it.\"\nVilkas: \"Kodlak used to speak of a way to cleanse his soul, even in death. You know the legends of the Tomb of Ysgramor.\"\nAela: \"There the souls of Harbingers will heed the call of northern steel. We can't even enter the tomb without Wuuthrad, and it's in pieces, like it has been for a thousand years.\"\nEorlund: \"And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim. Just because something is, doesn't mean it must be. The blade is a weapon. A tool. Tools are meant to be broken. And repaired.\"\nVilkas: \"Is that? Did you repair the blade?\"\nEorlund: \"\"This is the first time I've had all the pieces, thanks to our Shield-Brother here. \"The flames of a hero can reforge the shattered.\" The flames of Kodlak shall fuel the rebirth of Wuuthrad. And now it will take you to meet him once more. As the one who bore the fragments, I think should be the one to carry Wuuthrad into battle.

Also, typical with most Ayleid Ruins, there are numerous &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt; in Wendesel and an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Statue\"&gt;Ayleid Statue&lt;/a&gt; in Sel Sancremathi.\nThe first level is inhabited by bandits, while the second, third and fourth levels are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.

Among the treasure in this room is one guaranteed random &lt;a href=\"magical%20item\"&gt;magical item&lt;/a&gt;.

Sure, the villagers say that their friends and family members have gone missing, but my father says they probably just left to avoid the plague. Oh, right, and then there's the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos plague&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm not too worried about that, either. My father's the House Minister! He won't let anyone that's part of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; get sick, especially not his darling daughter. (That's me!)\nI saw a recruiting pamphlet for the Maulborn today. They were distributing them outside the gates of town. They say they're here to help, but I think there's something creepy about them. And I certainly don't like the outfits they make all their members wear. It's like they're some kind of an army or something. Still, there were a couple of cute-looking members wandering around down by the lake. I wonder what they like to do for fun when they're not saving the world? Maybe I'll sneak down there one night and take a look.\nThere's a stranger in town. Finally, someone interesting to talk to! I can't wait to talk to the stranger. Hear about news from distant lands, listen to stories of thrilling adventures and forbidden romance. Maybe my father will let me invite the stranger over for dinner. That would be exciting! But it would be more exciting if we could go somewhere quiet, just the two of us. I need to think about that. I'm sure I can work out a way to make that happen.\nI'll tell you all about it next time, Diary!\n\u2014 &lt;a href=\"Vim%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Vim Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;"}

If it's lost, look for a new one in any of the bandits back packs.\nHead over to the ruin and fight any enemies until they reach the inner court where the Bloodthorn Envoy Caoiss is. Fight and defeat him and return to the Lion Guard camp. Provost Piper suspect something happened as he saw the commotion over at the ruins. He is pleased of the outcome as an alliance between those two groups is not good. He also decided to let Kip and his family go as he couldn't stand seeing his wife and daughter so distressed."}

In addition to her constant fretting, Viola seems to have an obsession with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Lonely-Gale\"&gt;Captain Lonely-Gale&lt;/a&gt;, the retired ship captain living in the city; he can frequently be heard complaining about her bugging him for one reason or another. Viola does bother the Captain quite often, with trivial questions regarding lovers and the recent murders. &lt;a href=\"Elda%20Early-Dawn\"&gt;Elda Early-Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the Captain can be seen conversing in Candlehearth Hall about his various troubles, Viola amongst them.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"That%20Was%20Always%20There\"&gt;That Was Always There&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Revyn%20Sadri\"&gt;Revyn Sadri&lt;/a&gt; asks the Dragonborn to return &lt;a href=\"Viola%27s%20Gold%20Ring\"&gt;Viola's Gold Ring&lt;/a&gt; to her house in Windhelm. Master\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; is required. Viola can be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed for the key. Returning the ring to Viola in person prompts her to warn &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm about Revyn's theft, stating that she will convince the Jarl to raise his taxes.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must investigate a series of murders that have occurred in Windhelm.

I think it's yours. \"Oh, really? So that Dark Elf took my ring. So typical of his kind. I think the Jarl should hear about this. Maybe double his taxes. No, triple them.

Captain, can you spare a moment? I heard something the other day I wanted to share with you.\"\nLonely-Gale: \"What did you hear?\"\nViola: \"It was an old Nord proverb. It said the best way to get over the loss of a lover is to find a new one.\"\nLonely-Gale: \"I didn't lose a lover, Viola; I lost my wife. It's not the same thing.\"\nViola: \"Well, if it works in the one case, why not the other? Don't you want to at least give it a try?\"\nLonely-Gale: \"No, I really don't. It'll be a while before I'm ready for that. I'll be on my way now.\"\nViola: \"Captain Lonely-Gale, I-I've been looking for you everywhere!\"\nLonely-Gale: \"And now you've found me. Can I help you?\"\nViola: \"Have you thought about my invitation?\"\nLonely-Gale: \"I've thought about it, but I'm not sure it's such a good idea.\"\nViola: \"Oh, I see. Is it still too soon?\"\nLonely-Gale: \"Yes, I think that must be it. My wife hasn't been gone that long, after all. Ask me again on another day.\"\nViola: \"I'm sorry to be such a bother. We'll talk another time.\"\nViola: \"Captain. Captain!\"\nLonely-Gale: \"What is it now, Viola?\"\nViola: \"Did you notice that the snow settles in a different direction near the murder sites?\"\nLonely-Gale: \"Don't you think all your tramping around there investigating might have something to do with it?\"\nViola: \"I... well... perhaps. But still, it's curious.\"\nViola: \"Do you think those Dark Elves had anything to do with the murders? The attacks all happened at night, after all.\"\nLonely-Gale: \"Viola, Dark Elves sleep, just like the rest of us.\"\nViola: \"You wouldn't think it from the racket that Cornerclub makes.\"\nLonely-Gale: \"I'm sure the guards have the matter well in hand.

Real easy, but there wasn't any loot. But one monk, he was a squealing type. Put a knife to his throat and he sang like nirnroot.\nThe monk tells us there's a secret compartment in the carriage. We pop it open, and find the shiniest set of weapons and armor I ever laid my eyes upon. The kind you have to squint to look at it.\nWhen we got back to camp, first thing I did was try on a boot. Funny thing is, it didn't fit. I swear it was the right size, but Remy laughs and snatches it from me, saying some rubbish about how only real warriors can wear real armor.\nExcept on him, they wouldn't fit him neither. Soon the whole crew is trying on the set, but no matter the piece, no matter the size, they can't keep it on. Some manage to get on for a second, right up until the color goes out on their face.\nAnd it ain't just the armor. You try and swing one of the weapons, and you feel sick to your stomach. Like the thing don't want you wielding it.\nSo we're all sitting by the campfire, out of ideas, when , the new blood, gets the idea to have their new kin Eigorn try the armor on. Everyone laughs.\nThe kid ain't even one of the crew, just some green little bastard who decided to tag along for the raid. Like , they ain't even killed their first man yet. But lo and behold, the kid tries on the boot, and the damn thing fits.\n\"I guess Eigorn's part of the crew now,\" says, but the pup ain't having it. Turns out, they ain't wanna do the work! They don't even LIKE being a bandit.\nSo I tell , either the kid fights with us, or I slit their throat. I'm about to do it, when , that bloody traitor, picks up the big shiny mace and nearly clobbers my head off.\nLuckily the rest of the crew was there to keep that mace from turning my skull into porridge. But that's when I get the idea to try the armor on . And by the Nine, it fits that bastard too.\nWhich brings us to where we are now. The two of them are following orders, sure, but I don't trust them one bit. It's not just about the armor. been talking nonsense for a while now, saying we should let people go like they ain't bloody witnesses.\nRemy pointed out that we just need them to wear the armor, and look all intimidating like. The crew will do the rest. But that ain't gonna cut it. I want to test them. If we get into a fight, I need to know the person standing next to me is willing to kill a man if they have to.\nAnd if either of them refuse, we kill them both."}

He lives with his mother in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, and is watched over mostly by &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe usually polishes weapons or trains with the guild's newest members in any effort to keep himself skilled. It is said that he is a capable warrior, but won't be able to get any better if he is held back by his mother.\nBackground.\nViranus' brother, &lt;a href=\"Vitellus%20Donton\"&gt;Vitellus&lt;/a&gt;, was killed after a botched mission led by Oreyn. Since that time, his mother took a defensive stance in Viranus' upbringing in the guild. Afraid of losing her remaining son, he was never assigned any contracts: rather, he was assigned to aiding the training of other members.\nAfter several weeks of this, Viranus began wondering if his mother's fear of losing him were stemmed from any sign of incompetence. Sensing this, Oreyn took every opportunity he could to assign Viranus obscure contracts to boost his self-confidence. At one point, he sends Viranus along with the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nViranus' days were not meant to last, however. Oreyn sent him on yet another contract with a group of others, to clear the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Mine\"&gt;Forsaken Mine&lt;/a&gt; just south of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. After not hearing word of the group since, the Hero is sent to investigate in the \"&lt;a href=\"Trolls%20of%20Forsaken%20Mine\"&gt;Trolls of Forsaken Mine&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, where it is learned that all the members of the group, including Viranus, were killed.\nAt first glance it seems that &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt; killed them, however upon closer inspection a &lt;a href=\"A%20Bloody%20Journal\"&gt;bloodstained journal&lt;/a&gt; can be found and, when read, will reveal that they were killed by &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries. A few of said companies corpses will also be found. The news of the loss of Vilena Donton's remaining son invokes her to expel Oreyn from the Fighter's Guild, as well as demoting the Hero two ranks.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Son\"&gt;The Master's Son&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fighters Guild has been hired to find &lt;a href=\"Galtus%20Previa\"&gt;Galtus Previa&lt;/a&gt;, and Viranus Donton needs a confidence boost. Modryn Oreyn asks the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to assist and bring back Viranus alive.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Son\"&gt;The Master's Son&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Greetings, guildmate.

However, before he could learn more, something blocked his magic.\nWalkthrough.\nOnce the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; enters the library, they must walk through the hall. When doing so, they will be paralyzed, and will awaken in a prison. After speaking to Tedras Relvi, the Vestige will encounter a familiar, who is sent to help them and their compatriots; the familiar will open a portal to the instruction halls.\nAfter entering the portal, the Vestige must find Hadmar the Thin-Boned, who can be found in the instructor housing. After this, the Vestige must find Lena's lockbox. When exiting the instructor housing, they will encounter enemy mages, comprised of the Maulborn's own mages, as well as entranced novice mages.\nIn order to find the lockbox, face the large rock exactly to the north a short distance from Hadmar's totem. The Vestige must use the totem to launch themself onto the rock. The lockbox is in the crevasse in the center of the rock.\nAfter using the lockbox, Lena will materialize. Speak to her to advance the quest.\nAfter speaking to Lena, head down from the rock and search the surrounding area for &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scamps&lt;/a&gt;. In order to collect the scorched scamp hides, you will have to use Lena's Improved Wand of Finding on them. Get within range of a scamp and use Lena's wand. This will cause a spell that shall last several seconds, but will kill the scamp instantly upon its completion; the scamp will then yield a scorched scamp hide. Do this until five such hides have been collected.\nIn order to collect illusion dust, head directly west from the location of the scamps until finding ghostly creatures roaming about. These creatures include &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound%20%28Online%29\"&gt;nix-hounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kagouti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kagouti&lt;/a&gt;. Kill six such creatures, which will provide the necessary illusion dust, as well as ectoplasm and, possibly, a selection of other loot.\nAfter collecting the necessary ingredients, return to the library and head down the library trap door. Just before the door, Tedras Relvi will appear. The Vestige must speak to him.\nNow head down the trap door. The objective is to find the Maulborn General, Darvarsen. From the starting room, take a left, and then take an immediate left. A hole in a wall guarded by two Maulborn soldiers can be found. Take these two and proceed through the tunnel, taking out any Maulborn soldiers in your way.\nDarvarsen can be found at the end of the passage, flanked by two Oblivion portals which will spawn scamps during the fight. Darvarsen himself will use fire magic against the Vestige, and is quite resilient to damage. Keep the pressure on against him whilst evading his fire attacks and healing when damaged, and the Vestige shall prevail.\nWhen Darvarsen falls, the Vestige turns their attention to the large crystal, the Jagged Lens of Compulsion, in the middle of the room, flanked by enslaved students. Destroy it.\nAfter destroying the Jagged Lens, the Vestige will spawn in a room near Lena Dalvel. Speak to her to complete the optional objective.\nWith that done, leave the building, bypassing jubilant dancing students. Head southwards towards Arch-Mage Valeyn and speak to him.\nAfter speaking with the Arch-Mage, head south to the dock and speak with the students there. In reality, the Vestige only have to speak to Lena, who wants to say goodbye before they return to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. The students want to give the Vestige a present, which Lena will gift to them.\nWith that conversation finished, the &lt;a href=\"Shad%20Astula\"&gt;Shad Astula&lt;/a&gt; quest line is now complete. Shad Astula is now safe from the Maulborn invaders."}

The sweet scent lulled his mind into a state, and while in this state, he saw a circular grove of trees. The further he went into the grove, the wider the circle became, so that he could never reach its true center.\nAs he wandered he met the most beautiful spirit and when she spoke her sentences began with their last word, so that they made circles. \"River. Come, lie with me by the,\" she beckoned.\nVanirion only came to his senses when, slumped in a stupor from the powerful odor of the leaves, he fell from the branches of the tree. He survived the fall, but broke his leg, ending his thieving career. He spent the rest of his life searching the forest for the tree with the purple leaves, but never found it.\nThen I asked the &lt;a href=\"treethane\"&gt;treethane&lt;/a&gt; whether it is right for the Pact Bosmer to say that they \"see\" these visions, and whether it wouldn't be better to say that they \"imagine\" them. It's clear that these strange apparitions of cities and groves and other such wonders don't exist either on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; or in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe treethane took a long drink of whatever foul fermented milk was currently in fashion and looked at his feet and then at the sky. \"You say the world ends at what you can see with your eyes.

{"id": "16183", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16183", "title": "Vitharn", "text": "Vitharn is a &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fort&lt;/a&gt; located on the southwestern peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;. There is a large scale battle being fought by two opposing armies of ghosts that don't seem to like each other very much.\nHistory.\nVitharn was founded by &lt;a href=\"Vitraen%20Vitharn\"&gt;Count Vitraen&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, Countess Mawean, who gave birth to their son, Csaran, and daughter, Nweala. Fanatics dedicated to Sheogorath were united by the Count as vassals to protect his land. The Count and Countess believed that with the proper political influence, they could put their son on the throne of the Isles by usurping Sheogorath's position. The Count went so far as to refuse to acknowledge Sheogorath, proclaiming him and his family the true rulers of the Isles.\nSheogorath was amused by the behavior of Vitraen, and so allowed for Csaran to be wed to Sheen-In-Glade. Sheen-In-Glade was considered an excellent countess, who wanted nothing but to bring honor and glory to her new family. Though Sheen-In-Glade and Csaran had a child, it disappeared from the Isles when it had become around 20 years old. Csaran also became paranoid to anyone he did not share a direct blood relation with, including his wife, Sheen-In-Glade. As a result, Csaran fell to his sister, and in their relationship a new heir was born, Cesrien Vitharn.\nCesrien was violent-natured, of ailing health, slow wit, and quick to anger, seeking enemies where there were none. As such, he exterminated tribes outside of the keep of Vitharn for as far as the eye could see, with many men, mer, and beast being slain. Under his reign the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Road\"&gt;Pinnacle Road&lt;/a&gt; became unsafe to travel, as Cesrien killed those who he considered trespassers in Vitharn's land. \nThe Count also had legs that appeared to have different lengths, and breathed with a rasp. In his youth, his teachers were hard-pressed to teach Cesrien, as the boy was considered dull. He furthermore suffered from a list of ailments, which were treated by nurses and midwives, until he sent them away when he came of age. As he became older, Cesrien had little contact with the outside world, excluding a handful of courtiers. He was rarely seen in public, and when he was seen, it was because he organized his vassal Fanatics for a raid on the countryside.\nAfter desperate counsel by his advisors, Cesrien decided to pause his plundering and be wed in order to continue the noble bloodline of Vitharn. He chose a wife, named Jideen, from a &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;Heretic&lt;/a&gt; Commune in &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;. Vassal Fanatics, who had long honored their agreement to Count Vitraen, were greatly upset by this heresy. Tensions between the Fanatics and Vitharn grew until the bad health of Cesrien caused his death. Cesrien's son, Cirion, ascended the throne of Vitharn afterwards.\nCirion ascended the throne while he was still young. The public had only rarely seen him before his hasty corronation in Vitharn Keep, during which it was said that bruises he had gotten through beatings by his father were still visible. Cirion was described as gentle and reserved, and it was thought that, had Cirion been old enough to govern, this behavior may have had been enough to ease the tension among the Vassal tribe. However, due to his young age, the duty of governing went to his mother, Jideen, who had to deal with tasks that Count Cesrien had long ignored.\nJideen was considered a fit Countess, and was loved by her people. However, the leaders of the Vassal Fanatics were unable to contain their hatred for her Manic heritage. Despite her attempts at diplomacy, the hatred was rooted in the Vassal Fanatics, and grew over the years. Some consider it admirable that the Fanatics remained true to their oaths for as long as they did.\nWhen Cirion came of age, he tried to ascend the throne in earnest. However, Cirion had a great fear of the outside world, so great that even the shadow of a bird would startle the young Count. He was bad at speaking to his people, and when he attempted to make amends to his vassals, who were still outraged by his mother's heritage, he could only rarely contain his fright. Some even said that the young Count soiled himself before he fled back to his throne chamber.\nThe Fall of Vitharn.\nAfter time had passed, the Vassals snapped and amassed their armies to march, and encircle, on Vitharn. The invading force was first spotted by &lt;a href=\"Althel%27s%20Ghost\"&gt;Althel&lt;/a&gt;, one of Vitharn's scouts, who spotted them while on patrol. She returned as fast as she could to the city to warn the count of the danger, however, when the count heard the news he fled and hid.\nWhen Vitharn's priest, &lt;a href=\"Hloval%20Dreth%27s%20Ghost\"&gt;Hloval Dreth&lt;/a&gt; learned of the invading army, he went out to meet them. The Fanatics invaded Vitharn because its people were unwilling to convert. They asked Dreth to convert the people, but Dreth proposed that in return for his aid in converting the population, he would be appointed ruler of Vitharn. The Fanatics denied, and as a result, Hloval Dreth believed the Fanatics were after his own power.\nDue to the count's cowardice, Althel herself informed the guardforce of the invading army. The guardforce tried to get the townsfolk of Vitharn into the keep before the invading army could reach the city, but were too late. The gates were closed before all the citizens and soldiers could enter the keep, resulting in the citizens outside the walls being killed and the soldiers having to stand their ground. The soldiers that Vitharn itself had to offer were ill-suited for combat, partially because &lt;a href=\"Bat%20gro-Orkul%27s%20Ghost\"&gt;Bat gro-Orkul&lt;/a&gt;, the smith of Vitharn, refused to provide the soldiers with their required weapons and armor. Many farmers fled the countryside from the invading Fanatics, a number of which were conscripted into the force defending Vitharn. As a result, morale was low. One of the soldiers spotted the invading Fanatics entering the Sump and Reservoir of Vitharn. He then tried to tell his fellow soldiers to barricade the entrance to the Reservoir, but could not reach them in time. The Fanatics killed the rear guard and opened the main gate, allowing the city to be overrun in a single day.\nThe people of Vitharn who did not aid in the defense of the city earned their doom by being inactive. Revelers in the Keep pointing out how soldiers were paid to defend the city, and that therefor they were not obligated to aid in its defence. The citizens of Vitharn believed themselves to be superior to those not born in the city. They claimed that it was the role of lesser men to fight for those of noble blood, and how they should not have to risk their lives like some commoner.

One of Vivec's main duties is to guard the people of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; from the evils of Red Mountain.\nVivec has protected &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; from multiple invasions, through offensive and diplomatic means, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec has also done countless deeds for the Dunmer people; one such deed was saving Vivec City, a city made in his honor, from &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the \"Ministry of Truth,\" a giant meteor sent by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the city. Vivec used his powers to suspend it in the air above the city where it stayed until the Fourth Era.\nVivec disappeared around the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; under mysterious circumstances. Though magical inventions were made to support Baar Dau in Vivec's absence; the meteor eventually fell in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, resulting with the destruction of Vivec City, and another &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;eruption of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the disappearance of Vivec and the reinstatement of the worship of the old Dunmeri pantheon, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and Mephala, by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec was henceforth known as \"&lt;a href=\"Saint\"&gt;Saint&lt;/a&gt; Vivec.\"\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nVivec grew up in the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, now present-day Morrowind, sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic occupation&lt;/a&gt; of the province in the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec was a hermaphrodite born to a netchiman, but was orphaned at an unspecified age. A possibly apocryphal source states that his mother and father were named Berahzic and Irdi respectively, and that he may have had three other siblings named Irdi, Hlafem, and Hykro. Vivec's own original name is unknown. Vivec remembers his childhood fondly, recalling the laughing of the netchimen of his village when the hunts were good. He marched with his father in the ash, growing strong in the hooks and sail, able to run a junk through silt. At eleven, he sung to an &lt;a href=\"ashkhan\"&gt;ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;. He became sick after &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, with the nix-blood and fever, and was infirm a hundred years. As a teenager, Vivec lived on the streets and led a gang of guttersnipes willing to do anything for money, including killing, stealing, and prostitution. During his early teenage years, Vivec was said to have been illiterate.\nA teenage Vivec was, at some point, visited by a caravan guard named &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, later a soldier of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. While Vivec was originally hostile towards the soldier, Nerevar saw something in him, believing him to be special in some way. Vivec grew to like Nerevar, taking \"V\" from Nerevar's sigil, \"Vel\", and \"\"wearing it twice as his new name \"Vivec\"\" (as in \"V-\"). Vivec saw that Nerevar had great ambitions, the most forthright of such being his wish to see Resdayn free of Nordic occupation, and decided to help him achieve his goals. Nerevar would become the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; and leading general of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Almalexia\"&gt;Indoril Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, whom he would later marry. At an unspecified point before his marriage, Nerevar became good friends with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; King, &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;, and, with them joining forces, encouraged by Vivec's swift and tricky diplomacy, they began their rebellion against the Nords. During Nerevar's rebellion against the Nords, Vivec fought alongside him as a general in his army but refused to take Nerevar's Great House name, Indoril. Vivec was said to have fought with an improvised spear he cobbled together, created from a netch longhook, which may have been an inspiration, or early incarnation, of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war, Vivec became an important adviser of Nerevar, alongside &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and Nerevar's wife, Almalexia. These three people became Nerevar's most trusted advisers and were known as the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. After the Nerevar's rebellion in &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar forged an alliance between the Chimer and the Dwemer which fully united the province under a new government, known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia were wary about the new alliance with the Dwemer King, Dumac Dwarf-Orc, believing that the peace between the Chimer and their old enemies would never last. Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia told Nerevar that he should take opportunity of the peace and claim Resdayn for his own, but Nerevar was not willing to betray his old friend Dumac.\nWar of the First Council.\nLike Vivec and the others predicted, the peace between the Dwemer and Chimer did not last. &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, the head of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and trusted friend of Lord Nerevar, discovered that the Dwemer High Priest and &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, had been building a new construct known as the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; that would harness the power of the recently discovered &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. The Numidium was seen as a complete mockery of the Chimer faith and was a potential threat to all of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec and the rest of the old Tribunal urged Nerevar once again to go to war with the Dwemer, but Nerevar was still reluctant to do as his advisors told him. Nerevar went to his friend Dumac and asked him whether or not Voryn's claims were true. Dumac supposedly had no idea that Kagrenac had secretly been building the Numidium and denied Voryn's claims. Nerevar then went on a pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt; to consult with Azura on the matter. Azura confirmed what Voryn Dagoth said was true, and told Nerevar that the Numidium needed to be destroyed to ensure the safety of the entire world. Nerevar, who felt betrayed by Dumac, went to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and confronted him about what he learned from Azura. Dumac, who still did not know of the Numidium, was angered by Nerevar's insolence and the two friends argued bitterly. This dispute led to what would be known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War is believed to have taken place sometime in between the dates of &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;. During the last battle of the war, which occurred at the Red Mountain, Vivec and Almalexia commanded the Chimeri main army, distracting the Dwemeri forces, and giving Nerevar, Voryn Dagoth, and &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt; the chance to sneak into the Heart Chamber of Red Mountain, where Numidium was being constructed. In the Heart Chamber, Nerevar found Dumac, Kagrenac, and, by Nordic accounts, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting battle between these men ended with the disappearance of the Dwemer after Lord Kagrenac used his tools, &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;, upon the Heart of Lorkhan, and, by two accounts, Nerevar being severely injured.\nAfter the battle, Nerevar gave Kagrenac's tools to Voryn Dagoth for safekeeping while he returned to the council to determine what should actually be done with them. Vivec, Sotha Sil, Almalexia, and the rest of the council all agreed that Kagrenac's tools should be kept in case any other threat to Resdayn were to rise. Nerevar agreed with the council's decision under one exception; that the council had to take an oath that Kagrenac's tools were to never be used in the manner the Dwemer intended them for.\nAfter taking the Oath, Nerevar and Vivec went back to Red Mountain to retrieve the tools from Voryn Dagoth. Voryn however, refused to hand over Kagrenac's tools to Nerevar, and it was soon realized that he had secretly used the tools in Nerevar's absence and was corrupted by their power. In order to acquire the tools, Nerevar resorted to force. In the ensuing fight, Voryn, who now referred to himself as Dagoth Ur, was presumed dead by his opponents. According to some sources, Nerevar was severely injured once again in this fight, though this may just be an inconsistency on when he got injured in the first place. Afterwards, the tools were brought to Sotha Sil for studying.\nApotheosis and Curse of Azura.\nAfter the controversial death of Nerevar (which may have been caused by the Tribunal), Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil became the highest authorities of the New &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt;, which was made to replace the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; that had been disbanded after the War.\nAfter many years of ruling, Sotha Sil returned to Vivec and Almalexia with startling news. He had secretly learned how to use the tools of Kagrenac to tap into the divine power of the Heart of Lorkhan and redirect the power into a mortal being, giving them god-like powers. Sotha Sil proposed that the three of them use the tools to turn themselves into living gods in order to bring Resdayn into a new era of prosperity.\nAt first, Vivec and Almalexia were opposed to the idea, as it abjured his sacred oath with Nerevar, but Sotha Sil's vision of a new world with peace, justice, honor, and prosperity convinced Vivec to break his promise to his old friend. The three returned to Red Mountain and used the tools upon the Heart, transforming them into gods. After their ritual was complete, Azura appeared before the new deities, angered by the blasphemy they had just committed against her. She told Vivec and the others that &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevar would return&lt;/a&gt; to punish them for their mockery and to make sure that no mortal would ever defy her in this manner again. Sotha Sil replied to her threat claiming that the \"&lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon%23The%20Reclamations\"&gt;old gods&lt;/a&gt;\" were no longer necessary, and that the Chimer needed new gods that would care for their needs. Insulted, Azura cursed the Chimer; giving them ashen colored skin, and fiery red eyes. Henceforth, the Chimer were known as the Dunmer.\nBeginning of the Tribunal Temple.\nThe Chimer, now known as the Dunmer, were at first alarmed by their new appearance. They did not know what had changed their complexion from gold to grey, but the result terrified them. Sotha Sil reassured the Dunmer, stating that their affliction was not a curse, but instead a blessing, as it signified their beginning as a new, civilized Mer.\nMost of the Dunmer accepted the Tribunal and worshiped them as they had once worshiped &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, Azura, and Mephala. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; was formed, along with a just and honorable society under the theocratic rule of the Tribunal. Large cities were founded in the names of each of the aspects of &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec's city&lt;/a&gt; was established on the southern coast of Vvardenfell in the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;, looking into the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Vvardenfell was made into a holy Temple preserve under the direct supervision of Vivec, with strict rules against colonization. Almalexia, once Nerevar's wife, would become Vivec's consort.\nBut not every Dunmer was loyal to the Tribunal. The nomadic &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; of Vvardenfell believed that the Tribunal was responsible for the death of Nerevar, and despised them for this. According to Vivec, the belief that Nerevar was killed by the Tribunal was started by Alandro Sul, one of Indoril Nerevar's old shield-companions who was present at the battle of Red Mountain. Whether or not Alandro's claims are true or not cannot be known for a certainty, but there is some evidence that gives credibility to his accusation, some even coming from Vivec.\nThe Four Score War.\nFor thousands of years, the Tribunal kept relative peace in Morrowind. The only conflict in which the Tribunal participated in being the failed &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt; which was defeated by the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. In this war, Vivec's most notable action was creating an alliance with the Trident-Kings of the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; and cutting off the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; Army's reinforcement and supply roots by flanking them from the north at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Though both Morrowind and the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; helped each other during the war, peace did not last between the two.\nWithin a few years of the invasion of &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;, the new Second Empire became the most prominent domain within &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, holding every &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; in the mainland excluding Morrowind. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202840\"&gt;1E 2840&lt;/a&gt;, the third in line of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt;, declared war on Morrowind in an attempt to add it into the Reman Empire. The ensuring war was later known as the Four Score War, named after the 80 years it endured. The Tribunal, particularly Vivec, displayed amazing strength and leadership during the war. An example being the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;, in which Vivec took the Cyrodilic army completely by surprise and almost completely destroyed it in the process. But despite every effort, neither side could gain any sort of advantage on the other.\nDuring the last year of the war, &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; had a vision that the war would be lost if Vivec did not have the help of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, who had been away from Morrowind for seventeen years on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, training &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Mages&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec, who took Almalexia's vision seriously, told Almalexia to travel to Artaeum and retrieve Sotha Sil so that they would not lose the war. Almalexia arrived at Artaeum and told Sotha Sil about her vision and how he needed to return to Morrowind. Sotha Sil, who had just recently spent a strenuous effort making a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, that they agree to not be summoned by amateur mages to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, agreed to leave Artaeum with Almalexia. When Sotha Sil and Almalexia returned to Morrowind, they discovered Vivec had already surrendered to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek's&lt;/a&gt; terms after his crushing defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Battle of Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;. However, shortly after Vivec's surrender, his truce with the Empire was broken when an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt; seized the fortress at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Peace was made once again at &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, but after &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, the treaty was abandoned again. On the 6th day of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Reman III met with Vivec at &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; to tell him that the treaty was to be signed again at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. When Reman III returned to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, he was assassinated by his &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;wife's&lt;/a&gt; sister, &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, though the assassination is believed to have been truly orchestrated by his most trusted advisors, the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of Reman III, Versidue-Shaie took the Imperial Throne and signed the treaty with Vivec, officially ending the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAkaviri Invasion and the Ebonheart Pact.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt; a period known as the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; began in Tamriel after the death of the Akaviri Potentate, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;. The potentate's death resulted with the collapse of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; and brought chaos across each of its vassal provinces. Because of Morrowind's autonomy from the Empire and the rulership of Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, the province was left relatively unharmed by the Interregnum.\nHowever, in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, a new threat to Morrowind emerged. A Second Akaviri Invasion of Tamriel began, led by &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; snow demons. Though Morrowind was hit the most by the invasion, the Kamal invaded parts of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and Black Marsh as well. The three provinces united to repel the invaders, but even with their combined forces they still had trouble defeating their enemy. The foe was so great that Almalexia sought the help of the Tribunal's old foe, Ysmir Wulfharth, who now referred to himself as the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; (though by some accounts it was &lt;a href=\"King%20Jorunn\"&gt;King Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; who asked for Wulfharth's help). The Kamal suffered a crushing defeat at &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; after they were struck by the armies of Almalexia, Wulfharth, Jorunn, and the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; Shellbacks. Vivec took advantage of this defeat and used his powers to teach the people within Morrowind the ability to breath underwater for just one day, and then created a massive flood, temporarily drowning Morrowind into the sea and washing away the Akaviri Invaders. After this event, the Tribunal, King Jorunn, and the leaders of Black Marsh signed a treaty creating an alliance between them so that an invasion of the like would never occur again; this alliance was known as the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tiber Wars.\nAt the closing of the Interregnum, the warlord &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; and his young general, &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;, began their conquest of Tamriel. After the two conquered the Imperial City, Cuhlecain was murdered and Hjalti took the throne of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and was deemed Emperor Tiber Septim by the Grand &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battle%20Mage\"&gt;Imperial Battle Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;. When the kingdoms Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; were conquered, Tiber turned his eyes to Morrowind. Morrowind was rich with the metal &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; which Tiber needed to rebuild Cyrodiil to its former glory, which had been destroyed by the hundreds of years of war in the Interregnum. Tiber's friend and general, Ysmir Wulfharth, promised Tiber that if he were to defeat Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, he would be able to steal their power and use it against the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber took the advice of Wulfharth and declared war on Morrowind. Vivec, who knew the war was not going to end well for either side, formed a treaty with Tiber Septim, ending the war between Morrowind and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, absorbing Morrowind into the Empire, but also giving the province full autonomy. The last condition of the treaty was that Vivec give the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; to Tiber Septim to use as he pleased. Tiber, who was not very fond of the idea of facing the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; in battle, agreed to the treaty, and the war ended. According to some sources, Vivec may have met with Tiber Septim on occasion; Vivec even claims to have killed Tiber Septim with the intention of testing his abilities. Almalexia commissioned the reconstruction of Mournhold in a reaction to Septim's rise, being finished in the Third Era.\nDagoth Ur's return.\nIn the year 2E 882, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, who was believed dead after his battle with Nerevar and the Tribunal, awoke at Red Mountain along with his &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;kin&lt;/a&gt;, who were now &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s. Dagoth Ur began formulating a plan to destroy the Tribunal once and for all, as well as remove the Empire from Morrowind and conquer lands lost to the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; of Black Marsh over the many years of his absence.\nDagoth Ur knew that in order for the Tribunal to keep their divine power, they needed to annually return to Red Mountain and bask within the presence of the Heart of Lorkhan\u2014Dagoth Ur decided to use this to his advantage. When the Tribunal returned to Red Mountain to replenish their power, Dagoth Ur and his minions ambushed them. Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil were not strong enough to defeat Dagoth Ur, who had since grown extremely powerful through his connection to the Heart, and were forced to leave Red Mountain without replenishing their power. It is around this time that Dagoth Ur began building his ultimate weapon, &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Second Numidium.\nFor the next 500 years, the Tribunal's power began to weaken, and in their desperation, Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil began launching many assaults on Red Mountain, seeking to regain entrance to the Heart Chamber and stop the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; disease Dagoth was spreading across &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. All their attempts were futile, as Dagoth Ur was too powerful for the now-weary Tribunal, who had trouble staging assaults while simultaneously maintaining the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the Tribunal did manage to kill Dagoth Ur, the Heart of Lorkhan would always revive him in time. As the Tribunal weakened, so too did the state of Morrowind's society, resulting in events such as the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;, which was caused by a minor slave revolt. The last attempt to access the Heart Chamber occurred in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;. On this endeavor, Almalexia and Sotha Sil were nearly killed by &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Odros\"&gt;Dagoth Odros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Vemyn\"&gt;Dagoth Vemyn&lt;/a&gt;, but were saved by Vivec. In the struggle, Almalexia and Sotha Sil lost two of the tools of Kagrenac, &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, to the Sixth House, and failed to recover them. Demoralized and in a very weakened state, the only thing the Tribunal could do to hold back Dagoth Ur was focus their power into reinforcing the Ghostfence. Throughout this period, &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; and others who questioned the Tribunal were persecuted in order to protect the people's faith of the Tribunal Temple, as without the faith of the people, Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia would have been powerless and unable to sustain the Ghostfence.\nThe Nerevarine.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the ultimatum that Azura gave to the Tribunal when they made themselves into gods came true, and Nerevar returned to Tamriel as the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, Vivec and the rest of the Tribunal were hostile towards the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Cult\"&gt;Nerevarine Cult&lt;/a&gt; and claimed their prophecies false, as they threatened the faith of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which they needed to protect &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; from the darkness of Dagoth Ur. Vivec was also hostile, due to the fact that the Nerevarine was foretold to be the one to cast down the Tribunal and return the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon%23The%20Reclamations\"&gt;Old Dunmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec eventually realized that the Nerevarine was the Tribunal's last hope in defeating Dagoth Ur, and decided to aid them, even though it would require the Tribunal to sacrifice their divine powers. Vivec eventually met the Nerevarine at his &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt;, where he gave them the Tribunal's &lt;a href=\"plan%20to%20defeat%20Dagoth%20Ur\"&gt;plan to defeat Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;, the last Tool of Kagrenac in Vivec's possession; during this meeting, Vivec assured the Nerevarine that he would put an end to the persecution of Dissident Priests.\nAfter acquiring the rest of the tools, the Nerevarine journeyed to Red Mountain to put a stop to Dagoth Ur's plans. The Nerevarine used the tools upon the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, removing it from the world and severing Dagoth Ur's divine link to it; this allowed for him to be killed, as well as his creation, the Akulakhan. Though Dagoth Ur was defeated, the Tribunal was also cut off from their once-godlike powers.\nFall of the Tribunal and Disappearance.\nWith the Heart of Lorkhan removed from the world, the Tribunal's powers quickly faded, but were not gone entirely. Many of the Dunmer people were still faithful to the Tribunal, allowing Vivec, Sotha Sil, and Almalexia to sustain a small amount of their once-godlike powers, though Vivec realized this faith and the power that came with it would not last forever. Vivec dedicated his remaining power to reorganizing the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the issues between the Temple Priests and the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; to disappear, as well as using his power to help the people and their humble needs. Vivec also began preparations within his sect of the Temple for great change, telling his priests that the Tribunal should no longer be honored as gods, but instead as saints and heroes. Vivec recommended that the Temple's faith should return to the Old Reclamations, with the worship of Azura, Mephala, and Boethiah. Vivec believed that the Tribunal Temple's traditions needed to continue, just without the ALMSIVI, and he accepted his inevitable mortality contently, as he had always worn his divinity lightly. He told his priests that shortly after the Tribunal Temple has been reorganized, he would withdraw from the world.\nUnlike Vivec, Sotha Sil and Almalexia acted differently regarding their impending mortality. After the Tribunal's final defeat at the hands of Dagoth Ur in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, during which they lost Keening and Sunder, Sotha Sil completely alienated himself from the Tribunal and all others. The only person he supposedly conversed with during the ten years between his defeat and the fall of Dagoth Ur was the immortal wizard &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec doubted that Sotha Sil would even notice the loss of his divine powers, as he believed that Sotha Sil was so fascinated by the concept of mystery and the unknown that he had almost completely lost touch with the rest of the world.\nAlmalexia, on the other hand, was horribly affected by her loss of divinity, as she took her powers much more seriously than Vivec and Sotha Sil. After the Tribunal's disconnection to the Heart, Vivec stopped communicating with Almalexia, but he noticed that while her powers diminished, she began to agonize and grieve. Vivec feared that she would cause harm to herself or others, and shortly after Almalexia's loss of divinity, Vivec's fears came true. According to those who were close to her, Almalexia's personality had changed drastically; instead of her usual merciful and mother-like nature, Almalexia had become very aggressive and power-hungry. Almalexia began to severely punish those whom she considered unfaithful; in one such occasion, she covered all of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in ash storms by utilizing old Dwemer machinery. Eventually, Almalexia had gone completely insane. She formulated a plan to become Morrowind's \"One True God\" by killing the other members of the Tribunal and the Nerevarine. She traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; and murdered Sotha Sil, then used his mechanical creations to attack the city of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; to slander her now-deceased friend. Under Almalexia's orders, the Nerevarine was sent to the Clockwork City to find the supposedly mad Sotha Sil and kill him. Almalexia's true intention, however, was for the Nerevarine to get killed fighting the city's robotic inhabitants. However, the Nerevarine endured the Clockwork city and discovered the remains of Sotha Sil, which prompted Almalexia to attempt to kill the Nerevarine herself. In the fight that ensued, Almalexia was unable to defeat the Nerevarine and was instead killed by their hands.\nAfter Almalexia's death, Vivec was the only remaining aspect of ALMSIVI. Though saddened by the death of his fellow tribunes, he knew that since they were now mortals, they would have died at some point anyways\u2014he only regretted that it ended the way it did. He would later retrieve their bodies, as they were his family, interring them in the proper Velothi fashion, and mourn them thereafter. Vivec went on to guide the people of Morrowind until his sudden disappearance sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. What really happened to Vivec is unclear, though the disappearance of himself and the Nerevarine during the Oblivion Crisis has led many to believe that he was either \"taken\" by &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; during the crisis or killed by the Nerevarine; although, it is possible that he left the world on his own initiative as he said he would to his priests. After the destruction of Vivec City by &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind changed just like Vivec predicted it would; the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt; became the predominant religion in Morrowind and reestablished the worship of the Reclamations, as well as dubbed the Tribunal \"saints\" instead of gods.\nThe Trial of Vivec.\nThe Trial of Vivec has been claimed to be Vivec's last known presence before his sudden disappearance. In reality it was a forum roleplay, which several Elder Scrolls developers participated.\nThe Trial began when a scholar proposed that Vivec, now mortal, and the other now-deceased members of the Tribunal be tried for the breaking of his oath and alleged murder of their lord Nerevar, the problematic tapping of power from the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; as well as its hiding, and the possibly impertinent usurpation of the roles of the Three Good Daedra. Vivec agreed to be tried, and appointed three individuals, Allerleirauh, &lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt;, and Nigedo, as judges, which he referred to as his Tribunal.\nThe Trial began with the accusations of whether or not Vivec murdered his ruler and friend, Nerevar. To assure that his answers were truthful, Vivec applied his Water-Face so that he could answer without lying, and then told his judges that in his mortal life he was responsible for the death of Nerevar, but not in his life as a deity, which he claimed were separate. The question then arose whether the present Vivec was the mortal or god version of him, and if the mortal, whether or not he was the same person who murdered Nerevar. Vivec went on to further elaborate, stating that when Vehk the mortal touched the Heart, he ceased to be and became the god version of himself that had never, but at the same time, always existed, due to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Moment\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; at Red Mountain changing the past to better suit him. He then stated that the present Vivec was a remnant of his god form and not the mortal Vehk, much to the court's disbelief. In order to confirm what he had stated, Vivec proposed to his judges that Azura be summoned to speak on behalf of Nerevar and to answer important questions proposed to her. With the reluctant agreement of the court, it was decided that Azura would be summoned on the coming &lt;a href=\"Hogithum\"&gt;Hogithum&lt;/a&gt;. The items required for the summoning were as follows; &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;, an antler from the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;er King Dead Wolf-Dear, a ringlet from &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;'s Wraithmail, and the permanently torn shadow of one of the court members, in which the scholar Louis D'Onus volunteered to offer.\nThe next accusation was based on whether or not the Tribunal's replacement of the Three Good Daedra caused a negative impact on the people and society of Morrowind. In order to defend himself, Vivec summoned &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, who supported Vivec's claim that by taking Mephala's place in the pantheon, he became a living celebrant of her. Sheogorath would then be scared off by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt; at the trial, who, along with the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, had reason to believe that Vivec's agreement to be tried was merely another one of his schemes.\nWith the acquisition of all the required components for the summoning, the trial was only further suspended by the awaiting of Hogithum to arrive. When confronted with the accusations on his stealing of godhood, Vivec states that it was foretold by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; that one day, the Anticipations would be usurped by the Tribunal and that, because of this, this act was not a crime. When met with harsh doubt from the judges, Vivec admits that he gladly stole his godhood and would do so again if he could, stating that he had even left instructions for others to do the same. Vivec goes on to say that had he and the rest of the Tribunal not become gods, the Chimer/Dunmer people would have never prospered.\nWhen Hogithum arrived, the priest Ainoryl was given the task of summoning Azura within the Hall. After the preparations were made, Azura was summoned, but before the judges could ask her any questions, Vivec interrupted, revealing his true intentions for the assembly of the trial. Vivec used his shadow to wrap around Azura and reveal her neonymic, her magical name, using the power it gave him over her to fully manifest her and bind her to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec then proceeded to call forth her protonymic, her true name, further binding her to the realm and releasing the mortal soul that was trapped within Azura's Star. With Azura fully bound to Mundus, Vivec revealed to her his ability to utilize &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;, and then assembled his spear &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt; from the bones of his armor, thrusting it down her throat and banishing her from the world. With Azura defeated, Vivec thanked his court for unintentionally helping him get his long-awaited revenge upon Azura, and in conclusion, placed Alandro Sul's ringlet in his mouth, which issued a voice stating the secret message found in the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\": \"He was not born a god. His destiny did not lead him to this crime. He chose this path of his own free will. He stole the godhood and murdered the Hortator.\" Vivec then vanished, implying that his disappearance was done so on his own initiative.\nVivec was safe, having teleported to unrecorded planes and thieving from them for his own amusement. It is said he will trouble the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; no more, until the next threat to the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; is put down.\nVivec's Feats.\nOver the many years Vivec watched over &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, he has helped protect the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people in multiple ways. The following is a list of things that Vivec is known to have done with no known specification on the dates of which these events occurred.\nHalting Baar Dau.\nSometime around the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;'s godhood. The Daedric lord &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the Tribunal for mocking the Daedra and sent the great meteor, &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt;, to destroy the then-new city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. However, some different versions of the story has Baar Dau being one of Vivec's monster/children, acting out of its own will. After seeing the meteor, Vivec merely raised his hand and the moonlet froze above the city. Vivec decided to keep it above his city to show that faith should be kept in the Tribunal as it was faith that kept Baar Dau afloat.\nUnfortunately, five years after Vivec's disappearance, the Ingenium device that kept Baar Dau suspended in the air during Vivec's absence, failed, causing the moonlet to fall from the sky and annihilate the city of Vivec. A chain reaction made by the vibrations the meteor created when striking the ground caused the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to erupt for a second time, marking the beginning of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeating the Ruddy Man.\nInside of &lt;a href=\"Koal%20Cave\"&gt;Koal Cave&lt;/a&gt;, located near the city of &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec fought an incarnation of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;. In the fight between these two gods, Vivec defeated the Ruddy Man, and spared his life, with the exception that the Dunmer people were given his permission to use the hides of the Ruddy Man's worshipers, the Dreugh, to make armor. The battle was supposedly so epic that it resulted in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite having his life spared, the Ruddy Man attacked once again outside the city of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; after being summoned by a worshiper of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon%23The%20House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec and the Ruddy Man clashed for a second time, and the Ruddy Man was defeated once again.\nIt is believed that the Ruddy Man may have been an offspring resulting from Vivec's marriage to Molag Bal.\nFighting Mehrunes Dagon.\nAt the city of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec fought Mehrunes Dagon after he tried to attack the citizens of the city. Mehrunes attempted to throw a giant rock at the city, but Vivec taunted him so that he would throw the rock at him instead. Where this rock fell, the civilians of Maar Gan built a shrine to the Tribunal. It is said that during this fight, Vivec gave his silver sword to Mehrunes Dagon, as he thought it would be dishonorable to fight an unarmed enemy.\nMythology.\nBackground.\nThe mythology of Vivec as he recorded in his Book of Hours, also known as the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\", is alleged to be Vivec's written revision of his own history that occurred when his mortal self, Vehk, stole power from the Heart of Lorkhan during &lt;a href=\"the%20Red%20Moment\"&gt;the Red Moment&lt;/a&gt; Dragon Break and became a god. This alteration of history allowed for Vivec to legitimize the godhood of the Tribunal by making it so that their place in the pantheon of the Chimer/Dunmer had always existed, and that the original Three Good Daedra were merely their anticipations, holding the future Tribunal's positions until the day they rose to godhood. The history written in the Book of Hours marks the beginning of Vivec's second life in his God-form that had now always been present within the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;. This second life and timeline that Vivec created for himself, along with all the other timelines created during the Red Moment, converges with the primary, chronological, timeline when the Dragon Break ended, perhaps making the events that occur, in a sense, true. His mother \"survived\" him and laid his body at the altar of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt;, giving him her skin to \"wear into the underworld\", suggesting he would have died long ago if he had not become a god. Vivec states that Vivec the mortal killed Nerevar, but Vivec the god did not, implying that by rewriting his past the circumstances of Nerevar's death changed to remove him from fault.\nThe Thirty-Six Lessons.\nVivec's Lessons begin with the begetting of his god form; &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; chose the wife of a netchiman as a surrogate mother for the birthing Vivec and threw her into the sea, where dreughs modified her and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; impregnated her with the egg-image of Vivec. The netchiman's wife was then visited by seven Daedra known as the \"Barons Who Move Like This\" at &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;, each of whom taught the egg form of Vivec new motions and fighting styles. Their commander, &lt;a href=\"Fa-Nuit-Hen\"&gt;Fa-Nuit-Hen&lt;/a&gt;, told the netchiman's wife to go to the lands of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; to meet the future &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;. On her journey to these lands, she was visited by more spirits, who each proceeded to teach the egg form of Vivec new things; the sixth spirit to visit her at this time was Mephala, who burned out the eyes of the netchiman's wife, but had her secrets stolen by Vivec. Due to her blindness, the netchiman's wife accidentally wandered into a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Dwemeri Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing the power within the egg of Vivec, the Dwemer removed it from the netchiman's wife, killing her, and placed the image of Vivec within a simulacrum form of her. In reprisal, Vivec channeled his essence into love, an emotion that the Dwemer could not understand and feared. Unable to deal with the idea of love, the Dwemer removed the simulacrum from the cave.\nAfter the ordeal with the Dwemer, the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife continued on the original goal of reaching the lands of Indoril. Like before, Vivec was visited by a multitude of spirits, which Vivec debated with over varying concepts; this included an &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; who taught Vivec how to become a &lt;a href=\"Ruling%20King\"&gt;Ruling King&lt;/a&gt;. After walking for a long period of time, the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife died out, falling over on an Indoril road where it would sit for eighty days before being discovered by a merchant's caravan. While the merchant captain was advised by his guard, &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, to bring the simulacrum to the capital and present it before Almalexia, he believed that he could get a larger profit from selling it in the town of Noormoc. Nerevar then offered to buy the simulacrum himself, but the merchant captain still refused him. Vivec then spoke to Nerevar, stating \"You can hear the words, so run away Come Hortator, unfold into a clear unknown, Stay quiet until you've slept in the yesterday, And say no elegies for the melting stone.\" With these words said, Nerevar slew the merchant captain and took his caravan and the simulacrum for himself to bring to Almalexia as a weapon for the coming war with the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, who currently ruled the land.\nAs Nerevar and Vivec approached the capital, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt; began plotting to contest them. When they reached &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar gifted the simulacrum, with Vivec inside it, to Almalexia, to which Almalexia replied by saying, \"Seht who is Azura has revealed that war is come and that the Hortator that shall deliver us will approach with a solution walking at his side.\" Vivec then hatched from his egg and merged with the simulacrum of his mother, becoming a hermaphrodite. With Vivec now born, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; people, with Nerevar as their Hortator, rebelled against their Nordic overlords. Vivec was responsible for fighting off the greatest champions of the Nordic armies, including the great Nordic hero, &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;. After the defeat of the Nords, the Chimer and Dwemer were united under the rule of ALMSIVI and Nerevar. At this time, Vivec gave his first lesson to Nerevar on becoming a Ruling King and left him to ponder it. Vivec then wandered outside the capital of Resdayn and entered a region of badlands, where the Daedric Prince Molag Bal revealed himself to him. Vivec spoke to Molag Bal, saying, \"How very beautiful you are, that you do not join us.\" After this, Molag crushed Vivec's feet and had legions cleave them off. Vivec was then trapped within a net of fire, in which it became apparent to Vivec that Molag Bal intended to marry him. At Vivec's request, Molag Bal commanded his legions to create a banquet for this ceremony, and he then revealed to Vivec the secret symbol of royalty, &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt;, in which Vivec would reveal to Nerevar in his next lesson for becoming a Ruling King. Vivec, now content with Molag's gift, married him, and gifted him his own head; they then gave birth to thousands of children. Vivec's head stayed with Molag for eighty days until it was reunited with its body. At that moment, they both revealed their love to each other which was 'shaped like a spear,' and Vivec bit off a secret from Molag's spear, which he used to make his spear into a terrible weapon he named &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;. With Muatra assembled, Vivec knocked Molag Bal into a fissure created by their children, and then proceeded to kill them all with his new spear as he wept.\nAfter his short marriage to Molag Bal, Vivec taught Nerevar the third and final lesson of becoming a Ruling King. Vivec warned him of the enemy that only Nerevar could defeat, the Sharmat, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. As Nerevar tried to understand this lesson, he met Vivec shaving his head 'to make room for the fire,' the fire being the way to see with truth. Nerevar then admitted to Vivec that he was having trouble understanding the lessons he taught him. To this, Vivec replied telling him to 'reach heaven by violence.' Interpreting this in a literal sense, Nerevar took an axe and then traveled to the moon &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; where he was greeted by a Parliament of Craters. The Parliament recognized Nerevar's important place in the universe but denounced his authority over them. Nerevar subsequently attacked the Parliament, killing many of the craters. Nerevar would continue his attempt to reach heaven by violence but was eventually thrown back to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec would then find him in a grub field near the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;, and they would walk together. They walked across the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, where Nerevar learned new fighting styles, and then to the edge of the world where they found the bottom row of the world's teeth. Afterwards, they walked to &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, where they found only 'frozen bearded kings.' Next, traveling to &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; in the west, where Vivec gave birth to another race of monsters that ended up destroying the continent. Vivec then brought Nerevar to Red Mountain, where he told him that his foe Dagoth Ur awaited, and taught him of the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23The%20Hurling%20Disk\"&gt;Hurling Disk&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelieving that he had taught the Horator enough that he was ready for the coming war with the Dwemer, Vivec decided to begin writing his Book of Hours, as he knew a Dragon Break was coming. Vivec then went to Almalexia to tell her that he needed to defeat nine powerful monsters that escaped his Muatra; he promised her that he would return in time to kill &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; in the coming war. Almalexia replied to Vivec, saying that since he decided to create the Book of Hours, he had already killed one of the nine monsters, that being his mortal self. Vivec than began to question whether or not this was true, and then wondered whether or not his own godhood was the result of the ideals of the people or his own mortal desires. Pondering this, Vivec knew why he needed to make the Book of Hours. Vivec then entered a non-spatial space and decided that this would be where he launched his attack on the eight remaining monsters. In this place, Vivec was given a vision of the next &lt;a href=\"Shezarrine%23Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;two-headed&lt;/a&gt; Ruling King, that being the future Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec then built a Provisional House within the non-spatial space in an attempt to achieve a state beyond CHIM. Here, he was greeted by a song.\nFearing his own answer to this song, Vivec retreated from the Provisional House. Vivec then went to fight the first monster that escaped Muatra, who was known as Moon Axle. Moon Axle was immune to spears, as his body was made only of straight lines that never stayed in one position for too long. In order to defeat him, Vivec struck him with a curved sword and wrapped his body with the souls of nix hounds, keeping his body in one position. Vivec then stabbed Moon Axle with Muatra, killing him. A group of Chimer philosophers studied the lines that made up the remains of the Moon Axle. Vivec decided to these philosophers how to turn the lines into spokes of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, birthing the first Whirling School, where Vivec would teach for a year. After this, Vivec returned to the Provisional House in order to find the second monster, the Treasure Wood Sword, which was hidden within the tomb of the Chimer House Mora. In the tomb, Vivec was told by a &lt;a href=\"Bonewalker\"&gt;Bonewalker&lt;/a&gt; that he was not allowed to retrieve the sword as a deal was made with Mephala, keeping it there. In response to this, Vivec sought out the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, where he displayed amongst them a single vast movement of sex and murder throughout all their hideouts. With this done, the leader of the Morag Tong gave the Treasure Wood Sword to Vivec.\nNow that the Treasure Wood Sword was retrieved, Vivec returned to the Provisional House to find the location of the third monster. The third monster, known as Horde Mountain, was a massive conical stack of warriors whose apex reached the clouds. Before Vivec could attack the monster, three lower houses of Chimer trapped the beast in a net of \"doubtful doctrine.\" In appreciation of the deeds of these three houses, Vivec made a celebration and proclaimed the members of these houses his &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec then pierced Horde Mountain with Muatra, and threw its remains to the northeast, where they landed and formed the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec would then leave his city to find the fourth monster, the Pocket Cabal, who hid within the spell-lists of the greatest &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; wizards. Wanting to collect the words of this monster, Vivec disguised himself as a common traveler, and Muatra as a dwarf. After a year or two of stealing the Cabal's words, Muatra exploded, causing the Pocket Cabal to hide within a group of slaves, making them erupt in a babble of forbidden arcane knowledge. A large bug appeared before Vivec, carrying the greatest of the Telvanni Wizards, who stated his displeasure with Vivec's actions; Vivec responded to this by stabbing him with Muatra. The harness of the bug fell on the slave pen, releasing the slaves inside who still carried the Pocket Cabal. In order to stop the Cabal, Vivec created a dome-headed demon and trapped the slaves within it. Leaving Sotha Sil to look after the enigma that was the Pocket Cabal, Vivec went to find the fifth monster, the &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;. The Ruddy Man was a form Molag Bal took in a previous kalpa, when the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s ruled the world, and this old image of Molag Bal was born again when he mated with Vivec. This monster took the form of an armor, and whoever wore him turned into a mighty killer. After corrupting a young child from &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Ruddy Man was discovered by Vivec. The subsequent fight between these two resulted with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. Once Vivec had defeated the monster, he offered the armor to the Queen of the Dreughs, who modified his mother, the netchiman's wife. The Dreughs promised to keep the armor away from the people of the surface world, but Vivec would discover in ten years that they were lying when another individual wearing the Ruddy Man arose. Vivec slew the Ruddy Man again, and instead gave the armor to the loyal mystics of the Number Room.\nWhile searching for the sixth monster, Vivec secretly killed a loyal mystic out of his frustration. When Nerevar asked him why, Vivec told him \"No one knows what I am,\" and the Hortator accepted that. The sixth monster was named Ha-Note and hid in the &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Adjacent Place&lt;/a&gt;, where a race of monsters known as Grabbers added new emotions to him and created their first city in the image of Vivec's. This modification turned Ha-Note into a beast known as City-Face, who attempted to replace Vivec's city with himself, as he believed taking Vivec's culture was a better solution than having his own corrected. After Nerevar and Almalexia finished fighting off an army of Dwemer, Nerevar saw City-Face confront Vivec. Vivec then corrected City-Face's Grabber-culture before killing him with the Ethos Knife.\nMany years past and the Dwemer were nearly prepared to war with the Chimer. During this time, Nerevar married Almalexia, and Vivec began to grow tired of killing his children. Vivec's brooding caused the Chimer's skin to change to a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;dark-grey color&lt;/a&gt;, and Nerevar wished to know what pained him. Nerevar found Vivec in a Temple writing in his Book of Hours. Vivec wrote a scripture on how the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; were all liars, and that equilibrium with them cannot be reached. However, he then blotched out this passage with ink and instead wrote a scripture on the nature of truth. After writing this passage, Vivec returned to the Provisional House to find the seventh monster, named &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Lie-Rock&lt;/a&gt;, who flew to the heavens and met with the &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Void Ghost&lt;/a&gt;. The Void Ghost told Lie-Rock that if he stayed with him for a hundred years he could teach him secrets that would make him greater than any other god. However, Vivec found Lie-Rock and told him that the Void Ghost's deals are only for Ruling Kings, and then sent Nerevar to kill it. Instead of finding Lie-Rock, Nerevar found the Void Ghost, who told Nerevar that they were both in the wrong place. In this moment of confusion, Lie-Rock took the opportunity to attack Vivec's city, falling from the sky like a meteor, but before any damage could be done, Vivec froze Lie-Rock in the air by merely lifting his hand and pierced it with Muatra. When Nerevar returned to Vivec, he asked Vivec if he wanted it removed. Vivec responded, stating that he would keep Lie-Rock frozen where it was with its last intentions so that if the citizen's love for Vivec ever disappeared, they would be crushed by the rock. With the seventh monster defeated, Vivec returned to the Provisional House to find the eighth and strongest monster, this time taking Nerevar with him. When Nerevar arrived, he had the same frightening vision that Vivec had the first time he entered the non-spatial space, that of the next, two-headed, Ruling King, Tiber Septim. Together, both of them found the eighth monster, named GULGA MOR JIL. Instead of fighting his mother-father, GULGA MOR JIL asked Vivec why he must die. Vivec told the monster that it was his nature to die and gave him a prayer of mercy to comfort him. With this, the eighth monster accepted his death and his bones became the foundation of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow that all the monsters were defeated, the war with the Dwemer began. The Dwemer were aided by the Nords, with Ysmir as their leader. Nerevar led the Chimer armies and slew the Dwemer King &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; at Red Mountain, where he first found the Heart of Lorkhan. Dwemeri &lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt; attacked Mournhold, but were fought back by Almalexia, and Sotha Sil commanded an army of &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;clockwork&lt;/a&gt; Dreughs. Nerevar went seeking Dagoth Ur within Red Mountain, but the mountain exploded when he attempted to go too far inside. It was then that the High Priest Kagrenac revealed his great war machine, a &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Walking Star&lt;/a&gt;, which was the soul of the Dwemer built in the image of Vivec, and destroyed the Heartland of Veloth, creating the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. To defeat the star, Sotha Sil, Almalexia, and Vivec combined as one and took from the star its fire, mystery, and feet. No longer able to walk, the soul of the Dwemer was defeated and removed from the world.\nPersonality.\nWhen referring to his life as a mortal, Vivec describes himself as being very impatient, liking conversation to be quick and down to the point. As a teenager, Vivec was willing to kill, steal, and whore himself out for money without regret. However, his personality changed as he grew older. During his years in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;, he was said to have been its most gallant knight, as well as its most subtle rogue, a quality that stayed with him even in godhood. He was also said to be brave, honorable, cunning, and devious, all at once. Vivec is viewed by the people of Morrowind as being a benevolent and protective god, and is often considered to be the most popular aspect of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; due to his frequent public appearances and his safeguarding of the Dunmer people through diplomatic and martial ways. The tale of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Ashmask\"&gt;Vivec's Ashmask&lt;/a&gt; says that when a farmer was ill and could not pay the temple fee for a cure, Vivec himself healed him and left the mask as a symbol, showing his generosity and kindess. When worshipping Vivec, people recognize his valor, daring, justice, courtesy, pride, generosity, and humility\u2014these traits of Vivec are known as his Seven Graces. Vivec shows heavy appreciation for the arts, most notably poetry, which he is said to write every morning. He is often described as being both \"beautiful and bloody\" and an \"artistic violence\" due to his dual nature, which has been said to give Vivec a bipolar personality. Vivec's protective and artistic essences have gained him the appellation \"Warrior-Poet.\" Vivec is believed to have become &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;'s lover sometime after the death of &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; teaches that Vivec's duality is derived from his supposed &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; representation as the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. It is taught that Vivec and the other members of the Tribunal became gods through the guidance of their respective anticipations, as well as achieving superhuman discipline and virtue and supernatural wisdom and insight, but this is known to be untrue as it was the Tribunal's stealing of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s power that made them gods. Nevertheless, it is still possible that Vivec and the other aspects of ALMSIVI are actually related to the Daedric &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon%23The%20Reclamations\"&gt;Reclamations&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"mantling\"&gt;mantling&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec's relation to Mephala has given him a secret darker demeanor that he hides from the Dunmer people; this being his affiliation with the concepts of sex and murder, which Mephala is the patron god of. Vivec even describes his love as being \"shaped like a &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;,\" which in a sense, reflects his violent and loving nature. The people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; do not view Vivec as a representation of these notions, but they do unconsciously accept that these components of Vivec do exist.\nVivec shows his darker side during his trial, in which he deceived and risked the lives of many important scholars in order to get revenge on &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, even seeming to have planned on the death of a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i man who was present at the trial. Vivec also stated at the end of his Trial that every gift he has ever given was in his own pleasure, and openly admits to killing Nerevar and stealing godhood out of his own free will. Some questionable actions of Vivec also come up in the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\", whether they should be considered true or not, most notably his murder of a loyal mystic who did nothing wrong, and keeping &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; above his city as a forceful demand of love from his citizens. During the desperate situation Vivec was in while trying to stop Dagoth Ur, Vivec had stated that he no longer cared for the suffering of his people and that the only reason he continued warding off Dagoth Ur was so that he would not experience the shame of losing to him. Vivec and the other members of the Tribunal have been known to do immoral things in the means of protecting Morrowind and its people, most notably during the crisis caused by &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. The most often-stated reasoning for actions such as the persecution of &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; and lies about how the Tribunal really achieved divinity was so that the people kept their faith in the Tribunal, especially during times of hardship.\nVivec was known to take his divinity quite lightly and did not really care whether he was a god or not. After his disconnection from the Heart of Lorkhan, he was said to be happy to be a mortal again.\nGallery.\nC0DA.\nThe following are images of Vivec from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//c0da.es/\"&gt;C0DA&lt;/a&gt;:"}

Using the information obtained from Gallus' journal as proof, I hope to convince Brynjolf of Karliah's innocence and Mercer Frey's betrayal.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAt the beginning of the quest, the Dragonborn must enter the Ragged Flagon, however they will find the entrance by the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; Mausoleum locked, making the only point of entrance the Ratway. Karliah will be waiting there and will ask the Dragonborn if they are ready to confront the Guild. She has &lt;a href=\"Gallus%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Gallus's translated journal&lt;/a&gt; ready to show to the guild members, who require convincing. Agreeing to back her up will result in Karliah proceeding into the Cistern. If the City Influence quests have been completed, &lt;a href=\"Garthar\"&gt;Garthar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ravyn%20Imyan\"&gt;Ravyn Imyan&lt;/a&gt; will be guarding the door to the Cistern from the Flagon, but allow Karliah and the Dragonborn through. As expected, Brynjolf, Vex and &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; are waiting for Karliah and the Dragonborn with their weapons drawn, as are the other members on the far sides of the Cistern. Karliah hands over Gallus's journal as proof that it was Mercer that had been stealing from the guild. Brynjolf, refusing to believe that Mercer has been stealing from the Guild, orders Delvin to open the vault, which is found empty.\nIt takes two keys to unlock the vault, leading to Brynjolf's confusion, although Karliah mentions that he did not need a key. Delvin, Brynjolf, and Mercer are the only ones who own the needed keys. Although vindicated, Karliah is just as angered by this as the rest of the Thieves Guild, except perhaps for the seething Vex, who vows to kill Mercer immediately. Brynjolf calms the guild members down and orders Vex to guard the Ragged Flagon along with Delvin. He then asks the Dragonborn what they have learned from Karliah. The Dragonborn needs to explain to him that Mercer killed Gallus, that the three of them were Nightingales and that Karliah was behind &lt;a href=\"Goldenglow\"&gt;Goldenglow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew&lt;/a&gt;, which was a cunning plan to try and make Mercer look weak in front of &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter that, Brynjolf assigns the Dragonborn to an important task: They are to break into Mercer's house in Riften - Riftweald Manor - and gather any information that may indicate where the traitor has gone. Before leaving Brynjolf, the Dragonborn may ask him what the best way is into Riftweald Manor. If the Dragonborn asks Brynjolf for additional information before leaving, they find out about a watchdog and an exterior ramp with a mechanism to lower it, which could aid in the Dragonborn's escape. Also, asking about the watchdog named Vald will make Brynjolf indicate Vex may have more information to provide.\nIf the Dragonborn asks Vex about him, she tells them that Vald has a debt and that Vald is only interested in gold, so buying him off is a possibility, but it will not be cheap and Vald might not betray Mercer. Consequently, Vex suggests speaking to Maven Black-Briar about erasing Vald's debt, or running him through with a blade and taking what is needed off his body.\nEntering Riftweald Manor.\nWhen the Dragonborn reaches the Riftweald Manor they may find many entrances into the area: the manor's front door and two gates by the entrance to the Temple of Mara all require a &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt;, or the expert &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; locked gate behind the manor. Going through the back side of the manor, the optional objective to shoot the ramp mechanism (a dark object underneath the ramp) can be completed using a variety of methods: &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magelight&lt;/a&gt; spell, or by shooting an arrow at it.\nVald patrols this area and will attack the Dragonborn if he sees they have broken in. With a high enough Speech skill (an Amulet of Dibella helps), Mercer's House Key can be obtained by persuading Vald that Mercer needs him in Markath, with a high enough &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; skill, it can be taken from his pocket when he stands with his back against the gate - or it can be gotten by simply killing him. Alternatively, if the Dragonborn has cleared Vald's debt by retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Quill%20of%20Gemination\"&gt;Quill of Gemination&lt;/a&gt; for Maven, they can speak to Vald to receive the key. It is important to be outside the gated area when speaking with Vald otherwise he will be hostile. Wait for him to walk up to the gate to talk with him, then he will give the Dragonborn the key and leave Riften.\nIf a Riften Guard is nearby and spots the Dragonborn, they will approach and ask about the \"incident.\" Although further information cannot be obtained about what incident they are referring to, it seems related to breaking into the manor's secured area. Being close to a guard will cause this dialogue to repeat often, allowing the Dragonborn two options: to say they do not know anything about the incident, or to refuse to answer questions. The first option will satisfy the guard but refusing to cooperate will initiate the arrest dialogue.\nRiftweald Manor interior.\nImmediately after entering the manor, the Dragonborn can hear multiple voices. Beyond the next door is a bandit who is looking in the opposite direction. The Dragonborn can either sneak past him to the bedroom or kill him, which will obviously alert the others. Then, they are to go down the stairs and ignore the guard at the other end of the area, and go through a closed set of doors. On the far left of the room there will be a suspicious-looking &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;cabinet&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn needs to open it and push the back out to find another set of stairs to go down. Here, a large opening is found, leading into a series of tunnels.\nThe tunnels.\nIt is not difficult to navigate through the tunnels, but one should be wary of a tripwire that activates a series of lethal blades. Upon reaching the doorway, the Dragonborn needs to stand next to it, as when it is opened, poison darts are shot forth. There are two sets of poison arrows: one before Mercer's plans, and the other right after you enter the tunnels. There is a fire trap before the latter. There is a lot of valuable loot in Mercer's room\u2014a hoard of jewels in a bowl, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Kitchen%20Reader\"&gt;The Red Kitchen Reader&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as a &lt;a href=\"The%20Litany%20of%20Larceny%23Larceny%20trophies\"&gt;larceny target&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bust%20of%20the%20Gray%20Fox\"&gt;Bust of the Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;, which after being sold to Delvin Mallory for some septims, becomes a decoration in the Cistern. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Chillrend%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chillrend&lt;/a&gt; may be taken from its display case. This unique weapon is one of the most powerful one-handed swords in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, if the manor is entered once the Dragonborn is at least level 46. With the loot taken, the Dragonborn must make sure to pick up &lt;a href=\"Mercer%27s%20Plans\"&gt;Mercer's Plans&lt;/a&gt;.\nConclusion.\nContinuing on through the last tunnel, the Dragonborn will find themselves at the door to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway%20Vaults\"&gt;The Ratway Vaults&lt;/a&gt;. Following the quest objective marker back to Brynjolf and talking to him completes the quest."}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; arrives on the island of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;'s decree to open the border to foreigners, only to encounter an attack by mysterious creatures outside &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt;. They are tasked by &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; with investigating the decree's effects on the populace, as well as the nature of the attack.\nBackground.\nDirect start journal entry:\n\"Queen Ayrenn ordered the once-forbidden island of Summerset to open its borders and welcome outsiders to its expansive shores. Razum-dar, an agent of the Queen, has come to the island to make sure the decree is followed to the letter.\"\nCollections menu journal entry:\n\"Queen Ayrenn requests your aid in important matters in the newly opened province of Summerset Isle. A boat leaves regularly from most major cities. Seek out the Eye of the Queen, Razum-dar, when you reach the beautiful city of Shimmerene.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest can be started in more than one way. No matter what, you must purchase \"The Elder Scrolls Online: Summerset\" on a supported platform or &lt;a href=\"https%3A//account.elderscrollsonline.com/\"&gt;redeem&lt;/a&gt; an access code for it. From there, you can open the \"Collections\" menu and find the \"Stories\" tab. Activate the quest from there. Alternatively, speak to &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Calibar\"&gt;Calibar&lt;/a&gt; directly to get started.\nWhen you first play the game after obtaining \"Summerset\", an opening cinematic video will play. While this mainly serves to provide context for the introductory quest to \"Summerset\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mind%20Trap\"&gt;The Mind Trap&lt;/a&gt;,\" it displays for all players. New players will have to complete that quest in order to start \"The Queen's Decree.\"\nTalk to citizens.\nRegardless of how you enter Summerset, either through the &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20Wayshrine\"&gt;wayshrine&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt; or from &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Prisoner's Hold&lt;/a&gt; after completing \"The Mind Trap,\" an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; named Calibar will run up to you, explaining that a spontaneous attack by strange creatures has just occurred nearby: \"Let the cat fight those monsters! I'm getting out of here! The island's sprung a leak! Run!\" There are two ways to start the quest from here: either speak to Calibar, or head directly to the site of the attack, along the road heading southeast of the wayshrine. If you speak to Calibar, he will give the following information.\n\"First the Queen issues a decree that changes the status of Summerset from an isolated paradise into a ... tourist attraction! Now monsters! Sea creatures! I've never seen anything like them! Well, I say let the cat fight them! Better him than me!\"\nTell him that you will speak with &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; in order to start the quest. Razum-dar is located to the southeast, just up the road. When you arrive, Razum-dar will be found standing over the corpses of several of the creatures, alongside that of &lt;a href=\"Urcelia\"&gt;Urcelia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Edelle\"&gt;Edelle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tinaducil\"&gt;Tinaducil&lt;/a&gt; will be found at the scene of the attack as well.\nAlternatively, if you run up to the attack site while Razum-dar is still engaged in combat with the creatures, you will be able to overhear a brief conversation.\nTinaducil: \"Are \u2026 are those creatures \u2026 newcomers? They're hideous!\"\nRazum-dar: \"Raz enjoys a good fight as much as the next cat, but these are horrible creatures!\"\nRazum-dar will then say to you, \"Five-claw, good to see you! Raz has a proposal if you have the time.\" Regardless of which option you chose, speaking to Razum-dar results in the following conversation:\n\"Have you ever seen such creatures? Raz has not. Probably neither have you. You are a newcomer, yes? new to this island of High Elves? This one has an eye for such things. And you look capable. So, can Raz interest you in some cloak-and-dagger work?\"\nAfter agreeing to ask around about how the decree is being received, you are given objectives to speak with &lt;a href=\"Rhanul\"&gt;Rhanul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tsoxolza\"&gt;Tsoxolza&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Olnewil\"&gt;Olnewil&lt;/a&gt; in Shimmerene. You can either head directly to the city to find them, or ask Razum-dar about the specifics.\nWhat were those strange creatures I saw you fighting? \"Raz never saw such monsters in his life! They appear related to water, but this one tends to avoid the stuff. That pearl, though. Raz swears it was calling those creatures. A mystery for another time, perhaps. Now we need to see to the newcomers.\"\nAnyone in specific you want me to talk to regarding the Queen's decree? \"As a matter of fact, Raz made a list! Olnewil, a High Elf artisan, spoke out. See what she complained about. Then there's Tsoxolza, a persecuted Argonian newcomer. Finally Rhanul, a city resident noted in the Divine Prosecution's observation log.\"\nAnything I should know about Shimmerene before I head out? \"Hmm. Raz knows very little about city ordinances or how to tell the difference between mead and ale, so let's avoid those topics, yes? Otherwise, this one knows all about the Queen's decree and the initial reactions of the nobles and Kinlady.\"\nAfter leaving the area to find the citizens Razum-dar suggested you talk to, the attack site will disappear. The citizen closest to the attack site is Olnewil, who can be found at the southern docks to the southeast. She is located to the east of the docks themselves, collecting sea shells by the water. When spoken to, the following conversation will occur:\n\"\"Not that you'd understand the concept, but the Path to &lt;a href=\"Alaxon\"&gt;Alaxon&lt;/a&gt; requires dedication and complete concentration. I must find the perfect shells or my pigments will be substandard. And do you know what that will do to my art? Exactly!\"\"\nAfter speaking with Olnewil, head back up the stairs of the docks and follow the road northwest, past the city, to find Tsoxolza. When you reach a small bridge, head southwest along the bank of the river. Near a large rock, you will find a hostile &lt;a href=\"salamander\"&gt;salamander&lt;/a&gt; eating the corpse of a deceased &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Tsoxolza. Kill the salamander and find the nearby bag, titled \"Tsoxolza's Backpack,\" under the rock. Within the bag is a note called \"&lt;a href=\"Tsoxolza%27s%20Letter\"&gt;Tsoxolza's Letter&lt;/a&gt;\", which gives further details about his situation.\nThe final citizen you have to speak with, Rhanul, is found at the far side of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20Dockworks\"&gt;Shimmerene Dockworks&lt;/a&gt;, north of Shimmerene. Head to the docks, either going over the aforementioned bridge or through the city itself. Rhanul is located in a large stone building by the water with several boats under construction inside it. Speak to him, and he will reveal the details about his complaint to the Kinlady.\n\"I really must get back to work now. Every moment that my cousin remains sequestered is another moment where I must perform the work of two people. Pleasant travels, wayfarer.\"\nWhen you return to the entrance of Shimmerene to meet with Razum-dar, you will encounter a conversation between &lt;a href=\"Aldarch%20Tilcalar\"&gt;Aldarch Tilcalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corimin\"&gt;Corimin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daalinden\"&gt;Daalinden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Indalinwe\"&gt;Indalinwe&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Veranquel\"&gt;Veranquel&lt;/a&gt;, with Razum-dar standing behind them.\nVeranquel: \"This is unheard of! Why have you closed the Monastery?\"\nAldarch Tilcalar: \"Good people, I hear your concerns.\"\nIndalinwe: \"But the workers I hired? They were aboard the ship from Rivenspire!\"\nAldarch Tilcalar: \"The Kinlady and I, we have only your best interests in mind. Every guest must be sequestered while we ascertain their suitability for Altmer society.\"\nDaalinden: \"The Aldarch's right. Lock up the newcomers!\"\nCorimin: \"Send the newcomers back where they came from! We don't want them here!\"\nAfterwards, speak with Razum-dar. He will direct you to the &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Serene%20Harmony\"&gt;Monastery of Serene Harmony&lt;/a&gt; in Shimmerene, located in the northeastern part of the city.\n\"Such anger! Raz never expected to hear such words from the Queen's loyal subjects. The sentiment isn't universal, but enough feel this way for Raz to be concerned. Did you learn anything interesting from the people I sent you to talk to?\"\n\"You have no idea how much Raz appreciates a good assistant. In this line of work, decent help can be the difference between life and death. Not that the work is dangerous. Much. Now, let's go investigate the monastery!\"\nInvestigate the Monastery.\nHead northeast through the city gates and east past the canal. Bear right and begin walking up the steps to the monastery. After passing &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Kinlady Avinisse's Mansion&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Knight\"&gt;Golden Knight&lt;/a&gt; will appear and speak to you, saying, \"You there! I have a\u2014damn it! Why won't this work?\" However, he will disappear immediately afterwards. Two characters, &lt;a href=\"Lialanah\"&gt;Lialanah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Olunandon\"&gt;Olunandon&lt;/a&gt;, will then express their surprise about the knight's appearance.\nLialanah: \"Did you see a Golden Knight?\"\nOlunandon: \"I have no idea what that was, and I'm not sure I want to know!\"\nContinue up the steps to the monastery, and Razum-dar will approach the &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20Sentry\"&gt;Monastery Sentry&lt;/a&gt; outside of the building, leading him away.\nRazum-dar: \"Sentry! Raz owes you for that game of cards and has come to pay!\"\nMonastery Sentry: \"Huh? I don't recall any ... you say I won some gold?\"\nRazum-dar: \"Don't you remember? Raz always pays his debts. And he always buys the drinks!\"\nMonastery Sentry: \"Gold and drinks? Well, my relief should be along soon, so why not!\"\nNow, enter the Monastery through the main door. Once inside, you will have three quest objectives on the ground floor of the building. The closest of the three is the \"&lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Sequestered%20Guests\"&gt;List of Sequestered Guests&lt;/a&gt;\", which rests on a table on the western side of the hall, and lists several newcomers to the island which the monks have sent to cells in the Monastery Undercroft\u2014one of the newcomers is noted to be &lt;a href=\"Rhanul\"&gt;Rhanul&lt;/a&gt;'s cousin, just as he claimed earlier in the quest. Take the note as evidence.\nThe next objective is the \"&lt;a href=\"Kinlady%27s%20Letter\"&gt;Kinlady's Letter&lt;/a&gt;\" on a table near the center of the hall, by the bookshelves. This book reveals &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse\"&gt;Kinlady Avinisse&lt;/a&gt;'s elation regarding Aldarch Tilcalar's plan of the social integration of the immigrants. Pick this note up as well.\nNext, move forward to the large, multi-story room underneath the monastery's spire. On the right side, you will find a sleeping monk named &lt;a href=\"Monastic%20Nuleros\"&gt;Monastic Nuleros&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to him to uncover additional information about the newcomers and the monks of the monastery.\n\"Not now, please. Your spiritual well being can wait until after my nap.\"\nEven though Monastic Nuleros has directed you to the Undercroft, you cannot actually enter it yet. First, you need to head up one of the staircases on either side of the monastery and go to the north-northwest room on the upper floor. Here, you will find an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Pearl\"&gt;Abyssal Pearl&lt;/a&gt; on a table.\nUpon examining the pearl, &lt;a href=\"Valsirenn\"&gt;Valsirenn&lt;/a&gt; will enter the room and say to you, \"Unusual knick-knack for an Aldarch's office, wouldn't you agree?\" Speak to her, and the following conversation will begin:\n\"I noticed you skulking around while I was engaged in some skulking of my own. I suppose we both came to the monastery with a similar purpose in mind.\"\n\"A curious pearl. I wonder where the Aldarch acquired it? Probably not important. I'll meet you in the undercroft and we can see what's going on with the newcomers.\"\nGo down the eastern staircase and head straight for the next staircase, which leads to the Monastery Undercroft (specifically the Undercroft Passage). Go through the door. Once inside, Valsirenn will say, \"Something's wrong down here. I sense magic. Vile magic.\" Make a left and walk down another staircase. This leads to a room full of large cages, several of which have newcomers to the island within them. These include &lt;a href=\"Aphaurin%20Spenard\"&gt;Aphaurin Spenard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jhiinval\"&gt;Jhiinval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Minone%20Aloette\"&gt;Minone Aloette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zhaaruis\"&gt;Zhaaruis&lt;/a&gt;, and two &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20%28Character%29\"&gt;corpses&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon sighting the cages, Valsirenn will comment, \"Cages? These people did nothing to deserve such treatment. There's someone alive over there. See if you can help her.\" If you try to talk to her now, she will say, \"Something is amiss in Summerset, but I can't quite put my finger on the cause. No matter. I'm sure my investigation will turn up something. I just need to be patient.\"\nMinone Aloette is the only prisoner who can be interacted with. Speak to her, and she will explain that the monks just took several newcomers to the next room in the undercroft.\n\"Thank the Divines! You aren't one of the monks. Please, let me out of here!\"\nMove to the gate on your left and unlock Minone. She will subsequently unlock the cages of the other prisoners in the room and exit the Monastery Passage through the door you used to enter. The other prisoners cannot be interacted with.\nAfter finishing the dialogue with Minone, Valsirenn will say, \"Is that a ... Skaafin?,\" after which she will run to the other side of the room and crouch down by the Daedra. Speak to Valsirenn once more to progress further into the Monastery Undercroft.\n\"A Daedra? Here? And that's a Skaafin, if I remember my Daedric recitations correctly. Very curious.\"\nContinue west through the door into the Undercroft Great Hall. At the center of this large, two-story room is a pile of rubble from a collapsed walkway and a mysterious blue pearl, levitating and swirling with energy. Nearby is an &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Earl of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Skaafin%20Bloodcleaver\"&gt;Skaafin Bloodcleaver&lt;/a&gt;. Several newcomers can be seen closer to you, on the walkway: &lt;a href=\"Anjolda\"&gt;Anjolda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aphaurin%20Spenard\"&gt;Aphaurin Spenard&lt;/a&gt; (even though he was previously freed), &lt;a href=\"Elivette%20Dupare\"&gt;Elivette Dupare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krithgra\"&gt;Krithgra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mishzin\"&gt;Mishzin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rafel%20Ledure\"&gt;Rafel Ledure&lt;/a&gt;. The characters &lt;a href=\"Angetha\"&gt;Angetha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daine%20Dupare\"&gt;Daine Dupare&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eburris%20Calatus\"&gt;Eburris Calatus&lt;/a&gt; can be found below, near the pearl.\nUpon entering, the Earl of Clavicus Vile will say, \"More newcomers? Unfortunately, the magic only \"\" those who have been prepared. But never fear. Your turn will come.\" In response, Valsirenn will approach the edge of the walkway, looking down upon the pearl, and say, \"Daedric cultists? The pearl's draining these people!\" Simultaneously, the characters will be surrounded by swirling red lights similar to the ones around the pearl, and will collapse on the ground with a scream. They are not dead, but their health bars are drained. Valsirenn will then run to the top of the staircase at the right walkway. Follow her, and then proceed down the staircase.\nThe Earl of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; will run away into the next room of the undercroft, but the Skaafin Bloodcleaver will remain near the pearl and attack you. Valsirenn will say, \"I'll deal with the pearl, you hold off these creatures!\" Defend Valsireen so that she can handle the pearl. She will follow that up with, \"The pearl's magic attracts these creatures. Hold them off while I complete my spell!\" Soon afterwards, a &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Larva\"&gt;Yaghra Larva&lt;/a&gt; will appear, followed by a &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Spewer\"&gt;Yaghra Spewer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Strider\"&gt;Yaghra Strider&lt;/a&gt;. After killing all of these enemies, Valsirenn's spell will have taken effect, and she will say, \"Come on, let's talk outside.\" She will subsequently run into the next chamber, the Undercroft Labyrinth. Enter it as well and speak to her there.\n\"Those poor people. This wasn't just about newcomers and opposing the Queen's decree. That was Daedric magic back there! I just wish we had arrived a few moments earlier.\"\nWhile you are now capable of leaving the Undercroft even without speaking to Valsirenn, doing so will not advance yiy to the next stage of the quest. Since you cannot re-enter the Undercroft through the exit at the end, you will have to loop around back to the Monastery of Serene Harmony and go through the whole thing again to get back to Valsirenn. It is preferable to follow along with the quest markers instead of trying to skip portions of the quest.\nContinue down the hallway of the Undercroft Labyrinth. Take a right, and you will come to a fork. You will reach a dead end if you go right, filled with several bookshelves and two enemies, a &lt;a href=\"Skaafin%20Wretch\"&gt;Skaafin Wretch&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Skaafin%20Masquer\"&gt;Skaafin Masquer&lt;/a&gt;. If you go left, you will find additional Skaafin ahead, such as a &lt;a href=\"Skaafin%20Witchling\"&gt;Skaafin Witchling&lt;/a&gt;. Take a right, killing or sneaking past any Skaafin in your path, and continue down the long hallway. Then take another right into the room with the &lt;a href=\"Skaafin%20Tracker\"&gt;Skaafin Tracker&lt;/a&gt; and another Skaafin.\nMake your way to the doorway across the hall, where you will find a staircase on your right leading to the bottom of a large room. However, if you follow the staircase to the bottom, you will be attacked by several Skaafin close by. To avoid them, jump off the ledge to the left and go directly to the exit hallway to the left. Go through the door labeled \"Summerset,\" and you will come out in the hedge maze west of the Monastery of Serene Harmony.\nWhen you finally escape the Undercroft Labyrinth, Valsirenn will say, \"Living on Artaeum for a few centuries doesn't prepare you for physical activity. Let the Eye of the Queen know what we discovered and I'll catch up with you later.\" While not required to progress further in the quest, you can speak to Valsirenn at this point for more information.\n\"We were warned that Daedric Princes had their eyes on Summerset, but I didn't expect that level of danger from what was supposed to be a simple investigation. I suggest you tell the Eye of the Queen what we discovered. I'll catch up with you later.\"\nTo get out of the hedge maze, go forward and take a right. Then take a left and an immediate right out of the white gate, through which you can see the &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20Dockworks\"&gt;Shimmerene Dockworks&lt;/a&gt;. If you are unsure where to go, simply wait for &lt;a href=\"Elianne%20Alfena\"&gt;Elianne Alfena&lt;/a&gt; to enter the maze and follow her out. From there, take a left and walk toward the &lt;a href=\"Anchors%20Aweigh%20Inn\"&gt;Anchors Aweigh Inn&lt;/a&gt;, just past the garden. Inside the inn, go up the staircase on the left and walk to the room at the end of the hall to find Razum-dar. Speak to him once again.\n\"Ah, this one's new partner returns! What interesting scandal did you uncover in the monastery? Tell Raz every juicy detail!\"\n\"Go on. Pretend you belong and no one will notice you, especially once you put on those elegant clothes. Meet Raz nearby after you talk to her. This one looks forward to hearing what she has to say about all of this.\"\nIf you open your inventory and go to the \"Quest\" tab, you will find an note titled \"&lt;a href=\"Invitation%20to%20the%20Kinlady%27s%20Conference\"&gt;Invitation to the Kinlady's Conference&lt;/a&gt;\" with the description, \"An invitation provided by Razum-dar to get you into the Kinlady's mansion in Shimmerene.\"\nAttend the Kinlady's meeting.\nExit the Anchors Aweigh Inn and take a left, heading southwest along the street past all the performers. Head up the staircase toward &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Avinisse%27s%20Mansion\"&gt;Kinlady Avinisse's Mansion&lt;/a&gt;. When you get close, the option will appear to equip the Elegant Clothes. While it is not necessary to do so to enter the house, you cannot gain entrance to Kinlady Avinisse's Garden, the site of the meeting, without wearing them. Enter the house, walk straight ahead into the room with the staircase, and turn right into the room with the fireplace and a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Galmelor\"&gt;Galmelor&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to him in order to continue.\n\"Yes? And who might you be?\"\nGalmelor will then walk into the basement of the mansion. Go through the door labeled \"Kinlady Avinisse's Garden\" behind where he was formerly standing. When you arrive in the garden, Kinlady Avinisse will be found addressing the other guests, &lt;a href=\"Aldarch%20Tilcalar\"&gt;Aldarch Tilcalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arrimoril\"&gt;Arrimoril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Canonreeve%20Elquisa\"&gt;Canonreeve Elquisa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Justiciar%20Suriwen\"&gt;Chief Justiciar Suriwen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Craftreeve%20Midalmo\"&gt;Craftreeve Midalmo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haldinil\"&gt;Haldinil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Riniswin\"&gt;Riniswin&lt;/a&gt;, with the two servants, &lt;a href=\"Flaniethe\"&gt;Flaniethe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kanrel\"&gt;Kanrel&lt;/a&gt;, holding platters nearby. The Kinlady will say, \"We all have concerns regarding the Queen's decree. I assure you that I am working with Aldarch Tilcalar to safeguard the sanctity of Shimmerene and all of Summerset. Enjoy the food and drink. Business of the city requires my attention, but I shall rejoin you shortly.\" She will then go into the house.\nThe main objective now is to speak with the Kinlady, but it is still possible to talk to some of the other guests first. Notably, there is an optional objective to talk to Aldarch Tilcalar, as follows:\nIf you speak to Canonreeve Elquisa, who is sitting on a bench in the northeastern part of the garden, she will have the following dialogue:\nIf you speak to Chief Justiciar Suriwen, who is standing by the fountain near the center of the garden, she will have the following dialogue:\nIf you speak to Craftreeve Midalmo, who is sitting on a bench in the southwestern part of the garden, he will have the following dialogue:\nReturn to Kinlady Avinisse's Mansion. Go up the staircase to your right. At the top, go into the room to the left, where you will find Kinlady Avinisse standing in front of a fireplace. She will say, \"How dare you barge into my home without so much as a by your leave?\" Speak to her in order to complete the objective.\nAfter this, Galmelor will run into the room and speak to Kinlady Avinisse:\nGalmelor: \"My Lady, one of the monks said to deliver this message. It's from the Aldarch himself.\"\nKinlady Avinisse: \"The Coral Forest? An odd location for a meeting, but I need to hear the Aldarch's explanation.\"\nAt this point, you should exit the Kinlady's home and walk down the steps to the bridge in the middle of the city, where you will find Razum-dar. Speak to him.\n\"Pretend you are adjusting your boot or admiring the architecture. As hard as it may be, look anywhere but directly at Raz. Good, good. Now, tell Raz what you learned at the Kinlady's manor.\"\nValsirenn will approach the two of you and begin speaking to Razum-dar:\nValsirenn: \"I'm glad I found you. While watching the Kinlady's mansion, I saw her ladyship sneak out the back and leave the city.\"\nRazum-dar: \"The Kinlady is meeting the Aldarch in the Coral Forest. Raz smells something and it isn't moon-sugar biscuits!\"\nValsirenn: \"Your reputation precedes you, Eye of the Queen. I am Valsirenn of the Psijic Order. And I agree that the Aldarch is more than a simple monk.\"\nRazum-dar: \"We should work together, yes? But let's travel separately to avoid attracting unwanted attention. Raz will find you both at the Coral Forest.\"\nMeet Valsirenn at the Coral Forest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Forest\"&gt;Coral Forest&lt;/a&gt; is a large natural formation of coral that can be found to the southeast of Shimmerene. Exit the city through the main gate and follow the road southeast for a good distance, bearing to your left when you come to a fork in the road.\nYou may encounter various hostile creatures along the way, such as &lt;a href=\"welwa\"&gt;welwa&lt;/a&gt;s, but they can be avoided. Two lorebooks, \"&lt;a href=\"Fang%20of%20the%20Sea%20Vipers\"&gt;Fang of the Sea Vipers&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Handbill\"&gt;Thalmor Handbill&lt;/a&gt;\", may be found under a tree by the road. It can be identified by being close to a sharp corner in the road, as viewed from the map.\nYou will know when you have reached the Coral Forest when you start to see large coral formations to your left, filled with &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Sea%20Adder\"&gt;Lesser Sea Adder&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Reef%20Viper\"&gt;Reef Viper&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Salamander\"&gt;Salamander&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Strider\"&gt;Yaghra Strider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Yaghra%20Spewer\"&gt;Yaghra Spewer&lt;/a&gt;s close to the place where the Kinlady and Aldarch are meeting. Find Valsirenn near the northern part of the Coral Forest and speak to her:\n\"One of Summerset's more unique environments, the Coral Forest. I used to love coming here when I was growing up. We need to find out why the Aldarch asked Kinlady Avinisse to meet him out here.\"\n\"You take the lead. My combat spells are extremely limited. Just stay alert. We don't know what the Aldarch and the Kinlady are doing out here.\"\nWhen you approach the Kinlady and Aldarch, the following conversation can be overheard (the two cannot actually be seen conversing, as their voices appear to emanate from a nearby rock):\nKinlady Avinisse: \"Murder? That wasn't part of the plan, Aldarch!\"\nAldarch Tilcalar: \"You know nothing of the plan, you fool. Let me give you a taste of what the Prince of Bargains has in store for this pitiful world.\"\nKinlady Avinisse: \"Your Prince? I want no part of Daedra! Help!\"\nValsirenn will then say, \"The Aldarch! We'd better hurry!\" Kill any enemies in your way and then go to attach Aldarch Tilcalar, revealed to be the &lt;a href=\"Earl%20of%20Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Earl of Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; seen in the Monastery Undercroft, who can be seen standing next to an Abyssal Pearl hovering over the water. As the Kinlady is fleeing, Valsirenn will comment, \"I'll go after the Kinlady! You deal with the Aldarch!\" In preparation for combat, the Earl will say, \"Come, nebarra! Let me show you the power bestowed upon me by the Prince of Bargains!\" Attack him, and after dealing some damage he will summon Yaghra to defend himself. Once you kill him, activate the Abyssal Pearl to destroy it. Then meet up with Valsirenn and Razum-dar to the west. First, speak to Valsirenn.\n\"Razum-dar apprehended the Kinlady. They're at the west edge of the Coral Forest. What happened to Aldarch Tilcalar? Did he escape?\"\nAs she is saying her final line, Valsirenn will vast a spell to attune you to the portal to Artaeum in the Keep of Eleven Forces. Walk a short distance toward Kinlady Avinisse and Razum-dar, near a campfire. Upon your approach, Razum-dar will make a remark:\nRazum-dar: \"Ah, five-claw! The Kinlady and Raz had the most illuminating conversation.\"\nKinlady Avinisse: \"You can't treat me like some sort of criminal, you horrid creature!\"\nIf you speak to the Kinlady at this time, she will only say, \"My social standing is ruined. Just ... ruined.\" Speak to Razum-dar to complete the objective.\n\"Queen Ayrenn will be disappointed that the Kinlady of Shimmerene allowed a false Aldarch to murder so many newcomers. Such a scandal makes other travelers uneasy about coming here, yes?\"\n\"Stay alert, five-claw. Raz has heard Psijics turn people into chickens and make them explode. To die covered in feathers instead of fur, such a horrible demise. In the meantime, Raz will send Avinisse home until the Proxy Queen renders judgment.\"\nIf you speak to Kinlady Avinisse, she will have the following dialogue:\n\"Have you come to gloat? To kick me while I wallow in my own misery? Well, go ahead. I deserve it.\"\nTravel to Artaeum.\nTo get to the &lt;a href=\"Keep%20of%20the%20Eleven%20Forces\"&gt;Keep of the Eleven Forces&lt;/a&gt;, you must travel northwest, back up the road you were just on, until you reach a fork. At this point, turn left and you will approach the Keep. Walk forward until you reach the main structure, and head up the staircase to your left. At the top, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Skyshards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyshard&lt;/a&gt; available on the other side of the bridge to your right. The portal to Artaeum can be found down a small staircase to your left, opposite from the Skyshard. A copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Ways\"&gt;The Old Ways&lt;/a&gt;\" may be found on the floor by the eastern wall of the Keep. Approach the portal and activate it to travel to Artaeum.\nYou will be transported to Artaeum. Walk down the winding ramp and travel north to reach the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;. On the route there, you may encounter several static, non-hostile characters such as &lt;a href=\"Tendinwe\"&gt;Tendinwe&lt;/a&gt;, who explains if spoken to, \"Artaeum was once a part of the Summerset archipelago. That's why the flora here may seem so familiar to you. Of course, our order has now moved the island to somewhere else entirely. \u2026 Our order has the ability to move Artaeum, or even make it intangible. That's how we protected ourselves from invaders and outside forces.\" Such dialogue options are not quest-related and will be unchanged if you leave and return to it at this point.\nUnderneath the tower, &lt;a href=\"Ritemaster%20Iachesis\"&gt;Ritemaster Iachesis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valsirenn\"&gt;Valsirenn&lt;/a&gt; can be seen talking to each other, where Valsirenn reveals that the \"friend\" she was searching for is named &lt;a href=\"Leythen\"&gt;Leythen&lt;/a&gt;.\nValsirenn: \"And there was no sign of Leythen. I don't know whether to be grateful or concerned.\"\nRitemaster Iachesis: \"We'll find him, Val. Now go check on the pearl while I speak to our new guest.\"\nAfter this conversation, Valsirenn will walk toward the portal to the Ceporah Tower at the center of the area and activate it. Speak to Ritemaster Iachesis to finish the quest.\n\"What a rare honor Valsirenn bestowed upon you. Only a select few not of our order have ever walked upon this sacred island. Val tells me your aid was indispensable in uncovering the false Aldarch's plot on Summerset.\"\nIf you exit the dialogue box before pressing the \"Complete Quest\" button and speak to Ritemaster Iachesis again, the following conversation will occur, allowing you to finish it:\n\"Strange magic. Life-stealing pearls. Unknown sea creatures. It all relates to Sotha Sil's warning, but we still don't know what form the real threat will eventually take.\"\nIf the final dialogue option is chosen, Ritemaster Iachesis will simply say the line that he would have said initially, had you chosen to ask him about the how to help prior to completing the quest.\nEnter the Ceporah Tower using the portal next to you in order to take your first step toward completing the next quest in the main questline, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Pearl%20of%20Great%20Price\"&gt;A Pearl of Great Price&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

It was here that she discovered the Gray Menhir.\nThe stone loomed over Ranev, dwarfing her and casting a long shadow over the land and water. Ranev was greatly impressed by the size of the standing stone, for she was known for her strength and great height. To her amazement, she watched as words were carved into the stone, struck with great precision by unknown, invisible hands to create a tablet of sorts. The tablet exhorted her with the following words:\n\"Heed the Stars, O pilgrim, and undertake their quest. Seek their six virtues, hewn into stone. Bear each command with a noble heart and return with the utmost speed. For only the swift and the just shall receive celestial favor.\"\nReading these words, Ranev's chest swelled with great purpose. She resolved to take up the stone's challenge and seek the virtues of the Stars. She meditated in front of the Gray Menhir and sang a warrior's hymn before setting out to complete her pilgrimage.\nRanev traveled swifting, visiting each of the six holy sites in turn. At each site, the warrior had to overcome dangerous creatures, foul beasts, and other challenges to find the prayer markers and receive the six virtues. She returned to the Gray Menhir within the allotted time, victorious, with the virtues of the Stars singing inside her. She pledged to embody the virtues until the end of her days.

The bouquet of joss roses in her hand fell to the ground. For a moment it was as if all birds had ceased to sing and a cloud had passed over the sky. Her carefully cultivated and structured haven seemed to flood over with darkness.\n\"We have thy son,\" it read. \"We will be in touch with thee shortly with our ransom demands.\"\nZarek had never made it as far as Akgun after all. One of the brigands on the road, &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; probably, or accursed &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, must have seen his well-appointed carriage, and taken him hostage. Jalemmil clutched at a post for support, wondering if her boy had been hurt. He was but a student, not the sort to fight against well-armed men, but had they beaten him? It was more than a mother's heart could bear to imagine.\n\"Don't tell me they sent the ransom note so quickly,\" called a family voice, and a familiar face appeared through the hedge. It was Zarek. Jalemmil hurried to embrace her boy, tears running down her face.\n\"What happened?\" she cried. \"I thought thou had been kidnapped.\"\n\"I was,\" said Zarek. \"Three huge soaring &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; attacked my carriage on the Frimvorn Pass. Brothers, as I learned, named Mathais, Ulin, and Koorg. Thou should have seen these men, mother. Each one of them would have had trouble fitting through the front door, I can tell thee.\"\n\"What happened?\" Jalemmil repeated. \"Were thou rescued?\"\n\"I thought about waiting for that, but I knew they'd send off a ransom note and I know how thou does worry. So I remembered what my mentor at Akgun always said about remaining calm, observing thy surroundings, and looking for thy opponent's weakness,\" Zarek grinned. \"It took a while, though, because these fellows were truly monsters. And then, when I listened to them, bragging to one another, I realized that vanity was their weakness.\"\n\"What did thou do?\"\n\"They had me chained at their camp in the woods not far from Cael, on a high knoll over-looking a wide river. I heard one of them, Koorg, telling the others that it would take the better part of an hour to swim across the river and back. They were nodding in agreement, when I spoke up.\n\"'I could swim that river and back in thirty minutes,' I said.\n\"'Impossible,' said Koorg. 'I can swim faster than a little whelp like thee.'\n\"So it was agreed that we would dive off the cliff, swim to the center island, and return. As we went to our respective rocks, Koorg took it upon himself to lecture me about all the fine points of swimming. The importance of synchronized movements of the arms and legs for maximum speed. How essential it was to breathe after only third or fourth stroke, not too often to slow thyself down, but not too often to lose one's air. I nodded and agreed to all his fine points. Then we dove off the cliffs. I made it to the island and back in a little over an hour, but Koorg never returned. He had dashed his brains at the rocks at the base of the cliff. I had noticed the telltale undulations of underwater rocks, and had taken the diving rock on the right.\"\n\"But thou returned?\" asked Jalemmil, astounded. \"Was that not then when thou escaped?\"\n\"It was too risky to escape then,\" said Zarek. \"They could have easily caught me again, and I wasn't keen to be blamed for Koorg's disappearance. I said I did not know what happened to him, and after some searching, they decided he had forgotten about the race and had swum ashore to hunt for food. They could not see how I could have had anything to do with his disappearance, as fully visible as I was throughout my swim. The two brothers began making camp along the rocky cliff-edge, picking an ideal location so that I would not be able to escape.\n\"One of the brothers, Mathais, began commenting on the quality of the soil and the gradual incline of the rock that circled around the bay below. Ideal, he said, for a foot race. I expressed my ignorance of the sport, and he was keen to give me details of the proper technique for running a race. He made absurd faces, showing how one must breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth; how to bend one's knees to the proper angle on the rise; the importance of sure foot placement. Most important, he explained, was that the runner keep an aggressive but not too strenuous pace if one intends to win. It is fine to run in second place through the race, he said, provided one has the willpower and strength to pull out in the end.\n\"I was an enthusiastic student, and Mathais decided that we ought to run a quick race around the edge of the bay before night fell. Ulin told us to bring back some &lt;a href=\"firewood\"&gt;firewood&lt;/a&gt; when we came back. We began at once down the path, skirting the cliff below. I followed his advice about breath, gait, and foot placement, but I ran with all my power right from the start. Despite his much longer legs, I was a few paces ahead as we wound the first corner.\n\"With his eyes on my back, Mathais did not see the gape in the rock that I jumped over. He plummeted over the cliff before he had a chance to cry out. I spent a few minutes gathering some twigs before I returned to Ulin at camp.\"\n\"Now thou were just showing off,\" frowned Jalemmil. \"Surely that would have been a good time to escape.\"\n\"Thou might think so,\" agreed Zarek. \"But thou had to see the topography -- a few large trees, and then nothing but shrubs. Ulin would have noticed my absence and caught up with me in no time, and I would have had a hard time explaining Mathais's absence. However, the brief forage around the area allowed me to observe some of the trees close up, and I could formulate my final plan.\n\"When I got back to camp with a few twigs, I told Ulin that Mathais was slow coming along, dragging a large dead tree behind him. Ulin scoffed at his brother's strength, saying it would take him time to pull up a live tree by the roots and drop it on the bonfire. I expressed reasonable doubt.\n\"'I'll show thee,' he said, ripping up a ten foot tall specimen effortlessly.\n\"'But that's scarcely a sapling,' I objected. 'I thought thou could rip up a tree.' His eyes followed mine to a magnificent, heavy-looking one at the edge of the clearing. Ulin grabbed it and began to shake it with a tremendous force to loosen its roots from the dirt. With that, he loosened the hive from the uppermost branches, dropping it down onto his head.\n\"That was when I made my escape, mother,\" said Zarek, in conclusion, showing a little schoolboy pride. \"While Mathais and Koorg were at the base of the cliff, and Ulin was flailing about, engulfed by a swarm.\"\nJalemmil embraced her son once again.\nPublisher's Note\nI was reluctant to publish the works of Marobar Sul, but when the University of Gwylim Press asked me to edit this edition, I decided to use this as an opportunity to set the record straight once and for all.\nScholars do not agree on the exact date of Marobar Sul's work, but it is generally agreed that they were written by the playwright \"Gor Felim,\" famous for popular comedies and romances during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; between the fall of the First &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; Empire and the rise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The current theory holds that Felim heard a few genuine &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; tales and adapted them to the stage in order to make money, along with rewritten versions of many of his own plays.\nGor Felim created the persona of \"Marobar Sul\" who could translate the Dwemer language in order to add some sort of validity to the work and make it even more valuable to the gullible. Note that while \"Marobar Sul\" and his works became the subject of heated controversy, there are no reliable records of anyone actually meeting \"Marobar Sul,\" nor was there anyone of that name employed by the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the School of &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, or any other intellectual institution.\nIn any case, the Dwemer in most of the tales of \"Marobar Sul\" bear little resemblance to the fearsome, unfathomable race that frightened even the Dunmer, Nords, and &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; into submission and built ruins that even now have yet to be understood."}

If you are in the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, . Talk to her and she will tell you that House Ravenwatch are good vampires who hunt evil vampires, and that the Grey Host were a legion of evil vampires from the first era. She will mention that one of them likely survived their slaughter, and is now looking to revive them. She will then ask you to come with her to &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; and speak with &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Laurette%20Diel\"&gt;Scholar Laurette Diel&lt;/a&gt; to obtain more information. \nBoard Gwendis's cart to Bangkorai and you'll find the scholar at a campsite just outside the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her and she will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; has attacked the Garrison and routed the researchers. She will tell you to go look for her friends who fled in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kerbol%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Kerbol's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. The ones heading for Evermore were with a member of the &lt;a href=\"Pyre%20Watch\"&gt;Pyre Watch&lt;/a&gt;, who are experts on the Grey Host. Speak with Gwendis once you have this information and she will suggest that you two split up; she will go to Kerbol's Hollow while your job is to look for the scholars who headed for Evermore. \nYou will be looking for the scholars &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Indouz\"&gt;Indouz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Cogline\"&gt;Cogline&lt;/a&gt;. Indouz will be north of your current location; just west of &lt;a href=\"Martyr%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Martyr's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; became part of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; for a time because Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; came to the aid of the Bangkorai Garrison against the Grey Host. He does not know where the Pyre Watch soldier is though; they ran into an Imperial ambush and she distracted the soldiers so the scholars could flee. After you have told him to head for Laurette Diel's camphead to the west to find Cogline; he will be hiding behind a statue in the &lt;a href=\"Pelin%20Graveyard\"&gt;Pelin Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that the Pyre Watch warrior headed for the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20the%20Exiles\"&gt;Crypt of the Exiles&lt;/a&gt;, to your east. \nHead into the crypt. &lt;a href=\"Shelaria\"&gt;the warrior&lt;/a&gt; will be in the northwestern passage. She will be relieved to hear that the scholars are safe, and will ask you to lead her outside so you can talk more. Once outside, speak with her again and she will tell you that an ancient record mentions one of the Grey Host getting refuge in &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Watch\"&gt;Viridian Watch&lt;/a&gt;, in a place where only those considered worthy may find safety. Bring this information back to Gwendis outside the Bangkorai Garrison and she will tell you to head to Viridian Watch with her. \nViridian Watch is just southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Stronghold\"&gt;Forsaken Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;. In the first room, Gwendis will notice a sigil; speak with her and she will reveal the answer to the riddle: only vampires can see these sigils because only they are deemed \"worthy.\" She will give you a &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blood Pendant&lt;/a&gt; so that you may share some of her vampiric essence and see the sigils. Follow the path the sigils indicate until you reach the little room in the east, but watch out for &lt;a href=\"Curnard%20the%20Generous\"&gt;Curnard the Generous&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have reached the destination room, Gwendis will open a door to the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Gray Host Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. Head through and start looking around. On a table on the west side of the room, you will find &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Welcome\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ingerien\"&gt;Lady Ingerien&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Dynasty\"&gt;Clan Direnni&lt;/a&gt; to the vampire &lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt; promising to keep him safe here. Continue looking, and in a chest in the south of the room, you will find an &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Odd Signet&lt;/a&gt;. Gwendis will ask to see it; speak with her and she will mention that her mentor, &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt;, has one just like it. She will ask you to come to &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; with her to investigate &lt;a href=\"Ravenwatch%20Castle\"&gt;his castle&lt;/a&gt;; you can fast travel with her or travel there yourself. \nTalk to Gwendis outside Ravenwatch Castle. She will tell you that she wishes to enter the castle through a secret passage, so that she can investigate the Count's treasures before she confronts him about this. Follow her to the passage and head in. You will encounter a few spiders and skeletons down here, but this should not be too difficult. On the other side, climb the ladder into the castle, then follow Gwendis into the cellar. Search around here for the signet; you will find another secred toor in the armoire in the south. You will find yourself in a hidden library; on the desk, there will be &lt;a href=\"To%20My%20Dear%20Friend\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; from the Gray Host addressed to Count Verandis, asking him to come back. On the back of the note, there is a map to the island where the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Council\"&gt;Gray Council&lt;/a&gt; gathers. Talk to Gwendis about this information and she will ask you to join her in investigating the island; she cannot believe her trusted friend has ties to the Gray Host. Gwendis will stay in this room and look around for a bit; she will ask you to meet her outside.\nHead outside and speak with Gwendis by the cart to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Council\"&gt;The Gray Council&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Its capital is the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;-aligned &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Igmund\"&gt;Jarl Igmund&lt;/a&gt; resides and holds court in &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The coat of arms for the Reach is a ram's head.\nThe Reach is infamous for harboring the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; who are fighting a long war of independence and seek to retake Markarth from the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and free the Hold from &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; authority. The Forsworn are the Reach's most common enemies and dwell in the Reach highlands. With the constant threat of Forsworn attacks looming over Markarth and its surrounding settlements, the Reach is often considered the most dangerous Hold of Skyrim, fit only for seasoned adventurers or hardened mercenaries.\nGeography.\nThe Reach covers much of the western border of Skyrim, with &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the west. These are the Highlands of Skyrim, a rugged environment with few flat clearings, dotted with &lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Berries\"&gt;juniper trees&lt;/a&gt; and rich in valuable ores, especially &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. Surrounding Holds include &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; past the mountains to the north, &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; and the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; race from the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of Bretons established themselves in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. However, a small group of Bretons that were said to have more of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; blood than their brethren ventured outward and settled in the western borders of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Over the centuries, these Bretons would establish a separate and independent culture from their kin in High Rock and interbred with the local Nords, giving rise to a unique people known as the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, or the men and women of the Reach. This continued until the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Nordic conquests&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; during the First Era. \nAround &lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;, the Reach was ruled by ten warring kings. The legendary Reachman &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence, and united the kings in his struggle against the Imperial invading forces of &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;. Following the collapse of the Alessian Empire, the Reach managed to maintain its independence up until High King &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the Reach.\nSecond Era.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was known as General &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, he went about conquering the whole of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and consolidating his rule. He also defended the Reach from the Reachmen. One of his famous battles was when he led a small band of Colovian troops and Nord berserkers against the Witchmen of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hrol%27dan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hrol'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Reachmen lost political control of their territory, they did not lose the right to practice their religion and culture. This status quo was accepted by most Reachmen, but not by all.\nFourth Era.\nIndependent Kingdom.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; was in the midst of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, troops from the Reach were called to join the war efforts in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. In the year of &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, hardline Reachmen took this opportunity to rebel against the Empire and slaughter much of the Nord population in the city of Markarth. The uprising gained momentum, pushing the Nords out of the Hold and removing the Reach from Imperial authority for two years. Between &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, the Reachmen established an independent kingdom.\nThe Markarth Incident.\nDesperate to reclaim the Reach, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and his militia, promising them free worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their assistance. Ulfric accepted, and his troops reconquered Markarth from the Reachmen soon after. The returning Legion, coming back to restore order in Skyrim after the Great War, was allegedly refused entry into Markarth until they granted free Talos worship. The Empire accepted, however, agents of the Aldmeri Dominion discovered the Empire was violating the terms of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, and demanded the arrest of Ulfric and his militia. The disillusionment of Ulfric and his men over what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; would prove to become one of the direct causes of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reachmen took on the name of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; after their defeat in Markarth, and those not imprisoned fled to the highlands to continue their insurrection against the Empire's control over the Reach."}

Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Reach features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Dark Heart of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the zone quests for other zones prior to those in the Reach. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Note that the Epilogue for the Dark Heart of Skyrim requires the zone quests of both Western Skyrim (including in Greymoor Caverns) and the Reach (including in Arkthzand Cavern) to have been completed before it can be started.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nFour Skyshards can be found in the Reach totaling in one &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Reach and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches.

Its capital is the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;-aligned\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Igmund\"&gt;Jarl Igmund&lt;/a&gt; resides and holds court in &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The coat of arms for the Reach is a ram's head.\nThe Reach is infamous for harboring the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0who are fighting a long war of independence and seek to retake the hold from the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and free it from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0authority. The Forsworn are the most common enemies in the Reach and dwell in the highlands. With the constant threat of Forsworn attacks looming over the hold, including Markarth, the Reach is often considered the most dangerous hold of Skyrim, fit only for seasoned adventurers and hardened mercenaries.\nGeography.\nThe Reach covers much of the western border of Skyrim, with &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the west. These are the Highlands of Skyrim, a rugged environment with few flat clearings, dotted with &lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Berries\"&gt;juniper trees&lt;/a&gt; and rich in valuable ores, especially &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. Surrounding Holds include &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; past the mountains to the north, &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; to the north-east and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast. Forsworn have already laid claim to the Reach's main fort guarding the hold, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt;, on the border with Falkreath and Whiterun.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; and the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; race from the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of Bretons established themselves in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. However, a small group of Bretons that were said to have more of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; blood than their brethren ventured outward and settled in the western borders of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Over the centuries, these Bretons would establish a separate and independent culture from their kin in High Rock and interbred with the local Nords, giving rise to a unique people known as the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, or the Men and Women of the Reach. This continued until the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Nordic conquests&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; during the First Era.\u00a0\nAround\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;, the Reach was ruled by ten warring kings. The legendary Reachman &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence, and united the kings in his struggle against the\u00a0Imperial\u00a0invading forces of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Following the collapse of the Alessian Empire, the Reach managed to maintain its independence up until High King &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the Reach.\nSecond Era.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was known as General &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, he went about conquering the whole of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and consolidating his rule. He also defended the Reach from the Reachmen. One of his famous battles was when he led a small band of Colovian troops and Nord berserkers against the Witchmen of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hrol%27dan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hrol'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Reachmen lost political control of their territory, they did not lose the right to practice their religion and culture. This status quo was accepted by most Reachmen, but not by all.\nFourth Era.\nIndependent Kingdom.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; was in the midst of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, troops from the Reach were called to join the war efforts in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. In the year of &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, hardline Reachmen took this opportunity to rebel against the Empire and slaughter much of the Nord population in the city of Markarth. The uprising gained momentum, pushing the Nords out of the Hold and removing the Reach from Imperial authority for two years. Between &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, the Reachmen established an independent kingdom.\nThe Markarth Incident.\nDesperate to reclaim the Reach,\u00a0Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt; enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and his militia, promising them free worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their assistance. Ulfric accepted, and his troops reconquered Markarth from the Reachmen soon after. The\u00a0returning Legion, coming back to restore order in Skyrim after the Great War, was allegedly refused entry into Markarth until they granted free Talos worship. The Empire accepted,\u00a0however, agents of the Aldmeri Dominion discovered the Empire was violating the terms of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, and demanded the arrest of Ulfric and his militia. The disillusionment of Ulfric and his men over what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; would prove to become one of the direct causes of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reachmen took on the name of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; after their defeat in Markarth, and those not imprisoned fled to the highlands to continue their insurrection against the Empire's control over the Reach."}

He was a miner, as was his father before him, a common laborer in the mines of the Lord of Mournhold, for his ability in magicka was small. The work was honorable but paid poorly. His mother made and sold &lt;a href=\"comberry\"&gt;comberry&lt;/a&gt; cakes at the city market to help eke out their living. They did well enough, she said, they had enough to fill their bellies, no one could wear more than one suit of clothing at a time, and the roof leaked only when it rained. But &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; would have liked more. He hoped for a lucky strike at the mines, which would garner him a large bonus. In his free hours he enjoyed hoisting a mug of ale in the tavern with his friends, and gambling with them at cards. He also drew the eyes and sighs of more than one pretty &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; lass, although none held his interest for long. He was a typical young &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; of peasant descent, remarkable only for his size. It was rumored that he had a bit of &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic blood in him.\nIn Symmachus' thirtieth year, there was great rejoicing in Mournhold-a girl-child had been born to the Lord and Lady. A Queen, the people sang, a Queen is born to us! For among the people of Mournhold, the birth of an heiress is a sure sign of future peace and prosperity.\nWhen the time came round for the royal child's &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Naming\"&gt;Rite of Naming&lt;/a&gt;, the mines were closed and Symmachus dashed home to bathe and dress in his best. \"I'll rush straight home and tell you all about it,\" he promised his mother, who would not be able to attend. She had been ailing, and besides there would be a great crush of people as all Mournhold turned out to be part of the blessed event; and being blind she would be unable to see anything anyway.\n\"My son,\" she said. \"Afore you go, fetch me a priest or a healer, else I may pass from the mortal plane ere you return.\"\nSymmachus crossed to her pallet at once and noted anxiously that her forehead was very hot and her breathing shallow. He pried loose a slat of the wooden floor under which their small hoard of savings was kept. There wasn't nearly enough to pay a priest for healing. He would have to give what they had and owe the rest. Symmachus snatched up his cloak and hurried away.\nThe streets were full of folk hurrying to the sacred grove, but the temples were locked and barred. \"Closed for the ceremony,\" read all the signs.\nSymmachus elbowed his way through the mob and managed to overtake a brown-robed priest. \"After the rite, brother,\" the priest said, \"if you have gold I shall gladly attend to your mother. Milord has bidden all clerics attend-and I, for one, have no wish to offend him.\"\n\"My mother's desperately ill,\" Symmachus pled. \"Surely Milord will not miss one lowly priest.\"\n\"True, but the &lt;a href=\"Ranks%23Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt; will,\" the priest said nervously, tearing his robe loose from Symmachus' desperate grip and vanishing into the crowd.\nSymmachus tried other priests, and even a few mages, but with no better result. Armored guards marched through the street and pushed him aside with their lances, and Symmachus realized that the royal procession was approaching.\nAs the carriage bearing the city's rulers drew abreast, Symmachus rushed out from the crowd and shouted, \"Milord, Milord! My mother's dying-!\"\n\"I forbid her to do so on this glorious night!\" the Lord shouted, laughing and scattering coin into the throng. Symmachus was close enough to smell wine on the royal breath. On the other side of the carriage his Lady clutched the babe to her breast, and stared slit-eyed at Symmachus, her nostrils flared in disdain.\n\"Guards!\" she cried. \"Remove this oaf.\" Rough hands seized Symmachus. He was beaten and left dazed by the side of the road.\nSymmachus, head aching, followed in the wake of the crowd and witnessed the Rite of Naming from the top of a hill. He could see the brown-robed clerics and blue-robed mages gathered near the highborn folk far below.\n&lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe name came dimly to Symmachus' ears as the High Priest lifted the swaddled babe and proffered her to the twin moons on either side of the horizon: &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; rising, &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; setting.\n\"Behold the Lady Barenziah, born to the land of Mournhold! Grant her thy blessings and thy counsel, ye kind gods, that she may ever rule well over Mournhold, its ken and its weal, its kith and its ilk.\"\n\"Bless her, bless her,\" all the people intoned along with their Lord and Lady, hands upraised.\nOnly Symmachus stood silent, head bowed, knowing in his heart that his dear mother was gone. And in silence he swore a mighty oath-that he should be his Lord's bane, and in vengeance for his mother's needless death, the child Barenziah he should have for his own bride, and that his mother's grandchildren should be born to rule over Mournhold.\nAfter the ceremony, he watched impassively as the royal procession returned to the palace. He saw the priest to whom he'd first spoken. The man came gladly enough now in return for the gold Sym\u00admachus had, and a promise of more afterward.\nThey found his mother dead.\nThe priest sighed and tucked the pouch of gold coins away. \"I'm sorry, brother. It's all right, you can forget the rest of the gold, there's aught I can do here. Likely-\"\n\"Give me back my money!\" Symmachus snarled. \"You've done naught to earn it!\" He lifted his right arm threateningly.\nThe priest backed away, about to utter a curse, but Symmachus struck him across the face before more than three words had left his mouth. He went down heavily, striking his head sharply on one of the stones that formed the fire pit. He died instantly.\nSymmachus snatched up the gold and fled the city. As he ran, he muttered one word over and over, like a sorcerer's chant. \"Barenziah,\" he said. \"Barenziah. Barenziah.\"\nBarenziah stood on one of the balconies of the palace, staring down into the courtyard where soldiers milled, dazzling in their armor. Presently they formed into ordered ranks and cheered as her parents, the Lord and Lady, emerged from the palace, clad from head to toe in &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; armor, long purple-dyed fur cloaks flowing behind. Splendidly caparisoned, shining black horses were brought for them, and they mounted and rode to the courtyard gates, and turned to salute her.\n\"Barenziah!\" they cried. \"Barenziah our beloved, farewell!\"\nThe little girl blinked back tears and waved one hand bravely, her favorite stuffed animal, a gray wolf cub she called &lt;a href=\"Wuffen\"&gt;Wuffen&lt;/a&gt;, clutched to her breast with the other. She had never been parted from her parents before and had no idea what it meant, save that there was war in the west and the name &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was on everyone's lips, spoken in hate and dread.\n\"Barenziah!\" the soldiers cried, lifting their lances and swords and bows. Then her dear parents turned and rode away, knights trailing in their wake, until the courtyard was nearly emptied.\nSometime after came a day when Barenziah was shaken awake by her nurse, dressed hurriedly, and borne from the palace.\nAll she could remember of that dreadful time was seeing a huge shadow with burning eyes filling the sky. She was passed from hand to hand. Foreign soldiers appeared, disappeared, and sometimes reappeared. Her nurse vanished and was replaced by strangers, some more strange than others. There were days, or it may have been weeks, of travel.\nOne morning she awoke to step out of the coach into a cold place with a large gray stone castle amid empty, endless gray-green hills covered patchily with gray-white snow. She clutched Wuffen to her breast in both hands and stood blinking and shivering in the gray dawn, feeling very small and very dark in all this endless space, this endless gray-white space.\nShe and &lt;a href=\"Hana\"&gt;Hana&lt;/a&gt;, a brown-skinned, black-haired maid who had been traveling with her for several days, went inside the keep. A large gray-white woman with icy gray-golden hair was standing by a hearth in one of the rooms. She stared at Barenziah with dreadful, bright blue eyes.\n\"She's very -- black, isn't she?\" the woman remarked to Hana. \"I've never seen a Dark Elf before.\"\n\"I don't know much about them myself, Milady,\" Hana said. \"But this one's got red hair and a temper to match, I can tell you that. Take care. She bites. And worse.\"\n\"I'll soon train her out of that,\" the other woman sniffed. \"And what's that filthy thing she's got? Ugh!\" The woman snatched Wuffen away and threw him into the blazing hearth.\nBarenziah shrieked and would have flung herself after him, but was held back despite her attempts to bite and claw at her captors. Poor Wuffen was reduced to a tiny heap of charred ash.\nBarenziah grew like a weed transplanted to a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; garden, a ward of Count &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Advensen\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt; and his wife the Lady &lt;a href=\"Inga\"&gt;Inga&lt;/a&gt;. Outwardly, that is, she thrived\u2014but always there was a cold and empty place within.\n\"I've raised her as my own daughter,\" Lady Inga was wont to sigh as she sat gossiping when neighboring ladies came to visit. \"But she's a Dark Elf. What can you expect?\"\nBarenziah was not meant to overhear these words. At least she thought she was not. Her hearing was keener than that of her Nordic hosts. Other, less desirable Dark Elven traits evidently included pilfering, lying, and a little misplaced magic, just a small fire spell here and a little levitation spell there. And, as she grew older, a keen interest in boys and men, who could provide very pleasant sensations\u2014and to her aston ishment, gifts as well. Inga disapproved of this last for reasons incomprehensible to Barenziah, so she was careful to keep it as secret as possible.\n\"She's wonderful with the children,\" Inga added, referring to her five sons, all younger than Barenziah. \"I don't think she'd ever let them come to harm.\" A tutor had been hired when &lt;a href=\"Jonni\"&gt;Jonni&lt;/a&gt; was six and Barenziah eight, and they took their lessons together. She would have liked to train in arms as well, but the very idea scandalized Count Sven and Lady Inga. So Barenziah was given a small bow and allowed to play at target shooting with the boys. She watched them at arms practice when she could, sparred with them when no grownup folk were about, and knew she was good as or better than they.\n\"She's very... proud, though, isn't she?\" one of the ladies would whisper to Inga; and Barenziah, pretending not to hear, would nod silently in agreement. She could not help but feel superior to the Count and his Lady. There was something about them that provoked contempt.\nAfterward she came to learn that Sven and Inga were distant cousins of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor Keep's&lt;/a&gt; last titled residents, and she finally understood. They were poseurs, impostors, not rulers at all. At least, they were not raised to rule. This thought made her strangely furious at them, a good clean hatred quite detached from resentment. She came to see them as disgusting and repellent insects who could be despised but never feared.\nOnce a month a courier came from the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, bringing a small bag of gold for Sven and Inga and a large bag of dried mushrooms from Morrowind for Barenziah, her favorite treat. On these occa\u00adsions, she was always made to look presentable-or at least as presentable as a skinny Dark Elf could be made to look in Inga's eyes-before being summoned into the courier's presence for a brief interview. The same courier seldom came twice, but all of them looked her over in much the same way a farmer would look over a hog he is readying for market.\nIn the spring of her sixteenth year, Barenziah thought the courier looked as if she were at last ready for market.\nUpon reflection, she decided she did not wish to be marketed. The stable-boy, &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;, a big, muscular blond lad, clumsy, gentle, affectionate, and rather simple, had been urging her to run off for some weeks now. Barenziah stole the bag of gold the courier had left, took the mushrooms from the storeroom, disguised herself as a boy in one of Jonni's old tunics and a pair of his cast-off breeches... and on one fine spring night she and Straw took the two best horses from the stable and rode hard through the night toward &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest city of any importance and the place where Straw wanted to be. But Mournhold and Morrowind also lay eastward and they drew Barenziah as a lodestone draws iron.\nIn the morning they abandoned the horses at Barenziah's insistence. She knew they would be missed and tracked down, and she hoped to throw off any pursuers.\nThey continued on foot until late afternoon, keeping to side roads, and slept for several hours in an abandoned hut. They went on at dusk and came to Whiterun's city gates just before dawn. Barenziah had prepared a pass of sorts for Straw, a makeshift document stating an errand to a temple in the city for a local village lord. She herself glided over the wall with the help of a levitation spell. She had reasoned-correctly, as it turned out-that by now the gate guards would have been alerted to keep an eye out for a young Dark Elven girl and a Nordic boy traveling together. On the other hand, unaccompanied country yokels like Straw were a common enough sight. Alone and with papers, it was unlikely that he would draw attention.\nHer simple plan went smoothly. She met Straw at the temple, which was not far from the gate; she had been to Whiterun on a few previous occasions. Straw, however, had never been more than a few miles from Sven's estate, which was his birthplace.\nTogether they made their way to a rundown inn in the poorer quarters of Whiterun. Gloved, cloaked, and hooded against the morning chill, Barenziah's dark skin and red eyes were not apparent and no one paid any heed to them. They entered the inn separately. Straw paid the innkeeper for a single cubicle, an immense meal, and two jugs of ale. Barenziah sneaked in a few minutes later.\nThey ate and drank together gleefully, rejoicing in their escape, and made love vigorously on the narrow cot. Afterward they fell into an exhausted, dreamless sleep.\nThey stayed for a week at Whiterun. Straw earned a bit of money running errands and Barenziah burgled a few houses at night. She continued to dress as a boy. She cut her hair short and dyed her flame-red tresses jet black to further the disguise, and kept out of sight as much as possible. There were few Dark Elves in Whiterun.\nOne day Straw got them work as temporary guards for a merchant caravan traveling east. The one-armed sergeant looked her over dubiously.\n\"Heh,\" he chuckled, \"Dark Elf, ain'tcha? Like settin' a wolf t'guard the sheep, that is. Still, I need arms, and we ain't goin' near 'nough Morrowind so's ye can betray us to yer folk. Our homegrown bandits would as fain cut yer throat as mine.\"\nThe sergeant turned to give Straw an appraising look. Then he spun back abruptly toward Barenziah, whipping out his shortsword. But she had her dagger out in the twinkling of an eye and was in a defensive stance. Straw drew his own knife and circled round to the man's rear. The sergeant dropped his blade and chuckled again.\n\"Not bad, kids, not bad. How are ye with yon bow, Dark Elf?\" Barenziah demonstrated her prowess briefly. \"Aye, not bad, not bad 'tall. And ye'll be keen of eye by night, boy, and of hearin' 'tall times. A trusty Dark Elf makes as good a fightin' man as any could ask for. I know. I served under Symmachus his self afore I lost this arm and got invalided outter the Emp'ror's army.\"\n\"We could betray them. I know folk who'd pay well,\" Straw said later as they bedded down for their last night at the ramshackle lodge. \"Or rob them ourselves. They're very rich, those merchants are, Berry.\"\nBarenziah laughed. \"Whatever would we do with so much money? And besides, we need their protection for traveling quite as much as they need ours.\"\n\"We could buy a little farm, you and me, Berry -- and settle down, all nice like.\"\nPeasant! Barenziah thought scornfully. Straw was a peasant and harbored nothing but peasant dreams. But all she said was, \"Not here, Straw, we're too close to &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt; still. We'll have other chances farther east.\"\nThe caravan went only as far east as &lt;a href=\"Sungard\"&gt;Sunguard&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor Tiber Septim I had done much in the way of building relatively safe and regularly patrolled highways. But the tolls were steep, and this particular caravan kept to the side roads as much as possible to avoid them. This exposed them to the hazards of wayside robbers, both &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, and roving brigand bands of various races. But such were the perils of trade and profit.\nThey had two such encounters before reaching Sunguard\u2014an ambush which Barenziah's keen ears warned them of in plenty of time for them to circle about and surprise the lurkers, and a night attack by a mixed band of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, humans, and &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;. The latter were a skilled band and even Barenziah did not hear them sneaking up in time to give much warning. This time the fighting was fierce. The attackers were driven off, but two of the caravan's other guards were slain and Straw got a nasty cut on his thigh before he and Barenziah managed to gash his Khajiit assailant's throat.\nBarenziah rather enjoyed the life. The garrulous sergeant had taken a liking to her, and she spent most of her evenings sitting around the campfire listening to his tales of campaigning in Morrowind with Tiber Septim and General Symmachus. This Symmachus had been made general after Mournhold fell, the sergeant said. \"He's a fine soldier, boy, Symmachus is. But there was more'n soldiery involved'n that Morrowind business, if y'take my meanin'. But, well, y'know all 'bout that, I 'spect.\"\n\"No. No, I don't remember,\" Barenziah said, trying to sound nonchalant. \"I've lived most of my life in Skyrim. My mother married a Skyrim man. They're both dead, though. Tell me, what happened to the Lord and Lady of Mournhold?\"\nThe sergeant shrugged. \"I ain't never heard. Dead, I 'spect. 'Twas alot of fightin' afore the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt; got signed. It's pretty quiet now. Maybe too quiet. Like a calm afore a storm. Say, boy, you goin' back there?\"\n\"Maybe,\" Barenziah said. The truth was that she was drawn irresistibly to Morrowind, and Mournhold, like a moth to a burning house. Straw sensed it and was unhappy about it. He was unhappy anyway since they could not bed together, as she was supposed to be a boy. Barenziah rather missed it too, but not as much as Straw did, seemingly.\nThe sergeant wanted them to sign on for the return trip, but gave them a bonus nonetheless when they turned the offer down, and parchments of recommendation.\nStraw wanted to settle down permanently near Sunguard, but Barenziah insisted on continuing their travels east. \"I'm the Queen of Mournhold by rights,\" she said, unsure whether it was true\u2014or was it just a daydream she had made up as a lost, bewildered child? \"I want to go home. I need to go home.\" That at least was true.\nAfter a few weeks they managed to get places in another caravan heading east. By early winter they were at &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Rifton&lt;/a&gt;, and nearing the Morrowind border. But the weather had grown severe as the days passed and they were told no merchant caravans would be setting forth till mid-spring.\nBarenziah stood on top of the city walls and stared across the deep gorge that separated Rifton from the snow-clad mountain wall guarding Morrowind beyond.\n\"Berry,\" Straw said gently. \"Mournhold's a long way off yet, nearly as far as we've come already. And the lands between are wild, full of &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and bandits and Orcs and still worse creatures. We'll have to wait for spring.\"\n\"There's &lt;a href=\"Silgrod%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrod Tower&lt;/a&gt;,\" Berry said, referring to the Dark Elven township that had grown up around an ancient minaret guarding the border between Skyrim and Morrowind.\n\"The bridge guards won't let me across, Berry. They're crack &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; troops. They can't be bribed. If you go, you go alone. I won't try and stop you. But what will you do? Silgrod Tower is full of Imperial soldiers. Will you become a washing-woman for them? Or a camp follower?\"\n\"No,\" Barenziah said slowly, thoughtfully. Actually the idea was not entirely unappealing. She was sure she could earn a modest living by sleeping with the soldiers. She'd had a few adventures of that sort as they crossed Skyrim, when she'd dressed as a woman and slipped away from Straw. She'd only been looking for a bit of variety. Straw was sweet but dull. She'd been startled, but extremely pleased, when the men she picked up offered her money afterward. Straw had been unhappy about it, though, and would shout for a while then sulk for days afterward if he caught her at it. He was quite jealous. He'd even threatened to leave her. Not that he ever did. Or could.\nBut the Imperial Guards were a tough and brutal lot by all accounts, and Barenziah had heard some very ugly stories during their treks. The ugliest of them by far had come from the lips of ex-army veterans around the caravan campfire, and were proudly recounted. They'd been trying to shock her and Straw, she realized-but she also comprehended that there was some truth behind the wild tales. Straw hated that kind of dirty talk, and hated it more that she had to hear it. But there was a part of him that was fascinated nevertheless.\nBarenziah sensed this and had encouraged Straw to seek out other women. But he said he didn't want anyone else but her. She told him candidly she didn't feel that way about him, but she did like him better than anyone else. \"Then why do you go with other men?\" Straw had asked on one occasion.\n\"I don't know.\"\nStraw sighed. \"They say Dark Elven women are like that.\"\nBarenziah smiled and shrugged. \"I don't know. Or, no ... maybe I do. Yes, I do know.\" She turned and kissed him affectionately. \"I guess that's all the explanation there is.\""}

Barenziah wanted to join the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, knowing there would be trouble if she were caught freelancing. One day in a barroom she caught the eye of a known member of the Guild, a bold young &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Therris\"&gt;Therris&lt;/a&gt;. She offered to bed him if he would sponsor her membership. He looked her over, grinning, and agreed, but said she'd still have to pass an initiation.\n\"What sort of initiation?\"\n\"Ah,\" Therris said. \"Pay up first, sweetness.\"\n[This passage has been censored by order of the Temple.]\nStraw was going to kill her, and maybe Therris too. What in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; had possessed her to do such a thing? She cast an apprehensive look around the room, but the other patrons had lost interest and gone back to their own business. She did not recognize any of them; this wasn't the inn where she and Straw were staying. With luck it'd be a while, or never, before Straw found out.\nTherris was by far the most exciting and attractive man she had yet met. He not only told her about the skills she needed to become a member of the Thieves Guild, but also trained her in them himself or else introduced her to people who could.\nAmong these was a woman who knew something about magic. &lt;a href=\"Katisha\"&gt;Katisha&lt;/a&gt; was a plump and matronly &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;. She was married to a smith, had two teenage children, and was perfectly ordinary and respectable--except that she was very fond of cats (and by logical inference, their humanoid counterparts the Khajiit), had a talent for certain kinds of magic, and cultivated rather odd friends. She taught Barenziah an invisibility spell and schooled her in other forms of stealth and disguise. Katisha mingled magical and non-magical talents freely, using one set to enhance the other. She was not a member of the Thieves Guild but was fond of Therris in a motherly sort of way. Barenziah warmed to her as she never had toward any woman, and over the next few weeks she told Katisha all about herself.\nShe brought Straw there too sometimes. Straw approved of Katisha. But not of Therris. Therris found Straw \"interesting\" and suggested to Barenziah that they arrange what he called a \"threesome.\"\n\"Absolutely not,\" Barenziah said firmly, grateful that Therris had broached the subject in private for once. \"He wouldn't like it. I wouldn't like it!\"\nTherris smiled his charming, triangular feline smile and sprawled lazily on his chair, stretching his limbs and curling his tail. \"You might be surprised. Both of you. Pairing is so boring.\"\nBarenziah answered him with a glare.\n\"Or maybe you wouldn't like it with that country bumpkin of yours, sweetness. Would you mind if I brought along another friend?\"\n\"Yes, I would. If you're bored with me, you and your friend can find someone else.\" She was a member of the Thieves Guild now. She had passed their initiation. She found Therris useful but not essential. Maybe she was a bit bored with him too.\nShe talked to Katisha about her problems with men. Or what she thought of as her problems with men. Katisha shook her head and told her she was looking for love, not sex, that she'd know the right man when she found him, that neither Straw nor Therris was the right one for her.\nBarenziah cocked her head to one side quizzically. \"They say &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elven&lt;/a&gt; women are pro-- pro-- something. Prostitutes?\" she said, although she was dubious.\n\"You mean promiscuous. Although some do become prostitutes, I suppose,\" Katisha said as an afterthought. \"Elves are promiscuous when they're young. But you'll outgrow it. Perhaps you're beginning to already,\" she added hopefully. She liked Barenziah, had grown to be quite fond of her. \"You ought to meet some nice Elven boys, though. If you go on keeping company with Khajiits and humans and what have you, you'll find yourself pregnant in next to no time.\"\nBarenziah smiled involuntarily at the thought. \"I'd like that. I think. But it would be inconvenient, wouldn't it? Babies are a lot of trouble, and I don't even have my own house yet.\"\n\"How old are you, Berry? Seventeen? Well, you've a year or two yet before you're fertile, unless you're very unlucky. Elves don't have children readily with other Elves after that, even, so you'll be all right if you stick with them.\"\nBarenziah remembered something else. \"Straw wants to buy a farm and marry me.\"\n\"Is that what you want?\"\n\"No. Not yet. Maybe someday. Yes, someday. But not if I can't be queen. And not just any queen. The Queen of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;.\" She said this determinedly, almost stubbornly, as if to drown out any doubt.\nKatisha chose to ignore this last comment. She was amused at the girl's hyperactive imagination, took it as a sign of a well-functioning mind. \"I think Straw will be a very old man before 'someday' comes, Berry. Elves live for a very long time.\" Katisha's face briefly wore the envious, wistful look humans got when contemplating the thousand-year lifespan Elves had been granted by the gods. True, few ever actually lived that long as disease and violence took their respective tolls. But they could. And one or two of them actually did.\n\"I like old men too,\" Berry said.\nKatisha laughed.\nBarenziah fidgeted impatiently while Therris sorted through the papers on the desk. He was being meticulous and methodical, carefully replacing everything just as he'd found it.\nThey'd broken into a nobleman's household, leaving Straw to hover outside as lookout. Therris had said it was a simple job but very hush-hush. He hadn't even wanted to bring any other Guild members along. He said he knew he could trust Berry and Straw, but no one else.\n\"Tell me what you're looking for and I'll find it,\" Berry whispered urgently. Therris' night sight wasn't as good as hers and he didn't want her to magick up even a small orb of light.\nShe had never been in such a luxurious place. Not even the Darkmoor castle of Count Sven and Lady Inga where she had spent her childhood compared to it. She'd gazed around in wonder as they made their way through the ornately decorated and hugely echoing downstairs rooms. But Therris didn't seem interested in anything but the desk in the small book-lined study on the upper floor.\n\"Sssst,\" he hissed angrily.\n\"Someone's coming!\" Berry said, a moment before the door opened and two dark figures stepped into the room. Therris gave her a violent shove toward them and sprang to the window. Barenziah's muscles went rigid; she couldn't move or even speak. She watched helplessly as one of the figures, the smaller one, leaped after Therris. There were two quick, silent stabs of blue light, then Therris folded over into a still heap.\nOutside the study the house had come alive with hastening footsteps and voices calling out in alarm and the clank of armor hurriedly put on.\nThe bigger man, a Dark Elf by the looks of him, half-lifted, half-dragged Therris to the door and thrust him into the waiting arms of another Elf. A jerk of the first Elf's head sent his smaller blue-robed companion after them. Then he sauntered over to inspect Barenziah, who was once again able to move although her head throbbed maddeningly when she tried to.\n\"Open your shirt, Barenziah,\" the Elf said. Barenziah gawked at him and clutched it closed. \"You're a girl, aren't you, Berry?\" he said softly. \"You should have stopped dressing as a boy months ago, you know. You were only drawing attention to yourself. And calling yourself Berry! Is your friend Straw too stupid to remember anything else?\"\n\"It's a common Elven name,\" Barenziah defended.\nThe man shook his head sadly. \"Not among Dark Elves it isn't, my dear. But you wouldn't know much about Dark Elves, would you? I regret that, but it couldn't be helped. No matter. I shall try to remedy it.\"\n\"Who are you?\" Barenziah demanded.\n\"Ai. So much for fame,\" the man shrugged, smiling wryly. \"I am &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, Milady Barenziah. General Symmachus of His Awesome and Terrible Majesty &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; I's Imperial Army. And I must say it's a merry chase you've led me throughout Tamriel. Or this part of it, anyway. Although I guessed, and guessed correctly, that you'd head for Morrowind eventually. You had a bit of luck. A body was found in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; that was thought to be Straw's. So we stopped looking for the pair of you. That was careless of me. Yet I'd not have thought you'd have stayed together this long.\"\n\"Where is he? Is he all right?\" she asked in genuine trepidation.\n\"Oh, he's fine. For now. In custody, of course.\" He turned away. \"You ... care for him, then?\" he said, and then suddenly stared at her with fierce curiosity. Out of red eyes that seemed strange to her, except in her own seldom-seen reflection.\n\"He's my friend,\" Barenziah said. The words came out in a tone that sounded dull and hopeless to her own ears. Symmachus! A general in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Army, no less--said to have the friendship and ears of Tiber Septim himself.\n\"Ai. You seem to have several unsuitable friends--if you'll forgive my saying so, Milady.\"\n\"Stop calling me that.\" She was irritated at the general's seeming sarcasm. But he only smiled.\nAs they talked the bustle and flurry in the house died away. Although she could still hear people, presumably the residents, whispering together not far off. The tall Elf perched himself on a corner of the desk. He seemed quite relaxed and prepared to stay awhile.\nThen it occurred to her. Several unsuitable friends, had he said? This man knew all about her! Or seemed to know enough, anyway. Which amounted to the same thing. \"W-what's going to happen to them? To m-me?\"\n\"Ah. As you know, this house belongs to the commander of the Imperial troops in this area. Which means to say that it belongs to me.\" Barenziah gasped and Symmachus looked up sharply. \"What, you didn't know? Tsk, tsk. Why, you are rash, Milady, even for seventeen. You must always know what it is you do, or get yourself into.\"\n\"B-but the G-guild w-wouldn't ... wouldn't h-have--\" Barenziah was trembling. The Thieves Guild would never have attempted a mission that crossed Imperial policy. No one dared oppose Tiber Septim, at least no one she knew of. Someone at the Guild had bungled. Badly. And now she was going to pay for it.\n\"I daresay. It's unlikely that Therris had Guild approval for this. In fact, I wonder--\" Symmachus examined the desk carefully, pulling out drawers. He selected one, placed it on top of the desk, and removed a false bottom. There was a folded sheet of parchment inside. It seemed to be a map of some sort. Barenziah edged closer. Symmachus held it away from her, laughing. \"Rash indeed!\" He glanced it over, then folded and replaced it.\n\"You advised me a moment ago to seek after knowledge.\"\n\"So I did, so I did.\" Suddenly he seemed to be in high good humor. \"We must be going, my dear Lady.\"\nHe shepherded her to the door, down the stairs, and out into the night air. No one was about. Barenziah's eyes darted toward the shadows. She wondered if she could outrun him, or elude him somehow.\n\"You're not thinking of attempting to escape, are you? Ai. Don't you want to hear first what my plans for you are?\" She thought that he sounded a bit hurt.\n\"Now that you mention it--yes.\"\n\"Perhaps you'd rather hear about your friends first.\"\n\"No.\"\nHe looked gratified at this. It was evidently the answer he wanted, thought Barenziah, but it was also the truth. While she was concerned for her friends, especially Straw, she was far more concerned for herself.\n\"You will take your place as the rightful Queen of Mournhold.\"\nSymmachus explained that this had been his, and Tiber Septim's, plan for her all along. That Mournhold, which had been under military rule for the dozen or so years since she had been away, was gradually to be returned to civilian government--under the Empire's guidance, of course, and as part of the Imperial Province of Morrowind.\n\"But why was I sent to &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt;?\" Barenziah asked, hardly believing anything she had just been told.\n\"For safekeeping, naturally. Why did you run away?\"\nBarenziah shrugged. \"I saw no reason to stay. I should have been told.\"\n\"You would have been by now. I had in fact sent for you to be removed to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to spend some time as part of the Emperor's household. But of course you had, shall we say, absconded by then. As for your destiny, it should be, and should have been, quite obvious to you. Tiber Septim does not keep those he has no use for -- and what else could you be that would be of use to him?\"\n\"I know nothing of him. Nor, for that matter, of you.\"\n\"Then know this: Tiber Septim rewards friends and foes alike according to their deserts.\"\nBarenziah chewed on that for a few moments. \"Straw has deserved well of me and has never done anyone any harm. He is not a member of the Thieves Guild. He came along to protect me. He earns our keep by running errands, and he ... he ...\"\nSymmachus waved her impatiently to silence. \"Ai. I know all about Straw,\" he said, \"and about Therris.\" He stared at her intently. \"So? What would you?\"\nShe took a deep breath. \"Straw wants a little farm. If I'm to be rich, then I would like for one to be given to him.\"\n\"Very well.\" He seemed astonished at this, and then pleased. \"Done. He shall have it. And Therris?\"\n\"He betrayed me,\" Barenziah said coldly. Therris should have told her what risks the job entailed. Besides, he'd pushed her right into their enemies' arms in an attempt to save himself. Not a man to be rewarded. Not, in fact, a man to be trusted.\n\"Yes. And?\"\n\"Well, he should be made to suffer for it ... shouldn't he?\"\n\"That seems reasonable. What form should said suffering take?\"\nBarenziah balled her hands into fists. She would've liked to beat and claw at the Khajiit herself. But considering the turn events had taken, that didn't seem very queenly. \"A whipping. Er ... would twenty stripes be too many, do you think? I don't want to do him any permanent injury, you understand. Just teach him a lesson.\"\n\"Ai. Of course.\" Symmachus grinned at this. Then his features suddenly set, and became serious. \"It shall be done, Your Highness, Milady Queen Barenziah of Mournhold.\" Then he bowed to her, a sweeping, courtly, ridiculously wonderful bow.\nBarenziah's heart leapt.\nShe spent two days at Symmachus' apartment, during which she was kept very busy. There was a Dark Elven woman named &lt;a href=\"Drelliane\"&gt;Drelliane&lt;/a&gt; who saw to her needs, although she did not exactly seem a servant since she took her meals with them. Nor did she seem to be Symmachus' wife, or lover. Drelliane looked amused when Barenziah asked her about it. She simply said she was in the general's employ and did whatever was asked of her.\nWith Drelliane's assistance, several fine gowns and pairs of shoes were ordered for her, plus a riding habit and boots, along with other small necessities. Barenziah was given a room to herself.\nSymmachus was out a great deal. She saw him at most mealtimes, but he said little about himself or what he had been doing. He was cordial and polite, quite willing to converse on most subjects, and seemed interested in anything she had to say. Drelliane was much the same. Barenziah found them pleasant enough, but \"hard to get to know,\" as Katisha would have put it. She felt an odd twinge of disappointment. These were the first Dark Elves with whom she'd associated closely. She had expected to feel comfortable with them, to feel at last that she belonged somewhere, with somebody, as part of something. Instead she found herself yearning for her Nordic friends, Katisha and Straw.\nWhen Symmachus told her they were to set out for the Imperial City on the morrow, she asked if she could say good-bye to them.\n\"Katisha?\" he asked. \"Ai. But then ... I suppose I owe her something. She it was who led me to you by telling me of a lonely Dark Elven girl named Berry who needed Elven friends -- and who sometimes dressed as a boy. She has no association with the Thieves Guild, apparently. And no one associated with the Thieves Guild seems to know your true identity, save Therris. That is well. I prefer that your former Guild membership not be made public knowledge. Please speak of it to no one, Your Highness. Such a past does not ... become an Imperial Queen.\"\n\"No one knows but Straw and Therris. And they won't tell anyone.\"\n\"No.\" He smiled a curious little smile. \"No, they won't.\"\nHe didn't know that Katisha knew, then. But still, there was something about the way he said it ...\nStraw came to their apartment on the morning of their departure. They were left alone in the salon, although Barenziah knew that other Elves were within earshot. He looked drawn and pale. They hugged one another silently for a few minutes. Straw's shoulders were shaking and tears were rolling down his cheeks, but he said nothing.\nBarenziah tried a smile. \"So we both get what we want, eh? I'm to be Queen of Mournhold and you'll be lord of your own farmstead.\" She took his hand, smiled at him warmly, genuinely. \"I'll write you, Straw. I promise. You must find a scribe so you can write me too.\"\nStraw shook his head sadly. When Barenziah persisted, he opened his mouth and pointed at it, making inarticulate noises. Then she realized what it was. His tongue was gone, had been cut off.\nBarenziah collapsed onto a chair and wept noisily.\n\"But why?\" she demanded of Symmachus when Straw had been ushered away. \"Why?\"\nSymmachus shrugged. \"He knows too much. He could be dangerous. At least he's alive, and he won't need his tongue to ... raise pigs or whatever.\"\n\"I hate you!\" Barenziah screamed at him, then abruptly doubled over and vomited on the floor. She continued to revile him between intermittent bouts of nausea. He listened stolidly for some time while Drelliane cleaned up after her. Finally, he told her to cease or he would gag her for her journey to the Emperor.\nThey stopped at Katisha's house on their way out of the city. Symmachus and Drelliane didn't dismount. All seemed normal but Barenziah was frightened as she knocked on the door. Katisha answered the knock. Barenziah thanked the gods silently that at least she was all right. But she'd also obviously been weeping. In any case, she embraced Barenziah warmly.\n\"Why are you crying?\" Barenziah asked.\n\"For Therris, of course. You haven't heard? Oh dear. Poor Therris. He's dead.\" Barenziah felt icy fingers creeping round her heart. \"He was caught stealing from the Commandant's house. Poor fellow, but that was so foolish of him. Oh, Berry, he was drawn and quartered this very dawn by the Commandant's order!\" She started to sob. \"I went. He asked for me. It was terrible. He suffered so before he died. I'll never forget it. I looked for you and Straw, but no one knew where you'd both gone to.\" She glanced behind Barenziah. \"That's the Commandant, isn't it? Symmachus.\" Then Katisha did a strange thing. She stopped crying and grinned. \"You know, the moment I saw him, I thought, This is the one for Barenziah!\" Katisha took a fold of her apron and wiped it across her eyes. \"I told him about you, you know.\"\n\"Yes,\" Barenziah said, \"I know.\" She took Katisha's hands in each of hers and looked at her earnestly. \"Katisha, I love you. I'm going to miss you. But please don't ever tell anyone else anything about me. Ever. Swear you won't. Especially not to Symmachus. And look after Straw for me. Promise me that.\"\nKatisha promised, puzzled though willing. \"Berry, it wasn't somehow because of me that Therris was caught, was it? I never said anything about Therris to ... to ... him.\" She glanced over at the general.\nBarenziah assured her that it wasn't, that an informant had told the Imperial Guard of Therris' plans. Which was probably a lie, but she could see that Katisha plainly needed some kind of comfort.\n\"Oh, I'm glad of that, if I can be glad of anything just now. I'd hate to think-- But how could I have known?\" She leaned over and whispered in Barenziah's ear, \"Symmachus is very handsome, don't you think? And so charming.\"\n\"I wouldn't know about that,\" Barenziah said dryly. \"I haven't really thought about it. There've been other things to think about.\" She explained hurriedly about being Queen of Mournhold and going to live in the Imperial City for a while. \"He was looking for me, that's all. On orders from the Emperor. I was the object of a quest, nothing more than some sort of... of a... goal. I don't think he thinks of me as a woman at all. He said I didn't look like a boy, though,\" she added in the face of Katisha's incredulity. Katisha knew that Barenziah evaluated every male she met in terms of sexual desirability, and availability. \"I suppose it's the shock of finding out that I really am a queen,\" she added, and Katisha agreed that yes, that's true, that must've been something of a shock, although one there was no likelihood of her experiencing firsthand. She smiled. Barenziah smiled with her. Then they hugged again, tearfully, for the last time. She never saw Katisha again. Or Straw.\nThe royal party left Rifton by the great southern gate. Once through, Symmachus tapped her shoulder and pointed back at the portals. \"I thought you might want to say good-bye to Therris too, Your Highness,\" he said.\nBarenziah stared briefly but steadily at the head impaled on a spike above the gate. The birds had been at it, but the face was still recognizable. \"I don't think he'll hear me, although I'm quite sure he'll be pleased to know I'm fine,\" she said, seeming to sound light. \"Let's be on our way, General, shall we?\"\nSymmachus was clearly disappointed by her lack of reaction. \"Ai. You heard of this from your friend Katisha, I suppose?\"\n\"You suppose correctly. She attended the execution,\" Barenziah said casually. If he didn't know already, he'd find out soon enough, she was sure of that.\n\"Did she know Therris belonged to the Guild?\"\nShe shrugged. \"Everyone knew that. It's only lower-ranking members like me who are supposed to keep their membership secret. The ones higher up are well known.\" She turned to smile archly at him. \"But you must know all that, shouldn't you, General?\" she said sweetly.\nHe seemed unaffected by this. \"So you told her who you were and whence you came, but not about the Guild.\"\n\"The Guild membership was not my secret to tell. The other was. There's a difference. Besides, Katisha is a very honest woman. Had I told her, it would have lessened me in her eyes. She was always after Therris to take up a more honest line of work. I value her good opinion.\" She afforded him a glacial stare. \"Not that it's any concern of yours, but do you know what else she thought? She also thought I'd be happier if I settled down with just one man. One of my own race. One of my own race with all the right qualities. One of my own race with all the right qualities, who knows to say all the right things. You, in fact.\" She grabbed the reins preparatory to assuming a brisker pace--but not without sinking one final irresistible barb. \"Isn't it odd how wishes come true sometimes--but not in the way you want them to? Or maybe I should say, not in the way you would ever want them to?\"\nHis answer so took her by surprise that she quite forgot about cantering off. \"Yes. Very odd,\" he replied, and his tone matched his words exactly. Then he excused himself and fell behind.\nShe held her head high and urged her mount onward, trying to look unimpressed. Now what was it about his response that bothered her? Not what he said. No, that wasn't it. But something about the way he said it. Something about it made her think that she, Barenziah, was one of his wishes that had come true. Unlikely as this seemed, she gave it due deliberation. He had found her at last, after months of searching, it seemed, under pressure from the Emperor, no doubt. So his wish had come true. Yes, that must be it.\nBut in a way, apparently, not altogether to his liking."}

But by the second week out her spirits began to rise a little. She found that she enjoyed being on the road again, although she missed &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;'s companionship more than she would have thought. They were escorted by a troop of Redguard knights with whom she felt comfortable, although these were much more disciplined, and decorous, than the guards of the merchant caravans she had spent time with. They were genial but respectful toward her despite her attempts at flirtation.\nSymmachus scolded her privately, saying a queen must maintain royal dignity at all times.\n\"You mean I'm never to have any fun?\" she inquired petulantly.\n\"Ai. Not with such as these. They are beneath you. Graciousness is to be desired from those in authority, Milady. Familiarity is not. You will remain chaste and modest while you are at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBarenziah made a face. \"I might as well be back at &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt; Keep. Elves are promiscuous by nature, you know. Everyone says so.\"\n\"'Everyone' is wrong, then. Some are, some aren't. The Emperor -- and I -- expect you to display both discrimination and good taste. Let me remind you, Your Highness, that you hold the throne of Mournhold not by right of blood but solely at the pleasure of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. If he judges you unsuitable, your reign will end ere it begins. He requires intelligence, obedience, discretion, and total loyalty of all his appointees, and he favors chastity and modesty in women. I strongly suggest you model your deportment after our good Drelliane. Milady.\"\n\"I'd as lief be back in Darkmoor!\" Barenziah snapped resentfully, offended at the thought of emulating the frigid, prudish &lt;a href=\"Drelliane\"&gt;Drelliane&lt;/a&gt; in any way.\n\"That is not an option. Your Highness. If you are of no use to Tiber Septim, he will see to it that you are of no use to his enemies either,\" the general said portentously. \"If you would keep your head on your shoulders, take heed. Let me add that power offers pleasures other than those of carnality and cavorting with base company.\"\nHe began to speak of art, literature, drama, music, and the grand balls thrown at the Imperial Court. Barenziah listened with growing interest, spurred on not entirely by his threats. But afterward she asked timidly if she might continue her study of magic while at the Imperial City. &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; seemed pleased at this and promised to arrange it. Encouraged, she then said that she noted three of their knights escort were women, and asked if she might train a little with them, just for the sake of exercise. The general looked less delighted at this, but gave his consent, though stressing it would only be with the women.\nThe late winter weather held fair, though slightly frosty, for the rest of their journey so that they traveled quickly over firm roads. On the last day of their trip, spring seemed to have arrived at last for there were hints of a thaw. The road grew muddy underfoot, and everywhere one could hear water trickling and dripping faintly but steadily. It was a welcome sound.\nThey came to the great bridge that crossed into the Imperial City at sunset. The rosy glow turned the stark white marble edifices of the metropolis a delicate pink. It all looked very new and grand and immaculate. A broad avenue led north toward the Palace. A crowd of people of all sorts and races filled the wide concourse. Lights winked out in the shops and on in the inns as dusk fell and stars came out singly then by twos and threes. Even the side streets were broad and brightly illuminated. Near the Palace the towers of an immense &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;hall reared toward the east, while westward the stained glass windows of a huge tabernacle glittered in the dying light.\nSymmachus had apartments in a magnificent house two blocks from the palace, past the temple. (\"The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;,\" he identified as they passed it, an ancient Nordic cult which Tiber Septim had revived. He said that Barenziah would be expected to become a member should she prove acceptable to the Emperor.) The place was quite splendid--although little to Barenziah's taste. The walls and furnishings were done in utter pristine white, relieved only by touches of dull gold, and the floors in dully gleaming black marble. Barenziah's eyes ached for color and the interplay of subtle shadings.\nIn the morning Symmachus and Drelliane escorted her to the Imperial Palace. Barenziah noted that everyone they met greeted Symmachus with a deferential respect in some cases bordering on obsequiousness. The general seemed to take it for granted.\nThey were ushered directly into the imperial presence. Morning sun flooded a small room through a large window with tiny panes, washing over a sumptuously laden breakfast table and the single man who sat there, dark against the light. He leapt to his feet as they entered and hurried toward them. \"Ah, Symmachus our most loyal friend, we welcome your return most gladly.\" His hands held Symmachus' shoulders briefly, fondly, halting the deep genuflection the Dark Elf had been in the process of effecting.\nBarenziah curtseyed as Tiber Septim turned to her.\n\"Barenziah, our naughty little runaway. How do you do, child? Here, let us have a look at you. Why, Symmachus, she's charming, absolutely charming. Why have you hidden her from us all these years? Is the light too much, child? Shall we draw the hangings? Yes, of course.\" He waved aside Symmachus' protests and drew the curtains himself, not troubling to summon a servant. \"You will pardon us for this discourtesy toward yourselves, our dear guests. We've much to think of, though that's scant excuse for hospitality's neglect. But ah! pray join us. There's some excellent nectarines from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThey settled themselves at the table. Barenziah was dumbfounded. Tiber Septim was nothing like the grim, grey, giant warrior she'd pictured. He was of average height, fully half a head shorter than tall Symmachus, although he was well-knit of figure and lithe of movement. He had a winning smile, bright -- indeed piercing -- blue eyes, and a full head of stark white hair above a lined and weathered face. He might have been any age from forty to sixty. He pressed food and drink upon them, then repeated the question the general had asked her days ago: Why had she left home? Had her guardians been unkind to her?\n\"No, Excellency,\" Barenziah replied, \"in truth, no -- although I fancied so at times.\" Symmachus had fabricated a story for her, and Barenziah told it now, although with a certain misgiving. The stable-boy, &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;, had convinced her that her guardians, unable to find a suitable husband for her, meant to sell her off as a concubine in &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;; and when a &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; had indeed come, she had panicked and fled with Straw.\nTiber Septim seemed fascinated and listened raptly as she provided details of her life as a merchant caravan escort. \"Why, 'tis like a ballad!\" he said. \"By the One, we'll have the Court Bard set it to music. What a charming boy you must have made.\"\n\"General Symmachus said--\" Barenziah stopped in some confusion, then proceeded. \"He said -- well, that I no longer look much like a boy. I have... grown in the past few months.\" She lowered her gaze in what she hoped approximated maidenly modesty.\n\"He's a very discerning fellow, is our loyal friend Symmachus.\"\n\"I know I've been a very foolish girl, Excellency. I must crave your pardon, and that of my kind guardians. I... I realized that some time ago, but I was too ashamed to go back home. But I don't want to return to Darkmoor now. Excellency, I long for Mournhold. My soul pines for my own country.\"\n\"Our dear child. You shall go home, we promise you. But we pray you remain with us a little longer, that you may prepare yourself for the grave and solemn task with which we shall charge you.\"\nBarenziah gazed at him earnestly, heart beating fast. It was all working just as Symmachus had said it would. She felt a warm flush of gratitude toward him, but was careful to keep her attention focused on the Emperor. \"I am honored, Excellency, and wish most earnestly to serve you and this great Empire you have built in any way I can.\" It was the politic thing to say, to be sure -- but Barenziah really meant it. She was awed at the magnificence of the city and the discipline and order evident everywhere, and moreover was excited at the prospect of being a part of it all. And she felt quite taken by the gentle Tiber Septim.\nAfter a few days Symmachus left for Mournhold to take up the duties of a governor until Barenziah was ready to assume the throne, after which he would become her Prime Minister. Barenziah, with Drelliane as chaperone, took up residence in a suite of rooms at the Imperial Palace. Several tutors were provided her, in all the fields deemed seemly for a queenly education. During this time she became deeply interested in the magical arts, but she found the study of history and politics not at all to her prefer ence.\nOn occasion she met with Tiber Septim in the Palace gardens and he would unfailingly and politely inquire as to her progress -- and chide her, although with a smile, for her disinterest at matters of state. However, he was always happy to instruct her on the finer points of magic, and he could make even history and politics seem interesting. \"They're people, child, not dry facts in a dusty volume,\" he said.\nAs her understanding broadened, their discussions grew longer, deeper, more frequent. He spoke to her of his vision of a united Tamriel, each race separate and distinct but with shared ideals and goals, all contributing to the common weal. \"Some things are universal, shared by all sentient folk of good will,\" he said. \"So the One teaches us. We must unite against the malicious and the brutish, the miscreated -- the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, trolls, goblins, and other worse creatures -- and not strive against one another.\" His blue eyes would light up as he stared into his dream, and Barenziah was delighted just to sit and listen to him. If he drew close to her, the side of her body next to him would glow as if he were a smoldering blaze. If their hands met she would tingle all over as if his body were charged with a shock spell.\nOne day, quite unexpectedly, he took her face in his hands and kissed her gently on the mouth. She drew back after a few moments, astonished by the violence of her feelings, and he apologized instantly. \"I... we... we didn't mean to do that. It's just -- you are so beautiful, dear. So very beautiful.\" He was looking at her with hopeless yearning in his generous eyes.\nShe turned away, tears streaming down her face.\n\"Are you angry with us? Speak to us. Please.\"\nBarenziah shook her head. \"I could never be angry with you, Excellency. I... I love you. I know it's wrong, but I can't help it.\"\n\"We have a consort,\" he said. \"She is a good and virtuous woman, the mother of our children and future heirs. We could never put her aside -- yet there is nothing between us and her, no sharing of the spirit. She would have us be other than what we are. We are the most powerful person in all of Tamriel, and... Barenziah, we... I... I think I am the most lonely as well.\" He stood up suddenly. \"Power!\" he said with sublime contempt. \"I'd trade a goodly share of it for youth and love if the gods would only sanction it.\"\n\"But you are strong and vigorous and vital, more than any man I've ever known.\"\nHe shook his head vehemently. \"Today, perhaps. Yet I am less than I was yesterday, last year, ten years ago. I feel the sting of my mortality, and it is painful.\"\n\"If I can ease your pain, let me.\" Barenziah moved toward him, hands outstretched.\n\"No. I would not take your innocence from you.\"\n\"I'm not that innocent.\"\n\"How so?\" The Emperor's voice suddenly grated harshly, his brows knitted.\nBarenziah's mouth went dry. What had she just said? But she couldn't turn back know. He would know. \"There was Straw,\" she faltered. \"I... I was lonely too. Am lonely. And not so strong as you.\" She cast her eyes down in abashment. \"I... I guess I'm not worthy, Excellency--\"\n\"No, no. Not so. Barenziah. My Barenziah. It cannot last for long. You have a duty toward Mournhold, and a duty toward the Empire. I must tend toward mine as well. But while we may -- shall we share what we have, what we can, and pray the One forgives us our frailty?\"\nTiber Septim held out his arms -- and wordlessly, willingly, Barenziah stepped into his embrace.\n\"You caper on the edge of a volcano, child,\" &lt;a href=\"Drelliane\"&gt;Drelliane&lt;/a&gt; admonished as Barenziah admired the splendid star sapphire ring her &lt;a href=\"imperial\"&gt;imperial&lt;/a&gt; lover had given her to celebrate their one-month anniversary.\n\"How so? We make one another happy. We harm no one. Symmachus bade me be discriminating and discreet. Who better could I choose? And we've been most discreet. He treats me like a daughter in public.\" Tiber Septim's nightly visits were made through a secret passage that only few in the Palace were privy to -- himself and a handful of trusted bodyguards.\n\"He slavers over you like a cur his supper. Have you not noticed the coolness of the Empress and her son toward you?\"\nBarenziah shrugged. Even before she and Septim had become lovers, she'd received no more from his family than bare civility. Threadbare civility. \"What matter? It is Tiber who holds the power.\"\n\"But it is his son who holds the future. Do not put his mother up to public scorn, I beg you.\"\n\"Can I help it if that dry stick of a woman cannot hold her husband's interest even in conversation at dinner?\"\n\"Have less to say in public. That is all I ask. She matters little, it is true -- but her children love her, and you do not want them as enemies. Tiber Septim has not long to live. I mean,\" Drelliane amended quickly at Barenziah's scowl, \"humans are all short-lived. Ephemeral, as we of the Elder Races say. They come and go as the seasons -- but the families of the powerful ones live on for a time. You must be a friend to this family if you would see lasting profit from your relationship. Ah, but how can I make you see truly, you who are so young and human-bred as well! If you take heed, and wisely, you and Mournhold are like to live to see the fall of Septim's dynasty, if indeed he has founded one, just as you have witnessed its rise. It is the way of human history. They ebb and flow like the inconstant tides. Their cities and dominions bloom like spring flowers, only to wither and die in the summer sun. But the Elves endure. We are as a year to their hour, a decade to their day.\"\nBarenziah just laughed. She knew that rumors abounded about her and Tiber Septim. She enjoyed the attention, for all save the Empress and her son seemed captivated by her. Minstrels sang of her dark beauty and her charming ways. She was in fashion, and in love -- and if it was temporary, well, what was not? She was happy for the first time she could remember, each of her days filled with joy and pleasure. And the nights were even better.\n\"What is wrong with me?\" Barenziah lamented. \"Look, not one of my skirts fit. What's become of my waistline? Am I getting fat?\" Barenziah regarded her thin arms and legs and her undeniably thickened waist in the mirror with displeasure.\nDrelliane shrugged. \"You appear to be with child, young as you are. Constant pairing with a human has brought you to early fertility. I see no choice but for you to speak with the Emperor about it. You are in his power. It would be best, I think, for you to go directly to Mournhold if he would agree to it, and bear the child there.\"\n\"Alone?\" Barenziah placed her hands on her swollen belly, tears forming in her eyes. Everything in her yearned to share the fruit of her love with her lover. \"He'll never agree to that. He won't be parted from me now. You'll see.\"\nDrelliane shook her head. Although she said no more, a look of sympathy and sorrow had replaced her usual cool scorn.\nThat night Barenziah told Tiber Septim when he came to her for their usual assignation.\n\"With child?\" He looked shocked. No, stunned. \"You're sure of it? But I was told Elves do not bear at so young an age...\"\nBarenziah forced a smile. \"How can I be sure? I've never--\"\n\"I shall have my healer fetched.\"\nThe healer, a &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; of middle years, confirmed that Barenziah was indeed pregnant, and that such a thing had never before been known to happen. It was a testimony to His Excellency's potency, the healer said in sycophantic tones. Tiber Septim roared at him.\n\"This must not be!\" he said. \"Undo it. We command you.\"\n\"Sire,\" the healer gaped at him. \"I cannot... I may not--\"\n\"Of course you can, you incompetent dullard,\" the Emperor snapped. \"It is our express wish that you do so.\"\nBarenziah, till then silent and wide-eyed with terror, suddenly sat up in bed. \"No!\" she screamed. \"No! What are you saying?\"\n\"Child,\" Tiber Septim sat down beside her, his face wearing one of his winning smiles. \"I'm so sorry. Truly. But this cannot be. Your issue would be a threat to my son and his sons. I shall no more put it plainly than that.\"\n\"The child I bear is yours!\" she wailed.\n\"No. It is now but a possibility, a might-be, not yet gifted with a soul or quickened into life. I will not have it so. I forbid it.\" He gave the healer another hard stare and the Elf began to tremble.\n\"Sire. It is her child. Children are few among the Elves. No Elven woman conceives more than four times, and that is very rare. Two is the usual number. Some bear none, even, and some only one. If I take this one from her, Sire, she may not conceive again.\"\n\"You promised us she would not bear to us. We've little faith in your prognostications.\"\nBarenziah scrambled naked from the bed and ran for the door, not knowing where she was going, only that she could not stay. She never reached it. Darkness overtook her.\nShe awoke to pain, and a feeling of emptiness. A void where something used to be, something that used to be alive, but now was dead and gone forever. Drelliane was there to soothe the pain and clean up the blood that still pooled at times between her legs. But there was nothing to fill the emptiness. There was nothing to take the place of the void.\nThe Emperor sent magnificent gifts and vast arrangements of flowers, and came on short visits, always well-attended. Barenziah received these visits with pleasure at first. But Tiber Septim came no more at night -- and after some time nor did she wish him to.\nSome weeks passed, and when she was completely physically recovered, Drelliane informed her that Symmachus had written to request she come to Mournhold earlier than planned. It was announced that she would leave forthwith.\nShe was given a grand retinue, an extensive trousseau befitting a queen, and an elaborate and impressive ceremonial departure from the gates of the Imperial City. Some people were sorry to see her leave, and expressed their sadness in tears and expostulations. But some others were not, and did not."}

Dearly have I bought it. Now I do understand better &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s love of it, if he has often paid such prices. For surely worth is measured by the price we pay.\" By her wish, she rode on a shiny roan mare, clad as a warrior in resplendent chain mail of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elven&lt;/a&gt; make.\nAs the days slowly slipped by and her train rode the winding road eastward into the setting sun, around her gradually rose the steep-sided mountain slopes of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The air was thin, and a chill late autumn wind blew constantly. But it was also rich with the sweet spicy smell of the late-blooming black rose, which was native to Morrowind and grew in every shadowy nook and crevice of its highlands, finding nourishment even in the stoniest banks and ridges. In small villages and towns, ragged Dark Elven folk gathered along the road to cry her name or simply gape. Most of her knightly escort were &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, with a few &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. As they wove their way into the heart of Morrowind, they grew increasingly uncomfortable and clung together in protective clusters. Even the Elven knights seemed wary.\nBut Barenziah felt at home, at last. She felt the welcome extended to her by the land. Her land.\n&lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; met her at the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; border with an escort of knights, about half of whom were Dark Elven. In &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; battle dress, she noted.\nThere was a grand parade of entry into the city and speeches of welcome from stately dignitaries.\n\"I've had the queen's suite refurbished for you,\" the general told her later when they reached the palace, \"but you may change anything not to your taste, of course.\" He went on about the details of the coronation, which was to be held in a week. He was his old commanding self -- but she sensed something else as well. He was eager for her approval of the arrangements, was in fact fishing for it. That was new. He had never required her commendation before.\nHe asked her nothing about her stay in the Imperial City, or of her affair with Tiber Septim -- although Barenziah was certain Drelliane had told him, or earlier written him, everything in detail.\nThe ceremony itself, like so much else, was a mixture of old and new -- parts of it from the ancient Dark Elven tradition of Mournhold, the others dictated by Imperial decree. She was sworn to the service of the Empire and Tiber Septim as well as to the land of Mournhold and its people. She accepted oaths of fealty and allegiance from the people, the nobility, and the council. This last was composed of a blend of Imperial emissaries (\"advisors\" they were called) and native representatives of the Mournhold people, who were mostly elders in accordance with Elven custom.\nBarenziah later found that much of her time was occupied in attempting to reconcile these two factions and their cronies. The elders were expected to do most of the conciliating, in light of reforms introduced by the Empire pertaining to land ownership and surface farming. But most of these went clean against Dark Elven observances. Tiber Septim, \"in the name of the One,\" had ordained a new tradition -- and apparently even the gods and goddesses themselves were expected to obey.\nThe new Queen threw herself into her work and her studies. She was through with love and men for a long, long time -- if not forever. There were other pleasures, she discovered, as Symmachus had promised her long ago: those of the mind, and those of power. She developed (surprisingly, for she had always rebelled against her tutors at the Imperial City) a deep love for Dark Elven history and mythology, a hunger to know more fully the people from whom she had sprung. She was gratified to learn that they had been proud warriors and skilled craftsmen and cunning mages since time immemorial.\nTiber Septim lived for another half-century, during which she saw him on several occasions as she was bidden to the Imperial City on one reason of state or another. He greeted her with warmth during these visits, and they even had long talks together about events in the Empire when opportunity would permit. He seemed to have quite forgotten that there had ever been anything between them more than easy friendship and a profound political alliance. He changed little as the years passed. Rumor had it that his mages had developed spells to extend his vitality, and that even the One had granted him immortality. Then one day a messenger came with the news that Tiber Septim was dead, and his grandson &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; was now Emperor in his place.\nThey had heard the news in private, she and Symmachus. The sometime Imperial General and now her trusted Prime Minister took it stoically, as he took most everything.\n\"Somehow it doesn't seem possible,\" Barenziah said.\n\"I told you. Ai. It's the way of humans. They are a short-lived people. It doesn't really matter. His power lives on, and his son now wields it.\"\n\"You called him your friend once. Do you feel nothing? No grief?\"\nHe shrugged. \"There was a time when you called him somewhat more. What do you feel, Barenziah?\" They had long ago ceased to address each other in private by their formal titles.\n\"Emptiness. Loneliness,\" she said, then she too shrugged. \"But that's not new.\"\n\"Ai. I know,\" he said softly, taking her hand. \"Barenziah...\" He turned her face up and kissed her.\nThe act filled her with astonishment. She couldn't remember his ever touching her before. She'd never thought of him in that way -- and yet, undeniably, an old familiar warmth spread through her. She'd forgot ten how good it felt, that warmth. Not the scorching heat she'd felt with Tiber Septim, but the comforting, robust ardor she somehow associated with... with &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;! Straw. Poor Straw. She hadn't thought of him in so long. He'd be middle-aged now if he were still alive. Probably with a dozen children, she thought affectionately... and a hearty wife who hopefully could talk for two.\n\"Marry me, Barenziah,\" Symmachus was saying, he seemed to have picked up her thoughts on mar riage, children... wives, \"I've worked and toiled and waited long enough, haven't I?\"\nMarriage. A peasant with peasant dreams. The thought appeared in her mind, clear and unbidden. Hadn't she used those very same words to describe Straw, so very long ago? And yet, why not? If not Symmachus, who else?\nMany of the great noble families of Morrowind had been wiped out in Tiber Septim's great war of unification, before the treaty. Dark Elven rule had been restored, it was true -- but not the old, not the true nobility. Most of them were upstarts like Symmachus, and not even half as good or deserving as he was. He had fought to keep Mournhold whole and hale when their so-called counselors would have picked at its bones, sucked them dry as Ebonheart had been sucked dry. He'd fought for Mournhold, fought for her, while she and the kingdom grew and thrived. She felt a sudden rush of gratitude -- and, undeniably, affection. He was steady and reliable. And he'd served her well. And loved her well.\n\"Why not?\" she said, smiling. And took his hand. And kissed him.\nThe union was a good one, in its political as well as personal aspects. While Tiber Septim's grandson, the Emperor Pelagius Septim, viewed her with a jaundiced eye, his trust in his father's old friend was absolute.\nSymmachus, however, was still viewed with suspicion by Morrowind's stiff-necked folk, chary at his peasant ancestry and his close ties to the Empire. But the Queen was quite unshakably popular. \"The Lady Barenziah's one of our own,\" it was whispered, \"held captive as we.\"\nBarenziah felt content. There was work and there was pleasure -- and what more could one ask of life?\nThe years passed swiftly, with crises to be dealt with, and storms and famines and failures to be weath ered, and plots to be foiled, and conspirators to be executed. Mournhold prospered steadily. Her people were secure and fed, her mines and farms productive. All was well -- save that the royal marriage had produced no children. No heirs.\nElven children are slow to come, and most demanding of their welcome -- and noble children more so than others. Thus many decades had come to pass before they grew concerned.\n\"The fault lies with me, Symmachus. I'm damaged goods,\" Barenziah said bitterly. \"If you want to take another...\"\n\"I want no other,\" Symmachus said gently, \"nor do I know for certain that the fault is yours. Perhaps it is mine. Ai. Whichever. We will seek a cure. If there is damage, surely it may be repaired.\"\n\"How so? When we dare not entrust anyone with the true story? Healer's oaths do not always hold.\"\n\"It won't matter if we change the time and circumstances a bit. Whatever we say or fail to say, &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt; the Storyteller never rests. The god's inventive mind and quick tongue are ever busy spreading gossip and rumor.\"\nPriests and healers and mages came and went, but all their prayers, potions, and philtres produced not even a promise of bloom, let alone a single fruit. Eventually they thrust it from their minds and left it in the gods' hands. They were yet young, as Elves went, with centuries ahead of them. There was time. With Elves there was always time.\nBarenziah sat at dinner in the Great Hall, pushing food about on a plate, feeling bored and restless. Symmachus was away, having been summoned to the Imperial City by Tiber Septim's great-great-grandson, Uriel Septim. Or was it his great-great-great-grandson? She'd lost count, she realized. Their faces seemed to blur one into the next. Perhaps she should have gone with him, but there'd been the delegation from &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; on a tiresome matter that nevertheless required delicate handling.\nA bard was singing in an alcove off the hall, but Barenziah wasn't listening. Lately all the songs seemed the same to her, whether new or old. Then a turn of phrase caught her attention. He was singing of freedom, of adventure, of freeing Morrowind from its chains. How dare he! Barenziah sat up straight and turned to glare at him. Worse, she realized he was singing of some ancient, and now immaterial, war with the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; Nords, praising the heroism of &lt;a href=\"Edward\"&gt;Kings Edward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; and their brave &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn%27s%20Companions\"&gt;Companions&lt;/a&gt; . The tale was old enough, certainly, yet the song was new ... and its meaning ... Barenziah couldn't be sure.\nA bold fellow, this bard, but with a strong, passionate voice and a good ear for music. Rather hand some too, in a raffish sort of way. He didn't look to be well-off exactly, nor was he all that young. Certainly he couldn't be under a century of age. Why hadn't she heard him before, or at least heard of him?\n\"Who is he?\" she inquired of a lady-in-waiting.\nThe woman shrugged and said, \"Calls himself the &lt;a href=\"Drayven%20Indoril\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;, Milady. No one seems to know any thing about him.\"\n\"Bid him speak with me when he has done.\"\nThe man called the Nightingale came to her, thanked her for the honor of the Queen's audience and the fat purse she handed him. His manner wasn't bold at all, she decided, rather quiet and unassuming. He was quick enough with gossip about others, but she learned nothing about him -- he turned all questions away with a joking riposte or a ribald tale. Yet these were recounted so charmingly it was impossible to take offence.\n\"My true name? Milady, I am no one. No, no, my parents named me Know Wan -- or was it No Buddy? What matters it? It matters not. How may parents give name to that which they know not? Ah! I believe that was the name, Know Not. I have been the Nightingale for so long I do not remember, since, oh, last month at the very least -- or was it last week? All my memory goes into song and tale, you see, Milady. I've none left for myself. I'm really quite dull. Where was I born? Why, Knoweyr. I plan to settle in Dun roamin when I get there ... but I'm in no hurry.\"\n\"I see. And will you then marry Atallshur?\"\n\"Very perceptive of you, Milady. Perhaps, perhaps. Although I find Innhayst quite charming too, at whiles.\"\n\"Ah. You are fickle, then?\"\n\"Like the wind, Milady. I blow hither and yon, hot and cold, as chance suits. Chance is my suit. Naught else wears well on me.\"\nBarenziah smiled. \"Stay with us awhile, then ... if you will, Milord Erhatick.\"\n\"As you wish, Milady Bryte.\"\nAfter that brief exchange, Barenziah found her interest in life somehow rekindled. All that had seemed stale became fresh and new again. She greeted each day with zest, looking forward to con\u00adversation with the Nightingale and the gift of his song. Unlike other bards, he never sang her praises, nor other women's, but only of high adventure and bold deeds.\nWhen she asked him about this, he said, \"What greater praise of your beauty could you ask, Milady, than that which your own mirror gives you? And if words you would have, you have those of the greatest, of those greater than my callow self. How should I vie with them, I who was born but a week gone by?\"\nFor once they were speaking privately. The Queen, unable to sleep, had summoned him to her cham ber that his music might soothe her. \"You are lazy and a coward, sera, else I hold no charm for you.\"\n\"Milady, to praise you I must know you. I can never know you. &lt;a href=\"The%20Real%20Barenziah%2C%20Book%20IV%23Notes\"&gt;You are wrapped in enigma, in clouds of enchantment.&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Nay, not so. Your words are what weave enchantment. Your words... and your eyes. And your body. Know me if you will. Know me if you dare.\"\nHe came to her then. They lay close, they kissed, they embraced. \"Not even Barenziah truly knows Barenziah,\" he whispered softly, \"so how may I? Milady, you seek and know it not, nor yet for what. What would you have, that you have not?\"\n\"Passion,\" she answered back. \"Passion. And children born of it.\"\n\"And for your children, what? What birthright might be theirs?\"\n\"Freedom,\" she said, \"the freedom to be what they would be. Tell me, you who seem wisest to these eyes and ears, and the soul that knits them. Where may I find these things?\"\n\"One lies beside you, the other beneath you. But would you dare stretch out your hand, that you might take what could be yours, and your children's?\"\n\"Symmachus...\"\n\"In my person lies the answer to part of what you seek. The other lies hidden below us in these your very kingdom's mines, that which will grant us the power to fulfill and achieve our dreams. That which Edward and Moraelyn between them used to free &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and their spirits from the hateful domination of the Nords. If it be properly used, Milady, none may stand against it, not even the power the Emperor controls. Freedom, you say? Barenziah, freedom it gives from the chains that bind you. Think on it, Milady.\" He kissed her again, softly, and withdrew.\n\"You're not leaving... ?\" she cried out. Her body yearned for him.\n\"For now,\" he said. \"Pleasures of the flesh are nothing beside what we might have together. I would have you think on what I have just said.\"\n\"I don't need to think. What must we do? What preparations must be made?\"\n\"Why -- none. The mines may not be entered freely, it is true. But with the Queen at my side, who will stand athwart? Once below I can guide you to where this thing lies, and lift it from its resting place.\"\nThen the memory of her endless studies slid into place. \"The &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Horn of Summoning&lt;/a&gt;,\" she whispered in awe. \"Is it true? Could it be? How do you know? I've read that it's buried beneath the measureless caves of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Nay, long have I studied this matter. Ere his death King Edward gave the Horn for safekeeping into the hand of his old friend King Moraelyn. He in turn secreted it here in Mournhold under the guardianship of the god &lt;a href=\"Ephen\"&gt;Ephen&lt;/a&gt;, whose birthplace and bailiwick this is. Now you know what it has cost me many a long year and weary mile to discover.\"\n\"But the god? What of Ephen?\"\n\"Trust me, Milady heart. All will be well.\" Laughing softly, he blew her a last kiss and was gone.\nOn the morrow they passed the guards at the great portals that led into the mines, and further below. Under pretence of her customary tour of inspection, Barenziah, unattended but for the Nightingale, ventured into cavern after subterranean cavern. Eventually they reached what looked like a for gotten sealed doorway, and upon entering found that it led to an ancient part of the workings, long aban doned. The going was treacherous for some of the old shafts had collapsed, and they had to clear a passage through the rubble or find a way around the more impassable piles. Vicious rats and huge spiders scurried here and there, sometimes even attacking them. But they proved no match for Barenziah's firebolt spells or the Nightingale's quick dagger.\n\"We've been gone too long,\" Barenziah said at length. \"They'll be looking for us. What will I tell them?\"\n\"Whatever you please,\" the Nightingale laughed. \"You are the Queen, aren't you?\"\n\"The Lord Symmachus--\"\n\"That peasant obeys whoever holds power. Always has, always will. We shall hold the power, Milady love.\" His lips were sweetest wine, his touch both fire and ice.\n\"Now,\" she said, \"take me now. I'm ready.\" Her body seemed to hum, every nerve and muscle taut.\n\"Not yet. Not here, not like this.\" He waved around, indicating the aged dusty debris and grim walls of rock. \"Just a little while longer.\" Reluctantly, Barenziah nodded her assent. They resumed walking.\n\"Here,\" he said at last, pausing before a blank barrier. \"Here it lies.\" He scratched a rune in the dust, his other hand weaving a spell as he did so.\nThe wall dissolved. It revealed an entrance to some ancient shrine. In the midst stood a statue of a god, hammer in hand, poised above an admantium anvil.\n\"By my blood, Ephen,\" the Nightingale cried, \"I bid thee waken! Moraelyn's heir of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; am I, last of the royal line, sharer of thy blood. At Morrowind's last need, with all of Elvendom in dread peril of their selves and souls, release to me that guerdon which thou guardst! Now I do bid thee, strike!\"\nAt his final words the statue glowed and quickened, the blank stone eyes shone a bright red. The mas sive head nodded, the hammer smote the anvil, and it split asunder with a thunderous crash, the stone god itself crumbling. Barenziah clapped her hands over her ears and crouched down, shaking terribly and moaning out loud.\nThe Nightingale strode forward boldly and clasped the thing that lay among the ruins with a roar of ecstasy. He lifted it high.\n\"Someone's coming!\" Barenziah cried in alarm, then noticed for the first time what it was he was hold ing aloft. \"Wait, that's not the Horn, it -- it's a staff!\"\n\"Indeed, Milady. You see truly, at last!\" The Nightingale laughed aloud. \"I am sorry, Milady sweet, but I must leave you now. Perhaps we shall meet again one day. Until then... Ah, until then, Symmachus,\" he said to the mail-clad figure who had appeared behind them, \"she is all yours. You may claim her back.\"\n\"No!\" Barenziah screamed. She sprang up and ran toward him, but he was gone. Winked out of existence -- just as Symmachus, claymore drawn, reached him. His blade cleaved a single stroke through empty air. Then he stood still, as if taking the stone god's place.\nBarenziah said nothing, heard nothing, saw nothing... felt nothing...\nSymmachus told the half dozen or so Elves who had accompanied him that the Nightingale and Queen Barenziah had lost their way, and had been set upon by giant &lt;a href=\"spiders\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;. That the Nightingale had lost his footing and fallen into a deep crevice, which closed over him. That his body could not be recovered. That the Queen had been badly shaken by the encounter and deeply mourned the loss of her friend, who had fallen in her defense. Such was Symmachus' presence and power of command that the slack-jawed knights, none of whom had caught more than a glimpse of what happened, were convinced that it was all exactly as he said.\nThe Queen was escorted back to the palace and taken to her chamber, whereupon she dismissed her servants-in-waiting. She sat still before her mirror for a long time, stunned, too distraught even to weep. Symmachus stood watching over her.\n\"Do you have any idea at all what you have just done?\" he said finally -- flatly, coldly.\n\"You should have told me,\" Barenziah whispered. \"The Staff of Chaos! I never dreamed it lay here. He said-- he said-- \" A mewling escaped her lips and she doubled over in despair. \"Oh, what have I done? What have I done? What happens now? What's to become of me? Of us?\"\n\"Did you love him?\"\n\"Yes. Yes, yes, yes! Oh my Symmachus, the gods have mercy on me, but I did love him. Did. But now... now... I don't know... I'm not sure... I...\"\nSymmachus' hard-lined face softened slightly, and his eyes glittered with new light, and he sighed. \"Ai. That's something then. You will become a mother yet if it's within my power. As for the rest -- Barenziah, my dearest Barenziah, I expect you have loosed a storm upon the land. It'll be a while yet in the brewing. But when it comes, we'll weather it together. As we always have.\"\nHe came over to her then, and stripped her of her clothing, and carried her to the bed. Out of grief and longing, her enfeebled body responded to his brawny one as it never had before, pouring forth all that the Nightingale had wakened to life in her. And in so doing calming the restless ghosts of all he had destroyed.\nShe was empty, and emptied. And then she was filled, for a child was planted and grew within her. As her &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; flourished in the womb, so did her feeling toward patient, faithful, devoted Symmachus, which had been rooted in long friendship and unbroken affection -- and which now, at last, ripened into the fullness of true love. Eight years later they were again blessed, this time with a &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt;.\nDirectly after the Nightingale's theft of the Staff of Chaos, Symmachus had sent urgent secret communiques to Uriel Septim. He had not gone himself, as he would normally have, choosing instead to stay with Barenziah during her fertile period to father a son upon her. For this, and for the theft, he suf fered Uriel Septim's temporary disfavor and unjust suspicion. Spies were sent in search of the thief, but the Nightingale seemed to have vanished whence he had come -- wherever that was.\n\"Dark Elf in part, perhaps,\" said Barenziah, \"but part human too, I think, in disguise. Else would I not have come so quickly to fertility.\"\n\"Part Dark Elf, for sure, and of ancient &lt;a href=\"Ra%27athim\"&gt;Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; lineage at that, else he would not have been able to free the Staff,\" Symmachus reasoned. He turned to peer at her fixedly. \"I don't think he would have lain with you. As an Elf he did not dare, for then he would not have been able to part from you.\" He smiled. Then he turned serious once more. \"Ai! He knew the Staff lay there, not the Horn, and that he must teleport to safety. The Staff is not a weapon that would have seen him clear, unlike the Horn. Praise the gods at least that he does not have that! It seems all was as he expected -- but how did he know? I placed the Staff there myself, with the aid of the rag-tail end of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%27athim%20Clan\"&gt;Ra'athim Clan&lt;/a&gt; who now sits king in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Ebonheart\"&gt;Castle Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; as a reward. Tiber Septim claimed the Horn, but left the Staff for safekeeping. Ai! Now the Nightingale can use the Staff to sow seeds of strife and dissension wherever he goes, if he wishes. Yet that alone will not gain him power. That lies with the Horn and the ability to use it.\"\n\"I'm not so sure it's power the Nightingale seeks,\" Barenziah said.\n\"All seek power,\" Symmachus said, \"each in our own way.\"\n\"Not I,\" she answered. \"I, Milord, have found that for which I sought.\""}

The current &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim&lt;/a&gt;, sent some rather stiff messages expressing shock and displeasure at the Staff's disappearance, and urging Symmachus to make every effort to locate its whereabouts and communicate developments to the newly appointed &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, in whose hands the matter had been placed.\n\"Tharn!\" Symmachus thundered in disgust and frustration as he paced about the small chamber where &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, now some months pregnant, was sitting serenely embroidering a baby blanket. \"Jagar Tharn, indeed. Ai! I wouldn't give him directions for crossing the street, not if he were a doddering old blind sot.\"\n\"What have you against him, love?\"\n\"I just don't trust that mongrel &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt;. Part &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt;, part &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt;, and part the gods only know what. All the worst qualities of all his combined bloods, I'll warrant.\" He snorted. \"No one knows much about him. Claims he was born in southern &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, of a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Wood Elven&lt;/a&gt; mother. Seems to have been everywhere since -- \"\nBarenziah, sunk in the contentment and lassitude of pregnancy, had only been humoring Symmachus thus far. But now she suddenly dropped her needlework and looked at him. Something had piqued her interest. \"Symmachus. Could this Jagar Tharn have been the Nightingale, disguised?\"\nSymmachus thought this over before replying. \"Nay, my love. Human blood seems to be the one missing component in Tharn's ancestry.\" To Symmachus, Barenziah knew, that was a flaw. Her husband despised Wood Elves as lazy thieves and High Elves as effete intellectuals. But he admired humans, especially &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, for their combination of pragmatism, intelligence, and energy. \"The Nightingale's of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%27athim%20Clan\"&gt;Ra'athim Clan&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Mora\"&gt;House of Mora&lt;/a&gt; in particular, I'll be bound. That house has had human blood in it since her time. Ebonheart was jealous that the Staff was laid here when Tiber Septim took the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Horn of Summoning&lt;/a&gt; from us.\"\nBarenziah sighed a little. The rivalry between Ebonheart and &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; reached back almost to the dawn of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;'s history. Once the two nations had been one, all the lucrative mines held in fief by the Ra'athims, whose nobility retained the High Kingship of Morrowind. Ebonheart had split into two separate city-states, Ebonheart and Mournhold, when Queen &lt;a href=\"Lian\"&gt;Lian&lt;/a&gt;'s twin sons -- grandsons of the legendary King &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; -- were left as joint heirs. At about the same time the office of High King was vacated in favor of a temporary War Leader to be named by a council in times of provincial emergency.\nStill, Ebonheart remained jealous of her prerogatives as the eldest city-state of Morrowind (\"first among equals\" was the phrase its rulers often quoted) and claimed that rightful guardianship of the Staff of Chaos should have been entrusted to its ruling house. Mournhold responded that King Moraelyn himself had placed the Staff in the keeping of the god Ephen -- and Mournhold was unarguably the god's birthplace.\n\"Why not tell Jagar Tharn of your suspicions, then? Let him recover the thing. As long as it's safe, what does it matter who recovers it, or where it lies?\"\nSymmachus stared at her without comprehension. \"It matters,\" he said softly after a while, \"but I suppose not that much. Ai.\" He added, \"Certainly not enough for you to concern yourself further with it. You just sit there and tend to your,\" and here he smiled at her wickedly, \"embroidery.\"\nBarenziah flung the sampler at him. It hit Symmachus square in the face -- needle, thimble, and all.\nIn a few more months Barenziah gave birth to a fine son, whom they named &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing more was heard of the Staff of Chaos, or the Nightingale. If Ebonheart had the Staff in its possession, they certainly did not boast of it.\nThe years passed swiftly and happily. Helseth grew tall and strong. He was much like his father, whom he worshiped. When Helseth was eight years old Barenziah bore a second child, a daughter, to Symmachus' lasting delight. Helseth was his pride, but little &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; -- named for Symmachus' mother -- held his heart.\nSadly, the birth of Morgiah was not the harbinger of better times ahead. Relations with the Empire slowly deteriorated, for no apparent reason. Taxes were raised and quotas increased with each passing year. Symmachus felt that the Emperor suspected him of having had a hand in the Staff's disappearance and sought to prove his loyalty by making every effort to comply with the escalating demands. He lengthened working hours and raised tariffs, and even made up some of the difference from both the royal exchequer and their own private holdings. But the levies multiplied, and commoners and nobles alike began to complain. It was an ominous rumble.\n\"I want you to take the children and journey to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;,\" Symmachus said at last in desperation one evening after dinner. \"You must make the Emperor listen, else all Mournhold will be up in revolt come spring.\" He grinned forcibly. \"You have a way with men, love. You always did.\"\nBarenziah forced a smile of her own. \"Even with you, I take it.\"\n\"Yes. Especially with me,\" he acknowledged amiably.\n\"Both children?\" Barenziah looked over toward a corner window, where Helseth was strumming a lute and crooning a duet with his little sister. Helseth was fifteen by then, Morgiah eight.\n\"They might soften his heart. Besides, it's high time Helseth was presented before the Imperial Court.\"\n\"Perhaps. But that's not your true reason.\" Barenziah took a deep breath and grasped the nettle. \"You don't think you can keep them safe here. If that's the case, then you're not safe here either. Come with us,\" she urged.\nHe took her hands in his. \"Barenziah. My love. Heart of my heart. If I leave now, there'll be nothing for us to return to. Don't worry about me. I'll be all right. Ai! I can take care of myself -- and I can do it better if I'm not worrying about you or the children.\"\nBarenziah laid her head against his chest. \"Just remember that we need you. I need you. We can do without the rest of it if we have each other. Empty hands and empty bellies are easier to bear than an empty heart.\" She started to cry, thinking of the Nightingale and that sordid business with the Staff. \"My foolishness has brought us to this pass.\"\nHe smiled at her tenderly. \"If so, 'tis not so bad a place to be.\" His eyes rested indulgently on their children. \"None of us shall ever go without, or want for anything. Ever. Ever, my love, I promise you. I cost you everything once, Barenziah, I and &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Ai. Without my aid the Empire would never have begun. I helped its rise.\" His voice hardened. \"I can bring about its fall. You may tell Uriel Septim that. That, and that my patience is not infinite.\"\nBarenziah gasped. Symmachus was not given to empty threats. She'd no more imagined that he would ever turn against the Empire than that the old house wolf lying by the grate would turn on her. \"How?\" she demanded breathlessly. But he shook his head.\n\"Better that you not know,\" he said. \"Just tell him what I told you should he prove recalcitrant, and do not fear. He's Septim enough that he will not take it out on the messenger.\" He smiled grimly. \"For if he does, if he ever harms the least hair on you, my love, or the children -- so help me all the gods of Tamriel, he'll pray that he hadn't been born. Ai. I'll hunt him down, him and his entire family. And I won't rest until the last Septim is dead.\" The red Dark Elven eyes of Symmachus gleamed brightly in the ebbing firelight. \"I plight you that oath, my love. My Queen ... my Barenziah.\"\nBarenziah held him, held him as tight as she could. But in spite of the warmth in his embrace, she couldn't help shivering.\nBarenziah stood before the Emperor's throne, trying to explain Mournhold's straits. She'd waited weeks for an audience with Uriel Septim, having been fobbed off on this pretext or that. \"His Majesty is indisposed.\" \"An urgent matter demands His Excellency's attention.\" \"I am sorry, Your Highness, there must be some mistake. Your appointment is for next week. No, see...\" And now it wasn't even going well. The Emperor did not even make the slightest pretense at listening to her. He hadn't invited her to sit, nor had he dismissed the children. Helseth stood still as a carven image, but little Morgiah had begun to fuss.\nThe state of her own mind didn't help her any. Shortly upon arrival at her lodgings, the Mournholdian ambassador to the Imperial City had demanded entry, bringing with him a sheaf of dispatches from Symmachus. Bad news, and plenty of it. The revolt had finally begun. The peasants had organized around a few disgruntled members of Mournhold's minor nobility, and were demanding Symmachus step down and hand over the reins of government. Only the Imperial Guard and a handful of troops whose families had been retainers of Barenziah's house for generations stood between Symmachus and the rabble. Hostilities had already broken out, but apparently Symmachus was safe and still in control. Not for long, he wrote. He entreated Barenziah to try her best with the Emperor -- but in any case she was to stay in the Imperial City until he wrote to tell her it was safe to go back home with the children.\nShe had tried to barge her way through the Imperial bureaucracy -- with little success. And to add to her growing panic, all news from Mournhold had come to a sudden stop. Tottering between rage at the Emperor's numerous major-domos and fear of the fate awaiting her and her family, the weeks had passed by tensely, agonizingly, remorselessly. Then one day the Mournholdian ambassador came calling to tell her she should expect news from Symmachus the following night at the latest, not through the regular channels but by nighthawk. Seemingly by the same stroke of luck, she was informed that same day by a clerk from the Imperial Court that Uriel Septim had finally consented to grant her an audience early on the morrow.\nThe Emperor had greeted the three of them when they came into the audience chamber with a too-bright smile of welcome that nonetheless didn't reach his eyes. Then, as she presented her children, he had gazed at them with a fixed attention that was real yet somehow inappropriate. Barenziah had been dealing with humans for nearly five hundred years now, and had developed the skill of reading their expressions and movements that was far beyond what any human could ever perceive. Try as the Emperor might to conceal it, there was hunger in his eyes -- and something else. Regret? Yes. Regret. But why? He had several fine children of his own. Why covet hers? And why look at her with such a vicious -- however brief -- yearning? Perhaps he had tired of his consort. Humans were notoriously, though predictably, inconstant. After that one long, burning glance, his gaze had shifted away as she began to speak of her mission and the violence that had erupted in Mournhold. He sat still as stone throughout her entire account.\nPuzzled at his inertia, and vexed no end, Barenziah stared into the pale, set face, looking for some trace of the Septims she'd known in the past. She didn't know Uriel Septim well, having met him once when he was still a child, and then again at his coronation twenty years later. Twice, that was all. He'd been a stern and dignified presence at the ceremony, even as a young adult -- yet not icily remote as this more mature man was. In fact, despite the physical resemblance, he didn't seem to be the same man at all. Not the same, yet something about him was familiar to her, more familiar than it should be, some trick of posture or gesture...\nSuddenly she felt very hot, as if lava had been poured over her. Illusion! She had studied the &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;arts of illusion&lt;/a&gt; well since the Nightingale had deceived her so badly. She had learned to detect it -- and she felt it now, as certainly as a blind man could feel the sun on his face. Illusion! But why? Her mind worked furiously even as her mouth went on reciting details about Mournhold's troubles. Vanity? Humans were oft as ashamed at the signs of aging as Elves were proud to exhibit them. Yet the face Uriel Septim wore seemed consistent with his age.\nBarenziah dared use none of her own magic. Even petty nobles had means of detecting &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;, if not actually shielding themselves from its effects, within their own halls. The use of sorcery here would bring down the Emperor's wrath as surely as drawing a &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt; would.\n&lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuddenly she was brought to mind of the Nightingale. And then he was sitting before her. Then the vision changed, and it was Uriel Septim. He looked sad. Trapped. And then the vision faded once more, and another man sat in his place, like the Nightingale, and yet unlike. Pale skin, bloodshot eyes, Elven ears -- and about him a fierce glow of concentrated malice, an aura of eldritch energy -- a horrible, destructive shimmer. This man was capable of anything!\nAnd then once again she was looking into the face of Uriel Septim.\nHow could she be sure she wasn't imagining things? Perhaps her mind was playing tricks on her. She felt a sudden vast weariness, as if she'd been carrying a heavy burden too long and too far. She decided to abandon her earnest narrative of Mournhold's ills -- as it was quite plainly getting her nowhere -- and switch back to pleasantry. Pleasantry, however, with a hidden agenda.\n\"Do you remember, Sire, Symmachus and I had dinner with your family shortly after your father's coronation? You were no older than tiny Morgiah here. We were greatly honored to be the only guests that evening -- except for your best friend &lt;a href=\"Justin\"&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt;, of course.\"\n\"Ah yes,\" the Emperor said, smiling cautiously. Very cautiously. \"I do believe I recall that.\"\n\"You and Justin were such friends, Your Majesty. I was told he died not long after. A great pity.\"\n\"Indeed. I still do not like to speak of him.\" His eyes turned blank -- or blanker, if it had been possible. \"As for your request, Milady, we shall take it under advisement and let you know.\"\nBarenziah bowed, as did the children. A nod from the Emperor dismissed them, and they backed away from the imperial presence.\nShe took a deep breath when they emerged from the throne room. \"Justin\" had been an imaginary playmate, although young Uriel had insisted a place be set for Justin at every meal. Not only that, Justin, despite the boyish name, had been a girl! Symmachus had kept up the joke long after she had gone the way of imaginary childhood friends -- inquiring after Justin's health whenever he and Uriel Septim met, and being responded to in as mock-serious a fashion. The last Barenziah had heard of Justin, several years ago, the Emperor had evidently joked elaborately to Symmachus that she had met an adventurous though incorrigible Khajiit youth, married him, and settled down in to raise fire ferns and mugworts.\nThe man sitting on the Emperor's divan was not Uriel Septim! The Nightingale? Could it be...? Yes. Yes! A chord of recognition rang through her and Barenziah knew she was right. It was him. It was! The Nightingale! Masquerading as the Emperor! Symmachus had been wrong, so wrong...\nWhat now? she wondered frantically. What had become of Uriel Septim -- and more to the point, what did it mean for her and Symmachus, and all of Mournhold? Thinking back, Barenziah guessed that their troubles were due to this false Emperor, this Nightingale-spawned glamour -- or whatever he really was. He must have taken Uriel Septim's place shortly before the unreasonable demands on Mournhold had begun. That would explain why relations had deteriorated for so long (as humans reckoned time), long after her disapproved liaison with Tiber Septim. The Nightingale knew of Symmachus' famed loyalty to, and knowledge of, the Septim House, and was effecting a pre-emptive strike. If that were the case, they were all in terrible danger. She and the children were in his power here in the Imperial City, and Symmachus was left alone to deal with troubles of the Nightingale's brewing in Mournhold.\nWhat must she do? Barenziah impelled the children ahead of her, a hand on each shoulder, trying to stay cool, collected, her ladies-in-waiting and personal knights escort trailing behind. Finally they reached their waiting carriage. Even though their suite of rooms was only a few blocks from the Palace, royal dignity forbade travel on foot for even short distances -- and for once, Barenziah was glad of it. The carriage seemed a kind of refuge now, false as she knew the feeling must be.\nA boy dashed up to one of the guards and handed him a scroll, then pointed toward the carriage. The guard brought it to her. The boy waited, eyes wide and shining. The epistle was brief and complimentary, and simply inquired if King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, of the Province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, might be granted an audience with the famed Queen Barenziah of Mournhold, as he had heard much of her and would be pleased to make her acquaintance.\nBarenziah's first impulse was to refuse. She wanted only to leave this city! Certainly she had no inclination toward any dalliance with a dazzled human. She looked up, frowning, and one of the guards said, \"Milady, the boy says his master awaits your reply yonder.\" She looked in the direction indicated and saw a handsome elderly man on horseback, surrounded by a half dozen courtiers and cavaliers. He caught her eye and bowed respectfully, taking off a plumed hat.\n\"Very well,\" Barenziah said to the boy on impulse. \"Tell your master he may call on me tonight, after the dinner hour.\" King Eadwyre looked polite and grave, and rather worried -- but not in the least lovestruck. At least that was something, she thought pensively.\nBarenziah stood at the tower window, waiting. She could sense the familiar's nearness. But though the night sky was clear as day to her eyes, she could not yet see him. Then suddenly he was there, a swift moving dot beneath the wispy night clouds. A few more minutes and the great nighthawk finished its descent, wings folding, talons reaching for her thick leather armband.\nShe carried the bird to its perch, where it waited, panting, as her impatient fingers felt for the message secured in a capsule on one leg. The hawk drank mightily from the water till when she had done, then ruffled its feathers and preened, secure in her presence. A tiny part of her consciousness shared its satisfaction at a job well done, mission accomplished, and rest earned ... yet beneath it all was unease. Things were not right, even to its humble avian mind.\nHer fingers shook as she unfolded the thin parchment and pored over the cramped writing. Not Symmachus' bold hand! Barenziah sat slowly, fingers smoothing the document while she prepared her mind and body to accept disaster calmly, if disaster it would be.\nDisaster it was.\nThe Imperial Guard had deserted Symmachus and joined the rebels. Symmachus was dead. The remaining loyal troops had suffered a decisive defeat. Symmachus was dead. The rebel leader had been recognized as King of Mournhold by Imperial envoys. Symmachus was dead. Barenziah and the children had been declared traitors to the Empire and a price set on their heads.\nSymmachus was dead.\nSo the audience with the Emperor earlier that morning had been nothing but a blind, a ruse. A charade. The Emperor must have already known. She was just being strung along, told to stay put, take things easy, Milady Queen, enjoy the Imperial City and the delights it has to offer, do make your stay as long as you want. Her stay? Her detention. Her captivity. And in all probability, her impending arrest. She had no delusions about her situation. She knew the Emperor and his minions would never let her leave the Imperial City, ever again. At least, not alive.\nSymmachus was dead.\n\"Milady?\"\nBarenziah jumped, startled by the servant's approach. \"What is it?\"\n\"The Breton is here, Milady. King Eadwyre,\" the woman added helpfully, noting Barenziah's incomprehension. She hesitated. \"Is there news, Milady?\" she said, nodding toward the nighthawk.\n\"Nothing that will not wait,\" Barenziah said quickly, and her voice seemed to echo in the emptiness that suddenly yawned like a gaping abyss inside her. \"See to the bird.\" She stood up, smoothed her gown, and prepared to attend on her royal visitor.\nShe felt numb. Numb as the stone walls around her, numb as the quiescence of the night air... numb as a lifeless corpse.\nSymmachus was dead!\nKing Eadwyre greeted her gravely and courteously, if a bit fulsomely. He claimed to be a fervent admirer of Symmachus, who figured prominently in his family's legends. Gradually he turned the conversation to her business with the Emperor. He inquired after details, and asked if the outcome had been favorable to Mournhold. Finding her noncommittal, he suddenly blurted out, \"Milady Queen, you must believe me. The man who claims himself the Emperor is an impostor! I know it sounds mad, but I -- \"\n\"No,\" Barenziah said, with sudden decisiveness. \"You are entirely correct, Milord King. I know.\"\nEadwyre relaxed into his seat for the first time, eyes suddenly shrewd. \"You know? You're not just humoring someone you might think a madman?\"\n\"I assure you, Milord, I am not.\" She took a deep breath. \"And who do you surmise is dissembling as the Emperor?\"\n\"The Imperial Battlemage, Jagar Tharn.\"\n\"Ah. Milord King, have you, perchance, heard of someone called the Nightingale?\"\n\"Yes, Milady, as a matter of fact I have. My allies and I believe him to be one and the same man as the renegade Tharn.\"\n\"I knew it!\" Barenziah stood up and tried to mask her upheaval. The Nightingale -- Jagar Tharn! Oh, but the man was a demon! Diabolical and insidious. And so very clever. He had contrived their downfall seamlessly, perfectly! Symmachus, my Symmachus...!\nEadwyre coughed diffidently. \"Milady, I... we... we need your aid.\"\nBarenziah smiled grimly at the irony. \"I do believe I should be the one saying those words. But go on, please. Of what assistance might I be, Milord King?\"\nQuickly the monarch outlined a plot. The mage &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;, of late apprenticed to the vile Jagar Tharn, had been killed and declared a traitor by the false Emperor. Yet she had retained a bit of her powers and could still contact a few of those she had known well on the mortal plane. She had chosen a &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; who would undertake to find the Staff of Chaos, which had been hidden by the traitorous sorcerer in an unknown site. This Champion was to wield the Staff's power to destroy Jagar Tharn, who was otherwise invulnerable, and rescue the true Emperor being held prisoner in another dimension. However, the Champion, while thankfully still alive, now languished in the Imperial Dungeons. Tharn's attention must be diverted while the chosen one gained freedom with Ria's spirit's help. Barenziah had the false Emperor's ears -- and seemingly his eyes. Would she provide the necessary distraction?\n\"I suppose I could obtain another audience with him,\" Barenziah said carefully. \"But would that be sufficient? I must tell you that my children and I have just recently been declared traitors to the Empire.\"\n\"In Mournhold, perhaps, Milady, and Morrowind. Things are different in the Imperial City and the Imperial Province. The same administrative morass that makes it near impossible to obtain an audience with the Emperor and his ministers also quite assures that you would never be unlawfully imprisoned or otherwise punished without benefit of due legal process. In your case, Milady, and your children's, the situation is further exacerbated by your royal rank. As Queen and heirs apparent, your persons are considered inviolable -- sacrosanct, in fact.\" The King grinned. \"The Imperial bureaucracy, Milady, is a double-edged claymore.\"\nSo. At least she and the children were safe for the time being. Then a thought struck her. \"Milord King, what did you mean earlier when you said I had the false Emperor's eyes? And seemingly, at that?\"\nEadwyre looked uncomfortable. \"It was whispered among the servants that Jagar Tharn kept your likeness in a sort of shrine in his chambers.\"\n\"I see.\" Her thoughts wandered momentarily to that insane romance of hers with the Nightingale. She had been madly in love with him. Foolish woman. And the man she had once loved had caused to be killed the man she truly did love. Did love. Loved. He's gone now, he's... he... She still couldn't bring herself to accept the fact that Symmachus was dead. But even if he is, she told herself firmly, my love is alive, and remains. He would always be with her. As would the pain. The pain of living the rest of her life without him. The pain of trying to survive each day, each night, without his presence, his comfort, his love. The pain of knowing he would never see his children grow into a fine pair of adults, who would never know their father, how brave he was, how strong, how wonderful, how loving... especially little Morgiah.\nAnd for that, for all that, for all you have done to my family, Nightingale -- you must die.\n\"Does that surprise you?\"\nEadwyre's words broke into her thoughts. \"What? Does what surprise me?\"\n\"Your likeness. In Tharn's room.\"\n\"Oh.\" Her features set imperturbably. \"Yes. And no.\"\nEadwyre could see from her expression that she wished to change the subject. He turned once again to their plans. \"Our chosen one may need a few days to escape, Milady. Can you gain him a bit more time?\"\n\"You trust me in this, Milord King? Why?\"\n\"We are desperate, Milady. We have no choice. But even if we did -- why, yes. Yes, I would trust you. I do trust you. Your husband has been good to my family over the years. The Lord Symmachus--\"\n\"Is dead.\"\n\"What?\"\nBarenziah related the recent events quickly and coolly.\n\"Milady... Queen... but how dreadful! I... I'm so sorry...\"\nFor the first time Barenziah's glacial poise was shaken. In the face of sympathy, she felt her outward calm start to crumble. She gathered her composure, and willed herself to stillness.\n\"Under the circumstances, Milady, we can hardly ask--\"\n\"Nay, good Milord. Under the circumstances I must do what I may to avenge myself upon the murderer of my children's father.\" A single tear escaped the fortress of her eyes. She brushed it away impatiently. \"In return I ask only that you protect my orphaned children as you may.\"\nEadwyre drew himself up. His eyes shone. \"Willingly do I so pledge, most brave and noble Queen. The gods of our beloved land, indeed Tamriel itself, be my witnesses.\"\nHis words touched her absurdly, yet profoundly. \"I thank you from my heart and my soul, good Milord King Eadwyre. You have mine and m-my children's e-everlasting g-gra -- grati -- \"\nShe broke down.\nShe did not sleep that night, but sat in a chair beside her bed, hands folded in her lap, thinking deep and long into the waxing and waning of the darkness. She would not tell the children -- not yet, not until she must.\nShe had no need to seek another audience with the Emperor. A summons arrived at first light.\nShe told the children she expected to be gone a few days, bade them give the servants no trouble, and kissed them good-bye. Morgiah whimpered a bit; she was bored and lonely in the Imperial City. Helseth looked dour but said nothing. He was very like his father. His father...\nAt the Imperial Palace, Barenziah was escorted not into the great audience hall but to a small parlour where the Emperor sat at a solitary breakfast. He nodded a greeting and waved his hand toward the window. \"Magnificent view, isn't it?\"\nBarenziah stared out over the towers of the great city. It dawned on her that this was the very chamber where she'd first met Tiber Septim all those years ago. Centuries ago. Tiber Septim. Another man she had loved. Who else had she loved? Symmachus, Tiber Septim... and Straw. She remembered the big blond stable-boy with sudden and intense affection. She never realized it till now, but she had loved Straw. Only she had never let him know. She had been so young then, those had been carefree days, halcyon days... before everything, before all this... before... him. Not Symmachus. The Nightingale. She was shocked in spite of herself. The man could still affect her. Even now. Even after all that had happened. A strong wave of inchoate emotion swept over her.\nWhen she turned back at last, Uriel Septim had vanished -- and the Nightingale sat in his place.\n\"You knew,\" he said quietly, scanning her face. \"You knew. Instantly. I wanted to surprise you. You might at least have pretended.\"\nBarenziah spread her arms, trying to pacify the maelstrom churning deep inside her. \"I'm afraid my skill at pretense is no match for yours, my liege.\"\nHe sighed. \"You're angry.\"\n\"Just a little, I must admit,\" she said icily. \"I don't know about you, but I find betrayal a trifle offensive.\"\n\"How human of you.\"\nShe took a deep breath. \"What do you want of me?\"\n\"Now you are pretending.\" He stood up to face her directly. \"You know what I want of you.\"\n\"You want to torment me. Go ahead. I'm in your power. But leave my children alone.\"\n\"No, no, no. I don't want that at all, Barenziah.\" He came near, speaking low in the old caressing voice that had sent shivers cascading through her body. The same voice that was doing the same thing to her, here and now. \"Don't you see? This was the only way.\" His hands closed on her arms.\nShe felt her resolve fading, her disgust at him weakening. \"You could have taken me with you.\" Unbidden tears gathered in her eyes.\nHe shook his head. \"I didn't have the power. Ah, but now, now...! I have it all. Mine to have, mine to share, mine to give -- to you.\" He once more waved his hand toward the window and the city beyond. \"All Tamriel is mine to lay at your feet -- and that is only the beginning.\"\n\"It's too late. Too late. You left me to him.\"\n\"He's dead. The peasant's dead. A scant few years -- what do they matter?\"\n\"The children--\"\n\"Can be adopted by me. And we'll have others together, Barenziah. Oh, and what children they'll be! What things we shall pass on to them! Your beauty, and my magic. I have powers you haven't even dreamt of, not in your most untamed imaginings!\" He moved to kiss her.\nShe slipped his grasp and turned away. \"I don't believe you.\"\n\"You do, you know. You're still angry, that's all.\" He smiled. But it didn't reach his eyes. \"Tell me what you want, Barenziah. Barenziah my beloved. Tell me. It shall be yours.\"\nHer whole life flashed in front of her. The past, the present, and the future still to come. Different times, different lives, different Barenziahs. Which one was the real one? Which one was the real Barenziah? For by that choice she would determine the shape of her fate.\nShe made it. She knew. She knew who the real Barenziah was, and what she wanted.\n\"A walk in the garden, my liege,\" she said. \"A song or two, perhaps.\"\nThe Nightingale laughed. \"You want to be courted.\"\n\"And why not? You do it so well. It's been long, besides, since I've had the pleasure.\"\nHe smiled. \"As you wish, Milady Queen Barenziah. Your wish is my command.\" He took her hand and kissed it. \"Now, and forever.\"\nAnd so they spent their days in courtship -- walking, talking, singing and laughing together, while the Empire's business was left to subordinates.\n\"I'd like to see the Staff,\" Barenziah said idly one day. \"I only had a glimpse of it, you'll recall.\"\nHe frowned. \"Nothing would give me greater pleasure, heart's delight -- but that would be impossible.\"\n\"You don't trust me,\" Barenziah pouted, but softened her lips when he leaned over for a kiss.\n\"Nonsense, love. Of course I do. But it isn't here.\" He chuckled. \"In fact, it isn't anywhere.\" He kissed her again, more passionately this time.\n\"You're talking in riddles again. I want to see it. You couldn't have destroyed it.\"\n\"Ah. You've gained in wisdom since last we met.\"\n\"You inspired my hunger for knowledge somewhat.\" She stood up. \"The Staff of Chaos can't be destroyed. And it can't be removed from Tamriel, not without the direst consequences to the land itself.\"\n\"Ahhh. You impress me, my love. All true. It is not destroyed, and it is not removed from Tamriel. And yet, as I said, it isn't anywhere. Can you solve the puzzle?\" He pulled her to him and she leaned into his embrace. \"Here's a greater riddle still,\" he whispered. \"How does one make one of two? That I can, and will, show you.\" Their bodies merged, limbs tangled together.\nLater, when they had drawn a bit apart and he lay dozing, she thought sleepily, \"One of two, two of one, three of two, two of three... what cannot be destroyed or banished might be split apart, perhaps...\"\"\"\nShe stood up, eyes blazing. She started to smile.\nThe Nightingale kept a journal. He scribbled entries onto it every night after quick reports from underlings. It was locked in a bureau. But the lock was a simple one. She had, after all, been a member of the Thieves Guild in a past life... in another life... another Barenziah...\nOne morning Barenziah managed to sneak a quick look at it while he was occupied at his toilet. She discovered that the first piece of the Staff of Chaos was hidden in an ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarvish&lt;/a&gt; mine called &lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt; -- although its location was given only in the vaguest of terms. The diary was crammed with jotted events in an odd shorthand, and was very hard to decipher.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, she thought, in his hands and mine, and more perhaps -- and yet...\nFor all his exterior charm there was a cold emptiness where his heart should have been, a vacuum of which he was quite unaware, she thought. One could glimpse it now and then, when his eyes would go blank and hard. And yet, though he had a different concept of it, he yearned for happiness too, and contentment. Peasant dreams, Barenziah thought, and Straw flashed before her eyes again, looking lost and sad. And then Therris, with a feline Khajiit smile. Tiber Septim, powerful and lonely. Symmachus, solid, stolid Symmachus, who did what ought to be done, quietly and efficiently. The Nightingale. The Nightingale, a riddle and a certainty, both the darkness and the light. The Nightingale, who would rule all, and more -- and spread chaos in the name of order.\nBarenziah got reluctant leave from him to visit her children, who had yet to be told of their father's death -- and of the Emperor's offer of protection. She finally did, and it wasn't easy. Morgiah clung to her for what seemed an era, sobbing wretchedly, while Helseth ran off into the garden to be alone, afterward refusing all her attempts to speak to him on the subject of his father, or even to let her hold him to her breast.\nEadwyre called on her while she was there. She told him what she had discovered so far, explaining that she must remain awhile yet and learn more as she could.\nThe Nightingale teased her about her elderly admirer. He was quite aware of Eadwyre's suspicion -- but he wasn't the least bit perturbed, for no one took the old fool seriously. Barenziah even managed to arrange a reconciliation of sorts between them. Eadwyre publicly recanted his misgivings, and his \"old friend\" the Emperor forgave him. He was afterward invited to dine with them at least once a week.\nThe children liked Eadwyre, even Helseth, who disapproved of his mother's liaison with the Emperor and consequently detested him. He had become surly and temperamental as the days passed, and frequently quarreled with both his mother and her lover. Eadwyre was not happy with the affair either, and the Nightingale took great delight at times in openly displaying his affection for Barenziah just to nettle the old man.\nThey could not marry, of course, for Uriel Septim was already married. At least, not yet. The Nightingale had exiled the Empress shortly after taking the Emperor's place, but had not dared harm her. She was given sanctuary by the Temple of the One. It had been given out that she was suffering from ill health, and rumors had been circulated by the Nightingale's agents that she had mental problems. The Emperor's children had likewise been dispatched to various prisons all across Tamriel disguised as \"schools.\"\n\"She'll grow worse in time,\" Nightingale said carelessly, referring to the Empress and eyeing Barenziah's swollen breasts and swelling belly with satisfaction. \"As for their children... Well, life is full of hazards, isn't it? We'll be married. Your child will be my true heir.\"\nHe did want the child. Barenziah was sure of that. She was far less sure, however, of his feelings for her. They argued continually now, often violently, usually about Helseth, whom he wanted to send away to school in Summurset Isle, the province farthest from the Imperial City. Barenziah made no effort to avoid these altercations. The Nightingale, after all, had no interest in a smooth, unruffled life; and besides, he thoroughly enjoyed making up afterward...\nOccasionally Barenziah would take the children and retreat to their old apartment, declaring she wanted no more to do with him. But he would always come to fetch her back, and she would always let herself be fetched back. It was ineffable, like the rising and setting of Tamriel's twin moons.\nShe was six months pregnant before she finally deciphered the location of the last Staff piece -- an easy one, since every Dark Elf knew where the Mount of Dagoth-Ur was.\nWhen she next quarreled with the Nightingale, she simply left the city with Eadwyre and rode hard for High Rock, and Wayrest. The Nightingale was furious, but there was little he could do. His assassins were rather inept, and he dared not leave his seat of power to pursue them in person. Nor could he openly declare war on Wayrest. He had no legitimate claim on her or her unborn child. True to form, the Imperial City's nobility had disapproved of his liaison with Barenziah -- as they had so many years ago of Tiber Septim's -- and were glad to see her go.\nWayrest was equally distrustful of her, but Eadwyre was fanatically loved by his prosperous little city-state, and allowances were readily made for his... eccentricities. Barenziah and Eadwyre were married a year after the birth of her son by the Nightingale. In spite of this unfortunate fact, Eadwyre doted on her and her children. She in her turn did not love him -- but she was fond of him, and that was something. It was nice to have someone, and Wayrest was a very good place, a good place for children to grow up, while they waited, and bided their time, and prayed for the Champion's success in his mission.\nBarenziah could only hope that he wouldn't take very long, whoever this unnamed Champion was. She was a Dark Elf, and she had all the time in the world. All the time. But no more love left to give, and no more hatred left to burn. She had nothing left, nothing but pain, and memories... and her children. She only wanted to raise her family, and provide them a good life, and be left to live out what remained of hers. She had no doubt it was going to be a long life yet. And during it she wanted peace, and quiet, and serenity, of her soul as well as of her heart. Peasant dreams. That was what she wanted. That was what the real Barenziah wanted. That was what the real Barenziah was. Peasant dreams.\nPleasant dreams."}

He was a miner, as was his father before him, a common laborer in the king's mines, for his &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; ability was but small. The work was honorable, but poorly paid. His mother made and sold small wildenberry cakes in the market to help make out their living. They did well enough, his mother said. They had enough to fill their bellies, no one could wear more than one suit of clothing at a time and the roof only leaked when it rained. &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt; would have liked more. He hoped for a lucky strike in the mines, which would garner him a large bonus. In his free hours he enjoyed hoisting a glass of &lt;a href=\"ale\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt; in the tavern with his friends, and gambling with them at cards, and he drew the eyes and sighs of more than one pretty &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; girl, although none held his interest for long. In short, Symmachus was a typical young &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;dark elf man&lt;/a&gt;, remarkable only for his size. It was rumored that he had a bit of &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; blood in him.\nIn Symmachus' thirtieth year there was great rejoicing in Mournhold for a girl child was born to their lord and his lady. A queen, the people sang, a queen is born to us! For among the people of Mournhold, the birth of a female heir is a sure sign of peace and prosperity to come.\nWhen the time came for royal child's &lt;a href=\"Rite%20of%20Naming\"&gt;Rite of Naming&lt;/a&gt;, the mines were closed and Symmachus rushed home to bathe and dress in his best.\n\"I'll come straight home and tell you all about it,\" he promised his mother, who was not to attend. She had been ailing; besides, there would be a great crush of people as all Mournhold would be there, and being blind she would be unable to see anything anyway.\n\"My son,\" she said. \"Go, fetch me a priest or healer, else I may pass from the mortal plane when you return.\"\nSymmachus crossed to her bed at once and noted anxiously that her head was very hot and her breathing shallow. He pried up the loose floorboard where their small hoard of savings was kept. There wasn't nearly enough to pay a priest for healing. He would have to give what they had and owe the rest. Symmachus snatched up his cloak and rushed away. The streets were full of folk hurrying to the sacred grove, but the mage guild and the temples were locked and barred. \"Closed for the ceremony\" read the signs. Symmachus elbowed his way through the crowd and managed to overtake a brown-robed monk.\n\"After the rite, brother,\" the monk said, \"if you have gold I shall gladly to attend your mother. My lord has bade all clerics to attend and I shall not offend him.\"\n\"My mother's desperately ill,\" Symmachus pled. \"Surely, my lord will not miss just one lowly monk.\"\n\"The father abbot will,\" the monk said nervously, tearing his robe loose from Symmachus' grip and vanishing into the crowd.\nSymmachus tried other monks and mages, too, but with no better result. Armored guards came through the street and pushed him aside with their lances and Symmachus realized that the royal procession was approaching. As the royal carriage drew abreast, Symmachus rushed out from the crowd and shouted, \"My lord, my mother's dying--\"\n\"I forbid her to do so on this glorious night!\" the lord shouted, laughing and scattering coin into the throng. Symmachus was close enough to smell wine on the royal breath. On the other side of the carriage his lady clutched her babe to her breast, and stared wide-eyed at Symmachus, her nostrils flared in disdain.\n\"Guards!\" she cried. \"Remove this oaf.\" Rough hands seized Symmachus. He was beaten and left dazed by the side of the road.\nSymmachus, head aching, followed in the wake of the crowd and watched the Rite of Naming from the top of the hill. He could see the brown robed clerics and blue robed mages gathered near the royal folk far below.\n&lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;. The name came dim to Symmachus ears as the High Priest lifted the naked babe and showed her to the twin moons on either side of the horizon: &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; rising, &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; setting. \"Behold the Lady Barenziah, born to the rule of Mournhold! Grant her thy blessings and thy counsel ever that she rule to Mournhold's weal.\"\n\"Blessings, blessings...\" all the people murmured with their lord and lady, hands upraised. Only Symmachus stood silent, head bowed, knowing in his heart that his dear mother was gone. And in his silence he swore a mighty oath, that he should be his lord's bane and in vengeance for his mother's needless death, the child Barenziah he would have as his own bride, that his mother's grandchildren should be born to rule Mournhold.\nAfter the ceremony he watched impassively as the royal procession returned to the palace. He saw the monk to whom he'd spoken first. The man came gladly enough now in return for the gold Symmachus had and a promise of more later.\nThey found his mother dead, as he had feared. The monk sighed and tucked the bag away. \"I'm sorry, brother. Well, you can forget the rest of the gold, as there's naught I can do here. Likely--\"\n\"Give me back my gold!\" Symmachus snarled. \"You've done naught to earn it!\" He lifted his right arm threateningly. The priest backed away, beginning a curse, but Symmachus struck him before more than three words had left his mouth. He went down heavily, striking his head sharply on one of the stones that formed the firepit. He died instantly.\nSymmachus took the gold back and fled the city, muttering the name \"Barenziah\".\nPart 2.\nThe child Barenziah stood on the upper balcony of the palace, staring down into the courtyard where soldiers milled, splendid in their armor. Presently they formed into ordered ranks and cheered as her parents, the lord and lady emerged from the palace, clad head to toe in ebony armor, long purple-dyed fur cloaks flowing behind. Splendidly caparisoned shining black horses were brought for them and they mounted and rode to the courtyard gates, then turned to salute her.\n\"Barenziah!\" they cried. \"Barenziah, farewell!\"\nThe little girl blinked back tears and waved bravely with one hand, her favorite stuffed toy animal, a gray wolf cub she called Wuffen, clutched to her breast with the other. She had never been parted from her parents before and had no idea what it meant, save that there was war in the west and the names &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and Symmachus were on everyone's lips, spoken with hate and dread.\n\"Barenziah!\" The soldiers cried, lifting their lances and swords and bows. Then her dear parents turned and rode away, soldiers trailing in their wake until the palace was near emptied.\nSome time after came a day when Barenziah was shaken awake by her nurse, dressed hurriedly and carried from the palace. All she remembered of that dreadful time was seeing a huge shadow with burning eyes that filled the sky.\nShe was passed from hand to hand. Foreign soldiers appeared. Her nurse vanished and was replaced by strangers, some more strange than others. There were days, or was it weeks?, of travel. One morning she woke to step from the coach into a cold place with a large gray stone house set amid endless empty gray-green and hills patchily covered with gray-white snow. She clutched Wuffen to her breast with both hands and stood blinking and shivering in the gray dawn, feeling very small and very black in all this endless space gray-white space.\nA large gray-white woman was staring at her with dreadful bright blue eyes. \"She's very -- black, isn't she?\" the woman remarked to her companion, a brown skinned, black-haired woman named Hana who had been travelling with Barenziah for several days. \"I've never seen a dark elf before.\"\n\"I don't know much about them myself,\" Hana said. \"This one's got red hair and a temper to match, I can tell you that. Take care. She bites. And worse.\"\n\"I'll soon train her out of that,\" the other woman sniffed, \"And what's that filthy thing she's got? Ugh!\" The woman snatched Wuffen away and cast him into the fire blazing in the hearth. Barenziah shrieked and would have flung herself into the fire after him, but was forcibly restrained, despite her attempts to bite and claw her oppressors while poor Wuffen was reduced to a little heap of charred ash.\nPart 3.\nBarenziah grew like a weed transplanted to a &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; garden, a ward of Count Sven and his wife Lady Inga. Outwardly she thrived but there was a cold and empty place within.\n\"I've raised her as my own daughter,\" Lady Inga was wont to sigh when she sat gossiping with neighboring ladies come to visit, \"But she's a dark elf. What can you expect?\"\nBarenziah was not meant to overhear these words. At least she thought she was not. Her hearing was far keener than that of her Nord hosts. Other, less desirable dark elf traits included pilfering, lying and a little &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, just a small fire spell and a little &lt;a href=\"levitation\"&gt;levitation&lt;/a&gt;. And, as she grew older, a keen interest in boys and men, who could provide very pleasant sensations and, to her astonishment, gifts as well. Inga disapproved of this activity for reasons incomprehensible to Barenziah, so she was careful to keep it as secret as possible.\n\"She's wonderful with the children,\" Inga added, meaning her five sons, all younger than Barenziah. \"She'd never see them come to harm.\"\nA tutor was hired when Jonny was six and Barenziah eight, and she studied academic lessons along with him. She would have liked arms training as well, but the very idea of a girl training to arms scandalized Inga and Sven. Barenziah was given a bow and allowed to practice target shooting with the boys. She watched them at arms practice when she could, practiced with them when no grown folk were about, and knew she was as good or better than they.\n\"She's very proud, isn't she?\" the neighbor ladies would whisper, and Barenziah, pretending not to hear, would nod in agreement. She could not help but feel superior to the Count and Countess. There was something about them that encouraged this disdain in her.\nShe grew to learn that Sven and Inga were distant cousins of the last rulers of Darkmoon, and then she began to understand. They were poseurs, imposters, not rulers at all. At least, they were not raised to rule. This thought made her strangely furious at them, a good clean hatred detached from resentment. Barenziah came to see them as disgusting and corrupted insects who could be despised, but never feared.\nOnce a month a courier came from the emperor, bringing a small bag of gold for Inga and Sven and a large bag of dried mushrooms from Morrowind for Barenziah's consumption. She was always made presentable, as presentable as a skinny dark elf girl could be made to look in Inga's eyes, and summoned into the courier's presence for a brief interview. The same courier seldom came twice, but all looked her over rather as a farmer looks over a pig he's readying for market. In the spring of her sixteenth year Barenziah thought the courier looked as if she were at last ready for market.\nUpon reflection Barenziah decided that she did not wish to be marketed. The stable-boy, &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;, a big blond boy, clumsy, gentle, affectionate and rather simple, had been urging her to run off with him for some weeks. Barenziah stole the bag of gold the courier had left, took the mushrooms from the storeroom, dressed herself as a boy in some of twelve year old Timmy's casual clothing, and one fine spring night they took the two best horses and rode hard through the night toward &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest city of any size, which was where Straw wanted to go.\nBut &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; also lay east and it drew Barenziah as a lodestone does &lt;a href=\"iron\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;. In the morning they abandoned the horses at Barenziah's insistence. She knew they would be missed and tracked, and she hoped to throw pursuers off the trail. They continued afoot until late afternoon, keeping to side roads, then slept for several hours in an abandoned hut. They went on at dusk and came to the Whiterun city gates just before dawn.\nBarenziah had prepared a pass for Straw, stating an errand to a temple in the city for a local village lord. She herself sneaked over the wall with the help of her levitation spell. She had reasoned that by now the gate guards would have been alerted to look for a young dark elf and a Nord boy traveling together, but country boys like Straw were common enough. Alone and with papers, he would be unlikely to draw their attention.\nHer simple plan went smoothly. She met Straw at the temple, which was not far from the gate. She had been to Whiterun on a few previous occasions. Straw, however, had never been more than a few miles from Sven's estate, his birthplace. Together they made their way to a run-down inn in the poor quarter of Whiterun. Gloved, cloaked and hooded against the chill of the morning, her dark skin and red eyes were not apparent and no one paid any attention to them. They entered the inn separately. Sven paid the host for a single room, a large meal and a jug of ale, and Barenziah sneaked in a few minutes later. They ate and drank together gleefully, celebrating their escape, made love vigorously on the narrow bed, then fell into an exhausted sleep.\nThey stayed a week in Whiterun. Straw earned a bit of money running errands and Barenziah robbed a few houses at night. Barenziah continued to dress as a boy. She cut her hair short and dyed her flame-red tresses jet black as a further disguise, and kept out of sight as much as possible for there were few dark elves in Whiterun. Then Straw got them places as guards for a merchant caravan that was traveling east. The sergeant looked her over dubiously.\n\"Heh,\" he chuckled, \"dark elf, ain'tcha? Like setting a wolf to guard the sheep, that is. Still, I need arms, and we ain't going near enough to Morrowind that ye can betray us to yer brothers. Our home-grown bandits will as lief cut yer throat as mine.\"\nThe sergeant gave Straw an appraising look, then abruptly spun back to Barenziah, whipping out his short sword. But she had her knife out and was in a defensive stance. Straw drew his own knife and circled to the man's rear. The sergeant dropped his blade and chuckled again, \"Not bad, kids, not bad. How are ye with that bow, dark elf?\" Barenziah demonstrated her prowess. \"Aye, not bad, not bad a'tall. And ye'll be keen of eye by night and of hearing at all times. A trusty dark elf makes as good a fightin' man as any could ask for. I know. I served under Symmachus himself before I lost this arm and got invalided out of the Emperor's forces.\"\n\"We could betray them. I know folk who'd pay well,\" Straw said later, as they bedded down for their last night in the old inn, \"Or rob them ourselves. They're very rich, those merchants are, Berry.\"\nBarenziah chuckled, \"What ever would we do with so much money? And we need their protection for traveling quite as much as they need ours.\"\n\"We could buy a little farm and settle down.\"\nPeasant! Barenziah thought scornfully. Straw was a peasant and had peasant dreams. But all she said was, \"Not here, Straw, we're too close to Darkmoor still. We'll have more chances farther east.\"\nThe caravan went only as far east as Sunguard. Tiber Septim had done much in the way of building relatively safe patrolled highways, but his tolls were steep, and this particular caravan kept to the side roads as much as possible to avoid them. This exposed them to the hazards of robber barons, both &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt;, and roving bands of brigands of various races, but such were the perils of trade and profit.\nThey had two such encounters before reaching &lt;a href=\"Sunguard\"&gt;Sunguard&lt;/a&gt;, an ambush which Barenziah's keen ears detected in plenty of time for them to circle about and surprise the lurkers, and a night attack by a mixed band of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt;, humans and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;wood elves&lt;/a&gt;. The latter were a skilled band and even Barenziah did not hear them sneaking up in time to give much warning.\nThe fighting was fierce. The attackers were driven off, but two of the caravan's guards were killed, and Straw got a nasty cut on his thigh before he and Barenziah killed his Khajiit assailant.\nBarenziah rather enjoyed the life. The garrulous sergeant had taken a liking to her, and she spent most of her evenings sitting around a campfire listening to his tales of campaigning in Morrowind with Tiber Septim and Symmachus. Symmachus had been made a general after Mournhold fell, the sergeant said. \"He's a fine soldier, Symmachus is, but there was more than soldiery involved in Morrowind, if you take my drift. Well, you know about that, I expect.\"\n\"I don't remember,\" Barenziah said, \"I've mostly lived in Skyrim. My mother married a Skyrim man. They're both dead, though. What happened to the lord and lady of Mournhold?\"\nThe sergeant shrugged, \"I never heard. Dead, I expect. All Morrowind's under military rule now. It's pretty quiet. Maybe too quiet. Like a calm before a storm. You going back there?\"\n\"Maybe,\" Barenziah said. The truth was that she was drawn to Morrowind like a magnet. Straw sensed it and was unhappy about it. He was unhappy anyway, since they could not bed together, as she was supposed to be a boy. Barenziah rather missed it too, but not as much as Straw did, seemingly. The sergeant wanted them to sign on for the return trip, but gave them a bonus when they parted and letters of recommendation.\nStraw wanted to settle permanently near Sunguard, but Barenziah insisted on continuing to travel east. \"I'm the queen of Mournhold by rights,\" she said, unsure whether it was true, or it was a story she had made up as a child. \"I want to go home. I need to go home.\"\nThat at least was true. She had run out of mushrooms and was very hungry for them. She found a few for sale in the Sunguard marketplace, but they were not as good or satisfying as the ones the courier had brought. After a few weeks they managed to get places in a caravan heading east.\nBy early winter, they were in &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, and near the Morrowind border, but the weather had grown severe and they were told no merchant caravans would set forth until mid-spring.\nBarenziah stood atop the city walls and stared across the deep gorge that separated Riften from the snow-clad mountain wall of Morrowind beyond. \"Berry,\" Straw said gently, \"Mournhold's a long way off yet, nearly as far as we've come already, and the lands between are wild, full of wolves and bandits and orcs and still worse creatures. We'll have to wait for spring.\"\n\"There's &lt;a href=\"Silgrod%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrod Tower&lt;/a&gt;,\" Berry said, referring to the Dark Elf town that had grown up around the ancient tower that guarded the border between Skyrim and Morrowind.\n\"The bridge guards won't let me across, Berry. They're crack &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; troops. They can't be bribed. If you go, you go alone. I won't try to stop you. But what will you do? Silgrod Tower is full of Imperial troops. Will you become a washerwoman for them? A camp follower?\"\n\"No,\" Barenziah said thoughtfully. Actually the idea was not entirely unappealing. She was sure that she could earn a modest living by sleeping with the soldiers for money. She'd had a few adventures of that sort as they crossed Skyrim, when she'd dressed as a woman and slipped away from Straw. She'd only been looking for a bit of variety. Straw was sweet but dull. She'd been startled, but pleased when the men she picked up offered her money afterwards.\nStraw had been unhappy about it though and would shout for awhile, then sulk for days afterwards if he caught her at it. He was very jealous. He'd even threatened to leave her.\nBut the Imperial Guards were a tough and brutal lot by all accounts and Barenziah had heard some very ugly stories during her travels. The ugliest stories had come from the lips of ex-veterans around the caravan campfire and were proudly recounted. They'd been trying to shock her and Straw, she realized, but she also realized that there was some truth behind the wild tales. Straw hated that kind of talk and hated having her hear it, but there was a part of him that was fascinated by it.\nBarenziah had encouraged Straw to seek out other women, but he said he didn't want anyone but her. She told him she didn't feel that way, but she did like him better than anyone else.\n\"Then why do you go with other men?\"\n\"I don't know, dear.\"\nStraw sighed. \"They say dark elf women are like that.\"\nBarenziah smiled and shrugged. \"I know. I guess that's all the explanation there is.\"\nPart 4.\nThey settled into Riften for the winter, taking a cheap room in the slums. Barenziah joined the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Thieves' Guild&lt;/a&gt;, knowing there would be trouble if she were caught free-lancing. One day in the barroom she caught the eye of a known member of the guild, a bold young Khajiit named &lt;a href=\"Therris\"&gt;Therris&lt;/a&gt;. She offered to bed with him if he would sponsor her for membership. He looked her over, grinning, and agreed, but said she'd still have to pass a test.\n\"What sort of test?\"\n\"Ah,\" Therris said. \"Payment first, sweet thing.\" He put an arm around her, leaned over and kissed her, thrusting his tongue deep into her mouth and his free hand into her shirt.\n\"Nice,\" he said presently, withdrawing his tongue, but not his hand. His other hand slid down inside her waistband and fondled her buttocks.\n\"Let's go upstairs. We can use my room,\" Barenziah felt both embarassed and excited by his boldness.\nTherris grinned insolently. \"Why bother? You want me, don't you? I'll bet you'd pay me, wouldn't you?\"\n\"No,\" Barenziah said. She did want him, but not that badly.\n\"No? Well, a bargain's a bargain and Therris keeps his word. But here. Now.\" He hiked her skirt up and pulled her onto his lap so she sat astride, facing him. He opened her shirt and pulled it down on her shoulders so that her breasts were exposed.\n\"Nice pair, kid.\" She was facing the wall but she could feel the stares of the other patrons. A hush had fallen over the place. Even the bard had stilled. She felt both nausea and a hot burning desire. Her hands released his turgid penis and then it was inside her and she was screaming in both pain and ecstasy. Then everything went black.\nWhen she came to herself again she was sitting beside Therris, who was buttoning her shirt. \"That hurt!\" she said indignantly.\n\"Always does, kid. Didn't anyone ever tell you about Khajiit men? It hurts good though, now doesn't it?\" Barenziah scowled at him. She was still smarting. His penis had tiny little barbs on it.\n\"Well, the deal's off, if you like,\" he shrugged.\n\"No, I didn't say that. Only I prefer privacy, and I want to wait awhile, like a day or so before the next time.\"\nTherris laughed. \"You're OK, kid.\"\nStraw was going to kill her, and maybe Therris too. What in Tamriel had possessed her to do such a thing? She cast an anxious look around the room, but the other patrons had lost interest and gone back to their own business. She did not recognize any of them; this wasn't the inn where she lived. With luck it'd be awhile, or never, before Straw found out. But Therris was by far the most exciting and attractive man she'd yet met.\nHe not only told her about the skills needed to be a member of the Thieves' Guild, but trained her in them himself or introduced her to people who could teach her. Among these was a Nord woman who knew something about magic. &lt;a href=\"Katisha\"&gt;Katisha&lt;/a&gt; was plump and matronly. She was married to a smith, had two teen aged children and was perfectly ordinary and respectable except that she was very fond of cats, had a gift for certain kinds of magic, and cultivated rather odd friends.\nShe taught Barenziah an &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell and trained her in other forms of stealth and disguise. Katisha mingled magical and non-magical talents freely, using one to enhance the other. She was not a member of the Thieves' Guild but was fond of Therris in a motherly sort of fashion.\nBarenziah warmed to her as she never had to any woman, and over the next few weeks she told Katisha all about herself. She brought Straw there, too. Straw approved of Katisha but not of Therris. Therris found Straw amusing and suggested to Barenziah that they arrange what he called a threesome.\n\"Indeed not,\" Barenziah said, grateful that Therris had broached the subject in private. \"He wouldn't like it. I wouldn't like it!\"\nTherris smiled his charming triangular cat-smile and sprawled lazily back in his chair, curling his tail. \"You might both be surprised. Pairing is so boring. Well, would you mind if I brought a friend?\"\n\"Yes. If you're bored with me you and your friend can find someone else.\" She was a member of the Thieves' Guild now. She found Therris useful but not essential. Maybe she was a bit bored with him, too.\nShe talked to Katisha about her men problems. Katisha shook her head and told her she was looking for love, not sex, that she'd know the right man when she found him, and that neither Straw nor Therris was the right one for her.\nBarenziah cocked her head to one side quizzically. \"They say dark elf women are pro- pro- something. Prostitutes?\"\n\"You mean promiscuous, although some do become prostitutes, I suppose. Elf women are promiscuous when they're young. You'll outgrow it. Perhaps you're beginning to already,\" Katisha said hopefully. \"You ought to meet some nice elven boys, though. If you keep on keeping company with Khajiits and humans you'll find yourself pregnant soon.\"\nBarenziah smiled involuntarily at the thought. \"I'd like that. But it would be inconvenient, wouldn't it? Babies are a lot of trouble, and I don't even have a home yet.\"\n\"How old are you? Seventeen? Well, you've a year or two yet before you'll be fertile, unless you're very unlucky. Elves don't have children readily with other elves even after that, so you'll be all right if you stick with them.\"\n\"Straw wants to buy a farm and marry me.\"\n\"Is that what you want?\"\n\"No. Not yet. Maybe some day, if I can't be a queen.\"\n\"I think Straw will be a very old man before \"some day\" comes, Berry. Elves live a very long time.\" Katisha's face briefly wore the wistful look humans got when contemplating the thousand year life span that elves were entitled to by nature. True, few ever actually lived that long, as disease and violence took a toll, but they could.\n\"I like old men, too,\" Berry said.\nPart 5.\nBarenziah fidgeted impatiently while Therris sorted through the papers in the desk. He was being meticulous and methodical, careful to replace everything just as he'd found it. They'd entered a nobleman's house, leaving Straw outside as a lookout. Therris had said it was a simple job but very secret. He hadn't even wanted to bring any other Guild members along. He said he knew he could trust Berry and Straw.\n\"Tell me what you're looking for and I'll find it,\" Berry whispered. Therris' night sight wasn't as good as hers and he didn't want to make a light. Berry had never been in such a luxurious place. She gazed around with wonder as they'd made their way through the huge echoing downstairs rooms, but Therris didn't seem interested in anything but the desk in the small book-lined study on the upper floor.\n\"Ssss't,\" he hissed angrily.\n\"Someone's coming!\" Berry said, a moment before the door opened and two dark figures appeared. Therris gave her a violent shove toward them and sprang away toward the window. Barenziah's muscles went rigid; she couldn't move or even speak. She watched helplessly as a dark figure leaped after Therris. There were two quick, silent blue flares of light, then Therris folded in a still heap. Outside the study the house had come alive with footsteps and voices calling and the clank of armor.\nThe big man, a dark elf, half lifted, half dragged Therris to the door and thrust him into waiting arms. A jerk of the elf's head sent his robed companion after him. The elf came over to inspect Barenziah, who was once again able to move, although her head throbbed maddeningly when she did so.\n\"Open your shirt, Barenziah,\" the elf said.\nBarenziah gaped at him and clutched it closed.\n\"You are a girl, aren't you, Berry?\" he said softly. \"You should have stopped dressing as a boy a few months ago, you know. You were only drawing attention to yourself. And calling yourself Berry! Is your friend Straw too stupid to remember anything else?\"\n\"It's a common elf name,\" Barenziah defended herself.\nThe man shook his head sadly. \"Not among dark elves it isn't, my dear, but you really don't know much about dark elves, do you? I regret that, but it couldn't be helped. No matter. I'll remedy it.\"\n\"Who are you?\" Barenziah demanded.\n\"So much for fame,\" the man shrugged, smiling wryly. \"I am Symmachus, my lady, and it's a merry chase you've led me, although I'd guessed you'd head for Morrowind. You had a bit of luck. A body was found in Whiterun that was thought to be Straw's so we stopped looking for the pair. That was careless of me, yet I'd not have thought you'd have stayed together this long.\"\n\"Where is he? Is he all right?\"\n\"Oh, he's fine for now. In custody, of course. You -- care for him, then?\" he stared at her with curiosity out of red eyes that were so strange to her, except in her own seldom-seen image.\n\"He's my friend,\" Barenziah said. The words came in a tone that sounded dull and hopeless in her own ears. Symmachus! A general in the Imperial Army, said to have the friendship and the ear of Tiber Septim himself.\n\"Ai. You seem to have several unsuitable friends, if you'll forgive my saying so, my lady.\" As they talked the bustle and flurry in the house had died away, although she could hear people, presumably the residents, whispering together not far off. The tall elf seated himself on a corner of the desk. He seemed quite relaxed and prepared to stay awhile.\nSeveral? \"W-what's going to happen to them? To me?\"\n\"Ah. As you know this house belongs to the commander of the Imperial troops in this area.\" Barenziah gasped and Symmachus looked up sharply. \"You didn't know? You are rash, even for seventeen. You must always know what it is you do.\"\n\"B-but the G-guild w-wouldn't -- \" Barenziah was trembling. The Thieves' Guild would never have attempted a mission that involved Imperial policies. No one dared oppose Tiber Septim, at least no one she knew of.\n\"I daresay. It's unlikely that Therris had Guild approval for this job. I wonder--\" Symmachus examined the desk carefully, pulling out its drawers. He selected one, placed its contents on the desk top and removed the false bottom. There was a folded sheet of paper inside. It seemed to be a map of some sort. Barenziah edged closer to see it. Symmachus held it away from her, laughing. \"Rash indeed!\" He glanced it over, then folded and replaced it.\n\"You advised me to seek knowledge.\"\n\"So I did, so I did.\" Suddenly he seemed to be in high good humor. \"We must be going, my dear lady.\"\nHe shepherded her to the door, down the stairs and out into the night air. No one was about. Barenziah's eyes darted to the shadows. She wondered if she could outrun him, or elude him somehow.\n\"You're not thinking of attempting to escape, are you? Don't you want to hear what my plans for you are first?\" He sounded a bit hurt.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Perhaps you'd rather hear about your friends first.\"\n\"No.\" He looked pleased. It was the answer he wanted, but it was also the truth. While Barenziah was concerned for her friends, especially Straw, she was far more concerned for herself.\n\"You will take your rightful place as Queen of Mournhold.\"\nHer heart leapt. It was really true then!\nSymamchus explained that this had been his, and Tiber Septim's plan for her all along. That Mournhold, which had been under military rule for the dozen years since she had left was to be returned, gradually, to civilian government, under Imperial guidance, of course, and as a part of the Imperial Province of Morrowind.\n\"But why was I sent to Darkmoor.\"\n\"For safekeeping. Why did you run away?\"\nBarenziah shrugged. \"I saw no reason to stay. I should have been told.\"\n\"You would have been by now. I had in fact sent for you to be removed to Imperial City to spend some time as a part of the Emperor's household. As for your destiny, it should have been obvious to you. Tiber Septim does not keep those he has no use for, and what else could you be that is of use to him?\"\n\"I know nothing of him or you.\"\n\"Then know this: Tiber Septim rewards friend and foe alike according to their deserts.\"\nBarenziah chewed on that for a few moments. \"Straw has deserved well of me and has never done anyone any harm. He is not a member of the Thieves' Guild. He came along to protect me. He earns our keep by running errands, and--\"\nSymmachus waved her to silence. \"I know all about Straw,\" he said, \"and about Therris. So? What would you?\"\n\"Straw wants a little farm. If I'm to be rich, then I would give that to him.\"\n\"Very well. He shall have it. And Therris?\"\n\"He betrayed me,\" Barenziah said in a low voice. Therris should have told her the risks the job entailed. Further, he'd pushed her right into their foes' arms in an attempt to save himself.\n\"Yes. And?\"\n\"Well, he should be made to suffer for it, shouldn't he?\"\n\"That seems reasonable. What form should the suffering take?\"\nBarenziah balled her hands into fists. She'd like to beat and claw at the Khajiit herself, but that didn't seem very queenly. \"A whipping. Would twenty stripes be too many do you think? I don't want to do him any permanent injury.\"\n\"I shall arrange it.\"\nBarenziah spent two days in Symmachus' apartment during which she was kept very busy. There was a dark elf woman named Drelliane who saw to their needs, although she did not seem to be exactly a servant as she took her meals with them. Nor was she his wife. Drelliane seemed amused when Barenziah asked her about that. She simply said she was in Symmachus' employ and did whatever he asked of her.\nWith Drelliane's assistance several fine gowns and pairs of shoes were ordered for her, plus a riding habit and boots, along with other small necessities. Barenziah was given a room to herself. Symmachus was out a great deal. She saw him at most meals, but he said little about himself or what he had been doing, although he was cordial and polite, was quite willing to converse on most subjects, and seemed interested in anything she had to say. Drelliane was much the same. Barenziah found them pleasant enough, but hard to get to know, as Katisha would have put it. She felt an odd disappointment. These were the first dark elves with whom she'd associated closely. She had expected to feel comfortable with them, to feel, at last, that this was where she belonged. Instead she found herself yearning for her Nord friends, Katisha and Straw. When Symmachus told her they were to set out for Imperial City on the morrow, she asked if she could say goodbye to her friends.\n\"Katisha?\" he asked. \"Well enough. I suppose I owe her something. She it was who led me to you by telling me of a lonely dark elf girl named Berry who need elven friends -- and sometimes dressed as a boy. She has no association with the Thieves' Guild. And no one associated with the Thieves' Guild seems to know your true identity, save Therris. That is well. I prefer that your former Guild membership not be made public knowledge. You will speak of it to no one. It does not become an Imperial queen.\"\n\"No one knows but Straw and Therris. They won't tell anyone.\"\n\"No, they won't.\" He didn't know that Katisha knew then!\nStraw came to their apartment the morning of their departure, and they were left alone in the parlor, although Barenziah knew that the other elves were well within hearing. Straw looked drawn and pale. They hugged one another silently for a few minutes. Straw's shoulders were shaking and tears were rolling down his cheeks, but he said nothing.\nBarenziah tried a smile. \"So we both get what we want. I'm to be Queen of Mournhold and you'll be king of your own farm. I'll write you. You must find a scribe so you can write me, too.\" Straw shook his head sadly, and when Barenziah persisted, he opened his mouth and pointed inside, making an inarticulate noise. His tongue was gone! Barenziah collapsed onto a chair and wept noisily.\n\"Why?\" she demanded of Symmachus, when Straw had been ushered away. \"Why?\"\nSymmachus shrugged. \"He knows too much of you. He could be dangerous. At least he's alive, and he won't need his tongue to farm.\"\n\"I hate you!\" Barenziah screamed at him, then leaned over and vomited on the floor. She continued to revile him between intermittent bouts of nausea. He listened stolidly for some time, while Drelliane cleaned up after her. Finally, he told her to cease or he would gag her for the journey.\nThey stopped at Katisha's house. Symmachus and Drelliane didn't dismount. All seemed normal but Barenziah was frightened as she knocked on the door. Katisha answered her knock. She'd obviously been weeping, but she embraced Barenziah.\n\"Why are you crying?\" Barenziah asked.\n\"For Therris, of course. You haven't heard? He's dead. He was caught stealing from the commandant's house. Poor fellow, but it was so foolish of him. Oh, Barenziah, he was drawn and quartered this very dawn by the commandant's order. I went; he asked for me. It was terrible; he suffered so before he died. I'll never forget it. I looked for you and Straw but no one knew where you'd got to. That's Symmachus you're with, isn't it? You know, the moment I saw him, I thought, this is the one for Barenziah! I told him about you, you know.\"\n\"Yes,\" Barenziah said. \"Katisha, I love you, but please don't ever tell anyone else anything about me. Ever. Swear you won't. Especially not Symmachus. And look after poor Straw for me.\" Katisha promised, puzzled but willing. \"Berry, it wasn't somehow because of me that Therris was caught? I never said anything about Therris to Symmachus.\"\nBarenziah assured her that it wasn't, that an informer had told of the Imperial Guard of Therris' plans, which was probably a lie, but Katisha badly needed some kind of comfort.\n\"Oh, I'm glad of that, if I can be glad of anything just now. I'd hate to think-- but how could I have known? And Symmachus is very handsome, don't you think? And charming.\"\n\"I don't know,\" Barenziah said. \"I haven't really thought about it. There hasn't been time.\" She explained about being Queen of Mournhold and going to live in Imperial City for awhile first. \"He was looking for me. I don't think he thinks of me as a woman at all. He said I didn't look like a boy, though,\" she added in the face of Katisha's incredulity. She knew that Barenziah evaluated every male she saw in terms of sexual desirability. \"I suppose it's the shock of finding out that I really am a queen,\" she added, and Katisha agreed that that must be something of a shock, although one there was no likelihood of her experiencing first hand.\nTheir party left Rifton by the great south gate. Once through Symmachus tapped her shoulder and pointed back to the gate. \"I thought you might want to say good-bye to Therris, too,\" he said. Barenziah stared briefly but steadily at the head impaled on a spike above the gate. The birds were at it, but the face was still recognizable.\n\"I think he will not hear me,\" she said. \"Let's be on our way, shall we?\"\nSymmachus was clearly disappointed by her lack of reaction. \"You heard of this from Katisha?\"\n\"Of course. She attended the execution.\" Barenziah said casually. If he didn't know already, he'd find out soon enough; she was sure of that.\n\"Did she know Therris belonged to the Guild?\"\n\"Everyone knew that. It's only lower ranking members like me who are supposed to keep their membership secret. The ranking officers are well known. But you know all that, don't you?\" She smiled archly at him.\n\"So you told her who you were and whence you'd come, but not about the Guild.\"\n\"The Guild membership was not my secret to tell. The other was. There is a difference. Besides, Katisha is a very honest person. Had I told her it would have lessened me in her eyes. She was always after Therris to take up a more honest line of work. I value her good opinion. She also thought I'd be happier if I'd settle down with just one man friend, one of my own race. You, in fact. Isn't it odd how wishes come true sometimes, but not the way you want them to?\"\n\"Yes. Very odd.\" Something about the way he said it made her think that she herself was one of his wishes that had come true in a way that wasn't altogether to his liking.\nPart 6.\nBarenziah felt the weight of sorrow for several days, but by the third day out her spirits had begun to rise a bit. She found that she enjoyed being on the road again, although she missed Straw's companionship more than she would have thought. They were escorted by a troop of Redguard knights, with whom she felt comfortable, although these were much more disciplined than the guards of the merchant caravans. They were cordial but respectful towards her despite her attempts to flirt with the men. Symmachus scolded her privately, saying a queen must maintain a royal dignity at all times.\n\"You mean I'm never to have any fun?\"\n\"Not with such as these. They are beneath you. Graciousness is to be desired in those in authority. Familiarity is not. You will remain chaste and modest while you are in Imperial City.\"\nBarenziah screwed up her face. \"I might as well be back in Black Moor. Elves are promiscuous by nature. Everyone says so.\"\n\"'Everyone' is wrong, then. Some are, some aren't. The emperor -- and I -- expect you to show both discrimination and discretion. Let me remind you that you will hold the throne of Mournhold not by right of blood but solely at the pleasure of Tiber Septim. If he judges you unsuitable your reign will end ere it begins. He requires intelligence, obedience, discretion and total loyalty in all his appointees, and he favors chastity and modesty in women. I suggest you model your deportment after Drelliane.\"\n\"I'd liefer be back in Black Moor,\" Barenziah said indignantly.\n\"That is not an option. If you are of no use to Tiber Septim he will see to it that you are of no use to his enemies either,\" Symmachus said coldly. \"If you would keep your head upon your shoulders take warning. Let me add that power offers pleasures other than those of carnality and low company.\" He spoke of art, literature, drama, music, and grand balls. Barenziah listened with interest spurred by his threats, but after asked if she might continue her study of spellcasting while in Imperial City. Symmachus seemed pleased and promised to arrange it. Pleased with this she then said that she noted that three of their knights were women, and asked if she might train a little in combat with them, just for the sake of exercise. Symmachus looked less than pleased, but agreed she might, although only with the women.\nThe late winter weather held fair but cold for their journey, so that they travelled quickly over firm roads. On the last day, spring seemed to come at last for there was a thaw, and the road grew sloppy underfoot, and everywhere one could faintly hear the sound of water trickling and dripping.\nThey came to the great bridge that crossed into Imperial City at sunset. The rosy glow turned all the stark white marble buildings a delicate pink. It all looked very new and grand and immaculate. A broad avenue led straight north to the Palace. There was a crowd of people of all sorts in the streets. Lights winked out in the shops and on in the inns as dusk fell and the stars came out one by one. Even the side streets were broad and brightly lit. Near the palace the towers of a grand Mage Guild reared to the east while westward the stained glass windows of a great temple glittered.\nSymmachus had an apartment in a great house two blocks from the palace, past the Temple, the Temple of the One, he said, as they passed it, an ancient Nordic cult which Tiber Septim had revived. He said that Barenziah would be expected to become a member, should she prove acceptable to the Emperor.\nSymmachus' apartment was very grand, although little to Barenziah's liking. The walls and furnishings were stark white, relieved only by touches of bright gold, the floors of gleaming black marble. Barenziah's eyes ached for color and shadow.\nIn the morning Symmachus and Drelliane escorted her to the Imperial Palace. Barenziah noted that everyone they met greeted Symmachus with a deferential respect which in some cases bordered on obsequiousness. He took it quite for granted. She and Symmachus were ushered directly into the Imperial presence.\nMorning sun flooded the small room through a large window with tiny panes, washing over the breakfast table and the single man who sat there, dark against the light. He leapt to his feet as they entered and hurried toward them, \"Ah, Symmachus, my friend, I welcome thy return most gladly.\" His hands touched Symmachus shoulders briefly, fondly, interrupting the deep bow the elf had begun. Barenziah curtsied as Tiber Septim turned to her.\n\"Barenziah, my naughty little runaway, how do you, child? Here, let me have a look at you. Why, Symmachus, she's charming, absolutely charming. Why have you hidden her from us all these years? Is the light too much? Shall I draw the hangings? Yes, of course.\" He waved aside Symmachus protests and drew the curtains himself, not troubling to summon a servant. \"You will pardon me for this discourtesy to my guests. I've much to think of, but that's scant excuse for inhospitality -- ah, pray join me. There's some excellent fruit from the Black Marsh.\"\nThey settled themselves at the table. Barenziah was astonished. Tiber Septim was nothing like the grim grey giant warrior she'd pictured. He was only of middle height, half a head shorter than tall Symmachus, although he was well knit of figure and lithe in movement. He had a winning smile, bright, indeed piercing, blue eyes, and a full head of stark white hair above a lined and weathered face. He might have been of any age from forty to sixty.\nHe pressed food and drink upon them, then repeated his question: why had she left her home? Had her guardians been unkind to her?\n\"No, excellency,\" Barenziah replied, \"in truth, no, although I fancied so at times.\" Symmachus had made up a lie for her and Barenziah told it, although with misgivings. The stableboy, Straw, had convinced her that her guardians, unable to find a suitable husband for her, meant to sell her as a concubine in Rihad, and when a Redguard had indeed come, she had panicked and fled with him. Tiber Septim seemed fascinated and listened raptly as she provided details of her life as a merchant caravan guard.\n\"Why, 'tis like a ballad,\" he said. \"By the One, I'll have the court bard set it to music. What a charming boy you must have made.\"\n\"Symmachus said--\" Barenziah stopped in some confusion, \"he said, well, that I no longer look much like a boy. I have grown in the past few months.\" She lowered her gaze in what she hoped looked like maiden modesty.\n\"He's a very discerning fellow, is my friend Symmachus.\"\n\"I know I've been a very foolish girl. I must crave thy pardon, and that of my kind guardians. I -- I realized that some time ago, but I was too ashamed to go home. And I do long for Morrowind. My soul pines for my own country.\"\n\"My dear. You shall go home, I promise you, but I pray you remain with us a little longer, that you may prepare yourself for the stern task with which I shall charge you.\" Barenziah gazed at him earnestly, heart beating hard. It was all working just as Symmachus had said it would. She felt a warm flush of gratitude toward him, but was careful to keep her attention focused on the Emperor. \"I am honored, Excellency, and wish most earnestly to serve you and this great Empire you have forged in any way I can.\" It was the politic thing to say, but Barenziah really meant it. She was awed by the magnificence of the city and the discipline and order everywhere evident, and was excited at the prospect of being a part of it all. Plus she felt quite drawn to Tiber Septim.\nAfter a few days Symmachus left for Mournhold to take up his duties as governor until Barenziah was ready to assume the throne, after which he would become her Prime Minister. Barenziah, with Drelliane as chaperone, took up residence in a suite at the Palace. Several tutors were provided for her. During this time she became deeply interested in the magical arts, but she found the study of history and politics not at all to her taste.\nOn occasion she met Tiber Septim in the Palace gardens and he would unfailingly inquire politely as to her progress, and chide her, although with a smile, over her disinterest in matters of state. However, he was always happy to instruct her on fine points of magic, and he could make even history and politics seem interesting after all. \"They're people, child, not dry facts in a dusty book,\" he said. As her understanding broadened their discussions became longer, deeper and more frequent. He spoke to her of his vision of a united Tamriel, each race separate and distinct but with shared ideals and goals, all contributing to the common weal.\n\"Some things are universal, shared by all sentient folk of good will,\" he said. \"So the One teaches us. We must unite against the malicious and the brutish, the mis-created, the orcs, trolls, goblins and other worse creataures, not strive 'gainst one another.\"\nHis blue eyes would light as he stared into his dream, and Barenziah was delighted just to sit and listen to him. If he drew close to her, the side of her body next to him would glow as if he were a fire. If their hands met she would tingle all over as if his body were charged with a small shock spell. One day, quite unexpectedly, he took her face in his hands and kissed her gently on the mouth. She drew back after a few moments, astonished by the violence of her feelings, and he apologized instantly. \"I didn't mean to do that. It's just -- you are so beautiful, my dear. So very beautiful.\" He was looking at her with a hopeless yearning in his face. She turned away, tears streaming down her face. \"Are you angry with me? Talk to me.\"\nBarenziah shook her head. \"I could never be angry with you. I love you. I know it's wrong, but I can't help it.\"\n\"I have a wife,\" he said. \"She is a good and virtuous woman, and the mother of my children. I could never put her aside, yet there is nothing between us, no sharing of the spirit. She would have had me be other than what I am. I am the most powerful man in all Tamriel, and, Barenziah, I think I am the most lonely as well. Power!\" he said with contempt. \"I'd trade a goodly share of it for youth and love if the gods allowed it.\"\n\"But you are strong and vigorous and vital, more than any man I've ever known.\"\nHe shook his head. \"Today, perhaps. Yet I am less than I was yesterday, last year, ten years ago. I feel the sting of my mortality and it is painful.\"\n\"If I can ease thy pain, let me do so.\" Barenziah moved towards him, hands outstretched.\n\"I would not take thy innocence from thee.\"\n\"I'm not that innocent.\"\n\"How so?\" Tiber Septim's voice grated harshly, his brow knitted. Barenziah's mouth went dry. What had she done?\n\"There was Straw,\" she faltered. \"I -- I was lonely, too. Am lonely. And not so strong as you.\" She cast her eyes down in embarassment. \"I'm not worthy--\"\n\"No, no, not so. Barenziah, it cannot last for long. You have a duty in Mournhold. I must tend my Empire. Shall we share what we may and pray the One forgives us our frailty?\"\nTiber Septim held out his arms and, wordlessly, Barenziah stepped into his embrace.\nPart 7.\n\"You dance on the edge of a volcano, child,\" Drelliane scolded, as Barenziah admired the emerald ring her lover had given her to celebrate their one month anniversary.\n\"How so? We make one another happy. We harm no one. Symmachus bade me to be discriminate and discreet. Who better could I choose? And we've been most discreet. He treats me as a daughter in public.\" Tiber Septim's nightly visits were made through a secret passage.\n\"He slavers over you like a dog his dinner. Have you not noticed the coolness of the Empress and her son toward you?\"\nBarenziah shrugged. Even before she and Septim had become lovers she'd had no more from his family than bare civility. Threadbare civility. \"What matter? It is Tiber who holds power.\"\n\"It is his son who holds the future. Do not hold his mother up to public scorn, I beg you.\"\n\"Can I help it if that dry stick of a woman cannot hold her husband's interest even in conversation at dinner?\"\n\"Have less to say in public. That is all I ask. She matters little, save that her children love her, and you do not want them as enemies. Tiber Septim has not long to live. I mean,\" Drelliane amended quickly, at Barenziah's scowl, \"Humans are all short-lived. Temporary, as we elves say. They come and go as the seasons do, but the families of the powerful live on for a time. You must be a family friend if you would see lasting profit from your relationship. Ah, how can I make you truly see, you who are so young and human-bred as well! If you take care you and Mournhold are like to live to see the fall of Septim's dynasty, if indeed he has founded one, as you have seen its rise. It is the way of human history. They ebb and flow like the tides. Their cities and even their empires bloom like spring flowers, only to wither and die in the summer sun.\"\nBarenziah just laughed. She knew that rumors abounded about her and Tiber Septim. She enjoyed the attention for all save the Empress and her son seemed captivated by her. Bards sang of her dark beauty and her charming ways. She was in fashion and in love and if it was temporary, well, what was not? She was happy for the first time she could remember, each day filled with joy and pleasure, and the nights yet better.\n\"What is wrong with me?\" Barenziah lamented. \"Look, not one of my skirts fit? What's become of my waist? Am I getting fat?\" Barenziah regarded her thin arms and legs and her undeniably thickened waist in the mirror with displeasure.\nDrelliane shrugged. \"You appear to be with child, young as you are. Constant pairing with a human has brought you early to fertility. I see no choice but for you to speak with him about it. You are in his power. It would be best, I think, for you to go directly to Mournhold if he will agree, and bear the child there.\"\n\"Alone?\" Barenziah placed her hands on her swollen belly, tears forming in her eyes. Everything in her yearned to share the fruit of her love with her lover. \"He'll ne'er agree to that. He won't be parted from me now. You'll see.\"\nDrelliane shook her gray head. Although she said no more, a look of sympathy and sorrow had replaced her usual cool scorn.\nThat night Barenziah told Tiber Septim of it when he came to her.\n\"With child?\" He looked shocked. Stunned. \"You're sure of it? I was told elves do not bear so young.\"\nBarenziah summoned a smile. \"How can I be sure? I've never --\"\n\"I'll fetch my healer.\"\nThe healer, a high elf of middle years, confirmed that Barenziah was indeed pregnant and that such a thing had never before been known to happen. It was a testimony to His Excellency's potency, the healer said sycophantically. Tiber Septim snarled at him. \"This must not be,\" he said. \"Undo it.\"\n\"Sire,\" the healer gaped at him. \"I cannot--.\"\n\"Of course you can,\" he snapped. \"I command you do so.\"\nBarenziah, wide-eyed with sudden terror, sat up in the bed. \"No!\" she screamed. \"No! What are you saying?\"\n\"My dear child,\" Tiber Septim sat down beside her with his winning smile. \"I'm so sorry. Truly. But this cannot be. Your child could be a threat to my son and his sons. I will put it no more plainly than that.\"\n\"The child I bear is your child!\" she wailed.\n\"No. It's but a possibility, a might be, not yet gifted with a soul or quickened into life. I will not have it so.\" He gave the healer another hard stare and the elf began to tremble.\n\"It is her child. Children are few among elves. No woman conceives more than four and that is very rare. Two is the allotted number. Some bear none, some only one. If I take this one from her, she may not conceive again.\"\n\"You told me she would not bear to me. I've little faith in your prognostications.\"\nBarenziah scrambled naked from her bed, and ran for the door, not knowing where she was going, only that she could not stay. She never reached the door for blackness took her.\nBarenziah awoke to pain and emptiness. Drelliane was there to soothe the pain and clean the blood that pooled between her legs, but there was nothing to fill the emptiness. Tiber Septim sent gifts and flowers, and came for short visits, always well attended. Barenziah received these visits with pleasure, but he came no more at night nor did she wish for him. After a week, when she was physically recovered, it was announced that Symmachus had requested she come to Mournhold earlier than planned, and that she would leave forthwith. She was given a splendid retinue, a wardrobe befitting a queen and a ceremonial departure from the gates of Imperial City.\n\"Everything I have ever loved I have lost,\" Barenziah thought, looking over the mounted knights behind and ahead, the tirewomen near her in a carriage, \"yet have I gained a measure of wealth and power, and the promise of more to come. Dearly have I bought it. Now do I better understand Tiber Septim's love of it, if he has oft paid such prices, for surely worth is measured by the price one pays.\" Barenziah, by her wish, rode mounted on a shining black mare, clad as a warrior in shining chain mail of dark elf making.\nAs the slow days slipped by and her train rode a winding road eastward into the setting sun, around her rose the steep-sided mountain slopes of Morrowind. The air was thin and a chill late autumn wind blew constantly, but it was also rich with the sweet spice smell of the late-blooming black rose, which grew in every shadowy nook and crevice, finding nourishment even in the stoniest slopes. In small villages and towns, ragged dark elf folk gathered along the road to cry her name or simply gape. Most of her knightly escort were Redguards with a few dark elves, Nords and Bretons scattered among them. As they wove their way into the heart of Morrowind, these grew increasingly uncomfortable and clung together. Even the dark elf knights seemed somewhat uneasy. Barenziah felt at home, felt the welcome extended to her by this land.\nSymmachus met her at the Mournhold borders with an escort of knights, about half of whom were dark elf in Imperial battle dress, she noted. There was a grand parade into the city and speeches of welcome from elders.\n\"I've had the queen's suite refurbished for you,\" he said, \"but you can change anything not to your taste, of course.\" He went on about details of the coronation ceremony which was to be held in a week. He was his old commanding self, but she sensed something else as well. He was eager for her approval of the arrangements. He asked her nothing about her stay in Imperial City or Tiber Septim, although Barenziah was certain that Drelliane had told him everything in detail.\nThe ceremony itself, like so much else, was a mixture of old and new, parts of it dictated by Imperial format, as she was sworn to service of the Empire and Tiber Septim, as well as to the land of Mournhold and its people. She then accepted fealty from the people and the council. The council was composed of a mixture of Imperial representatives, advisors they were called, and native representatives of the people. These latter were mostly elders, in accordance with elven custom. Barenziah found that much of her time was occupied in attempting to reconcile these two forces. And the elders were expected to do most of the conciliating in the name of the reforms introduced by the Empire, such as land ownership and surface farming, which went clean against dark elven tradition, as laid down by their ancient gods and goddesses. Now, Tiber Septim, in the name of the One had decreed a new tradition, and the gods and goddesses themselves were expected to obey.\nBarenziah threw herself into work and study. She was through with love and men for a long, long time, if not forever. There were other pleasures, she discovered, as Symmachus had promised, those of the mind, of power. She developed a love for dark elf history and legend, a hunger to know the people from whom she sprang, proud warriors and craftsmen.\nPart 8.\nTiber Septim lived another half century, during which she saw him on a few occasions, as she was bidden to Imperial City for one reason or another. He greeted her with warmth on these occasions and they had long talks together about events. He seemed to have quite forgotten that there had ever been anything more between them. He changed little over the years. Rumor said that his mages had found spells to extend his vitality, and even that the One had granted him immortality. Then one day a messenger came with the news that he was dead, and his son was now Emperor in his place.\nThey'd heard the news in private, she and Symmachus. He took it stoically, as he took everything.\n\"It doesn't seem possible,\" Barenziah said.\n\"I told you. It's the way of humans. They are a short-lived race. It doesn't really matter. His power lives on, and his son now wields it.\"\n\"You called him your friend. Do you feel nothing?\"\nHe shrugged. \"There was a time when you called him somewhat more. What do you feel, Barenziah?\"\n\"Emptiness. Loneliness,\" she said, then she too shrugged. \"That's not new.\"\n\"I know,\" he said, taking her hand. \"Barenziah, let me try to fill that lonely place.\" He turned her face up and kissed her. It filled her with astonishment. She couldn't remember his ever touching her before. She'd never thought of him in that way, and yet, undeniably, an old familiar warmth spread through her. She'd forgotten how good it was, that warmth. Not the burning heat she'd felt with Tiber Septim, but the warmth she associated with, with Straw! Straw, poor Straw. She hadn't thought of him in so long. He'd be middle-aged now if he still lived. Probably married with a dozen children, she hoped, and a wife who could talk for two.\n\"Marry me, Barenziah,\" he was saying, \"I've worked and toiled and waited long enough, haven't I?\"\nMarriage. \"A peasant with peasant dreams.\" The words appeared in her mind, as if from long ago. And yet, why not? If not him, who? The great noble families had been destroyed in the war and its aftermath. Dark elf rule had been restored, but not the old nobility. Most of them were upstarts, like Symmachus and not as good as he was. He'd fought to keep Mournhold whole and healthy when their so-called advisors would have picked their bones, sucked them dry as Ebonheart had been sucked dry. He'd fought for Mournhold, fought for her, while she and it grew. She felt a sudden rush of gratitude, and, undeniably, affection. He was steady and reliable. He'd served her well. \"Why not?\" she said, smiling.\nThe union was a good one, both in its political and personal aspects. While Tiber Septim's son viewed her with a jaundiced eye, his trust in his father's old friend was absolute. Symmachus, however, was still viewed with suspicion by Morrowind's stiff-necked folk, suspicious of his peasant ancestry, his close ties to the Empire, while she was quite popular. \"The Lady's one of our own in her heart,\" it was whispered, \"held captive as we are.\" Barenziah felt content. There was work and pleasure and what more could one ask of life? The years passed swiftly, with crises to be dealt with, storms and famines and failures and successes and plots to be foiled. Mournhold prospered well enough. Her people were secure and fed, her mines and farms productive. All was well save that the marriage produced no children. No heirs.\nNow elven children are slow to come, and most demanding of their welcome, noble children more so than others, thus many decades had passed before they grew concerned.\n\"The fault lies with me, husband. I am damaged goods.\" Barenziah said bitterly. \"If you want to take another...\"\n\"I want no other,\" Symmachus snapped, \"nor do I know the fault to be thine. Perhaps it is mine. Whichever, we will seek a cure. If there is damage, surely it may be repaired?\"\n\"How so? When we dare not entrust anyone with my true story? Healer's oaths do not always hold.\"\n\"It won't matter if we change the time and circumstances a bit. Whate'er we say or fail to say Jephre never rests. His inventive mind and quick tongue are ever busy spreading gossip and rumor.\"\nPriests and Healers came and went, but all their prayers, potions and other efforts produced not even a period of bloom, let alone a single fruit. Eventually, they put it from their minds and left it in the gods' hands. They were yet young, with centuries ahead of them. There was time. Elves always have time.\nPart 9.\nBarenziah sat in the hall at dinner, pushing her food about on her plate, feeling bored and restless. Symmachus was away, having been summoned to Imperial City by Tiber Septim's great-great grandson, Uriel Septim. Or was it his great-great-great grandson? She'd lost count, she realized. Their faces seemed to blur into one another. Perhaps she should have gone with him, but there'd been the delegation from Tear on a tiresome matter that required delicate handling.\nA bard was singing, but Barenziah hadn't been listening. Lately all the songs seemed the same to her, whether new or old. Now a turn of phrase caught her attention. He was singing of freedom, of adventure, of freeing Morrowind from its chains. How dare he! Barenziah sat up straight and turned to glare at him and worse, then realized that he was singing of some ancient war with Skyrim Nords, praising the heroism of King Moraelyn and his brave Companions. That tale was old enough, yet the song was new ... and the meaning...Barenziah wasn't sure. A bold fellow, but with a good voice and an ear for poetry and music. Rather handsome, too, in a raffish way. He didn't look exactly prosperous, nor was he all that young. Certainly he wasn't under a century of age. Why hadn't she heard him before, or at least heard of him?\n\"Who is he?\" she whispered to her dinner companion, who shrugged and said, \"Calls himself Nightingale. No one seems to know anything about him.\"\n\"Bid him speak with me when he has done.\"\nNightingale came to her, thanked her for the honor and the purse she handed him. His manner wasn't bold, rather quiet and unassuming. He was quick enough with gossip about others, but she learned nothing about him, for he turned all questions away with a joking answer or a wild tale, yet one given so charmingly that it was impossible to take offense. \"My true name? Milady, I am no one. No, no, my parents named me Know Wan, or was it, No Buddy? What doth it matter? How can parents give name to that which they know not? Ah, I believe that was the name, No Not. I have been Nighingale for so long I do not quite remember, oh, since last month at the very least, or was it last week? All my memory goes into song and tales, you see. I've none left for myself. I'm really quite boring. Where was I born? Why, Knoweyr. I plan to settle in Dunroman when I get there, but I'm in no hurry.\"\n\"I see. And will you then marry Atleshur?\"\n\"Very perceptive of you, milady. Perhaps, although I find Inaste quite charming, too, at whiles.\"\n\"Ah, you are fickle, then?\"\n\"Like the wind, milady, I blow hither and yon and hot and cold.\"\n\"Stay with us awhile, then, if you will.\"\n\"As you wish, milady.\"\nBarenziah found her interest in life rekindled. All that had seemed stale seemed fresh and new again. She greeted each day with zest, looking forward to conversation and song with Nightingale. Unlike other bards he never sang her praises, nor other women's but only of high adventure and bold deeds. When she asked him about this, he merely said, \"What greater praise of thy charm couldst thou ask, than what thy own mirror gives thee? And if words thou wouldst have, thou hast those of the greatest bards of the land? How should I vie with them, I who was born but a week gone by?\" For once they spoke privately, for Barenziah, unable to sleep, had bidden him come to her chamber that his music might soothe her.\n\"Thou art lazy and a coward, else I hold no charm for thee.\"\n\"Milady, to praise thee I must know thee and thy spirit is wrapped in clouds of enchantment.\"\n\"Not so, 'tis thy words that weave enchantment, and thy eyes. Know me if thou wilt, and if thou dare'st.\" He came to her; they lay close, kissed and embraced. \"Not even Barenziah truly knows herself,\" he whispered softly. \"How can I? Barenziah, thou seekest and know it not, nor yet for what. What would you have, that you have not?\"\n\"Passion,\" she whispered, \"passion. And children born of it.\"\n\"And for thy children, what? What birthright will you give them?\"\n\"Freedom,\" she whispered, \"freedom to be what they are. Where can I find these things?\"\n\"They lie beside you and beneath you if you dare stretch out your hand to take them.\"\n\"But Symmachus...\"\n\"I tell you, in me lies the answer to part of your quest and below us in these very mines, lies that which will grant us the power to fulfill achieve it. That which Moraelyn and Edward between them used to free High Rock from Nord domination of their spirit. Properly used, none can stand against it, not e'en that power which the Emperor controls. Freedom, Barenziah, freedom from the chains that bind you. Think on it, Barenziah.\" He kissed her again, softly, and withdrew.\n\"You're not going?\" she cried out, for her body yearned for him.\n\"For now,\" he said. \"Pleasures of the flesh are nothing beside what we might have together. I would have you think on it.\"\n\"I don't need to think. What must we do? What preparation must we make?\"\n\"Why, none. You can enter the mines freely. Once below I can guide you to where this thing lies and lift it from its resting place.\"\n\"The Horn of Summoning,\" she whispered. \"Is it true? How do you know? 'Tis said it's buried 'neath Daggerfall itself.\"\n\"Nay, long have I studied this matter. Before his death King Edward gave the horn for safekeeping into the hand of his old friend King Moraelyn, who secreted it here in Mournhold, under the guardianship of the god Ephen, whose birthplace this is. Now thou know'st what it hath cost me many long years and weary miles to learn.\"\n\"But the god?\"\n\"Trust me, dear heart. All will be well.\" Laughing, he blew her a last kiss and was gone.\nOn the morrow they passed the guards at the great doors that led below. Barenziah made her usual tour of inspection but instead of leaving afterwards, she and Nightingale entered a long-sealed door that led to an ancient part of the workings, long abandoned. The going was treacherous, for some of the old passages had collapsed and they had to clear a passage or find a way around. Vicious rats and huge spiders scurried here and there and sometimes attacked them.\n\"We've been gone too long,\" Barenziah said. \"They'll be looking for us. What will I tell them?\"\n\"Whate'er you please,\" Nightingale laughed. \"You are the queen, aren't you?\"\n\"Symmachus--\"\n\"That peasant obeys whoever holds power. Always has, always will. We shall hold the power, love.\" His lips were the sweetest wine, every touch of fire and lightning.\n\"Now,\" she said, \"take me now. I'm ready.\" Her body seemed to hum, every nerve and muscle taut.\n\"Not yet. Not here, not like this.\" He waved around at the ancient dusty rubble and grim rock walls. \"Just a little longer.\"\n\"Here,\" he said at last, pausing before a blank wall. \"Here it lies.\" His hands wove a spell and the wall dissolved to reveal the entrance to an ancient shrine. In the midst stood a statue of the god, hammer in hand, poised above an adamantium anvil.\n\"By my blood, Ephen, I bid you wake! Moraelyn's heir of Ebonheart am I, last of the royal kin, sharer of thy blood. At Morrowind's last need, with all elvendom in peril of their souls, release to me that which thou guardst! Now do I bid thee strike!\"\nAt his words the statue stirred and quickened, and the blank stone eyes glowed red. The massive head nodded, and the hammer smote the anvil, which split asunder with a thunderous crash, and the stone god himself crumbled. Barenziah clapped her hands over her ears and crouched down, crying aloud. Nightingale strode boldly forward and clasped what lay among the ruins with a cry of ecstasy, lifting it high.\n\"Someone's coming!\" Barenziah cried. \"Wait, that's not the Horn, it -- it's a staff!\"\n\"Indeed, my dear, you see truly, at last!\" Nightingale laughed aloud, then -- \"I'm sorry, my darling, that I must leave you now. Perhaps we'll meet again one day. Until then -- ah, until then, Symmachus,\" he said to the mail clad figure who'd appeared behind them, \"she's yours.\"\n\"No!\" Barenziah sprang up and ran toward him, but he was gone -- winked out of existence -- just as Symmachus, sword drawn, reached him. His blade cleaved a single stroke through empty air, then he stood as still as if he'd taken the stone god's place. Barenziah said nothing, nothing, nothing...\nSymmachus told the half dozen elves who had accompanied him to say only that Nightingale and the queen had lost their way, and had been set upon by spiders. Nightingale had fallen into a deep crevice that closed upon him. His body could not be recovered. The queen had been badly shaken by the encounter and deeply mourned the loss of the friend, who had fallen in her defense. Such was his power of command that the slack-jawed soldiers, none of whom had caught more than a glimpse of the event, were half-convinced that it was true.\nBarenziah was escorted above and taken to her chamber where she dismissed her servants and sat stunned, too shaken even to weep. Symmachus stood watching her.\n\"Do you have any idea what you have done?\" he said finally.\n\"You should have told me,\" Barenziah whispered, \"The Staff of Unity and Chaos! I never dreamed it lay here. He said--\" A mewling moan escaped her lips and she doubled over in agony. \"What have I done? What now? What's to become of me?\"\n\"You loved him?\"\n\"Yes, yes, yes. Oh, may the gods have mercy on me, I did love him.\"\nSymmachus hard-lined face softened slightly and his eyes glittered with a new light, and he sighed softly. \"Ahhh, that's something then. You will become a mother if it's within my power. As for the rest, my dear, I expect you have loosed a storm upon the land. It'll be awhile yet in the brewing. When it comes we'll weather it together.\" He stripped her clothing from her and carried her to the bed. Out of grief and longing, her body responded to his as never before, pouring forth all that Nightingale had woken in her. She was emptied, and then filled, for a child was planted and grew within her. As the babe grew in her womb, so did her feeling for patient faithful Symmachus, rooted in long friendship and affection, now at last ripen into the fullness of true love. Eight years later their love was blessed again with a little daughter.\nDirectly after Nighingale's theft of the staff Symmachus had sent secret messages to Uriel Septim of the matter, but had not gone himself, choosing rather to stay with Barenziah during her fertile period and father the child upon her. For this, and for the theft, he suffered Uriel Septim's disfavor and suspicion. Spies were sent in search of the thief but Nighingale seemed to have vanished whence he'd come, wherever that was.\n\"Dark elf, in part, perhaps,\" said Barenziah, \"but part human, too, I think, in disguise, else would I not have come so quickly to fertility.\"\n\"Part dark elf, for sure, of ancient R'Aathim lineage, else he could not have freed the staff,\" Symmachus reasoned, \"and I think he would have lain with thee. As elf he did not dare, for then he would not have been able to part with thee. He knew the Staff lay there, not the Horn, and that he must teleport to safety, for the Staff is not a weapon that would have seen him clear, unlike the horn. Praise the gods he hath not that! It seems all was as he expected, yet how did he know? I placed it there myself, with the aid of the rag-tail end of the R'Aathim clan who now sits king in Ebonheart as a reward. Tiber Septim claimed the Horn, but left the Staff for safe-keeping. Nightingale can use the Staff to sow seeds of strife and dissension, if he wishes, yet that alone will not gain him power. That lies with the Horn and the ability to use it.\"\n\"I'm not so sure it's power that Nightingale seeks,\" Barenziah said.\n\"All seek power,\" Symmachus retorted, \"each in our own way.\"\n\"I have found what I sought,\" Barenziah said.\nPart 10.\nAs Symmachus had predicted, the theft of the Staff of Chaos had few short term consequences. The current emperor, Uriel Septim, sent some rather stiff messages expressing shock and displeasure at the staff's disappearance and urging that Symmachus make every effort to locate its whereabouts and communicate this to the newly appointed Imperial BattleMage, Jagar Tharn, in whose hands the matter had been placed.\n\"Tharn!\" Symmachus snarled in disgust and frustration, as he paced about the small chamber where Barenziah, now some months pregnant, was sitting serenely, knitting a baby blanket. \"Jagar Tharn, indeed. I wouldn't give him directions for crossing the street.\"\n\"What have you against this person, husband?\"\n\"I just don't trust that mongrel elf. Part wood elf, part dark elf and part only the gods know what. All the worst qualities of all his combined races. No one knows much about him. Claims he was born in Valenwood, of a wood elf mother. Seems to have been everywhere since--\"\nBarenziah, sunk in the contentment of pregnancy had only been humoring Symmachus thus far, but this piqued her interest. \"Nightingale? Could he have been this Jagar Tharn, disguised?\"\n\"Nay. Human blood seems to be the one missing component in Tharn's ancestry.\" To Symmachus, Barenziah knew, that was a flaw. Symmachus despised wood elves as lazy thieves and high elves as effete intellectuals, but he admired humans, especially Bretons, for their combination of pragmatism, intelligence and energy.\n\"Nightingale's of Ebonheart, of the House of Mora, I'll be bound -- that house has had human blood since her time. Ebonheart was jealous that the Staff was laid here when Tiber Septim took the Horn from us.\"\nBarenziah sighed a little. The rivalry between Ebonheart and Mournhold reached back almost to the dawn of history. Once the two had been one, all the mines within held by Clan R'Aathim, whose royal house held the High Kingship of Morrowind. Ebonheart had split into two separate city states, Ebonheart and Mournhold, when Queen Lian's twin sons, Moraelyn's grandsons, had been left as the heirs. At the same time the office of High King had been vacated in favor of a temporary War Leader to be named by a council in times of provincial emergency. Still, Ebonheart remained jealous of her prerogatives as the eldest city state of Morrowind, still first among equals, and claimed that guardianship of the Horn should rightfully be entrusted to the elder. Mournhold responded that Moraelyn himself had placed the Horn in the keeping of the god Ephen, and Mournhold was unarguably the god's birthplace.\n\"Why not tell Jagar Tharn of your suspicions then? Let him recover the thing. As long as it's safe, what does it matter where it lies?\"\nSymmachus stared at her without comprehension. \"It matters,\" he said softly, \"but not that much,\" he added. \"Certainly not enough for you to concern yourself further over it. You just tend to your -- knitting.\"\nIn a few more months Barenziah produced a fine son, whom they named Helseth. Nothing more was heard of the Staff or \"Nightingale.\" If Ebonheart held it, certainly they did not boast of it. The years passed swiftly and happily. Helseth grew tall and strong. He was much like his father, whom he worshipped. When Helseth was eight years old Barenziah bore a second child, a daughter, to Symmachus' great delight. Helseth was his pride, yet little Morgiah held his heart.\nShortly after Morgiah's birth word came that a plot against the Emperor had been unmasked and that the chief co-conspirators Jagar Tharn and Ria Silmane were dead. Symmachus rejoiced at this news. \"I told you so,\" he crowed. Yet thereafter relations with the Empire slowly deteriorated, for no apparent reason. Taxes were raised and quotas increased with each passing year. Symmachus felt that the Emperor suspected him of having had a hand in the plot and sought to prove his loyalty by making every effort to comply with the increasing demands. He lengthened working hours and raised taxes and even made up some of the difference from both crown funds and their own private holdings. Yet still the demands increased and commoners and nobles alike grew restless.\n\"I want you to take the children and journey yourself to Imperial City,\" Symmachus at last said in desperation. \"You must make the Emperor listen, else all Mournhold will be in revolt come spring. You have a way with men, you always did.\" He forced a smile.\nBarenziah forced a smile of her own. \"Even you.\"\n\"Yes, even me,\" he said dully.\n\"Both children?\" Barenziah looked over toward the corner windows where Helseth was strumming a lute and singing a duet with his little sister. Helseth was fifteen, Morgiah just eight.\n\"Perhaps they'll soften his heart. Besides, it's time that Helseth was presented at the Imperial Court.\"\n\"Perhaps, but that's not your true reason. You do not think you can keep them safe here. If that's the case, then you're not safe here either. Come with us,\" Barenziah urged.\nHe took her hands in his. \"Barenziah. Love. Heart of my heart, if I leave now, there'll be nothing for us to return to. I'll be all right. I can take care of myself, and I can do it better if I need not fear for you and our children.\"\nBarenziah laid her head against his chest. \"Just remember that we need you. We can do without the rest if we have each other. Empty hands and empty bellies are easier to bear than an empty heart. My foolishness has brought us to this pass.\"\n\"If so, 'tis not that so a place to be.\" His eyes rested fondly on their carefree children. \"And none of us shall go without. I cost you everything once, Barenziah, I and Tiber Septim. Without my aid the Septim dynasty would never have begun. I helped its rise. I can bring about its fall. You may tell Uriel Septim that, and that my patience is bounded.\"\nBarenziah gasped. Symmachus was not given to empty threats. She'd no more imagined that he would ever turn against the Empire than that the old house wolf lying by the hearth would turn on her.\n\"How?\" she demanded, but he shook his head. \"Better that you know not,\" he said. \"Just tell him that, if he prove recalcitrant, and do not fear. He's Septim enough that he will not kill the messengers.\"\nThe late winter journey to Imperial City was an easy one. One of the things the Septim Empire had accomplished was the building and maintenance of good highways throughout Tamriel.\nPart 11.\nBarenziah stood before the Emperor's throne, explaining Mournhold's straits. She'd waited weeks for an audience with Uriel Septim, fobbed off on pretext or another. \"His Excellency is indisposed.\" \"An urgent matter demands his attention.\" \"I am sorry, your Highness, there must be some mistake. Your appointment is for next week. No, see...\" And now it was not going well. He did not even seem to be listening to her. He hadn't invited her to sit, nor had he dismissed the children. Helseth stood still as a carved statue, but little Morgiah had begun to fidget.\nHe had first greeted the three of them with a too-bright smile of welcome that did not reach his eyes. Then, as she presented her children, he had gazed at them with a fixed attention that was real, yet inappropriate. Barenziah had been dealing with humans for nearly five hundred years now and had developed skill at reading their expressions and movement that was far beyond that any human ever learned. Try as the Emperor might to conceal it, there was a hunger in his eyes, and something more. Regret. Why? He had several fine children of his own. Why covet hers? And why look at her with an intense, though, brief yearning? Ah, well, perhaps he was tired of his Lady. Humans were fickle minded. But after that one long, burning glance, his gaze had shifted away as she began to speak of her mission, and he sat still as stone.\nPuzzled, Barenziah stared into the pale set face, looking for some trace of the Septims she'd known. She hadn't known Uriel Septim well, having met him only once when he was still a child and then at his coronation twenty years before. He'd been stern and dignified then, yet not icily remote as this man was. Despite the physical resemblance, he didn't seem to be the same man at all. Not the same, yet something about him was familiar to her, more familiar than it should be, some trick of posture or gesture ... Suddenly she felt very warm, as if lava had been poured over her. Illusion! She had studied well the arts of illusion since Nightingale had fooled her so badly. She had learned to detect it and she felt it now, as certainly as a blind man could feel the sun on his face.\nIllusion, but why? Her mind worked furiously even as her mouth went on reciting details about the Mournhold economy. Vanity? Humans were oft as ashamed of the signs of age as elves were proud of them. Yet the face Uriel Septim wore seemed consistent with his age. Barenziah dared use none of her magic arts. Even petty nobles had means of detecting, if not shielding themselves from these in their halls. The use of magic here would bring down his wrath as surely as drawing a knife would. Magic. Illusion.\nSuddenly she thought of Nightingale and briefly he sat before her, only saddened. Trapped. And then that vision faded and another man sat there, like Nightingale and yet unlike. Pale skin, red eyes and elven ears and about him a fierce glow of concentration, an aura of energy, a shrinking horror. This man was capable of anything! And then, once again she beheld the face of Uriel Septim. How could she be sure she wasn't imagining things? Perhaps her mind was playing tricks on her. She felt a sudden vast weariness, as if she'd been carrying a heavy burden too long and too far.\n\"Do you remember, Excellency, Symmachus and I had dinner with your family shortly after your father's coronation. You were no older than little Morgiah here. We were greatly honored to be the only guests that evening, except for your best friend Justin, of course.\"\n\"Ah, yes,\" the Emperor said. \"I believe I do recall that.\"\n\"You and Justin were such friends. I was told he died not long after. A great pity.\"\n\"Indeed. I still do not like to speak of him.\" His eyes were wary. \"Ah, as for your request, my lady, we shall take it under advisement and let you know.\"\nBarenziah bowed, as did her children. A nod dismissed them, and they backed away from the presence. Barenziah took a deep breath. \"Justin\" had been an imaginary friend, although Uriel had insisted that a place be set for Justin at every meal! Not only that, \"Justin\" had been a girl, despite the boy name. Symmachus had kept up the family joke long after \"Justin\" had gone wherever such childhood friends go, inquiring seriously after Justin's well-being whenever he and Uriel Septim met, and being responded to as seriously. The last Barenziah had heard \"Justin\", after an adventurous youth, had married a high elf and settled in Lilandril. The man occupying the Emperor's chair was not Uriel Septim! Nightingale! A chord of recognition rang through her and Barenziah knew that she was right. It was he, indeed! Symmachus had been wrong, so wrong ...\nWhat now, she wondered. What had become of Uriel Septim, and, more to the point, what did it mean for her and Symmachus and Mournhold? Thinking back, Barenziah guessed that their troubles were due to this false emperor, Nightingale, or whoever he really was. He must have taken Uriel Septim's place shortly before the unreasonable demands on Mournhold had begun. That would explain why relations had deteriorated so long (as humans judged time) after her offense. Nightingale knew of Symmachus' famed loyalty to, and knowledge of, the Septims and was making a pre-emptive strike. If that were indeed the case they were all in terrible danger. She and the children were under his hand here in Imperial City and Symmachus left alone to face the troubles of Nightingale's brewing.\nWhat must she do? Barenziah urged the children ahead of her, a hand on each shoulder, her womanservant and guards trailing behind. They had reached their waiting carriage -- even though their apartment was only a few blocks from the Palace, royal dignity forbade their walking, and for once, Barenziah was glad of that. Even the carriage seemed a kind of sanctuary now, false as she knew that feeling to be.\nA boy dashed up to one of the guards and handed him a letter, then pointed towards the carriage. The guard brought it to her. The boy waited, eyes wide. The letter was brief and complimentary and simply asked if King Eadwyre of Wayrest, High Rock, might be granted an audience with her, as he had heard much of her, and would be pleased to make her acquaintance. Barenziah's first impulse was to refuse. She wanted only to leave this city! Certainly she had no inclination for any dalliances with a dazzled human. She looked up frowning and one of the guard said, \"The boy says his master awaits your reply yonder.\" She looked in the direction indicated and saw a handsome elderly man on horseback, surrounded by a half-dozen courtiers and guards. He caught her eye and bowed respectfully, removing his plumed hat.\n\"Very well,\" Barenziah said to the boy, on impulse. \"Tell your master he may call on me tonight, after the dinner hour.\" The man looked polite and grave, and rather worried, but not in the least lovesick.\nPart 12.\nBarenziah stood at the open tower window, waiting. She could sense her familiar's nearness, but though the night sky was clear as day to her eyes she could not yet see him. Then suddenly he was there, a swift moving dot beneath the wispy night clouds. A few more minutes and the great nighthawk was there, wings folded, talons reaching for her thick leather armband. She carried the bird to its perch where it waited, panting, while her impatient fingers felt for the message secured in a capsule on one leg. It drank, then ruffled its feathers and began to preen, secure in her presence. A tiny part of her consciousness shared its satisfaction with a job well done, rest earned ... yet beneath that was an unease. Things were not right, even to its bird mind.\nHer fingers shook as she unfolded the thin sheet and pored over the sheet of cramped writing. Not Symmachus' bold hand! Barenziah sat, slowly, fingers smoothing the document while she prepared her mind and body to accept disaster calmly.\nThe Imperial Guards had deserted Symmachus and joined the rebels. The loyal troops had suffered a decisive defeat. The rebel leader had been recognized as king of Morrowind by the Emperor. Symmachus was dead. Barenziah and the children had been declared traitors of the Empire and a price set on their heads.\n\"My lady?\" Barenziah jumped, startled at her servant's approach. \"The Breton is here. King Eadwyre,\" the woman added helpfully, noting Barenziah's puzzlement. \"Is there news, my lady?\" she said, nodding at the nighthawk.\n\"Nothing that will not wait,\" Barenziah said quickly. \"See to the bird.\"\nKing Eadwyre greeted her gravely and courteously, if rather fulsomely. He claimed to be a great admirer of Symmachus, who figured prominently in his family legends. Gradually he turned the conversation to her business with the Emperor. Finding her noncommittal, he suddenly blurted out, \"My Lady Queen, you must believe me. The man posing as the Emperor is an impostor! I know it sounds mad, but I -- \"\n\"No,\" Barenziah said, with sudden decisiveness. \"You are correct. I know.\"\nEadwyre relaxed back into his seat for the first time, eyes shrewd. \"You know? You're not just humoring a madman? My lady I -- we -- need your aid.\"\nBarenziah smiled grimly at the irony. \"Of what assistance might I be, my lord?\"\nQuickly he outlined a plot. The Imperial Sorceress Ria Silmane had been killed and declared a traitor by the false emperor, yet she retained a bit of her power and could yet contact a few of those she had known well on the mortal plane. She had chosen a Champion who would undertake to assemble the missing staff pieces and use the staff's power to destroy Jagar Tharn, who was otherwise invulnerable, and rescue the true Emperor, who was being held prisoner in another plane. However, the chosen Champion languished now in the Imperial Dungeons. Tharn's attention must be diverted while he freed himself with Ria's help. Barenziah had Tharn's ear and eye. Could she provide the necessary distraction?\n\"I suppose I could obtain another audience with him. Would that be sufficient? What do you mean, his eye?\"\nEadwyre looked uncomfortable. \"It was whispered among the servants that Jagar Tharn kept your likeness in a sort of shrine in his chambers. That surprises you?\"\n\"Yes. And no.\"\n\"Our chosen one may need a few days to escape.\"\n\"You trust me in this? Why?\"\n\"We are desperate, my lady. We have no choice. But yes, I do trust you. Symmachus -- \"\n\"Is dead.\" Barenziah explained quickly and coolly.\n\"My Lady. What dreadful news!\" For the first time Eadwyre's urbane poise was shaken. \"Under the circumstances, we can hardly ask -- \"\n\"Nay, my lord king. Under the circumstances I must do what I may to avenge myself upon the murderer of my childrens' father. In return I ask only that you protect my orphaned children as you may.\"\n\"Most willingly do I so pledge, most brave and noble lady!\"\nOld fool, Barenziah thought. She did not sleep that night, but sat in a chair beside her bed, hands folded in her lap, thinking long deep thoughts. She would not tell the children, not yet, not until she must.\nShe had no need to seek another audience with the \"Emperor\" for a summons came in the morning. She told the children she expected to be gone a few days, bade them give the servants no trouble and kissed them goodbye. Morgiah whimpered a bit, for she was bored and lonely in Imperial City. Helseth looked dour but said nothing. He was very like his father.\nAt the palace, Barenziah was escorted not into the great hall, but to a small parlor where the Emperor sat at a solitary breakfast. He nodded a greeting, and waved his hand at the window. \"Splendid view, isn't it?\"\nBarenziah stared out over the towers of the great city. It dawned on her that this was the very chamber where she'd first met Tiber Septim and a strong wave of inchoate feeling swept over her. When she turned back at last Uriel Septim had vanished and Nightingale sat in his place, laughing.\n\"You knew,\" he said accusingly, scanning her face. \"I wanted to surprise you. You might at least pretend.\"\nBarenziah spread her arms, \"I'm afraid my skills at pretense are no match for yours, my liege.\"\n\"You're angry with me.\" He pretended to pout.\n\"Just a little,\" she said icily. \"I do find betrayal offensive.\"\n\"How human of you.\"\n\"What do you want of me?\"\nHe wiped his mouth and stood erect. \"Now you are pretending. You know what I want of you, my love.\"\n\"You want to tantalize and torment me. Go ahead. I'm in your power.\"\n\"No, no, no. I don't want that at all, Barenziah.\" He came near, speaking low in the old caressing voice that sent shivers over her body. \"Don't you see? This was the only way.\" His hands closed on her arms.\n\"You could have taken me with you!\" Tears gathered in her eyes.\nHe shook his head. \"I didn't have the power. Ah, but now, now I have it all. Mine to have, mine to share -- with you.\" He waved his hand toward the window and the city beyond. \"All Tamriel to lay at your feet -- and that is only the beginning.\"\n\"It's too late. Too late. You left me to him.\"\n\"He's dead. A scant few years...what does it matter?\"\n\"The children -- \"\n\"I'll adopt them. We'll have others together, Barenziah. I have powers you do not dream of!\" He moved to kiss her but she slipped his grasp and turned away.\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\"You do, you know. You're still angry, that's all.\" His smile did not reach his eyes. \"What do you want?\"\nShe shrugged. \"A walk in the garden. A song or two.\"\n\"Ah. You want to be courted.\"\n\"Why not? You do it so well. It's been long since I've had the pleasure.\"\nAnd so they spent their days in courtship, walking, talking, singing and laughing together, while the Empire's business was left to underlings.\n\"I'd like to see the staff,\" Barenziah said idly one day. \"I only had a glimpse of it.\"\n\"Nothing would give me greater pleasure, heart's delight, but that's impossible.\"\n\"You don't trust me,\" Barenziah pouted, but she softened her lips for his kiss.\n\"Nonsense, love. It isn't here. In fact, it isn't anywhere.\" He laughed and kissed her again, softly.\n\"Now you're talking in riddles again. I want to see it. You can't have destroyed it.\"\n\"Ah, you've gained in wisdom, since last we met.\"\n\"You piqued my interest somewhat. The staff can't be destroyed and it can't be removed from Tamriel, not without the direst consequences to the land itself.\"\n\"Ahhh. All true. And yet, as a I said, it isn't anywhere. Can you solve the riddle?\" He pulled her to him and she leaned into his embrace. \"Here's a greater riddle still,\" he whispered, \"how to make one of two. That I can and will show you.\" Their bodies merged, limbs tangled together. Later, when they'd drawn a bit apart and dozed, she thought, sleepily. \"One of two, two of one, three of two...what cannot be destroyed or banished might be split apart, perhaps...\"\nNightingale kept a diary. He scribbled entries in it each night after quick reports from his underlings. It was locked but the lock was a simple one, so Barenziah managed to sneak quick looks at it while he was occupied in toileting himself. She discovered that the first staff piece was hidden in an ancient dwarven mine called Fang Lair, although its location was given only in vague terms. The diary was crammed with jotted events in an odd shorthand, and was very hard to decipher.\nAll Tamriel, she thought, in his hands and mine, and more perhaps, and yet ... For all his surface charm there was a cold emptiness where his heart should have been, an emptiness of which he was quite unaware, she thought. One could glimpse it now and then, when his eyes would go blank and hard. Peasant dreams, Barenziah thought, and Straw flashed before her eyes, looking sad, and then Therris, with a mocking smile and empty eye sockets. Symmachus, who did what must be done, quietly and efficiently. Nightingale. Nightingale, who would rule all, and more, and yet spread chaos in the name of control.\nBarenziah got reluctant leave from Nightingale to go to her children, who had to be told of their father's death and of the emperor's offer of his protection to them. Eadwyre called on them while she was there, and she told him what she had discovered so far, and explained that she must remain awhile yet and learn more as she could.\nNightingale teased her about her elderly admirer. He was quite aware of Eadwyre's suspicion, although as he said, no one took the old fool seriously. Barenziah managed to arrange a reconciliation of sorts between them. Eadwyre publicly recanted his suspicions and his \"old friend\" forgave him. Thus he was invited to dine with them at least once a week. The children liked Eadwyre, even Helseth, who disapproved of his mother's liaison with the \"Emperor\" and consequently detested Nightingale. He had become surly and temperamental and frequently quarreled with both of them.\nEadwyre was not happy either and Nightingale delighted in publicly displaying his affection for Barenziah. They could not marry, of course, for Uriel Septim was already married. He had exiled the true Empress shortly after taking Septim's place, but had not dared to harm her. She was held by the Temple of the One. It had been given out publicly that she was in ill health, and rumors had been circulated that she had mental problems. The Emperor's children had also been dispatched to various prisons disguised as \"schools\".\n\"She'll grow worse in time,\" Nightingale said carelessly, eying Barenziah's swollen breasts and belly with satisfaction. \"As for his children ... well, life is full of hazards, isn't it? We'll be married. Your child will be my true heir.\" He did want the child. Barenziah was sure of that. She was far less sure of his feelings for her. They quarrelled, often violently, usually about Helseth, whom he wanted to send away to school. Barenziah made no effort to avoid these quarrels. Nightingale had no interest in a peaceful life and he thoroughly enjoyed making up afterwards. Occasionally Barenziah would take the children and retreat to their old apartment, declaring she wanted no more to do with him.\nShe was six months pregnant before she finally deciphered the location of the last staff piece -- an easy one, since every dark elf knew where Dagoth-Ur was. When next she quarrelled with Nightingale she simply left the city with Eadwyre and they rode hard for High Rock and Wayrest.\nNightingale was furious, but there was little he could do. His assassins were rather inept, and he dared not leave his seat of power to pursue them in person, nor could he openly declare war on Wayrest. He had no legitimate claim on her on her unborn child. The nobility had disapproved of his liaison with Barenziah and were glad that she had gone. Wayrest was equally disapproving and distrustful of her, but Eadwyre was much beloved by his prosperous little city, and allowances were readily made for his eccentricities.\nBarenziah and Eadwyre were married a year after the birth of her son by Jagar Tharn. Eadwyre doted on her. She did not love him, but she was fond of him, and that was something. It was nice to have someone, and Wayrest was a very pleasant place, a good place for children to grow up, while they waited, and hoped, and prayed for their Champion's success in his long mission."}

The adventures of the famous Breton detective are as sought-after in Windhelm and Skywatch as they are in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike other authors, the creator of Investigator Vale refuses to share the stage with her amazing heroine. In fact, her identity has remained anonymous and unknown\u2014until now.\nThis chronicler-at-large began researching this mystery after hearing the story of a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Daggers\"&gt;Ring of Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, the intelligence branch of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. This former member, according to the story, was not only a master spy, but a formidable detective, a consummate warrior, and a daring adventurer. The more I researched this remarkable woman, the more she reminded me of the fictitious Vale. I had to meet this woman, so I began my hunt for Arabelle Davaux.\nArabelle Davaux was born in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in 2E 527. She grew up in a noble household, attending the best schools in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. A rambunctious youth and rebellious teenager, she ran away from home at the age of fifteen to join a mercenary group that helped defend High Rock from the invading horde that stormed out of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. She went on to fight in a number of battles across the continent before finding a place with the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt;. By 2E 560, she had earned the rank of captain and commanded a squad of the Lion Guard's finest soldiers. That's where she first came to the attention of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, king of Wayrest and future high king of the Daggerfall Covenant.\nNow, Arabelle's exploits read like the most outrageous of Vale's stories. She was reported to have dispatched bandit lords, marauding trolls, and enemy forces with style and panache, and rumors indicated she had multiple lovers of all races and genders in a dozen different town, cities, and ports of call. Life was her adventure, and she rushed to meet it the way she charged to meet every enemy in battle. Scandalous tales even connect her to High King Emeric in a romantic fashion, especially during the year she served on his personal guard. Whatever the truth of it, it's obvious that Arabelle impressed Emeric, and when he forged the Ring of Daggers, she was one of his first recruits.\nWhen Arabelle turned fifty, she decided it was time to start a new chapter in her life. She graciously resigned from the Ring of Daggers and took up the role of a world traveler, finally getting to leisurely visit people and places she used to only get to see as part of her job. Claiming she was now \"too old\" to deal with intrigue, spycraft, and rumors of war, Arabelle became a lady of leisure, securing suites and spending long and luxorious weeks in one exotic location after another. I caught up with her in the city of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronicler: Arabelle Davaux, it's a pleasure to meet you after all the amazing stories I read. Did you really take down four river trolls singlehandedly to stop the attacks against the people of &lt;a href=\"Kerbol%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Kerbol's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;?\nArabelle: Actually, it was six swamp trolls, but I didn't want to seem like I was bragging in the official report.\nChronicler: You've led a remarkable life. Mercenary, adventurer, soldier, spy. Now I understand you have a new passion. Care to tell my readers all about it?\nArabelle: My passion is travel and sightseeing, but if your readers want to hear about my adventures as a tour guide \u2026.\nChronicler: Don't play coy, Lady Arabelle. You know exactly which passion I'm referring to. And it begins with Investigator Vale.\nArabelle: Ah, well, I suppose you've found me out. I have grown rather fond of those daring stories of crime and drama. And, I'm not ashamed to say, I love how bawdy the investigator can be. Gets my old blood boiling, if you know what I mean!\nChronicler: Come, come, Lady Arabelle. Admit it! You're the author of the Investigator Vale books!\nArabelle: Author? Me? Do these elegant fingers look cramped and strained from holding a quill for hours at a time? Do you see any ink stains on my hands?\nChronicler: But isn't it true that you modeled Vale after your own exploits? That it's a thinly veiled autobiography of your time as a spy for High King Emeric?\nArabelle: What an imagination you have, chronicler! Are you sure you aren't the author of Vale's amazing adventures?\nChronicler: Me? Don't be absurd! I report the news, not create elaborate fictions!\nArabelle: If you say so, my dear.\nChronicler: But isn't it true that you still dabble in solving mysteries? That you choose places to visit based on what crimes and conspiracies are currently confounding local authorities?\nArabelle: Do I? I hadn't noticed.\nChronicler: My gods! You practically admitted you played \"sheathe the dagger\" with High King Emeric in \"Investigator Vale and the High Rock Revolt!\"\nArabelle: I did no such thing! And besides, Emeric's dagger would more accurately be described as a sword \u2026.\nChronicler: See! You did it again!\nArabelle: Write whatever you feel you must, dear. As for me, I'm late for dinner with Captain Ghorza of the Orsinium Guard. It's been a long time since I enjoyed the company of a lascivious Orc. And I hear she's been having trouble catching a museum thief.\nChronicler: There you have it, faithful reader. Lady Arabelle confessed to being the author of the Investigator Vale mysteries! I solved a case worthy of the famous detective herself!"}

And how he, later, conquered the Dwemer and the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; armies during the battle of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nContents.\nThe Real Nerevar: A &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; retainer's informal history of &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;\n [This &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; retainer's informal history of Nerevar lists no sources. ] \nWhen the Dunmer followed &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, they were many warring clans, with no law or leader in common. One Dunmer warlord, Nerevar, had the ambition to rule all the Dunmer.\nIn that time, House &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; were great enchanters, so Nerevar went in secret to a Dwemer smith and asked for an enchanted ring that would help him. The ring gave its wearer great powers of persuasion; for safety, it was enchanted to instantly kill anyone who wore it except Nerevar. The ring was called &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt;, and it helped Nerevar unite the various clans into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, however, disputes over religion divided the Council, with House Dwemer and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; on one side and all the other Houses on the other. Dwemer and Dagoth invited &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; clans as allies, and held northwest &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, while Nerevar mustered the other Houses and nomad tribes and marched to meet the Dwemer-Dagoth-Westerner forces.\nThe armies met at Red Mountain, a Dwemer stronghold. The Dwemer were defeated, with great slaughter, and terrible sorceries were used, resulting in the utter extermination of House Dwemer, &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, and their allies. Nerevar was killed in the battle, and his &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; lost, but Nerevar's alliance survives in Morrowind's ruling political institution, the Grand Council."}

The well in the atrium of the fortress supplied him with enough water to hold there until the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, but his stomach reminded Menegur minute to minute that he needed food.\nThe wagonload of supplies mocked him. When his army, the forces of the King of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, had left Cascabel Hall, and he had manned the battlements as the rear-guard to protect their retreat, they had left a wagon behind to supply him with enough food for months. It was not until the night after they left that he inspected the larder and found that nothing edible was in the wagon. Trunk after trunk was filled with netch armor from the army's incursion into &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently his &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; confederates had assumed that the lightly opaque material was hard tack in aspic. If the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; whose caravan had been raided knew about this, they would never be able to stop laughing.\nMenegur thought that his fellow mercenary and kinswoman Aerin would have found this amusing as well. She had spoken with great authority about &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Leather%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;netch leather&lt;/a&gt;, being an expert of sorts on light armor, but she had made a point to mention that it could not be eaten like other leather in occasions of hardship. It was a pity she couldn't be there to enjoy the irony, Menegur thought savagely. She had returned to Morrowind even before the king's army had left, preferring a life as a wanted fugitive to a free existence in the cold of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll the weeds in the courtyard had been devoured by the rear-guard's sixteenth day manning Cascabel Hall. The entire castle had been scoured: rotten tubers in the mulch pile found and consumed, a dusty bouquet in the countess's bedchamber eaten, almost every rat and insect but the most cunning infesting the castle walls had been tracked down and gobbled up. The castellan's chambers, filled with acrid, inedible law books, had yielded up a couple crumbs of bread. Menegur had even scraped moss from the stones. There was no denying it: he would be dead from starvation before his army returned to break the ranks of the enemies who surrounded the fortress.\n\"The worst part,\" said Menegur, who had taken to talking to himself on only the second day alone in the castle. \"Is how close sustenance is.\"\nA vast arbor of golden apples stretched acre after acre near the castle walls. The sunlight cast a seductive gleam on the fruit, and the cruel wind carried sweet smells into Cascabel to torture him.\nLike most &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, Menegur was an archer. He was a master of long and medium distance fighting, but in close quarters, as he would be if he dared to leave the castle and enter the enemy camp in the arbor, he knew he would not last long. At some point, he knew he would have to try, but he had been dreading the day. It was upon him now.\nMenegur put on the netch armor for the first time, feeling the powdery, almost velvet texture of the rendered leather against his skin. There was also a barely perceptible throb, which he recognized as the remnant nematocysts of the netch's venomous flesh, still tingling months after its death with domesticated poison. The combination made him feel energized. Aerin had described the sensation perfectly, just as she had explained how to defend himself while wearing netch leather armor.\nUnder cover of night, Menegur crept out of the back gate of the castle, locking it behind him with a rather cumbersome key. He made for the arbor as quietly as he could, but a passing sentry, coming behind a tree, saw him. Remaining calm, Menegur did as he remembered Aerin had instructed, only moving after the attack had been launched. The sentry's blade glided against the armor and knocked to the left, throwing the young man off balance. That was the trick, as he understood it: you had to be prepared to be hit, and merely move with the blow, allowing the membranous armor to divert the injury away.\nUse your enemy's momentum against him, as Aerin used to say.\nThere were several more close encounters in the arbor, but each swing of an ax and each thrust of a sword found purchase elsewhere. With handfuls of apples, Menegur ran the gauntlet back to the castle. He locked the back gate door behind him and fell into an orgy of eating.\nFor week after week, the Bosmer stole out to gather his food. The guards began anticipating his raids, but he kept his schedule irregular and always remembered when attacked to wait for the blow, accept it, and then turn. In such a way, he lived and survived his lonely vigil in Cascabel Hall.\nFour months later, as he was preparing for another seizure of apples, Menegur heard a loud clamor at the front gate. Surveying the group from a safe distance on the battlements, he saw the shields of the King of Solitude, his ally the Count of Cascabel, and their enemy the King of &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;. Evidently, a truce had been called.\nMenegur opened the gates and the combined armies flooded the courtyard. Many of the knights of Farrun sought to shake the hand of the man they had named the Shadow of the Arbor, expressing their admiration at his defensive skills and apologizing good-naturedly for their attempts to slay him. Only doing their job, you know.\n\"There's hardly a apple left on the vines,\" said the King of Solitude.\n\"Well, I started on the edges and worked my way in,\" explained Menegur. \"I brought back extra fruit to tempt the rats of out of walls so I could have a little meat as well.\"\n\"We've spent the last several months working out the details of the truce,\" said the King. \"Really quite exhausting. In any rate, the Count will be taking back possession of his castle now, but there is a small detail we need to work out. You're a mercenary, and as such responsible for your own expenses. If you had been a subject of mine, things might be different, but there are certain old rules of law that must be respected.\"\nMenegur anticipated the strike.\n\"The problem is,\" the King continued. \"You've taken a good deal of the Count's crops while here. By any reasonable computation, you've eaten an amount equal to and likely exceeding your mercenary's wages. Obviously, I would not want to penalize you for the excellent job you've done defending the castle in uncomfortable circumstances, but you agree that it's important that we observe the old rules of law, don't you?\"\n\"Of course,\" replied Menegur, accepting the blow.\n\"I'm delighted to hear that,\" said the King. \"Our estimation is that you owe the Count of Cascabel thirty-seven Imperial gold.\"\n\"Which I will gladly pay to myself, with interest, after the autumntide harvest,\" said Menegur. \"There is more left on the vine than you suggest.\"\nThe Kings of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;, and the Count of Cascabel stared at the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"We agreed to abide to the strictest old rules of law, and I've had time to read a great many books over the time you were making your truce. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20246\"&gt;3E 246&lt;/a&gt;, during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel IV&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Council, in an attempt to clear up some questions of property rights in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; during those chaotic days, decreed that any man without a liege who occupied a castle for more than three months would be granted the rights and titles of that estate. It's a good law, of course, meant to discourage absent and foreign landlords.\" Menegur smiled, feeling the now familiar sensation of a glancing strike diverting. \"By the rule of law, I am the Count of Cascabel.\"\nThe rear-guard's son still hold the title of Count of Cascabel. And he grows the finest, most delectable apples in the Empire."}

He will tell you that he was one of the inhabitants of this place when they struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Shada\"&gt;Shada&lt;/a&gt;. He did not trust Shada and protested against this deal, and as a punishment he was kept alive indefinitely as his fellow nedes lost their minds in service to Shada. He thinks he knows a way to undo the curse when it is in its beginning stages, but in return, he wants you to free him by finding and slaying the general Zal'ik. \nZal'ik is protected by an air of poison; you will have to watch visions of the past to find out how to dispel this poison. You can find these visions in the hallway ahead; for the first vision, you will see a group of nedes trying to bide time until the ritual is complete; they will then turn into skeletons and attack you. A bit ahead, you will see another vision, this time of Zal'ik trying Nhalan for treason and ordering that he is taken to Shada. At the end of the vision, the spirits will again turn to skeletons and attack you. Further on, you will spot the cursed air Nhalan described; just before, there is another vision. In it, you will see the Nedes talking about a creature that will keep the cursed air up; this time the ghosts will not turn to skeletons and attack you. \nThe creature is through the corridor to the north. Once you get there, you will see a vision of the nedes summoning a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Debruz\"&gt;Debruz&lt;/a&gt;; you will have to fight this beast. He likes to set the floor on fire, as well as summon armies of Nedes to help him in the fight. Your main focus should be the big guy, but it is wise to cull some of the hordes now and then so that you do not get overwhelmed. Once Debruz is dead head back south and speak with Nhalan about what has happened. He will tell you that the poison clouds have started to move, and that you should be able to navigate through them to find Zal'ik. \nHead on ahead. The clouds have indeed started moving; follow the clouds, but make sure not to step inside of them. There will be enemies along the way; do not get too distracted by them, as you will have plenty of time to fight them when you are out of the poison cloud area. Once you are through the hallway, the poison clouds will stop; kill any enemies that are chasing you, then head down the stairway into Zal'ik's crypt. There are chests containing soul shards throughout the room; open all of these to engage in combat with Zal'ik's forces. After you have killed a number of them, Zalik himself will awaken. During this fight, he will summon hordes of allies, including tortured souls that will use spells that slow you down to the point where you almost cannot move at all. If you are a solo player, taking down all these souls is nigh impossible; focus your attacks on Zal'ik himself. Once he is dead, you can kill off his remaining friends. \nAfter the battle, head through the door to the southwest of the room. You will find yourself in another corridor with poison gas clouds; this time, there's an alcove with some bookshelves halfway through where you can take refuge and kill the pursuing enemies. At the end of the hallway, head up the stairs and dispose of the enemies pursuing you, then talk to Nhalan. As a reward for freeing him, hewill give you his journal, which contains ways to stop the curse in its beginning stages. Head back to camp and give this journal to &lt;a href=\"Tishi\"&gt;Tishi&lt;/a&gt; to finish the quest. "}

The fall of the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; was the last straw in the tottering support for the Temple's worship of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. With all three of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunes\"&gt;Tribunes&lt;/a&gt; now widely believed dead or disappeared, what had been a simmering schism within the ranks of the Temple priesthood burst into the open.\nWhile outsiders may never know the full tale of this internal struggle, when the smoke cleared a few years later, the former &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; were in full control of the Temple , with &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; loyalists either purged or recanted. The so-called \"New Temple\" now declared the worship of the Tribunes a result of misguided teaching, blaming the mistakes on the former Tribunal. The Temple now taught that the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; venerated by the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribes (&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boethia\"&gt;Boethia&lt;/a&gt;) were the \"true way\" and should be revered by the Dunmer people. Fittingly, the daedra were named the \"Reclamations,\" as if they were reclaiming their status from the Tribunal.\nIn an elegant , no doubt intended to reconcile the large majority of the Temple priesthood who were neither Dissidents nor fanatic Tribunal loyalists, Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec were relegated to the status of \"&lt;a href=\"saints\"&gt;saints&lt;/a&gt;,\" a traditional way to venerate the most honored Dunmer ancestors. This apparently satisfied enough the existing priesthood that the New Temple was able to maintain at least a semblance of outward continuity.\nThe rise of the New Temple almost completely vindicated the previously persecuted Ashlanders, who had continued to worship the three daedra throughout the Tribunal's rule. The Ashlanders are now lauded as the keepers of the old ways and having \"true vision.\" It is now quite common for many of the Dunmer people to make the arduous pilgrimages into the ash wastes to seek the counsel of the Wise Women. These women have supposedly opened the eyes of those who they claim were \"blinded by the Tribunal,\" and directly connect the eruption of the Red Mountain and the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20invasion\"&gt;Argonian invasion&lt;/a&gt; to the anger of the three daedra. &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, whose fortunes were so entwined with the Tribunal Temple, suffered greatly from its fall. While House Indoril still technically exists, the priesthood of the Temple are now considered one and the same with House Indoril - those who become priests are now considered to have \"joined Indoril.\" The political power of the Indoril has thus passed entirely into the hands of the Temple (although members of the old House Indoril are still over-represented in the priesthood).\nThe rise of the New Temple has a number of parallels with the rise of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; - each filled the vacuum of power resulting from the crisis of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;. How durable these new arrangements will prove, religious and political, remains to be seen. The span of two centuries is quite brief in the long history of the ancient Dunmer people."}

The greater world came to me primarily through the windows of my room, high in the relative safety of my family's expansive manor. The vivid flashes of light and color that entered my room via its large windows served only to heighten the anxiety and fear of the outside world I had carefully cultivated in my bed rest. With the physical world become a place of feat and tension for my weakened frame, I retreated into the solace of the written word, and plumbed the deep mysteries of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile I lived many lives, and learned many things in this way, one particular legend, that of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;, the king of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, lodged itself most firmly in my mind. Though I was the scion of a family of proud &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, I contrived a connection between myself and the King of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faolan\"&gt;Faolan&lt;/a&gt;. With this lie embedded in my heart, I turned my studies to the dark arts, wishing to find a way to fulfill Red Eagle's oath, and return him to life. He would, by my machinations, rule The Reach, his flaming sword in one hand, and I at the other, his trusted and beloved vizier.\nAs I grew, my maladies passed, leaving me weak, but not longer bed-ridden, and the largesse of my family afforded me the ability to discreetly expand my research. My peculiar eccentricities were accepted due to my rank, and the near complete isolation of my youth.\nInevitably, my studies led me to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Late at night, in the darkness, deep within my family's manor, I would conduct ancient rituals in unfamiliar tongues, raising the foul demons and trapping them, plying them with questions. Often they would ignore my entreaties, promising me great power or wealth if only I would release them from their magical bonds. Through weak of flesh, my mind was stalwart, I resisted their honeyed words, and eventually they would accept that the only path to freedom lay in acquiescence.\nAgain and again, this story played out, and in fits and starts I collected the information I desires, but it was never enough. Slowly, their poisoned promises bore fruit, and I convinced myself that perhaps I could outsmart these &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;-cursed souls. It was my own hubris that led me to believe I could accept their gifts and yet control the terms.\nHow naive I was then, and how haunted I am by the truths I know now. The fear of the outside world returned tenfold, I have again taken solace in the solitude of my ancestral manse. Though I search feverishly for an escape, I know in my heart that none will rear its head. There is a darkness that lives in the roots of Nirn, and once envisaged, it can never be escaped.\nAppearances.\n&lt;a href=\"Der%20Rote%20Fluch%2C%20Band%201\"&gt;Der Rote Fluch, Band 1&lt;/a&gt;"}

My eyes followed the path into the hills, resting finally on a distant cave entrance, barely visible through the stinging snow, and I steeled myself for the coming trek. Though my physical and mental reserves were nearly spent, I knew that my ambitions were closer than ever to being fulfilled, and despite the lateness of the day and the biting cold, I resolved to reach &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Rebel%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; on that very night.\nThough the powers granted to me by my &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; benefactors are great, intestinal fortitude was not on the list, and when I reached the mouth of the cave I collapsed, exhausted. As i lay there, without even the vigor to drag myself inside, I began to hear the flittering whispers and distant horns, calling me forth to destiny. With this ghostly music in my ears, I crawled into the mouth of the cave, wrapped all that I had around my frame, and dropped into black, dreamless sleep.\nI awoke to the sound of birds and light\u2014things still, as in my youth, repugnant to my senses. I retreated quickly into the darkness of the cave. I knew that my goal was below in the depths. A warm breath pulsed from the interior of the cave, drawing me inward, the thrumming horns seeming to echo from somewhere deep below. I felt a tightness in my chest as I followed these guides, hoping to soon reach my much maligned ancestor.\nThe traps set to dissuade intruders and grave robbers were child's play for my intellect, and ever cautious I made my way deeper into the crypt. The cave walls pressed in, and gradually the rough, rippled rock walls gave way to hewn stone and chiseled murals. My fingers traced the images, caressing Red Eagle's sword as it cut swathes through a thousand men. The whispering voices and alien horns grew louder, increasing the pressure in my head\u2014my senses lulled, but my mind alert, I knew that soon, after years of research, my ascension was at hand.\nI turned one last corner and found myself in Red Eagle's tomb. Simple and unadorned, a sarcophagus sat on a dais in the center of the chamber. Lying near it on a pedestal was &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Red Eagle's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, his magnificent blade. In a burst I ran to it, and hovered over it. My was breath heavy and quick, the voices and music silenced, replaced by an all-encompassing, heavy, ragged, expectant breath.\nMy hand hovered above the hilt, my fingers grasping and flexing, fear mingling with excitement. Carefully, I reached down and grasped the blade, lifting it up before me and staring, transfixed by the sight.\nWhat came next, my mind almost completely refuses to recall, as memories of such horror must be locked away, lest the brain that contains them be driven mad.\nAppearances.\n&lt;a href=\"Der%20Rote%20Fluch%2C%20Band%202\"&gt;Der Rote Fluch, Band 2&lt;/a&gt;"}

Like my &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; benefactors, he whispered of power beyond belief, and filled my head with images of us ruling together as I had always imagined. The room continued to press inward, and I felt cushioned and buoyed along as I laid the blade carefully on the ground and grunted through the effort of removing the lid of Red Eagle's tomb.\nI gazed down at the skeletal remains, the dank smell of the tomb wafting up to my nostrils was intoxicating. Here was the moment I had long dreamt of, and the voice of Red Eagle gently urging me on, which all came crashing down the moment I laid the blade in his grave.\nMy head was immediately wracked with a blinding pain, and I fell to the ground, my vision filled with a pulsing red light. I could hear, somewhere in the distance, the creaking skeleton of Red Eagle climbing from the grave. I saw visions of burning cities, my own flesh melting from the bone as I was consumed in flames. The voice of Red Eagle cackled, now in the room, and he circled behind, \"foolish child,\" he scratched in his inhuman voice, \"you are no kin of mine...\"\nIn a rush I charged Red Eagle and manage to knock the blade from his hand, picking it up I charged from the room, his menacing laughter, turning to roars of anger. Somewhere in my rush to escape, more animal than man, I lost the blade, but must have brought it far enough to trigger some sort of mechanism, as I heard stone doors grinding shut behind me, and the pursuit of Red Eagle was cut off.\nAnd that is why I now live in fear, locked away in my study, hoping to find some way to destroy the horror I have unleashed on the world. Though trapped, at any time, another man, foolish as myself may set him free, and I pity the world when that time comes. I fear for us all."}

Other Emperors, of course, had master chefs and cooks in their staff, but only during the reign of Pelagius was there someone of rarefied tastes to plan the menus and select the finest produce to be served at court. His son Uriel requested that I continue in that position, but I was forced to graciously decline the invitation, because of age and poor health.\nThis book, however, is not intended to be autobiography. I have had a great many adventures in my life as a knight of fine dining, but my intention for this book is much more specific. Many times I have been asked, \"What is the best thing you ever ate?\"\nThe answer to that is not a simple one. Much of the pleasure of a great meal is not only in the food: it is in the setting, the company, the mood. Eat an indifferently cooked roast or a simple stew with your one true love, and it is a meal to be remembered. Have an excellent twelve-course feast with dull company, while feeling slightly ill, and it will be forgotten, or remembered only with distaste.\nSometimes meals are memorable for the experiences that come before them.\nFairly recently, in northern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, I had a bit of bad luck. I was with a group of fishermen, observing their technique of capturing a very rare, very delicious fish called &lt;a href=\"Merringar\"&gt;Merringar&lt;/a&gt;. The fish is found only far from shore, so it was a week's voyage out beyond civilization. Well, we found our school of Merringar, but as the fishermen began spearing them, the blood in the water attracted a family of &lt;a href=\"Land%20Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;, who capsized the boat and everyone on it. I managed to save myself, but the fishermen and all our supplies were lost. Sailing is not, alas, a skill I have picked up over the years, and it took me three weeks, with no provisions, to find my way back to the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. I had managed to catch enough small fish to eat raw, but I was still delirious from hunger and thirst. The first meal I had on shore, of &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic roast boar, Jazbay wine, and, yes, filet of Merringar would have been excellent under any circumstances, but because of the threat of starvation I had faced, it was divine beyond words.\nSometimes meals are even memorable for the experiences that follow them.\nIn a tavern in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, I was introduced to a simple peasant dish called &lt;a href=\"Kollopi\"&gt;Kollopi&lt;/a&gt;, delicious little balls of flesh, thick with spices and juice, so savory I asked the proprietress whence they came. &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Pascost\"&gt;Mother Pascost&lt;/a&gt; explained that the Kollopi were an arboreal rodent that fed exclusively on the most tender branches of the graht-oak, and I was fortunate enough to be in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the annual harvest. I was invited to join with a small colony of &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt; monkeys, who alone could gather these succulent little mice. Because they lived only on the slenderest branches of the trees, and only on the ends of those same branches, the Imga had to climb beneath them and jump up to \"pick\" the Kollopi from their perches. Imga are, of course, naturally dexterous, but I was then relatively young and spry, and they let me help them. While I could never jump as high they could, with practice, I found that if I kept my head and upper body rigid, and launched off the ground with a scissors-like kick, I could reach the Kollopi on the lowest branches of the tree. I believe I gathered three Kollopi myself, though with considerable effort.\nTo this day, I salivate at the thought of Kollopi, but my mind is on the image of myself and several dozen Imgas leaping around beneath the shade of the graht-oaks.\nThen, of course, there are the rare meals memorable for what came before, after, and during the meal, which brings me to the finest thing I ever ate, the meal that began my lifelong obsession with excellent cuisine.\nAs a child growing up in &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. I did not care for food at all. I recognized the value of nutrition, for I was not a complete dullard, but I cannot say that mealtime brought me any pleasure at all. Partly, of course, this was the fault of my family's cook, who believed that spices were an invention of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and that good Imperials should like their food boiled, textureless and flavorless. Though I think she was alone in assigning a religious significance to this, my sampling of traditional Cyrodilic cuisine suggests that the philosophy is regrettably common in my homeland.\nThough I did not enjoy food per se, I was not a morose, unadventurous child in other respects. I enjoyed the fights in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and nothing made me happier than wandering the streets of my town, with my imagination as my only companion. It was on one such jaunt on a sunny &lt;a href=\"Day\"&gt;Fredas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt; that I made a discovery that changed my heart and my life.\nThere were several old abandoned houses down the street from my own home, and I often played around them, imagining them to be filled with desperate outlaws or haunted by hundreds of evil spirits. I never had the nerve to go inside. In fact, had I not that day seen some other children who had delighted in teasing me in the past, I would never have gone in. But I needed a sanctuary, so I ran into the closest one.\nThe house seemed to be as desolate on the inside as on the outside, further proof that no one lived there, and had not for some time. When I heard footsteps, I could only assume that the loathsome little urchins I hoped to avoid had followed me in. I escaped to the basement, and from there, past a broken-down wall that led to a well. I could still hear the footsteps above, and I decided that I was still loath to confront my tormentors. Knocking aside the rusty locks on the well, I slipped down below.\nThe well was dry, but I discovered it was far from empty. There was a sort of a sub-basement to the house, three large rooms that were clean, furnished, and evidently not abandoned at all. My senses told me someone was living in the house, after all: not only my sense of sight, but my sense of smell. For one of the rooms was a large red-painted kitchen, and spread out on the coals of the oven was a roast, carved into small morsels. Passing a beautiful and appropriate bas-relief of a mother carving a roast for her grateful children, I beheld the kitchen and the wonders within.\nLike I said, food had never interested me before, but I was transfixed, and even now as I write this, words fail me in describing the rich aroma that hung in the air. It was like nothing I had ever smelled in my family's kitchen, and I was unable to stop myself from popping one of the steaming chunks of meat into my mouth. The taste was magical, the flesh tender and sweet. Before I knew it, I had eaten everything on the stove, and I learned at that very second the truth that that food can and should be sublime.\nAfter gorging myself and having my culinary epiphany, I was conflicted on what to do. Part of me wanted to wait down in that red kitchen until the chef returned, so I could ask him what his secret recipe was for the delicious meat. Part of me recognized that I had stolen into someone's house and eaten their dinner, and it would be wise to leave while I could. That was what I did.\nTime and again, I've tried to return to that strange, wonderful place, but Cheydinhal has changed over time. Old houses have been reclaimed, and new houses abandoned. I know what to look for on the inside of the house - the well, the beautiful etching of a woman preparing to carve out a roast for her children, the red kitchen itself - but I have never been able to find the house again. After a while, as I grew older, I stopped trying. It is better as it remains in my memory, the most perfect meal I ever ate.\nThe inspiration for my life that followed all was cooked up, together with that fabulous meat, right there in the Red Kitchen."}

Lift! Scatter a handful of herbs into the bowl and pound again! The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; sat close together, knee to knee, bowls held in curve of their bent knees.\nRakhal chanted softly, swaying with her movements.

Yashirr had never sat in the circle before. In prior years, she'd gathered the herbs and clay, but nothing more. Now she sat at Rakhal's right hand in a place of honor. Pride rushed through the young &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orcs\"&gt;Wood Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, she had been chosen as an apprentice!\n\"Mauloch!\" Pound!\n\"Give us...\" Lift!\n\"...blood!\" Scatter!\nAt that final word, the women threw back their heads and released Mauloch's call, a throaty howl that echoed through the trees and nearby cliffs. Rakhal signaled their work's completion.\nThe tribe lined up to be painted with the fresh battle-red clay. Rakhal waved those she deemed unworthy or unfit for the battle aside. They weren't allowed to partake in the painting ritual.\nWhen Rakhal motioned to Yashirr to step from the line, Yashirr parted her lips to protest, then pursed them tightly. To question Rakhal's judgement would bring dishonor. Bowing her head in confused anger, Yashirr joined the handful of unselected Orcs.\nRakhal looked over the unselected, and pulled Yashirr to her side. \"Mauloch chose you to perform the next ritual, child. Take the blade and remember: Mauloch watches you.\"\nGuiding Yashirr's hand, Rakhal leaned over the empty vessel and slid the young Orc's blade across her outstretched neck. Rakhal's hand did not falter even as she slipped from consciousness in order to provide the next paint with the sacred blood of a true warrior."}

There was almost no warning. I mean, we were what... perhaps a mile from the nearest swamps? It was like the swamp suddenly swallowed up half of the city.\"\nI asked him to describe what happened from the beginning.\n\"I owned a farm just outside the Tear of time. We were planting the next season's crops and getting ready to store what we had harvested. Everything was going well until the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; exploded. Almost immediately, the ground rumbled and shook. Cracks started forming everywhere and then the water just started seeping through. It was awful. In a matter of hours, I was knee-deep in swamp water running for my life. Where I was running, I had no idea. At first I ran towards the city itself, but it looked like the walls were cracking. All around me, people were desperately trying to save their livestock and their families from the rising water. Just when the ground shaking finally died down, and I had a moment to think, there was a horrible cracking noise. I'll never forget it, because I knew what it was before I looked. The entire southern wall of Tear collapsed, sending guards tumbling into the swamp. I heard people screaming as they were covered by the rubble and forced down into the water. Forgetting my own problems, I looked over at my fellow farmers who were all staring at the carnage unfolding before us. Suddenly, we all just forgot our own problems and ran to help. There must have been hundreds of the poorer folks who lived outside the walls helping the richer ones who lived in the city. Never saw anything like that. I think we must have saved hundreds more that day.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Neria%20Relethyl\"&gt;Neria Relethyl&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;\nNeria was badly burned by the eruption, and had trouble speaking to me. She is currently convalescing at the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; even after all these years. I've tried to record her story to the best of my ability.\n\"It was such a terrible thing... the fire. It burned everything in its path. It flattened trees, turned our huts into splinters and knocked over towers like they were made from parchment. It all happened in an instant. A rumbling sound, then a massive wall of flame... it was so high it blocked out the sun. I thought that the world itself had split apart. It passed over the water and turned it to steam... vaporized everything it touched. When it finally hit us, I was blown off of my feet... didn't even have time to run away or seek shelter. I ended up in the riverbed next to the town, which kept some of the flames off of me. All around... could smell the charred stench of death. There were Dunmer that were burned alive and some never saw it coming. I lay in that riverbed for two days before the healers found me. When I could finally stand, Gnisis was gone. There wasn't a thing left... it's as though it was wiped from the face of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

As I tried to get him under control, there was a massive explosion from the center of the city. I saw the cantons fall apart before I was knocked off my feet. Then I remember the ground starting to rumble. It lasted for a long time and it receded into the distance as if directed toward the center of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. A few minutes later, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted, sending a huge cloud of fire into the sky. My pack guar had long since fled, and I decided I should do the same. I never stopped running until I reached &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nI asked him if he knew what had happened to Vivec City.\n\"I didn't hear until much later that the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; had struck the heart of the city. What I do know for certain is that many Dunmer lost their lives that day and that Vivec City is no more.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Deros%20Dran\"&gt;Deros Dran&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;\n\"The Red Year didn't heavily affect Mournhold itself, but it touched many of the people who lived there. A lot of us had relatives somewhere on Vvardenfell, and after the first day that the eruption occured we started receiving reports of widespread devistation in Vivec City, &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think a single night went by for months where you wouldn't hear someone openly weeping. It was a sad time for all of us.\"\nI asked if Mournhold had sustained any damage during the Red Year.\n\"I don't know why, but the destruction seemed to pass us by. A few Dunmer claimed that it was the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; watching over us, but others claimed that the Tribunal was to blame for everything. I actually saw a few of those disagreements come to blows. It was a strange time.\"\nI got an interesting response from Deros regarding Mournhold's role during the Red Year.\n\"Relief efforts began almost a month after the mountain erupted. It was actually a directive that came from the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; councilor that was living in Mournhold at the time. I can't remeber his name, but he took charge of the situation and sent soldiers, supplies, and able-bodied Dunmer to the outlying settlements that had been hit the hardest. I was sent to Balmora. The place was a mess; hardly anything left in town was still standing. I spent maybe two months there, helping to rebuild the town and getting my fellow Dunmer back on their feet. It started out as a burden, but it ended up being the most rewarding thing I'd ever done in my life. I started some friendships there that still last to this day, including my beloved wife.\""}
