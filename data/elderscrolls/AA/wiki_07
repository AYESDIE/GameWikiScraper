Rumors have been circulating around Skyrim that a child by the name of &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt; is trying to summon the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. This boy is in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, according to the rumors.\nBackground.\n\"I heard a rumor that a boy named Aventus Aretino, in Windhelm, has been attempting to contact the Dark Brotherhood. I should find this boy and speak with him, and find out why he wants to contact a guild of assassins.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhile walking around Skyrim, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will begin to hear rumors of a \"cursed child.\" Any innkeeper can be asked about the latest rumors and eventually, the person will mention that there is a child in Windhelm by the name of Aventus Aretino who is attempting to summon the Dark Brotherhood.\nTalk to Aventus Aretino.\nAventus Aretino can be found inside the Aretino Residence located near the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Quarter\"&gt;Gray Quarter&lt;/a&gt; in Windhelm. When first entering the Arentino Residence, Aventus is found chanting the Black Sacrament and asking the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; why she has not answered his prayers to send a Dark Brotherhood assassin to meet with him to receive the contract he has placed on Grelod the Kind.\nAfter initiating conversation with Aventus, he will tell the Dragonborn that he summoned the Dark Brotherhood because his mother died and he was sent to Honorhall Orphanage, in Riften. While there, the cruel matron, Grelod the Kind, abused him and the other children, causing him to run away. Aventus believes that the Dragonborn is a Dark Brotherhood assassin, despite the character's conversation options emphasizing that is not at all the case, and will ask the player to kill Grelod the Kind. When told that assassinations do not come cheap, he claims to have a rather valuable reward.\nKill Grelod the Kind.\nGrelod can be found in Honorhall Orphanage in Riften. When talked to she will be rude and if the player tells her that Aventus says hello, she will become infuriated and swear revenge upon the boy. It is at this point that she is extremely hostile and alienated, so the player will be unable to speak with her further.\nShe does not prove any challenge to the Dragonborn, as one hit from any weapon, even fists, will be enough to kill her. The player can alternatively call on a follower to strike her down. The children at the orphanage will not report the Dragonborn to the Riften Guard either, but rather cheer upon her demise. It is advised, however, to carry out the deed within Honorhall Orphanage. Also be sure to ignore &lt;a href=\"Constance%20Michel\"&gt;Constance Michel&lt;/a&gt; rather than to kill her, as this will trigger a bounty in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. Grelod lets out a loud death scream when she is slain, so a stealth kill would be best to keep the Dragonborn hidden, especially in Grelod's bedroom with the door closed and using an arrow or crossbow bolt to carry out the task, so when the kids and Constance hear the scream, the Dragonborn is not discovered.\nOnce Grelod has been dispatched, return to Aventus in Windhelm for the reward.\nReward.\nAventus will reward the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Aretino%20Family%20Heirloom\"&gt;Aretino Family Heirloom&lt;/a&gt; which has a base value of 100 . This will also initiate the next stage of the Dark Brotherhood questline \"&lt;a href=\"With%20Friends%20Like%20These...\"&gt;With Friends Like These...&lt;/a&gt;.\" To start this quest, sleep in any bed away from Windhelm after having received the &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;Mysterious Note&lt;/a&gt;, or before getting the note."}

But they cannot leave this way as &lt;a href=\"Irien\"&gt;Irien&lt;/a&gt; and the guards are out there. Follow Jakarn to the side exit and leave the Grave.\nWhen outside, Jakarn asks for help with the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;goblins&lt;/a&gt;, as he has left something there. Head to the goblin mine and enter with Jakarn. Here he will say that he will trust them to get the gem and he will take care of the goblins. Enter the storage room on the upper level and look for the gem in a chest. After retrieving the gem, meet Jakarn at the beach as he suggested.\nAfter exiting the mine, Jakarn is nowhere to be found.

Choose what to say to her, either say he was not there or say the gem was found. If the first answer was chosen, head over to the &lt;a href=\"Screaming%20Mermaid\"&gt;Inn&lt;/a&gt; to find Jakarn.\nOutside the Inn an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; woman is standing, looking very angry. &lt;a href=\"Irien\"&gt;Irien&lt;/a&gt; says that if the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is looking for Jakarn he is inside the tavern with a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; girl. She says: \"Jakarn is a liar and I hate him, but if I didn't hate the Headman more I'd tell him where he is.\"\nGo inside the Inn and find Jakarn. He is glad they made it out the mine. Give him the gem, and he will reward them\u00a0with the &lt;a href=\"Jakarn%27s%20Machete\"&gt;Jakarn's Machete&lt;/a&gt; and some as well as agreeing to join &lt;a href=\"Kaleen\"&gt;Kaleen&lt;/a&gt;'s crew."}

Inspector Tarma and &lt;a href=\"Haldoril\"&gt;Haldoril&lt;/a&gt; are sent to the Laughing Moons Plantation to make sure everything is in order and that the crops are secure from thieves.\nPersonality.\nTarma is a devoted inspector, appearing to want nothing more than to ensure the safety of everyone. Although Juranda-ra does not agree with him, he believes that insecure crops could be taken by thieves, leading to increased smuggling. While he takes his job seriously, he is not emotionless, as he complements the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; at a job well done, and despite the unorthodox methods, does recognize that the rats have been dealt with. Strangely enough, he does not appear to like &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; cuisine, calling it \"too cultural.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Pinch%20of%20Sugar\"&gt;A Pinch of Sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspector Tarma arrives at the plantation after the &lt;a href=\"Thunderbug\"&gt;Thunderbug&lt;/a&gt; eggs are acquired. He begins to question why Juranda-ra is stalling, to which she points out the Vestige as her \"specialist\" on the matter. After the rat nests are destroyed, he acknowledges the success and states that everything is in order.\nConversations.\nWhen Inspector Tarma arrives:\nJuranda-ra: \"We did not expect you so soon, Inspector Tarma.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"One must arrive early to see the truth of things.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"The truth? But we have nothing to hide, Inspector.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"I hear that often, Clan Mother. Far too often.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"I can't help but notice the abundance of vermin about, Clan Mother.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"The great storm was not kind to us. Still, we have the matter in hand.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Do you?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Indeed, we brought in a specialist. This one assures you, Inspector, the matter will be resolved shortly.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Clan Mother, tell me your thoughts on the skooma trade.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Moon-sugar is more than a spice, to some of us. Using it to brew skooma is an abomination.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Then you would have no idea who might supply such an operation\u2026?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"None in this one's employ. We want nothing to do with skooma, Inspector. If we learn any of our customers brew the stuff, you'll be the first to know.\"\nAfter destroying the rat nests:\nInspector Tarma: \"Tell me, Clan Mother. Wherever did you find this specialist of yours?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Rajhin's own luck, Inspector. As though ja-Kha'jay provided us with the one we most needed.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Quaint. Might I suggest a more rigorous selection process? Freelancers are not always so \u2026 competent.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"As you can see, vermin aren't tolerated at Laughing Moons Plantation!\"\nInspector Tarma: \"A spectacular display. If all your hirelings are as capable as your specialist, you've no need to worry.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"This one is delighted by your words, Inspector.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"I said 'if,' Clan Mother.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"There's no question, Juranda-ra. Your Specialist certainly showed the vermin their place.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Of Course, Inspector. We could expect nothing less of specialists!\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Haldoril, make a note. 'Unorthodox methods, but vermin-free.'\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Haldoril\"&gt;Haldoril&lt;/a&gt;:\"' \"Sir.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"How was your voyage to our island? You arrived before the great storm, yes?\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Yes, we arrived in Mistral before it struck. I understand the rest of the fleet was not so lucky.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"My condolences, Inspector. Khenarthi's price is not always so high. We can only hope she'll return some of those she has taken.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"I'll require accommodations for myself and my aid. You'll provide them, of course?\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Naturally. Will you be dining with us, as well?\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Erm \u2026 that will not be necessary. Khajiiti fare is too \u2026 cultural for my palate.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Will you be staying with us long, Inspector?\"\nInspector Tarma: \"As long as necessary. One can only tolerate so much fresh air.\"\nJuranda-ra: \"Truly? Then we'll endeavor to make your stay comfortable.\"\nInspector Tarma: \"Don't fret overmuch. If my duty requires it, I can tolerate such \u2026 rustic accommodations.\""}

He told Colin that after his speech Vel appeared to be less informed than his most junior inspector.\nIt is later revealed Attrebus was alive.

He ordered him to tell him anything that could help them, or if he thought it was best not to tell him, then he should act. Marall also told Colin that a reliable source claimed that Prince Attrebus had been seen at the waterfront."}

My research into the cult's existence has permitted me a unique opportunity: a private interview with one of its members.\n\u2014 So tell me, how did you come to be a member of the Spider Cult?\nCultist: As it is with all things, the weavings of Her web led me into the Spinner's embrace.\n\u2014 You mean Mephala herself recruited you?\nCultist: Is the fly recruited into the Spider's web? No. I could as much avoid this fate as avoid my own mortality.\n\u2014 Interesting. Let's talk about your fellow enthusiasts for a moment. What can you tell me about the other members of your cult?\nCultist: I can't share their names, but I could tell you what they do. We have a leader called \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Widow\"&gt;the Widow&lt;/a&gt;.\" She gives us our purpose and communes with the Spinner Herself. Sometimes these purposes require a killing. Such responsibilities fall to our &lt;a href=\"Deathweavers\"&gt;Deathweavers&lt;/a&gt;, who carry out the act in accordance with the Spinner's will. The rest of us are labeled &lt;a href=\"Scuttlers\"&gt;Scuttlers&lt;/a&gt;, as we hurry along more discreet paths to weave our master's webs.\n\u2014 Fascinating. Have you ever killed anyone in the name of your master?\nCultist: Not yet.\n\u2014 Is there any truth to the claim that Spider Cults are little more than debauched orgy clubs?\nCultist: There is some truth to that, yes.\n\u2014 Oh. Would you care to elaborate?\nCultist: Seduction and copulation are powerful tools. Often, induction into the cult requires a member to engage in such activities with the Widow or a designee. Some Webs are more \u2026 zealous about this practice than others.\n\u2014 I see. How exactly would a prospective member apply?\nCultist: Is this for your research?\n\u2014 Naturally.\nCultist: How unfortunate. I could share that information with you, but only if you are actually going to join us.\n\u2014 Ah. Well \u2026 that's not out of the question. Perhaps this is all part of Mephala's plan, eh? Caught in her web, as it were?\nCultist: I believe this interview is over."}

He will ask you to speak to Azum to find out what is going on. \nAzum can be found among the tents; she cannot tell you anything about Tand's whereabouts, but will direct you to people who might have seen something. You can speak to either Dulan at the Lizard Races, Khaba at the Troll Fights or Bunul at the Spikeball Track. Dulan is the closest to you, just to the north. Dulan can be persuaded to tell you that Tand ended up owing a lot of money and got drunk, and that &lt;a href=\"Hadran\"&gt;Hadran&lt;/a&gt; tends to make drunkards who owe a lot of money disappear. \nHead up the wooden platform to the north to speak to Bunul; he will only talk if you agree to play a game of Spikeball first. Head to the starting line; the game is essentially a race, in which you can stun your opponents by throwing spikeballs at them. Winning the race is not dificult; just stun your opponents and get the lead. Talk to Bunul afterward and he will tell you he saw Tand running from Hadran's men; he was quite the athlete.

You will find Hadran inside; he will tell you that he is making Tand work off his debt, and that he is going to sell Tand once he is used up. You can offer to pay Tand's debts yourself or buy Tand, at which point Hadran will offer to take you to him. This is a trap though; you will be ambushed by Hadran's men.

Eventually, you will come across Faraniel standing over the body of Captain Alphaury; the shadow walkers got to him before she did. Speak with her and she will tell you how to save the Khajiit Kamu. you need to collect spriggan bark and infuse it with the light of the wisps here, so that you can see the Shadow Walkers' runners. \nHead into the woods and kill a few spriggans for their bark. Once you have three pieces of bark, return to Faraniel and she will treat it so that it can be used to see the walkers and follow them to Kamu. It will also make you invisible to the shadow walkers. To activate it, use the wisps of light found throughout the forest; use a new wisp when it runs out. Cross the bridge and start your search; once you spot a runner, give chase. You will find the Khajiit being rescued from the shadow walkers by a &lt;a href=\"Lamia\"&gt;Lamia&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Tzik%27nith\"&gt;Tzik'nith&lt;/a&gt;. Tzik'nith and Faraniel will hold a discussion on who should care for the cat. Speak with Kamu and he will tell you that there is something in the tower here that is important for defeating Molag Bal. He will tell you that the Bosmer and the Lamia both claim to know how to get inside, but that neither seems all that trustworthy. \nAt this point, you get to choose whether you ask the elf or the lamia for help. The Lamia will ask you to help defeat the elves; Faraniel will ask you to help convince her clan that Molag Bal is using them.

Provided you complete the required reading prior to each session, you will acquire a clear understanding of these mythogenic forces that will serve as a sufficient base for deeper study in a number of disciplines, from historical inquiry to theoretical aetheroplanar manipulation.\nYour cultural and personal preconceptions will be challenged. Common myths will be dispelled, from crude misinterpretations of the Aedra as powerful creator-beings of \"good\" looking down upon and tinkering with &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; to the supposition of Aedra and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; as locked in perpetual extra-Mundic war. The explorations presented in this course have, in the past, offended certain dogmatic students (especially in regards to the Divines), but I urge you to approach these topics as a scholar and not as a priest.\nUnderstanding the Aedra beyond creation mythology and the convention of the Divines will allow you to grow as a scholar. The very approach this series demands will instruct you in the proper methodology of scholarly pursuits: we will study rare and obscure texts, unravel complex symbolic structures, and approach each topic from a critical standpoint.\nThe five primary lecture topics are as follows:\nLecture One: Survey of Origination Myths\nLecture Two: Anuic-Padomaic Interplay\nLecture Three: Aedra v. Daedra\nLecture Four: Aedric Energies and Influence\nLecture Five: Beyond Mere Divines\nOutside reading and sedulous note-taking are necessary for full understanding of the lectures. All required outside texts referenced can be found in the fine library on the grounds. Do not wait to the last possible moment to prepare for a lecture; only a few copies of certain ancient and obscure texts will be available.\nNaturally, you will be inclined to explore some of the subjects presented further. Your newfound knowledge of Aedric beings, their involvement in creation, a broader understanding of their relationship to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, and exposure to current debates will propel you to additional studies. For additional reading, I recommend works by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Hetchfeld\"&gt;Brother Hetchfeld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Mikhael%20Karkuxor\"&gt;Brother Mikhael Karkuxor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aicantar\"&gt;Aicantar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt; (beyond those we will reference through the series). Be ever vigilant in your studies, however, and avoid biased or poorly-researched works, such as those scribbled by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cinnabar\"&gt;Cinnabar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;. Always seek refutations and take no one scholar's words for absolute truth."}

Every performance must have some engaging or surprising element to it or it shall fall flat regardless of the entertainer's other skills. Find a hook, preferably one tailored to your audience, that captures their imagination, ire, or hearts\u2014preferably all three! Then you have the foundation of an unforgettable performance. Look to famous characters, historical events, a loathsome monster, or anything else you know will command the attention and interest of your patrons.\nNow that you have the heart of your act figured out, it's time to make it truly impressive! Some will tell you that you need to have explosions and trained beasts to be successful, but the truth is that creative use of any and all available resources will likely serve you just as well. Can you throw your voice or speak several languages? Do you know someone with even rudimentary talent in magic? Do you have access to brightly-colored fabric or color-shifting kindlepitch? Any of these things and more can be a key component of your performance and nothing should be overlooked.\nWith the premise and supporting mechanics determined you can now start refining your script! You never want to be at a loss for words on the stage so this part is just as critical as the rest. Start with a rough draft and work from there, keeping in mind the tone and context you've already established to ensure it all comes together.

A member of the Mages Guild had summoned a Daedra and failed to control it, and so had created the story of the breech to get the Order's attention. Because of her deception, done to avoid paying the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate the Daedra, the Quester willingly hands the Agent a random amount of for putting their life in extraordinary danger.\nThe Agent will also receive a boost to their reputation within the Order, while penalties for failing the quest remain true to the Order's standards:"}

Trust me, if they're not on your side? You're cranked. That being said, they're not the easiest group to understand. The Apostles aren't chasing the glory of their ancestors or the thrill of battle. They don't burden themselves with thoughts of war, or famine, or disease. In fact, they rarely burden themselves at all, getting factotums to do everything but wipe their\u2014but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start at what they do care about.\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; is not only the god of the Apostles, but their mentor of sorts. The relationship is rather like needy students with a particularly distant teacher. The Apostles always seem to be seeking his approval on whatever project they're working on, though I doubt they'll ever get it. Their God of Mysteries keeps to himself more often than not.\nAll of the Apostles work towards one goal, something they call &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;-Ensuing, or &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; Final, or Second Nirn, so on and so forth. If you want to bore yourself with the details, give the Sermons of Sotha Sil a read. And then another read. And then a third read so you can actually understand any of it, if you happen to be so inclined. All I know is that they're not so fond of this world, and they're trying to make it better. Somehow.\nNow you would think that making the world better would include what could generally be recognized as acts of generosity, or at least basic human kindness. You would be wrong on that account. You see, the perfect Nirn doesn't really include things like feeding the hungry or sheltering the sick. It does involve making a scrap ton of machines. For some reason.\nSo, to get in good with the Apostles you have to help them conduct their experiments of gods know what. This means demonstrating a knack with magic, machines, or probably both. If you don't have those skills handy I suggest you listen closely for some other opportunity. The Clockwork Apostles are not above asking for favors, especially if it's for a task they think beneath them. Sure, they might not have the easiest or most wholesome requests in mind, but I suggest you take the chance while it's available."}

And, just as always, Feliwoin is here to deliver. Bringing you nothing but the latest and most relevant news, I knew exactly what role I must play in this new proclamation. I am of course talking about the new laws that allow our &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; allies access to the shores of Summerset. Many are concerned about the impacts of such an event, with good reason. Are our streets safe? Are our homes secure?\nReaders, I made it my mission to find out.\nI started with &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, home to our royal court and most regal &lt;a href=\"Proxy%20Queen%20Alwinarwe\"&gt;Proxy Queen Alwinarwe&lt;/a&gt;, may long she live and reign gloriously in these most troubling of times. Walking the streets, I made sure to disguise myself in garb as common as I could possibly find. Not a soul knew who I was, and that was just the way I wanted it. Crawling through the common rabble would allow me access to our new so-called-allies.\nMy first encounter involved a rather brusque &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; making a purchase at the grocery. I observed from the sides, ever vigilant toward any case of sticky paws, given their propensity toward thievery. I was unable to observe any theft, but was there to bear witness a rather astonishing exchange. This Khajiit went up to the store clerk, put his items on the counter, and simply asked, \"How much?\"\nNo, you did not read that wrong dear readers! No greeting, not so much as an honor or a praise! Appareantly, our allies are too good for even basic, common manners. Oh, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; above, I was simply staggered. I watched in horror as the poor clerk tried her best to respond in a far more befitting way as this brutish Khajiit continuously rebuked all words of politeness. After a few moments of cringing, I simply could not bear the weight of such impropriety and had to leave the store, my pulse drumming from what I had witnessed.\nMy next sighting occurred while stopping at one of Alinor's many opulent fountains. Soon after taking my seat on a nearby bench, I witnessed a hoard of little Khajiits run to the fountain. My, there must have been at least ten of them! Without any sense of control, all at once they plunged into the crystal waters of the once tranquil fountain, splashing about in the most barbaric of fashions. Their mother came up from behind, clucking her tongue like a mad &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Online%29\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;. One by one, her children slowly stepped out from the fountain, talking excitedly all the while.\nI had of course heard that Khajiit gave birth to litters, but I never thought they would have so many children of the same age! I can see the population rising among our furred allies tenfold every decade, what with such ... tendencies. Not to mention the control these mothers seem to have on their children, apparently not thinking to teach them a modicum of manners.\nIt was while I was sitting in shock, mouth agape, that the most perplexing interaction occurred. Perhaps it was my blatant observation of his kind, but a young Khajiit standing near decided to strike up conversation. I will not do you disservice by writing this cretin's dialogue here, but I will tell you that it involved the creation of children and how he would be willing to render his \"services\" for such an activity. I turned ruby red as, in face of such lewdness, I left at once.\nI of course need not remind my dear readers of the other reputations that I, being a lawful citizen of Summerset, am not able to observe. Surely, had I been able to risk my safety to observe more unsavory sections of the city, I would have seen a rise in &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; trades and black-market deals. Yes, I only have rumors to guide these claims, but the Khajiit are known for their inclination toward the illegal. I have no doubt that crime statistics will continuously rise, given their habitation of our beloved homeland.\nLet us hope that our leaders will soon see the error of their ways. Perhaps these allies are necessary in the war effort, but we're fighting a battle here on the very shores of our beloved island! A battle against brutish, lewd, and often miscreant Khajiits who threaten to rot our society from the inside out. With just one day's worth of observation, I can safely say that all citizens have every right to be anxious!\nWe must all rise together and petition for the return of our peaceful seclusion. Appeal to our local leaders, inform your fellow citizens, and keep an eye out for those who have already invaded our homelands. Keep a tight hold of both your purses and children as you travel our once safe streets. Don't allow apologists to sway you, dear readers. Know the truth, written by my own, trusted hand!\nMy next issue will continue my investigation, this time into the habits and culture of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, our lesser kin. Be sure to purchase it so I can continue my important work!"}

We &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; chose to walk within the glorious footsteps of those who went before us. We are the golden, the powerful, the just. Others, like the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed our ways and were cursed for their impunity. They pray to their &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;false gods&lt;/a&gt; and muck about in the ash.\nAnd then there are our current allies, the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Well, what is there to say about the Wood Elves? It is true that they follow our gods, however lightly, given their clear preference for &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;. That, and their pointed ears, are where my comparisons must stop. Everything else about them, from their culture to their stature, is far removed from our level of perfection.\nStill, do we have anything to fear from our primitive cousins? I made it my mission to find out.\nThe stars were keen for me to complete this particular assignment, for it was just as I set my mind to investigate that I was invited to an exclusive engagement. The details, of course, shall remain anonymous (though I can say it was within the abode of a rather high-ranking member of our royalty), but it gave me the opportunity I had been seeking. Among those on the invitation list, which I of course perused before sending my acceptance, were several Wood Elves.\nHere I could see our allies attempt to socialize with some of the most prestigious members of Summerset society. What an opportunity to witness how well they fit into our culture. With notebook in hand and wearing one of my many gorgeous dresses, I eagerly traveled to the abode of my host.\nI could barely contain my excitement as I made my way to the dining table. There, clustered together in a little clan of their own, were the Wood Elves who would be the focus of my investigation. I was quickly told by a fellow acquaintance that they were followers of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, a lucky coincidence if I ever saw one. It was exactly this barbaric belief that many feared would clash to fiercely against Summerset's pristine principles.\nThe first strangeness occurred when the meals were served to them. As we know, the Green Pact does not allow for the use or consumption of plant material. As such, our most gracious host saw fit to serve these Wood Elves nothing but the finest cuts of Summerset meat. They ate their meal with what can only be described as ravenous gusto, with not one care for the proper use of their silverware. Why, one even scooped up the juices upon her plate with a dessert spoon!\nAs I watched this small tribe devour its meal, I could only imagine a legion of Wood Elves arriving to consume our local &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Summerset%29\"&gt;fauna&lt;/a&gt;. With that being their only sustenance, can we truly trust our little cousins to restrain themselves? There may come a day when no &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Online%29\"&gt;chicken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pig%20%28Online%29\"&gt;pig&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"Cat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; will grace our tranquil island. Can we truly allow for such a future?\nStill, I was determined to engage with these guests. After dinner I made my way to one, my decorum as impeccable as always, and asked what brought him to our island.\n\"I'm 'ere on be'alf of the king,\" he told me, his rather thick accent marring each syllable. \"Gotta' show you 'igh Elfs that we're civilized like.\"\nEach word he muttered, of course, led me farther from that conclusion. Still, I politely inquired what he believed Wood Elves would bring to the glory of Summerset. What contribution could his people make for the betterment of all the High Elves who called our isle home?\nI'm afraid he got rather coarse after that simple question. His wording was such that one might assume ignorance, but the vulgarity of his word choice showed outright hostility. I'm afraid to say he dared to call into question my pure intentions by asking such a question, adding more than a few choice descriptions about my person!\nI was simply flabbergasted. Quickly, one of his companions apologized to me and whisked him away. Still, the damage was done. I had seen quite enough of the manners and propriety of those we had chosen to welcome into our borders.\nI also remind you, my dear readers, the cultural differences that may prove quite perilous to our way of life. Cannibalism, blatant thievery, trees that walk about! How can we trust the Wood Elves to live properly alongside us, rather than running around in their little bone huts? From all that I've witnessed, I cannot believe such a thing is possible.\nI urge you, dear readers, to protest. Raise your voices against the moderate tide! Allow not a step more to be taken. Instead, push back. We must return Summerset to the glory of the past, and once again make it a home for High Elves and High Elves only.\nWill you join me in that cause?"}

I'd stake my reputation on it,\" Investigator Vale said.\n\"I swear, he didn't have a thing to drink all night! Didn't see him eat anything either,\" the bartender of &lt;a href=\"the%20Lonely%20Troll\"&gt;the Lonely Troll&lt;/a&gt; said while he nervously wrung a towel through his hands, \"But he looked scared. Jumpy.\"\nInvestigator Vale stood over the body of the male Nord that lay on the floor of the once-bustling tavern. Much of the place cleared out when the man dropped dead in the middle of the evening rush, but a few brave patrons continued to drink in corners out of sight of the corpse.\nThe average Nord's commitment to mead was something to be respected, Vale thought.\n\"Strange. What was he doing here if he wasn't eating or drinking?\" Vale mused aloud, \"And how in the world was he poisoned?\"\nThe attractive guard captain folded her arms across her chest and frowned, \"A sober Nord in a tavern. That always spells trouble.\"\nVale smiled, \"My thoughts exactly, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aeja\"&gt;Captain Aeja&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWithout so much as a warning, Investigator Vale pushed herself away from the bar and made her way toward the tavern's recesses. Captain Aeja hurried along behind her. She was much taller but found it hard to keep up with the quick, curvaceous private investigator as she navigated the small pockets of people left inside the tavern.\n\"Investigator, where are you going?\"\nVale stopped in front of a table tucked into the back of the tavern. There, a handsome man sat by himself, save for a pet &lt;a href=\"Scorpion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt; crawling on his shoulder. As the two women approached, the man grinned widely and gestured with his sloshing tankard.\n\"Hail, ladies! To what do I owe the honor of having two lovely women approach my table?\"\nInvestigator Vale slid into the seat next to him with a vulpine smile, \"I noticed your tankard is full.\"\nThe man's expression did not falter, as Vale expected it to. He was either a very good actor, or her hunch was wrong. But her hunches were never wrong.\n\"Are you interested in helping me with that?\" the man asked with a waggle of his brow.\nVale saw Captain Aeja stiffen beside her, her hand clenching the pommel of her sheathed blade. The young captain was rather alluring when she got all protective, Vale thought. But there would be time for that later.\n\"No, merely curious about the reason for your hesitation,\" she said with a smile.\nThe man adjusted the sleeve of his robe with a subtle movement, \"Sometimes a man prefers to savor his drink. Is that a crime?\"\n\"Not at all,\" Vale said coolly, \"Unless, of course, you're staying sober to watch the fruits of your labor play out in a crowded tavern.\"\n\"That's quite a bold accusation,\" he scoffed, \"You can't walk around accusing anyone who isn't drunk of being a murderer.\"\n\"True. Though I can accuse someone with a deadly azure scorpion of being a murderer.\"\n\"Zaleya would never hurt anyone,\" the man protested.\n\"Not of her own volition, surely,\" Vale said, \"But that particular breed has been domesticated. She'd take orders from her master if instructed.\"\nThe man narrowed his eyes, \"You have no proof!\"\nThe Investigator held out a delicate hand. Her eyes flashed dangerously. \"Then let her sting me.\"\nCaptain Aeja balked, \"What? Investigator, don't!\"\n\"To kill a man of that size, lovely Zaleya would have had to expend much, if not all, of her venom. It will take time for her to replenish that. Therefore, if I'm correct, I should be completely safe.\"\nThe captain eyed the plucky investigator warily, but finally turned her gaze on the man. \"Well? Let's see it then.\"\nThe man's expression didn't change, but Investigator Vale saw fury spark in his eyes. A muscle in his jaw jumped as he picked up the scorpion and placed it in the investigator's waiting hand. He made a soft clicking noise with his tongue, and the scorpion's tail plunged into Vale's palm.\nAlmost simultaneously, the man jumped up and tried to run. Investigator Vale, who stood calmly cradling the scorpion, stepped deftly to the side to give Captain Aeja room. The tall guard shoved the man back into his seat so hard the chair tipped backward and spilled him onto the floor. Before he could scramble back to his feet, Captain Aeja drew her sword and laid it at the base of his throat.\nInvestigator Vale smiled and stroked the scorpion with a delicate finger, \"My, you are full of spirit, aren't you, Zaleya?\"\n\"Investigator, are you all right?\" the captain asked.\n\"Never better,\" Vale replied.\n\"What kind of woman are you?\" the man choked, \"You were supposed to fall to your knees in pain!\"\n\"I only fall to my knees for very specific occasions, my dear,\" Vale said smugly, and then let the scorpion crawl from her hand and onto the table, \"Speaking of which, Captain Aeja, once we're finished here I'd love to buy you a drink.\"\nThe attractive guard blushed and tried unsuccessfully to conceal a smile, \"As you say, Investigator.\"\n\"Though,\" Investigator Vale said with a wink, \"Perhaps we'll pick a different tavern.\""}

It happens. Not every death hides a conspiracy or a murder.\"\nInvestigator Vale gave Velnea a dazzling smile before turning back to address her father. \"I'll be the judge of that, my dear councilor,\" she said with evident excitement. \"After all, it's what I do.\"\nVale and Velnea walked side by side beneath the massive mushrooms that towered behind Master Adren's alchemy shop. The old alchemist had been Velnea's beloved mentor since she was a young girl, instructing her in the alchemical arts as well as encouraging other academic pursuits. There was a garden toward the back of the area, displaying a harvest of plants and flowers favored by alchemists. An easel was set up nearby, holding a canvas that showed the alchemist sitting beside his beloved garden. The painting was not quite finished.\n\"Adren always told me I could be anything I wanted to be,\" Velnea mused. \"I didn't have to become a merchant or a trader if my father's life didn't appeal to me. He \u2026 encouraged me to \u2026 dream.\"\n\"Sounds like he was a wonderful person,\" Vale said cheerfully as she marveled at the nix-hound that wandered over to investigate the strange visitor. \"And what is your dream, dear Velnea, if you don't mind me asking?\"\nVelnea blushed, hesitated, and stepped over to the unfinished painting. She said, \"I want to be a painter. I love to draw, and Adren helped me develop my talent. Landscapes, portraits, still lifes \u2026 I've created quite a body of work and he said that each new painting was better than the last. I was in the middle of this one when \u2026. I miss that old alchemist. A lot.\"\nVale bent down to examine the ground beneath one of the tree-like mushrooms. \"And this is where you found the alchemist?\" she asked.\nVelnea shivered and clutched her arms tightly. \"Yes. I came by to visit. When I couldn't find Adren inside his shop, I assumed he had come out here to read or tend to his garden. Instead, I found him lying there, face up and eyes open. I'll never forget the sight of him.\"\nThe investigator stood up and scanned the rest of the backyard. \"You said nothing was missing? Hmm. According to your painting, one of the flowers has disappeared.\"\nVelnea looked at the unfinished painting and saw the vibrant and exotic bloom rising from the patch beside the image of her mentor. Then she examined the garden and let out a squeak of surprise. \"You're right! I can't believe I didn't notice that before! It's gone!\"\n\"And if your depiction is accurate, the missing plant is a rare crimson &lt;a href=\"dragonthorn\"&gt;dragonthorn&lt;/a&gt;,\" Vale said. \"A much sought after plant when it comes to alchemy. And this discoloration on the stem of the mushroom. That indicates that the surface of the fungus interacted with a garlic snail and produced a plume of noxious gas. Quite toxic, as I understand it.\"\n\"A garlic snail? In Adren's garden? He was too good a gardener to allow such a pest to take root among his mushrooms,\" Velnea said.\n\"Then murder it is, my dear,\" Vale said. \"Tell me, did Adren have any rivals among the local alchemists?\"\nInvestigator Vale entered Dirani's flower shop and walked confidently toward the older &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; who was busy working on a floral arrangement that included flora and fungi. Following behind Vale were Velnea and a House Hlaalu soldier. Vale paused to sniff at the arrangement-in-progress before she stepped over to a large pot containing freshly turned soil. Sticking out of the soil was a crimson dragonthorn.\n\"Well, that's an extremely rare flower,\" Vale said, bending to examine the plant more closely. \"And look. It has the same small yellow dots on the petals, just like in your painting, dear Velnea.\"\nDirani looked from Vale to the soldier and back again, clearly nervous and sweating uncomfortably. \"What \u2026 what are you implying?\" she eventually managed to stammer.\n\"I never imply,\" Vale said, placing her hand on a glass case sitting on the counter. The case contained a small colony of garlic snails. Vale tapped the side with one long, slender finger. \"I'll say the words plainly. You murdered Master Adren so that you could acquire his prized crimson dragonthorn.\"\n\"That's \u2026 that's preposterous!\" Dirani protested. Then she turned and ran out through the back of the flower shop. The Hlaalu soldier followed quickly after her.\n\"She's going to get away,\" said Velnea, disappointment evident in her sad voice.\n\"Nonsense, my dear,\" Vale said. \"Your soldier seems more than capable of apprehending an old woman. Now what do you say? I'd love it if you'd paint my portrait. Tell me, how do you feel about nudes?\""}

To begin your journey, find Ambassador Lazgara in one of the following cities: Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, or Vulkhel Guard.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter either receiving a letter from Forge-Mother Alga, or speaking with the Ambassador in the aforementioned cities, the Vestige must make their way to &lt;a href=\"Merchant%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Merchant's Gate&lt;/a&gt; and rendezvous with the caravan there. After entering through the gate, and approaching the caravan, the Vestige will find out that it has been sacked and looted by a band of Reachmen known as the \"Winterborn Clan.\" When speaking to a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; caravan guard, &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, she will tell them the following:\n\"Did Orsinium send you? Are you part of the reinforcements? The Winterborn came out of nowhere. It happened so fast. They took our cargo into the hills and the Orc peasants chased them. That's when Chief Bazrag and his warriors arrived.\"\nWas the chief part of your caravan? \"No, we were the caravan guards. Bazrag said he was on partol, looking for Winterborn marauders. Some scary Reach warlord named Ice-Heart leads them. Even Bazrag seemed a bit nervous just talking about him. Now go help the chief before it's too late!\"\nAfter this conversation, the Vestige will have to head up the mountain to rescue the ambushed Orc peasants from the Winterborn marauders. When the Vestige approaches the sacked caravan surrounded with several injured peasants, they will witness an Orc caravan guard being shot dead by a &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Archer\"&gt;Winterborn Archer&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the Winterborn marauders will ambush the Vestige. After defeating the group, an injured peasant will urge the Vestige to seek for more peasants in the mountains, as they have fled there after being ambushed. However, after reaching the entrance of the ice-covered cave the peasants fled to, the Vestige will find out they have all been frozen to dead by Urfon Ice-Heart. Inside the cave is one of Chief Bazrag's soldiers, &lt;a href=\"Ulsha\"&gt;Ulsha&lt;/a&gt;. When spoken to, she will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"I saw what you did out there. Thanks for helping the clan Orcs. The ones in here? I think it's too late to help them. Ice-Heart... he froze them solid. The bastard's got magic the likes of which I've never seen.\"\nAfter this, the Vestige will have to search for clues as to where the maruaders disappeared to. Several questmarkers will appear on the map, but the marker near the river is the only correct one. When reaching the riverbank, the Vestige will run into &lt;a href=\"Olarz%20the%20Cunning\"&gt;Olarz the Cunning&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Winterborn clan and a powerful sorcerer. The Vestige may optionally defeat him, or they may take the note that lies on a wooden chest behind Olarz. After reading the note, the Vestige will discover an Orc has betrayed Orsinium and gave away the location of the caravan to Ice-Heart's Winterborn. The note is signed by \"Vulture.\" The next objective will be to show the note to Chief Bazrag. After reaching Chief Bazrag in a mountain pass near Orsinium, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"You're the outsider who leaped into the bears' den to fight the Winterborn? Ulsha and the Wood Elf mentioned you. Surprised you didn't end up all bruised and bloodly like the rest of these fools. This is our home, not an amusement for your pleasure!\"\nAfter this conversation, the Vestige will have to enter Orsinium and ask around for the traitor in the local &lt;a href=\"The%20Greedy%20Gut\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;. When entering the inn, the Vestige will hear the innkeeper, &lt;a href=\"Shulthog\"&gt;Shulthog&lt;/a&gt;, speak about a large amount of gold he has received. When spoken to, he will tell them the following:\n\"It's a good day, friend! I've got gold in my pocket and a full mug in my hand! So, what can I do for you?\"\nThe Vestige will have to find Gulug by following his scent. This is no hard task, because the scent leaves a distinct green cloud behind. By following the cloud through the city, the Vestige will eventually reach &lt;a href=\"Ufgel%27s%20Bathhouse%20and%20Laundry\"&gt;Ufgel's Bathhouse and Laundry&lt;/a&gt;, where Gulug will await them. When entering the bathhouse, the Vestige is able to overhear a conversation between &lt;a href=\"Ufgel\"&gt;Ufgel&lt;/a&gt; and Gulug. Gulug brags about his wealth, while Ufgel skeptically tells him he didn't have a dime a week ago. When entering the downstairs area of the bathhouse and approaching Gulug to speak with him, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"What's this about? If you aren't here to use the bath's, it must be about my tonics. Well, I can assure you. My tonics are guaranteerd to cure whatever ails you. It just takes time... and... and multiple applications!\"\nI'll tell the Guard about this. Don't try to leave the city. \"Do what you will. My tonics are out in the city now, getting to the people who need them. Sure, I won't be able to enjoy the rest of my gold, but I accomplished what I set out to do.\"\nIf you are truly doing this to help the city, I won't report you to the guard. \"Ah, it's good to meet like-minded individuals! You have my thanks. The poor of this city can take comfort in knowing they can afford the tonics they need. I'll find a way to repay you, don't you worry about that!\"\nAfter having found out that Gulug sold out the city of Orsinium to the Winterborn, the Vestige must report to the city keep and speak with &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Solgra\"&gt;High Priestess Solgra&lt;/a&gt;. When initiating dialogue with her, she will tell them the following:\n\"Ah, another traveler arrives in our grand city! Welcome, welcome! Are you one of the chosen? Do you bear the letter from the Forge-Mother?\"\nAfterwards, the Vestige will receive a leveled amount of . The objective \"Talk to Forge-Mother Alga\" will appear after having spoken to High Priestess Solgra, but this is not actually part of the quest. Speaking to Forge Mother Alga will start the quest \"&lt;a href=\"For%20King%20and%20Glory\"&gt;For King and Glory&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Every &lt;a href=\"Hogithum\"&gt;Hogithum&lt;/a&gt;, which we celebrate on the 21st of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;, we summon her for guidance, as well as to offer things of worth and beauty to Her Majesty. She is a cruel but wise mistress. We do not invoke her on any Hogithum troubled by thunderstorms, for those nights belong to the Mad One, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, even if they do coincide with the occasion. Azura at such times understands our caution.\nAzura's invocation is a very personal one. I have been priestess to three other Daedric Princes, but Azura values the quality of her worshippers, and the truth behind our adoration of her. When I was a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elven&lt;/a&gt; maid of sixteen, I joined my grandmother's coven, worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the Schemer Princess. Blackmail, extortion, and bribery are as much the weapons of the Witches of Molag Bal as is dark magic. The Invocation of Molag Bal is held on the 20th of &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;, except during stormy weather. This ceremony is seldom missed, but Molag Bal often appears to her cultists in mortal guise on other dates. When my grandmother died in an attempt to poison the heir of &lt;a href=\"Firewatch\"&gt;Firewatch&lt;/a&gt;, I re-examined my faith in the cult.\nMy brother was a warlock of the cult of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;-and from what he told me, the Dark Warrior was closer to my spirit than the treacherous Molag Bal. Boethiah is a Warrior Princess who acts more overtly than any other &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;. After years of skulking and scheming, it felt good to perform acts for a mistress which had direct, immediate consequences. Besides, I liked it that Boethiah was a Daedra of the Dark Elves. Our cult would summon her on the day we called the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20%28Holiday%29\"&gt;Gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;, the 2nd of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;. Bloody competitions would be held in her honor, and the duels and battles would continue until nine cultists were killed at the hands of other cultists. Boethiah cared little for her cultists-she only cared for our blood. I do think I saw her smile when I accidentally slew my brother in a sparring session. My horror, I think, greatly pleased her.\nI left the cult soon after that. Boethiah was too impersonal for me, too cold. I wanted a mistress of greater depth. For the next eighteen years of my life, I worshipped no one. Instead I read and researched. It was in an old and profane tome that I came upon the name of Nocturnal-Nocturnal the Night Mistress, &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; the Unfathomable. As the book prescribed, I called to her on her holy day, the 3rd of &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt;. At last I had found the personal mistress I had so long desired. I strove to understand her labyrinthine philosophy, the source of her mysterious pain. Everything about her was dark and shrouded, even the way she spoke and the acts she required of me. It took years for me to understand the simple fact that I could never understand Nocturnal. Her mystery was as essential to her as savagery was to Boethiah or treachery was to Molag Bal. To understand Nocturnal is to negate her, to pull back the curtains cloaking her realm of darkness. As much as I loved her, I recognized the futility of unraveling her enigmas. I turned instead to her sister, Azura.\nAzura is the only Daedra Princess I have ever worshipped who seems to care about her followers. Molag Bal wanted my mind, Boethiah wanted my arms, and Nocturnal perhaps my curiosity. Azura wants all of that, and our love above all. Not our abject slavering, but our honest and genuine caring in all its forms. It is important to her that our emotions be engaged in her worship. And our love must also be directed inward. If we love her and hate ourselves, she feels our pain. I will, for all time, have no other mistress."}

They believe &lt;a href=\"Arden-Sul\"&gt;Arden-Sul&lt;/a&gt;, Who Reads the Winds in Our Entrails, was the mortal aspect of Lord Sheogorath, and will come again to cleanse &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;the Realm&lt;/a&gt;. Since these claims are clearly ridiculous, it can be assumed that all Zealots are quite mad.\nThe Zealots cannot be reasoned with. They cannot be treatied with easily. They attack almost anyone on sight, assuming them to be heretics or non-believers. They fight to the death, reveling in the carnage.\nThe reader might ask, then how does one join the Zealots? After much research, I discovered that Zealots sneak into settled areas and leave sets of robes behind. Anyone inclined towards Zealotry can don these robes and approach the Zealots safely. It is said that Zealot leaders can see the true heart of a supplicant, even if he wears the robes, and will slay any false supplicants.\nEven then, the Zealots have painful rituals meant to prove their fealty to Sheogorath. Only the most devout supplicants are accepted into their ranks. Those who fail these tests are put to death.\nOnce a supplicant is accepted as a Zealot, he is taught ceremonies and sorcerous secrets. The best known is summoning &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; to do their bidding. These powerful creatures are formidable foes."}

He preaches that his followers should work hard, be wise in their spendings, and never steal. He is almost always portrayed as male, and is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i/&lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; god &lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt;, as well as with a blue star that sometimes shines over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview and worship.\nLike his &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; brethren, he cannot directly interact with &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, however he can influence it in his own way. Zenithar teaches to work hard, not for the material wealth it provides, but for the spiritual benefits. The fruits of hard labour praise Zenithar, according to his priests. In the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, he is mainly worshipped as a god of merchants and middle nobility, appearing to give him a diverse group of followers. A common phrase spoken by his worshipers is that Zenithar is the god 'that will always win'.\nZenithar is often said to be closely associated with &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, as the materials required for Zenithar's craftsmanship must be derived from Kynareth's natural world. Thus, one cannot revere Zenithar without acknowledging the power of Kynareth. This bond is shown when the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt; could only acquire the &lt;a href=\"Mace%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Mace of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, Zenithar's only known artifact, when wearing the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Boots of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, which are associated with Kynareth.\nArtifacts.\nZenithar's only known artifact is the Mace of the Crusader. During the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, each of the eight divines granted &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; a holy relic, together known as the &lt;a href=\"Relics%20of%20the%20Crusader%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Relics of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. Zenithar's gift to Pelinal was the mace. It is said that upon Pelinal's death, a messenger brought the mace to &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. Centuries later, visions of the mace would start appearing to people who prayed to the tomb of &lt;a href=\"St.%20Kaladas\"&gt;St. Kaladas&lt;/a&gt;, the architect of Leyawiin chapel. Many have since tried and failed to get the mace, including &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Ralvas\"&gt;Sir Ralvas&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; figured out that one needs to wear the Boots of the Crusader to successfully reach the mace, and thus succeeded at retrieving the item.\nVerse.\n\"Come to me, Zenithar, for without you, like a child, I might fiddle and fret when only through struggle and labor may I craft a work worthy of your name and the name of my patron.\""}

She also mentions that her bow is still sitting at the very edge of the log, overlooking the chasm.\nTo obtain the bow, the Dragonborn must carefully walk along the log and pick it up at the end of the log. The bow cannot be picked up from a distance by using the &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; spell. Once it has been picked up, Katria will tell the Dragonborn to take good care of it for her.\nEnchantment.\nIts innate enchantment grants it the ability to fire &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; 30% faster. Like all innate enchantments, it does not run out of charge and cannot be disenchanted or enchanted.\nSmithing.\nIt can be upgraded with a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20metal%20ingot\"&gt;Dwarven metal ingot&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; if the Arcane Blacksmith perk is unlocked, and also benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Smithing\"&gt;Dwarven Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk, which doubles the improvement.\nUsefulness.\nZephyr has the highest base damage per second of any &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; in the game, firing an arrow every 1.58 seconds, compared to the fastest non-unique bow in the game, the &lt;a href=\"Long%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;long bow&lt;/a&gt;, which fires an arrow every 1.81 seconds.\nEarly on and even at higher levels the Zephyr is a powerful weapon for archers. Able to deal a higher amount of damage per second than any other ranged weapon, Zephyr can theoretically kill faster than any other ranged weapon. However, it may be a poor choice at higher levels for archers that prefer &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; attacking, as the relatively low damage will not kill most enemies in one hit.\nSince this bow relies on its high rate of fire rather than its base damage to bring down enemies, it can quickly use up arrows, especially at higher levels when enemies will take multiple shots to kill. The fact it cannot be disenchanted further limits its potential."}

Finding them and saving them becomes a priority. They will battle several Covenant soldiers near the stairs of the eastern gate. After aiding Denskar and Littrek, the Vestige must seek out Aera Earth-Turner, whom is located under a tower along with &lt;a href=\"Eiman\"&gt;Eiman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molla\"&gt;Molla&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Glad to see you.

Once they get about 20\u201330 feet away, they start to sprint at the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; with a charging hit that knocks its target back several feet.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dread zombie&lt;/a&gt; has the ability to quickly regain health, perform powerful attacks and defend itself. Dread Zombies can kill &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; and other powerful entities, earning this foe a reputation as one of the hardest enemies to kill."}

A zone is the largest category of &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; by area and contains many locations within it, and features a series of quests of different types, including &lt;a href=\"zone%20quest\"&gt;zone quest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;side quests&lt;/a&gt;. While side quests are often unrelated from each other, zone quests are a sequential story that revolve around the events within the zone and an overarching story told across multiple zones.\nList of zones.\nThere are 46 zones as of the release of , some of which have distinguishing regions, or 'subzones,' between them. As a general rule, non-starter zones not part of any chapter or DLC are separated into three subzones, each with a separate but related zone quest series. Chapter and DLC zones typically only have one series of zone quests. It is not necessary to have completed the content in any one zone to do the content in another, with the exception of epilogues for year-long stories.\nBase zones.\nBase zones are zones that are included with \"Online\" without any chapter or DLC and are organized by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in their original story order with subzones. Note that, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; only has six zones instead of seven, as it only has one starter zone instead of two.\nChapter and DLC zones.\nEach chapter and DLC zone requires the appropriate content to access it. Zones included in chapters are larger than those in DLCs; however, DLC zones conclude the stories started in chapter zones. Chapter and DLC zones are ordered by their release from earliest to latest with subzones, if applicable.\nZone Guide.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"Update%2021\"&gt;Update 21&lt;/a&gt;, the Zone Guide provides menus that can be used to track the completion of any given zone according to its zone quests, locations and &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;. There are two elements of the Zone Guide: on the map and in the Group &amp; Activity Finder. The Zone Guide on the map provides a menu to the map's left of the current zone displaying the total number of zone quests, &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"delves\"&gt;delves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"points%20of%20interest\"&gt;points of interest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"striking%20locales\"&gt;striking locales&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"set%20stations\"&gt;set stations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"public%20dungeons\"&gt;public dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, world events (such as &lt;a href=\"dark%20anchors\"&gt;dark anchors&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"world%20bosses\"&gt;world bosses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyshards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skyshards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"lorebooks\"&gt;lorebooks&lt;/a&gt; that have been found. Progress metres for lorebooks are account-wide and do not have to be collected for each character, and dungeons will be marked as completed when they are discovered if another character on the same account has already completed it. Points of interest with quests and zone quests will only be marked as completed when the relevant quest has been completed by the logged-in character. The Zone Guide in the Dungeons &amp; Activity Finder menu provides both the map completion menu as well as the description of the current zone and an overview of &lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Online%29\"&gt;achievements&lt;/a&gt; that can be completed in the zone.\nLevel restrictions.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Update%2012\"&gt;Update 12&lt;/a&gt;, the difficulty of content in a zone was targeted for a specific level range, making some zones extremely difficult or impossible for characters to progress in if they were under the zone's level range, or extremely easy if they were above it. Prior to &lt;a href=\"Update%2010\"&gt;Update 10&lt;/a&gt;, these levels were based on &lt;a href=\"veteran%20rank\"&gt;veteran rank&lt;/a&gt;s, and then were based on &lt;a href=\"champion%20points\"&gt;champion points&lt;/a&gt; until Update 12. Since Update 12, all zones use the &lt;a href=\"battle%20leveling\"&gt;battle leveling&lt;/a&gt; system, wherein characters have their statistics upscaled to what they would be if they were 160. Prior to battle leveling, the zones of a character's Alliance were leveled from 3 to 43, while the zones not of their Alliance could be leveled from either 1\u20135 or 6\u201310. After Update 12, one set of zones not of the character's Alliance was leveled from 40\u2013150 and the others were all 160.\nThe level progression of zones was equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Silver\"&gt;Cadwell's Silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt;: Dominion characters did Dominion zones, followed by Covenant zones and then Pact zones; Covenant characters did Covenant zones, followed by Pact zones and then Dominion zones; and Pact characters did Pact zones, followed by Dominion zones and then Covenant zones. This specific progression also had the effect of preventing any characters of different Alliances from encountering each other in Alliance zones. Wrothgar, Hew's Bane and the Gold Coast were never level restricted, instead being subject to battle leveling since their releases despite being before Update 12.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDevelopment.\nSeveral zones were planned during the development of \"Online\" to be incorporated later. While some, such as Blackwood and Wrothgar, have been incorporated since launch, others remain conceptual. Other zones not initially planned have also been incorporated since launch, such as the Telvanni Peninsula and the Gold Coast.\nOriginally planned zones include:"}

It has been said that the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; was an apprentice of Zurin Arctus.\nZurin Arctus was known to be an astounding tactician as well as an accomplished diplomat and intellectual. His magical skill was unmatched by any other mage of his time, which may be attributed to his believed connections to &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the god of magic. Zurin Arctus is typically regarded as the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, though his identity is sometimes contested with &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nZurin Arctus' prominent role in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic history doesn't truly begin until the ending of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; and the beginning of the Septim Empire. Originally acting as a protector of the Imperial City, Zurin Arctus would later become Tiber Septim's head Battlemage and one of his most trusted advisers. After Talos took the Imperial City and was crowned the Emperor by Zurin himself, he successfully conquered all the Kingdoms of Man. The Underking Wulfharth, who was believed to be one of Tiber's head military consultants, implored Tiber to wage war against the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; as revenge for what they did to &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; ages ago. While Zurin advised against the manner, Tiber was persuaded by Wulfharth's promise of large sums of &lt;a href=\"Ebony\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; to be found in Morrowind. The Underking also promised Tiber that by stealing the Tribunal's power, they could wage war against &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. A war with the Altmer was, at the time, the farthest thing from the Emperor's mind, who had already sent Zurin to begin peace talks with the King of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. With the rising threat of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, both sides quickly agreed to end the fighting before any significant amount of damage could be done. Zurin Arctus was believed to have secretly met with Vivec to broker this treaty. The terms of peace made Morrowind subject to the Empire, but also allowed the Tribunal to rule Morrowind with near complete autonomy and hold onto all traditional practices. General belief holds that Vivec offered the Emperor the remains of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; to uphold their compromise. Wulfharth was furious that Tiber would allow the Tribunal to keep their power and decided to abandon Tiber and his Empire.\nAfter the war with Morrowind, Tiber Septim gave Zurin the task of unraveling the mystery of the Numidium, a device which some people incorrectly assume was built by Zurin himself. While studying the history of the grand artifact, Zurin Arctus discovered the stories surrounding the Battle of Red Mountain and the Numidium's true purpose. Zurin would eventually learn that the massive construct was designed to harness the energy of &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, and that a similar power source could be used to activate it. While Zurin raved over his discovery, the Emperor realized that the Numidium could be his key to conquering the whole of Tamriel. Reconstructing the Numidium became Tiber Septim's top priority. The Emperor gave the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; orders to annex the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; territory of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; and remove the populace from the area to create a secret build-site for the Numidium. Zurin was put in charge of reconstructing the Numidium and would be responsible for formulating the controlling device of the Numidium, known as the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Zurin created the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; from his own heart and imbued it with his life force to power the Numidium. A message was then secretly sent to the Underking Wulfharth, pleading for his aid in destroying Dagoth Ur, but upon his arrival at the Imperial Palace he was ambushed and his life force was captured within the Mantella. In the confrontation, Zurin was killed by the last breath of Wulfharth's heart, roaring a hole in his chest. When the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; arrives, Tiber Septim explained away the event by claiming that Zurin had attempted to assassinate him and usurp his place as Emperor. Tiber Septim reactivated the Numidium with the Mantella and used it to conquer his enemies and later crush all the neutral royal families of Tamriel so that he might replace them with people he knew to be loyal. However, through unknown means, Zurin Arctus is resurrected as &lt;a href=\"The%20Underking\"&gt;The Underking&lt;/a&gt;. Sickened by the Emperor's profane use of the great titan, Zurin fought the Numidium to reclaim the Mantella, but in the ensuing fight both were vanquished and the Mantella was blasted into &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. With his life force gone, Zurin fell into a semi-slumber state, relying on the employment of various agents to help him locate his heart.\nPersonality.\nZurin Arctus was a very intelligent man, often being assigned to study and artifacts such as &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; and giving crucial advice to Tiber Septim that has won several battles. Zurin was known to prefer diplomacy to warfare and attempted to avoid wars and battles when possible, being quoted as saying \"Victory without battle is the acme of skill\", and would often try to make it appear to the enemy that they could not win and thus avoid battle. Zurin preferred to use skillful tactics to his advantage rather than overwhelming force to demonstrate his skill as a battlemage, and would purposefully make his armies appear unorganized to make his victories in battle seem more proficient.\nZurin strongly believed that in battle, arcane and mundane tactics must be in balance to ensure superiority over the opposing army and that, for a battlemage to show true skill, they should always make sure that a battle can be won before it starts. Zurin was a very illusive tactician on the battlefield and would often trick the enemy into thinking they've won the battle by conserving his armies' power, and then striking the opposing army when they were vulnerable. This tactic was known to have worked extremely well at the Battle of Five Bridges in which he and Tiber routed an army twice their size. Zurin liked to look at war as if it were a tree, writing in his book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Art%20of%20War%20Magic\"&gt;The Art of War Magic&lt;/a&gt;\", \"The battle is only a leaf on the tree; if a leaf falls, does the tree die? But when a branch is lopped off, the tree is weakened; when the trunk is girdled, the tree is doomed\".\nMore information.\nZurin Arctus is believed by many to have possessed some form of supernatural affinity. The &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Worms\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, a long-lived nemesis of the Underking, expressed with certainty that Zurin Arctus was an incarnation of the early immortal spirit variously known as Arnand or Hans \"the Fox\". Many associate him with the god &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the deity inhabited his body and imbued him with divine magical power. Some also state that Zurin Arctus may have been a mortal &lt;a href=\"Shezarrine\"&gt;avatar of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, which can be seen through the connections often drawn between &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt; and the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s. Some sources inconsistently refer to the Mantella as either the heart of Tiber Septim or the heart of Zurin Arctus, no doubt due to the Mantella's obscure origins. Esoteric theories hold that upon the meeting between General Talos and Zurin Arctus, the two unified as the &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;Enantiomorph&lt;/a&gt; \"Tiber Septim\" in order to unite the land and people under a singular ruler. This healing of the schism gave birth to the Mantella, the supposed heart of Tiber Septim. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; depicts the Emperor in an adjacent manner, that of a \"two-headed\" &lt;a href=\"Ruling%20King\"&gt;Ruling King&lt;/a&gt; with no equivalent."}

According to the master of their forge, I am the first outsider permitted to gaze upon the forge where they create their greatest works, deep beneath the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. In my first day alone I have witnessed many wonders of which I never thought &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; to be capable. I decided to document my experience before I return to the College.\nI am struck by the secretive nature of these Orcs. Even the entrances to their great forge are carefully concealed, invisible if one does not know their presence. As if that were not enough, some paths only seem to open for those of their own bloodline, or perhaps those who prove themselves in some way. I shall have to inquire further.\nThe forge itself was breathtaking. I must admit, I had my doubts - these are Orcs, after all - but it is indeed a magnificent sight. I made no mention of it, but it was clear the forge was not created by the Orcs. True, they have done much work on the exterior to conceal its origins. But the inner workings, the meticulous design? There is &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; brilliance beneath the Orc stone. Of that, I have no doubts.\nThe Orcs boast proudly of the forge, and work it with a variety of implements, but say nothing of the forge-hammer itself. Do they even know what they have? The forge is special, true, and my senses are keen enough to recognize the Dwemer had good reason for constructing it here. Yet the forge-hammer is older, and stronger still. What such a tool could do in my hands instead of theirs!\nPerhaps an opportunity will arise. For now, the forge-master showed me to a side chamber for rest and drink. The heat from this place is sweltering and clouds the mind. More after my head clears."}

It is divided into two main parts: the mainland, and the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, which are separated by the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; was ceded to Morrowind by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorrowind was formerly the homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, and now of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Dark Elves. Although the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; was a great influence in politics, Morrowind was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;King Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt; during the events of and in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;. The island of Vvardenfell serves as the setting for .\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nThe prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; led the Chimer to the land that would be known as Morrowind at some point in the Middle Merethic Era. The &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; also settled the area around this time. It is unclear exactly which group of Mer arrived in the area first, although the records of the Dwemer allegedly reach back further. The Velothi built many towers at this time, alongside a number of \"High Elven\" towers. The term \"High Elven\" is unexplained in this text, as the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; are not mentioned by name as having any political involvement with the Chimer at this time.\nThis period of success was followed by an unexplained period of decline of the original &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; Chimer culture, which allowed the Dwemer to gain a more established foothold on the land, and the first known Dwemer settlements date from this period. This ultimately led to internecine war between the Chimer and Dwemer, which lasted into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Era.\nChimer-Dwemer Warfare.\nDisputes over territory marked the early interactions between the two groups of Mer in Morrowind in the First Era. These battles were allegedly fueled by conflicting religious beliefs of the two cultures, with the Chimer affronted by the Dwemer's lack of respect for the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; they worshipped, and the Dwemer either worshiped an unknown force or were more agnostic in their beliefs.\nInvasion of the Nords and the Formation of the First Council.\nThis disorganization contributed to the conquest of Morrowind by the Nords under &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt;, which took a mere 50 years. The Nord invasion forced the Chimer and Dwemer to overlook their differences and unite, forming the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;. This coalition drove out the Nords and formed the nation of Resdayn, which stimulated the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;. It was achieved largely because of the friendship between &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;, but ended with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the First Council.\nSome claim that the war was simply due to continued religious differences between the Chimer and the Dwemer, others because the Chimer found various Dwemer sorcerous practices detestable. The event that likely sparked the march to war was the discovery by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; that the Dwemer had unearthed the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. This led to heated negotiations between Nerevar and Dumac Dwarfking. Upon being told by Azura that the Dwemer were building a new god under the mountain, Nerevar and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, currently only advisors, issued an ultimatum to the Dwemer to stop work on their new god, or face destruction. Dumac, ignorant of the discovery of the Heart, refused. And so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war.\nThe war saw the Chimer divided, as House Dagoth sided with the Dwemer against the other Dunmer houses. House Dagoth invited Orcs and Nords as allies, which the latter saw as an opportunity to retake their old domains and claim the Heart of Lorkhan. The exact course of the war is unclear, but all sources claim the war ended in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle of Red Mountain.\nAll forces involved in the war met at Red Mountain. During the battle, there was a major standoff at the chamber where the Heart of Lorkhan was kept. One tale claims Nerevar, the Tribunal, and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; snuck into the chamber where the Heart of Lorkhan was kept, and confront Dumac and Kagrenac. In the ensuing battle, Dumac was killed, although precisely who killed him is uncertain. Some sources claim it was Nerevar, others Wulfharth, and yet others a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zira\"&gt;Dro'Zira&lt;/a&gt;. Sources are similarly unclear as to whether Nerevar was killed during the battle, died from his wounds afterward or was murdered by the Tribunal. All sources agree that the Dwemer disappeared, and some elaborate that &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; fell into the hands of Nerevar and the Tribunal. &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, a traitor of House Dagoth, was left guarding the Tools with the Heart while the Tribunal and Nerevar met to discuss the artifacts' fates. The four resolved to destroy them. When they returned, Dagoth refused to hand them over, but was defeated and fled into the depths of Red Mountain.\nThe Tribunal's Apotheosis and Azura's Curse.\nFollowing the battle, either directly after or some years later, the Tribunal use Kagrenac's Tools to tap the power of the Heart and become living gods. Either at this point, or the point where they murdered Nerevar, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; cursed them for their treachery, turning the Chimer into the Dunmer as a punishment, and prophesying Nerevar's return.\nFormation of the Temple and Grand Council.\nFollowing their &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;apotheosis&lt;/a&gt;, the Tribunal formed the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that they were better-suited to look after the people of Morrowind than the fickle Daedra. The Tribunal also outlawed the inter-house conflicts that had been a part of much of Chimer history, sanctioning the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; guild to carry out assassinations in lieu of full-blown inter-house conflict. However, there are instances of conflict between the Houses even after this time.\nThe First Council was renamed the Grand Council, and consisted of only the victorious houses. The &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, nomadic Dunmer arranged into tribes rather than settled Houses, refused to worship the Tribunal, continuing in ancestor and Daedra worship. Over time, the webs of allegiances between the settled Dunmer and the peace brought by the Grand Council meant that they developed rapidly, forcing the nomadic Ashlanders into the less fertile lands of the province.\nThe First Akaviri Invasion.\nIn 1E 2700 or 2703, a force of &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; invaded Tamriel. The Tribunal joined with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the Tsaesci, Vivec allegedly forming an alliance with the king of the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; as part of this effort.\nThe Four Score War.\nRelations ultimately worsened between the Empire and Morrowind, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; breaking out in 1E 2840. The Tribunal took an active role in both the battles and negotiations of the war, which ultimately ended with no change of territories in 2920, the last year of the First Era.\nAt the same time as the treaty was being negotiated, Reman III and his sons were murdered by the Morag Tong. Some claim this was done on the orders of the Akaviri Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, who also ratified the final treaty between the Empire and Morrowind.\nSecond Era.\nThe Second Akaviri Invasion and the Ebonheart Pact.\n&lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; from Akavir invaded the kingdom of Eastern Skyrim in 2E 572. The Dunmer joined with the Nords and Argonians to drive them out, forming the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. Following the expulsion of the Akaviri, the Pact made a bid for the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil, led by the Nord &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons for the traditionally insular Dunmer following this venture are unclear, but it may be that they believe that the divine nature of the Tribunal and their ability to defend Tamriel from external threats gave them that right, or as part of a desire to remain independent of any continent-spanning empire.\nThe Pact ultimately disbanded before the end of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, in unknown circumstances.\nWar and Armistice with Tiber Septim.\nTiber Septim made clear preparations to invade Resdayn after conquering &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Great Houses were divided on how to oppose the Empire, leaving &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; standing alone against the legions. There were several border skirmishes, and &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by Imperial troops.\nShortly after this, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; met with Tiber Septim and signed an armistice which integrated the new province of Morrowind into the Empire while guaranteeing \"all rights of faith and self-government.\" The Empire installed &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; as a figurehead queen, and the Imperial Legions occupied Morrowind, but also agreed to not interfere with the affairs of the Tribunal, and left most of the local government to the Great Houses and the Temple. There are also rumors that Vivec offered Tiber the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; as part of the agreement.\nThe Armistice was unilaterally declared by Vivec, and came as a surprise to most of the Grand Council, and the Temple. It was accepted by Houses Hlaalu, Redoran and Telvanni, while House Indoril, backed by House Dres, swore to resist to the death. The head of the council, an Indoril, refused to sign the treaty, was assassinated and replaced by a Hlaalu, who also seized control of several local councils. Many remaining Indoril nobles committed suicide rather than submit to Imperial rule, further weakening the House.\nThird Era.\nArnesian War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt; started as an Argonian slave revolt during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; (3E 389\u2013399). The revolt escalated into full conflict thanks to the alleged torture and death of &lt;a href=\"Roris\"&gt;Roris&lt;/a&gt;, who was later canonized by the Temple. The revolt caused the death of the Imperial general Symmachus, and the flight and abdication of Queen Barenziah. Despite these setbacks, Morrowind ultimately prevailed in the war, taking land from the Argonians.\nThe Rise of Dagoth Ur and the Nerevarine.\nSince their ascension, the Tribunal had to make annual pilgrimages to the Heart of Lorkhan to renew their powers. However, they had been unable to do so since 2E 882, having been driven off by &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;. This began a series of raids against Red Mountain by the Tribunal, in an attempt to access the Heart, culminating in the ambush of Almalexia and Sotha Sil and the loss of &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 417. Meanwhile, followers of Dagoth Ur had begun to occupy various places and build up their strength, including their old headquarters in &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt;, while recruiting followers by compulsion and visions in dreams.\nIn 3E 427, an individual who came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; arrived on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine, rumored to be the prophesied reincarnation of Nerevar, or a member of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; and an Imperial plant, recovered Kagrenac's tools, destroyed the Dwemer enchantments on the Heart of Lorkhan, and defeated Dagoth Ur. The Nerevarine also killed the deranged Almalexia, who herself murdered Sotha Sil, before disappearing.\nFollowing the disappearance of Vivec, &lt;a href=\"Lie%20Rock\"&gt;Lie Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a moon or meteor originally kept suspended above &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; by Vivec's power, began to fall again. A group of mages in Morrowind created the Ingenium, a soul-powered machine, to keep the moon suspended above the city.\nReturn of Barenziah and Coronation of King Helseth.\nBarenziah returned to Morrowind some time before 3E 427 when her son &lt;a href=\"Helseth\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; became king after the sudden death of King Llethan, and took the title of Queen Mother for herself. A ruthless and paranoid king, Helseth ordered the assassination of the Nerevarine by the Dark Brotherhood, fearing that they were a threat to his rule.\nSometime after his coronation, King Helseth outlawed slavery in Morrowind, and reformed the Grand Council to be closer to a traditional Dunmeri governmental structure.\nOblivion Crisis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; affected Morrowind along with the rest of Tamriel, causing the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; and forcing the Imperial garrison at &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, where no Oblivion Gates are known to have opened, to be recalled to Cyrodiil.\nFollowing this, the Houses sent out various expeditions to help re-establish themselves, and House Redoran sent one such group to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. These assisted the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; with their mining operations in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nFourth Era.\nRed Year.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, a woman named Ilzheven was chosen to help power the Ingenium. Her lover, a Dunmer named Sul, fought to free her, destroying the Ingenium in the process. This caused Lie Rock to resume its descent and crash into Vivec City, destroying it.\nThis sent shockwaves which caused Red Mountain to erupt, triggering earthquakes and tsunamis across Morrowind. The ensuing natural disasters destroyed &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and heavily damaged &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. On Solstheim, Fort Frostmoth was decimated. On the mainland, shocks reached as far as &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; was unaffected.\nA House Redoran councilor from Mournhold coordinated relief efforts and teams were sent to Vvardenfell to help rebuild a month after the eruption. Telvanni magelord &lt;a href=\"Master%20Neloth\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt; also took in some refugees at his tower of Tel Mithryn. Ongoing relief efforts on Vvardenfell were however disrupted by the Argonian invasion in the following year.\nArgonian Invasion.\nIn 4E 6, the Argonians invaded Morrowind at the bidding of the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. Much of southern Morrowind was devastated by the Argonians, and also apparently some holdings of House Telvanni. The Empire's ineffectual protection and seeming indifference to Morrowind's plights made them reviled by the Dunmer. After the Empire \"released its grasp\" on Morrowind &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;'s Imperial ties resulted in it being replaced by &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt; on the Council of Great Houses. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Morrowind during the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; prevented the Empire from reclaiming Morrowind.\nThe combination of the Red Year and the invasion forced most Dunmer to flee to Solstheim, then technically part of Skyrim, and into Skyrim itself. In 4E 16, Solstheim officially became part of Morrowind, forcing the East Empire company to give over the rule of the island to House Redoran.\nGovernment.\nMorrowind is officially a province of the Empire, governed by a titular king put in place after the Armistice. This king historically has very little power, with most administration falling on the Grand Council and the Great Houses. The Temple and, while they existed, the Tribunal, also had an input in governmental affairs.\nKing of Morrowind.\nOne of the terms of the Armistice with the Empire was the creation of a King of Morrowind, who served as an Imperial representative. Traditionally a figurehead more than an active ruler, the king does have a variety of powers in Morrowind's government. His edicts have generally covered points of provincial trade and settlement, but have been more far-reaching in some cases, including a ban on the Morrowind &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt;, and a restructuring of the Grand Council.\nGrand Council.\nThe main ruling body of Morrowind is the Grand Council, instituted following the War of the First Council. The Tribunal had seats on the council, as did the Great Houses and the Temple. The Grand Council was governed by a Lord High Councillor at the time of the Armistice, whose assent is apparently required for motions to pass. The structure of the Grand Council was reformed by King &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Helseth\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; in the late Third Era, although exactly what this has meant for the Council's composition and role in Morrowind governance is unclear.\nDistrict Councils.\nUnder the Empire, Morrowind was divided into districts, which were administered by Dukes representing the Empire, and self-governing preserves. The Temple and the Great Houses govern subdistricts within each district territory, under the guidance of District Councils. Local law is enforced under the mandate of these councils, resulting in a mixture of Imperial, Temple and House law being enforced, depending on precisely who governed the subdistrict in question.\nGreat Houses.\nThe Great Houses have their origins in ancient &lt;a href=\"Velothi\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; tribes, and function effectively as political parties within the Morrowind polity, as well as controlling much of the trade and local administration in the province.\nRepresentatives from each of the Great Houses sit on the Grand Council, the body that has ruled Morrowind since the late First Era. The Houses themselves also have ruling councils, which enforce House policy and conduct.\nGreat Houses that have been referenced in the games to date are House Dagoth, House Dres, House Hlaalu, House Indoril, House Redoran, House Sadras and House Telvanni. All but House Dagoth and House Sadras had a stake in Morrowind's governance for most of its history. House Dagoth was destroyed following the events at the Battle of Red Mountain, while House Sadras replaced House Hlaalu following the Red Year. During the time of Resdayn in the First Era, the Dwemer were also accorded the status of a House, referred to as \"House Dwemer.\"\nMembership of the Great Houses is generally a matter of birth, but members can be adopted into a Great House. This typically requires the sponsorship of an existing House councilor. Following House Dagoth's dissolution, many of its members were assimilated into other Houses thusly.\nHouse Dres.\nHouse Dres, whose influence stems from agriculture and the slave trade, is located in the south-eastern part of Morrowind, and has no holdings in Vvardenfell. A strong and rich House in the Second Era, with a thriving economy, its influence on Morrowind politics has weakened considerably since Morrowind's surrender to the Third Empire, which it strongly opposed.\nHouse Dres is the most conservative of Morrowind's Great Houses, to the extent that the Daedra worship of the Chimer is still commonly practiced by its members. During the war in which Morrowind became a province of the Empire of Tiber Septim, it was one of the Houses, along with House Indoril and House Redoran, to resist Imperial forces, opposing the treaty even after Redoran agreed to its terms.\nMore recently, after the defeat of Dagoth Ur, House Dres has apparently undergone some significant changes. King Hlaalu Helseth has outlawed slavery in Morrowind, but Dres is apparently prospering in spite of this.\nHouse Hlaalu.\nHouse Hlaalu was always one of the weaker Great Houses, and so tended to rely on trade and relations with external political forces to keep up with the rest of the Houses. This meant that they were one of the few sincere members of the Ebonheart Pact during the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;. The House itself positions this as the ability to be nimble and adjust to events, which is for them a political necessity. The House had holdings on Vvardenfell during the Third Era, and its old capital was &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;. However, the key members of the Hlaalu council all resided on Vvardenfell.\nHouse Hlaalu was always pro-Imperial in its outlook, urging accommodation with Tiber Septim in the period leading up to the Armistice. When the head of the Grand Council, an Indoril, refused to sign the treaty that Vivec negotiated, he was assassinated and replaced by a member of House Hlaalu. Their cooperation with Imperial authorities during the Third Era allowed them to expand aggressively and build and support many new settlements on Vvardenfell. The exact status of these settlements in the political climate following the events of Red Year and the Argonian invasion is unknown. Following the abdication of Queen Barenziah, Athyn Llethan, a member of House Hlaalu, became King of Morrowind. He died soon after her return, shortly before the events of .\nHouse Hlaalu saw its status of Great House revoked during the Fourth Era. This was due to the Empire's (supposed) abandonment of Morrowind during the Oblivion Crisis. Since the other Great Houses could not take their anger out on the Empire, they targeted House Hlaalu, who were staunch Imperial supporters. The House became an outcast and a pariah, losing almost all of its power.\nHouse Indoril.\nHouse Indoril is one of two Great Houses that do not have holdings in Vvardenfell. Its capital is Almalexia, which also functions as the capital of Morrowind as a whole. The vast majority of members serve the Temple, a tendency which only increased following the events of Red Year and the fall of the Tribunal, resulting in all of House Indoril's power passing into the hands of the Temple in the Fourth Era.\nThe Chimer warlord Nerevar was an Indoril, and the House claimed that from it came the Tribunal itself. These connections allowed them to maintain a strong control of Morrowind's governance throughout much of Morrowind's history.\nWhen the Third Empire invaded, House Indoril wished to fight to the death rather than submit and proposed fighting a guerrilla war against the invaders. Following the Armistice, many House Indoril nobles committed suicide rather than accept the treaty, and the House lost a great deal of influence because of it. This has only continued in later years, with House Indoril now effectively functioning as an ancillary part of the Temple.\nHouse Redoran.\nHouse Redoran is a martial house that consider themselves the hereditary defenders of Morrowind. The House prizes the three virtues of duty, gravity and piety, and they are typically considered one of the more honorable Houses in the region. The house claims their first duty is to the Temple, although not as part of its structure as House Indoril is. The House motto is: \"A Redoran is a warrior whose duty is first to the Tribunal, second to House Redoran, and third to family and clan.\"\nThey have holdings in Vvardenfell island and on the west of the Morrowind mainland. Their holdings in the mainland of Morrowind include a large portion of the northwest of the province. Their capital on Vvardenfell and council seat for much of their history was Ald'ruhn. In the Fourth Era, they also control much of the island of Solstheim, including the settlement of Raven Rock, following the departure of the Empire in 4E 16.\nThe House was seen to be in decline for much of the Third Era, losing influence on Vvardenfell as the more expansionist and underhanded Telvanni and Hlaalu houses, in addition to suffering from severe levels of crime organized by the Cammona Tong and the Thieves Guild. The most severe blow came during the Oblivion Crisis, when Ald'ruhn was destroyed.\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis, House Redoran established holdings on Solstheim and mainland Morrowind, taking over Raven Rock after the withdrawal of the Empire. On the mainland, House Redoran was one of the least damaged houses following the Red Year and was able to take over the position of leadership on Morrowind's Grand Council.\nHouse Sadras.\nHouse Sadras is a great house that rose to prominence during the Fourth Era. They joined the ruling Council of Morrowind, along with House Telvanni, Dres, Indoril and Redoran.\nHouse Telvanni.\nHouse Telvanni is a house governed by powerful and idiosyncratic mage-lords, with little formal code of conduct being imposed by the House hierarchy. As a result, many of the most powerful Telvanni lords work in solitude, and do not concern themselves directly with House affairs. During the Three Banners War, despite being a member of the Ebonheart Pact, the Telvanni were most concerned with keeping the other Pact members out of their territories.\nDespite this, there is a \"de facto\" code of conduct in the House, which considers that might makes right. The House motto reflects this, being: \"The forceful expression of will gives true honor to the Ancestors.\" This cut-throat attitude also means that murdering one's political opponents is a perfectly acceptable way of resolving disputes. It is also the way that the current ruling Archmagister must be deposed.\nTheir indifference to politics is reflected in the structure of House governance. While the Telvanni council is made up of some of the most powerful wizards in the House, they are represented and their votes are cast by \"Mouths,\" who speak for their patron in council so that the actual Councillor does not have to. Most Telvanni Councillors on Vvardenfell do not live at the Vvardenfell district seat of Sadrith Mora, but have their own towers, populated by their retainers. Their isolationism is also reflected in the governance of their main territories. Non-members of the House are required to have \"hospitality papers\" to be in Sadrith Mora at all.\nDespite being laissez-faire in their attitude to internal and political affairs, House Telvanni is one of the most competitive when it comes to obtaining resources and power. The House was in direct competition with House Hlaalu for land on Vvardenfell for much of the Third Era, and dominated much of Vvardenfell's eastern regions. Alongside House Dres, House Telvanni is one of the more vocal proponents of slavery on Morrowind, as it allows them to have a fresh supply of both test subjects and cheap labor. They even worked with House Hlaalu to break the Mages Guild monopoly on transportation magic in the Third Era.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis, the House was rumored to be defending Morrowind directly by invading and closing Oblivion gates. However, the House suffered from the subsequent Argonian invasion in 4E 6.\nMilitary.\nIt is argued by historians and scholars that, aside from Cyrodiil, the Dunmer are the most powerful province in terms of military might, yet political division has always prevented this from being utilized effectively. Only during invasion has Morrowind stood united to any great degree.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis, however, it fell to House Redoran to organize the Dunmer into an effective fighting force against the Daedra. House Redoran had a very effective army by the end of the crisis and were able to hold their own when the Argonians invaded. While the southern half of Morrowind was ravaged, House Redoran led the Dunmer in the defense of the northern half and was able to hold the invaders. Redoran's demonstration of the superior effectiveness of its armies gained them much respect from their people, and from then onward they became the most powerful and respected Great House in Morrowind.\nDunmer warriors favored a wonderfully light armor made from the carapace of insects, covered over with a finely-woven cloak of spider silk and wrapped several times around the torso. A turban protected the head and face from the ubiquitous ash, with goggles of transparent resin; loose trousers and high boots completed the dress. While this made for an outlandish appearance, travelers would understand the utility of these garments the first time one is caught out of doors in one of the frequent ash storms without such protection. This natural, light armor was known as &lt;a href=\"Chitin%20Armor\"&gt;Chitin Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarriors of the Great Houses wear a unique heavy plate armor called &lt;a href=\"Bonemold%20Armor\"&gt;Bonemold Armor&lt;/a&gt;. It was fashioned from actual bone that was reinforced with a resin-like material and then shaped to form the armored plating. Although it appeared brittle, it was said to be comparable to iron or steel armors.\nEconomy.\nMorrowind was originally an agrarian aristocracy; mostly free farmers and herders and fishermen, all ruled by the Great Houses and their noble councils. After the Imperial occupation, and especially on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmer developed a mercantile economy based on the model of the Empire, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, law, and legions, but driven by trade in crafts and goods.\nMorrowind's production was based on the mining of &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Egg\"&gt;kwama eggs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;. One of the main reasons for the Empire's invasion was due to the vast mineable ebony deposits present in the province.\nGeography.\nLocated in the northeast of Tamriel, Morrowind is a largely alien and inhospitable place where the sky is darkened regularly by furious ash storms belched forth from the mighty Red Mountain, the largest volcano in Tamriel. The familiar flora and fauna of Tamriel is exchanged for bizarre and twisted forms that can survive the regular ashfall. In the Ashlands, cloaked and masked Dunmer tend to herds of giant insects and &lt;a href=\"Netch\"&gt;Netch&lt;/a&gt;. One can also observe Dunmer riding extremely large insects. Much of the landscape is as twisted and mountainous as its neighbor Skyrim, but it is a hot and desolate land, even far from Vvardenfell, where Red Mountain is located. Previously named Resdayn, Veloth, Dwemereth, and Dunmereth, it had been called \"Morrowind\" for the last two Eras.\nThe wilderness of mainland Morrowind was not as dense as it was in Valenwood or even Cyrodiil, but it was not as sparse as on the island of Vvardenfell, where the volcano made the ground inhospitable to normal plant life. One could get lost in the woods here, and people did. Morrowind is the northeastmost province of Tamriel, bounded on the north and east by the Sea of Ghosts, on the west by Skyrim, on the southwest by Cyrodiil, and on the south by Black Marsh. It is the great stretch of northeastern Tamriel between the Velothi Mountains and the sea, and between the southern edge of the Deshaan plain and the northern coast. &lt;a href=\"Shadowgate%20Pass\"&gt;Shadowgate Pass&lt;/a&gt; is found on the border with Cyrodiil.\nMost of the population is gathered in the high hilly uplands and rich fertile river valleys of central Morrowind, especially around the Inland Sea. The Deshaan is the broad southern plain which gradually slopes down into the dismal swamps of Black Marsh. Clan Dres rules the southern sweep of Morrowind, where the fertile Deshaan plain merges with the swamps of Black Marsh.\nThe southeast is a warm coastal plain with broad cultivated areas and marshes and swamps similar to those found in Black Marsh. Southeast Morrowind is flat, wet, and warm like Black Marsh. The area around Tear is much hotter than the Grazelands and is \"practically Argonia\". Many tales are told of this clockwork city of brass, hidden in the steaming swamps of southern Morrowind, the lair of the most mysterious member of the Tribunal. The &lt;a href=\"Dejasyte\"&gt;Dejasyte&lt;/a&gt; is a desert area in the southern half of the province, filled monochrome grey and tan dunes and boulders and little vegetation.\nThe west and south-central region is mountainous and sparsely populated. The Great Valley is found near the north coast. Western and south-central Morrowind is mountainous, with few settlements. &lt;a href=\"Dunkreath\"&gt;Dunkreath&lt;/a&gt; is found somewhere here.\nThe rocky, rugged &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Archipelago\"&gt;archipelago of the northeast&lt;/a&gt; is also sparsely populated. The rocky coasts and islands of northeast Morrowind has a few small settlements. &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt; is found here.\nClan Telvanni shuns all contact with outsiders, preferring to tend their herds of giant insects amid the rocky hills and islands of the extreme northeast. The &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; makes up the region around Firewatch, while the Indoril control the treacherous cliff coastline of it all along Necrom.\nThe island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; is found somewhere off the east coast of the province.\nThe island Vvardenfel is encircled by the Inner Sea, cut off from mainland Morrowind by the surrounding Sea, and is dominated by the titanic volcano Red Mountain and its associated ash wastelands. The portion of the Padomaic Ocean lying north of Vvardenfell is know as the Sea of Ghosts. Most of the island's population is confined to the relatively hospitable settled west and southwest coast; Vvardenfell island is covered by hostile desert wastes, dry arid grasslands, and volcanic badlands, and thinly populated by the nomadic Ashlander camps here and there.\nNotable locations.\nRegions.\nBal Foyen.\nBal Foyen is a pocket realm along the Inner Sea, located east of Stonefalls, before the Telvanni Peninsula. Bal Foyen has a large population of Argonians in the area, likely a reserve for former slaves. The township of &lt;a href=\"Dhalmora\"&gt;Dhalmora&lt;/a&gt; is built in the traditional Argonian mud-style and it is where the people of Bal Foyen generally live. &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Zeren\"&gt;Fort Zeren&lt;/a&gt; is a bulwark that protects the area from invading forces. Because Dhalmora is an agriculture and trading community, the &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen%20Dockyards\"&gt;Bal Foyen Dockyards&lt;/a&gt; serve as an in-between point for resources from Bal Foyen to the rest of Morrowind. Bal Foyen relays info to nearby Davon's Watch.\nClockwork City.\nThe Clockwork City is the domain of Sotha Sil, a member of the Tribunal. The Clockwork City is far more advanced than the rest of Tamriel, with artificial flora and sunlight to safeguard the people. The &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt; is the capital of the Radius, the wild reaches of the Clockwork City. Throughout the Radius, Sotha Sil's factotums inspect the land, for various disturbances and other activities. The &lt;a href=\"Mnemonic%20Planisphere\"&gt;Mnemonic Planisphere&lt;/a&gt; is where Sotha Sil's memories are held and preserved. The location of the Clockwork City is largely unknown, but it is expected to be underneath Mournhold, deep in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeshaan.\nDeshaan is the grazelands along southern Morrowind, and it is the center of the province's theopolitical power. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; is the traditional capital of Morrowind, and it is the capital of the Great House Indoril. It is a part of the larger city of Almalexia. The neighboring city-state of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt; is the capital of the Great House Hlaalu, and it serves more as a trading post than a fully-fledged city. The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Shrine of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt; is the burial grounds of the Prophet Veloth himself; it also houses his artifacts. The &lt;a href=\"Shad%20Astula%20Academy\"&gt;Shad Astula Academy&lt;/a&gt; is the center of Magical studies in Morrowind, and it is due east of Mournhold. Deshaan is split into &lt;a href=\"Lagomere\"&gt;Lagomere&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Redolent%20Loam\"&gt;Redolent Loam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siltreen\"&gt;Siltreen&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolstheim.\nThe island of Solstheim sits in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, in an area between Morrowind and Skyrim. Because of that, Solstheim has been a territory for both provinces. The major township in the region is &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, originally an Imperial-charter town which has become the territory of House Redoran. On the northern coast is the Nordic settlement of &lt;a href=\"Skaal%20Village\"&gt;Skaal Village&lt;/a&gt;, home to the Skaal Tribe of Nords. East of Raven Rock is the Imperial stronghold &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;, where the East Empire Trading Company had originally occupied Solstheim. Solstheim is split into the &lt;a href=\"Felsaad%20Coast\"&gt;Felsaad Coast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hirstaang%20Forest\"&gt;Hirstaang Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Isinfier%20Plains\"&gt;Isinfier Plains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. But with the Red Year, the Hirstaang Forest was obliterated, leaving the Solstheim Ashlands.\nStonefalls.\nThe Stonefalls Ashlands stretches from the northern portion of the Valus Mountains, the southern coast of the Inner Sea, to the eastern border to the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of the region is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, which is a city of House Hlaalu. It is located at the center of the region. To the western edge is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, a trading city with ties to House Dres. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; is a city of House Indoril, and it is located on the eastern coast. The twin volcanoes &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt; tower throughout Stonefalls. The region is split into &lt;a href=\"Daen%20Seeth\"&gt;Daen Seeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varanis\"&gt;Varanis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zabamat\"&gt;Zabamat&lt;/a&gt;.\nVvardenfell.\nThe sub-continent of Vvardenfell is the massive island located in the middle of Morrowind, surrounded by the Inner Sea and the Sea of Ghosts. The center of the island is &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the largest volcano on Tamriel. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is the capital of the region, and it is on the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; is a city of House Hlaalu, on the northern end of the Odai River, in a pocket of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; is a city of House Redoran, and it was built around the carcass of &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor Crab of Vvardenfell. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, is a city of House Telvanni, among &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Vvardenfell has various regions, the most notable ones are the West Gash, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt;, among others.\nMajor cities.\nVivec City.\nNamed after &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;one of the Tribunal gods&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec City lay on the southern coast of the island of Vvardenfell and projected well into the sea. The city of Vivec is owned by the Tribunal Temple, with Great Houses renting property from it in order to have a presence in the city. After &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; fell, the city was destroyed, and the region where it once stood being named Scathing Bay.\nMournhold.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes called the City of Gems, or Almalexia, was home to King Hlaalu Helseth, the current king of Morrowind, and the god Almalexia, a member of the Tribunal, as well being as birthplace of Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;. It is referred to as \"The city of light and magic\" by the local people. Mournhold was sacked by Argonians some time during the Fourth Era, and the province's capital was moved to &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly two centuries after the invasion Mournhold is rebuilt and is thriving once again.\nBalmora.\n&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; is located in the southern part of Vvardenfell and is the district seat of House Hlaalu, and was the largest settlement on Vvardenfell after Vivec City in the Third Era. The &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Council%20Manor\"&gt;Hlaalu Council Manor&lt;/a&gt;, the location of House Hlaalu's bureaucracy and leadership, was located within Balmora. The city was badly damaged during the Red Year, but is in the process of being rebuilt.\nEbonheart.\nThe town of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; is composed of several islands, surrounded by walls and connected by small bridges. There is also a port, offering ship transfer to various coastal towns on Vvardenfell. Ebonheart is the seat of Imperial rule on the island of Vvardenfell, the regional headquarters of the East Empire Company, the Imperial Legion, and the home of Castle Ebonheart, wherein the Duke of Vvardenfell, Vedam Dren resides. It is named after the city of Old Ebonheart on the mainland of Morrowind, across the Inner Sea. The castle is very well protected from attack, since it resides on hills surrounded by water. The Second Era faction the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; was named after the city.\nSadrith Mora.\nThe coastal city &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; is located on an island on the eastern side of Vvardenfell. It is ruled by House Telvanni, and in the Third Era was home to Master &lt;a href=\"Neloth\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the House's councilors. Sadrith Mora had the Imperial Fort, &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Hall\"&gt;Wolverine Hall&lt;/a&gt;, which includes several Imperial guilds and an Imperial Shrine. Stalls, shops and homes line the curving main pathway that runs around the base of the central hill on which Master Neloth's tower, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt;, was built. It was destroyed in the eruption of Red Mountain in 4E 5.\nAld'ruhn.\n&lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; was the Vvardenfell district seat of House Redoran and a large settlement. The Redoran Council Chambers are located inside the shell of an ancient, extinct giant crab. Imperial-constructed roads lead north to the villages of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and lead south to the major city of Balmora. Ald'ruhn was destroyed by Daedra during the Oblivion Crisis, and the rebuilding efforts suffered significant damage following the Red Year.\nBlacklight.\nBlacklight is a city located on the northwestern coast of Morrowind, near the border of Skyrim. Following the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; and the sack of Almalexia by the Argonians, it became the capital of Morrowind and home to House Redoran. Many citizens of Blacklight moved to parts of Skyrim, most notably Windhelm, and also a large proportion moved to Solstheim. A Temple of Azura is known to exist, where Neria Relethyl resides.\nNecrom.\n&lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt; is in the east of Morrowind and is a city of the dead. The city is a place white towers, and of pilgrimage for many Dunmer, who wish to bury their dead there.\nNarsis.\n&lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;, situated in the south of Morrowind, is the capital city of the Great House Hlaalu. In the Fourth Era, it was sacked by the Argonians of Black Marsh, during the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the reasons why House Hlaalu has lost great influence in Morrowind.\nTear.\n&lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; is the southernmost city of the province of Morrowind. It is the capital of House Dres, and, as such, had a large population of slaves. The city was destroyed during the Red Year but seems to have been rebuilt.\nCulture.\nThree major cultural groupings settled Morrowind: the Great House groups, the Ashlanders, and the Imperials. The smallest settlements were the Ashlander nomadic camps, compromised of small, portable huts. Recent Imperial colonies like &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt; display the same half-timbered homes and stone castles as might be found in High Rock or any other western province. The Dunmer Great Houses maintain a cultural dominance, however, with each displaying their own distinct customs and architecture.\nReligion.\nDaedra worship.\nChimeri Daedra Worship.\nThe Chimer were led away from Summerset by Veloth and Boethiah, who ate Trinimac to aid their exodus. He was joined by Azura and Mephala in leading the Chimer to Vvardenfell, and accompanied by Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal and Sheogorath.\nAzura, Boethiah, and Mephala are credited with bringing a particular form of advancement to the Chimer. Boethiah in areas as diverse as philosophy to architecture; Mephala in devising the House system that would define later Chimer and Dunmer society; and Azura taught them how to be different to the Altmer. These are seen as the \"Good Daedra\" in much Dunmeri folklore. The other four Daedra are traditionally seen as testing and opposing figures, although this may be a later elaboration originating during the Tribunal period.\nThe Anticipations and the House of Troubles.\nFollowing the apotheosis of the Tribunal, the worship of Daedra was prohibited by the Tribunal Temple because they claimed the Daedra were unworthy due to their inconstant and dangerous natures. This led to a decline in Daedra worship among the Great Houses, although the Ashlanders and House Dres carried on worshipping the Daedra as they had always done. Azura, Boethiah and Mephala allegedly consented to be replaced, and became the \"Anticipations\" of the Tribunal, sharing certain aspects with the Tribunal member who replaced them. Almalexia replaced Boethiah, Sotha Sil replaced Azura and Vivec took the place of Mephala.\nThe other four Daedra previously worshiped by the Chimer did not accept this however, becoming the Four Corners of the House of Troubles. Their roles as testing figures and obstacles to be overcome was solidified at this point.\nTribunal Temple.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; worshiped the three living gods: Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec, also known as the ALMSIVI. Each god was a patron of different things for Dunmer people. Almalexia was a patron of teachers and healers, Vivec was a patron of artists and rogues and Sotha Sil was a patron of artificers and wizards. According to Temple doctrine the three tribunes gained their divine power through superhuman discipline and virtue, and supernatural wisdom and insight. The Tribunal saved the Dunmer from numerous disasters, such as when Baar Dau was flung from the sky by Sheogorath and was stopped by Vivec from landing on Vivec City, or when Almalexia and Sotha Sil banished Mehrunes Dagon back to Oblivion after he destroyed Mournhold. By doing these things, the Tribunal eventually gained the trust of the Dunmer people, displacing the original Daedra worship of the Chimer and moving themselves to a position of veneration, rather than worship. Some complied with this, but others refused to accept the Tribunal's new position. Those who resisted the transition became framed as tempters and devil figures by the Temple, known as the \"House of Troubles.\"\nAfter the Nerevarine destroyed the Dwemer enchantments on the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, the Tribunal's power waned. Almalexia became unhinged as her godhood left her. After she murdered Sotha Sil in a fit of rage, Almalexia herself was slain by the Nerevarine. Vivec also disappeared, and it is unknown whether he is alive or dead.\nThe Reclamations.\nFollowing the events of the Red Year in 4E 5, the Dunmer began to lose faith in the now missing Tribunal, and schisms broke out within the Temple. Eventually, the Dissident Priests emerged dominant, and reinstituted the worship of the three Good Daedra, with the Tribunal venerated as saints. As part of this, they were named the Reclamations, and the Ashlanders heralded as the guardians of the true path of worship.\nDemographics.\nOn the Isle of Vvardenfell, which was only recently opened to settlement and trade, most of the island's population was confined to the relatively hospitable west and southwest coast, centered on the ancient city of Vivec and the old Great House district centers at Balmora, Ald'ruhn and Sadrith Mora. The rest of the island was covered by hostile desert wastes, arid grasslands, and volcanic badlands and thinly populated by the nomadic Ashlander tribes.\nOn the Mainland, the population is more evenly spread across the Province, with major cities such as Mournhold, Tear, Narsis, Necrom, Port Telvannis, Blacklight and &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt; holding very large portions of the Province's residents.\nThe grey-skinned, red-eyed Dark Elves seem admirably suited to their strange, ash-blighted region. They are known as the Dunmer in the Elven tongue, and now populate the great stretch of northeastern Tamriel between the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the sea, and between the southern edge of the Deshaan Plains and the northern coast. The Dunmer are descendant of the Chimer, who were themselves part of the Aldmeri tribes that chose to follow Veloth out of the Aldmeri ancestral homelands and into Morrowind. The Chimer were cursed by Azura for the Tribunal's transgressions, which gave the Dunmer the ash-grey skin and glowing red eyes that make them instantly recognizable. Like all elves, they tend to be tall and gaunt, but the Dark Elves take the Elvish haughtiness to an extreme, viewing humans as no better than beasts, fit only to serve as slaves on the plantations of Tear.\nThey consider themselves superior even to other Elves, who, in their estimation, are effete and decadent specimens of the pure Elven race. The earliest human records bearing on the subject (which remain the best source until the archives of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; are opened to Imperial scholars) are the chronicles of the Nords. The Nords gave to the region the name of Dunmereth for being the land of the Dunmer, but in earlier ages, it was called Resdayn; and Imperial Librarian Elba Laskee traces the foundation of the Dark Elven nation back to above 3,500 years from the present time. Morrowind was not given its modern name until after the first eruption of Vvardenfell."}

They are content to graze with their lower jaws for tubers and roots just under the surface of their &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;ashland&lt;/a&gt; home. Wild guar are mostly docile, but have been known to become feral and attack in the wilds of some lands. Guar are fierce if provoked, and have been known to kill. Their closest relatives are the &lt;a href=\"Alit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kagouti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kagouti&lt;/a&gt;, also common in the lands of Morrowind, as well as the &lt;a href=\"pony%20guar\"&gt;pony guar&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Pony Guar,\" as nicknamed by visitors to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, are a smaller species of guar that are rarely exported since they lack the physical strength of their larger cousins. Not well known outside of southern Morrowind, they are a curiosity sometimes raised as &lt;a href=\"Pony%20Guar%20%28Pet%29\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;, but some do raise them for their meat and skins.\nAlit and Kagouti\nAlit are close relatives to the guar with far sharper sets of teeth. They are omnivores and while they do not hunt in organized packs, they have been known to attack other creatures and even people for an opportunistic meal. Alit supplement their nutrition, much like the guar, by rooting. For many years, it became the vogue for exotic animal enthusiasts from &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; to import alit for their own amusement. Many escaped captivity, and their descendants can be found stalking the great forests of the southwest.\nKagouti are large, armored cousins of the guar and the alit. Their most distinctive features are their tusks and head crests. They are territorial, fierce, and hostile. They hunt in packs and have been known to be able to flip a full-grown &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; in the air with ease.\n&lt;a href=\"Scuttler%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Scuttler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bantam%20Guar\"&gt;Bantam Guar&lt;/a&gt;\nThe scuttler is a small, docile species of biped the size of a common housecat. They have no apparent forelegs, and survive on eating smaller insects and groundworms. Having completely different reproductive and growth cycles, they are not related to the guar or alit. Scuttlers are more similar to the cliff racer family of leathery flyers than their form would suggest. Smugglers have sold them as pets in ports from &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Haven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;.\nBantam Guar, despite their name, classify as part of the scuttler family and are not guar at all. Many have described them as \"ugly &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Online%29\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;,\" as they have a distinctive body shape and behavior that remind many of the common bird. They retain the vestigial wings, and unlike their cliff racer and cliff darter cousins, they cannot fly. Southern Morrowind farmers raise them for their eggs and meat."}

In speaking, and in &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;, the term mortal usually means a civilized mortal race, over those of beasts, creatures, and other uncivilized races. Immortals are thought to include &lt;a href=\"Deities\"&gt;Deities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, although their true immortality is debated.\nOrigin of mortals.\nAccording to lore, the origin of mortals starts first during the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, the time of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;'s interactions caused the formation of other beings in the Void. After the first of these beings, &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; brought time into existence, these \"divines\" were able to form distinct personalities and inhabit the many planes created through Anu and Padomay's conflicts of order and chaos. One of these beings, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; proposed a plan to the other et'Ada, to create a mortal plane of existence of their own design, in which they could create and influence mortal beings.\nAs the Et'Ada created this plane, they realized that Lorkhan's proposal resulted in each of them giving up portions of their divinity as they created. As the Et'Ada were not eternal, the energies they exerted in the creation of Nirn pulled parts of themselves into the plane, diminishing their immortality. (In some races' views this was a purposeful trickery by Lorkhan, as he was aware of this resulting in their loss of true divinity.)\nUpon this realization, many of the Et'Ada fled this mortal realm to avoid surrendering their immortality, and returned to their various planes. One group of these beings, however, fully surrendered their divinity, and formed the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. This now mortal race began to procreate in the physical sense, and eventually diverged into the mortal races of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

Morthal is a remote, fishing town found on the riverbanks of the &lt;a href=\"Hjaal%20River\"&gt;Hjaal River&lt;/a&gt;. It was supposedly named after the Cyro-Nordic Demigod, &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, who consorted with &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nDespite being the capital of a regional hold, Morthal is situated off the main road that runs throughout Hjaalmarch, being found between the fort-town of &lt;a href=\"Snowhawk\"&gt;Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt;, and the mining village of &lt;a href=\"Stonehills\"&gt;Stonehills&lt;/a&gt;. Morthal is a gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;Drajkmyr Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, which takes a large portion of Hjaalmarch. Much of the marsh is nothing but uninhabitable land, consisting of sunken ruins and caves. To the south of town lies the ancient city, currently known as the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, which looks over the majority of north-central Skyrim. As mentioned before, the region surrounding Morthal is uninhabitable, except for settlements found on the road between &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;. But ruins are found around Drajkmyr, such as the tombs of &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorthal itself is a medium-sized town, built at the end of a small mountain pass that connects it to the road. The dirt road that runs through town leads into a stone bridge that leads to the lumber mill and the Drajkmyr Marsh. Morthal is situated on an off-path river from the &lt;a href=\"River%20Hjaal\"&gt;River Hjaal&lt;/a&gt;, which starts from the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; and ends around the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;, where it meets the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Along the primary path is the seat of power, the &lt;a href=\"Highmoon%20Hall\"&gt;Highmoon Hall&lt;/a&gt;, a typical Nordic Longhouse for the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. Roads that go off the main street are wooden boardwalks where fishermen lay their boats, or just fish right there. Most homes are built on small plots of land that are connected to the sidewalk. Most of this is found in the east of town, while a minor part is found on the west side, where the residential inn, the &lt;a href=\"Moorside%20Inn\"&gt;Moorside Inn&lt;/a&gt; is found.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Western Skyrim.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt;, who was a close ally to Versidue Shaie but was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;, along with the decline of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. But the process for the next &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; would bring controversy. Naturally, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Freydis\"&gt;Queen Freydis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, Logrolf's daughter is to be named the High Queen, but even then, people were skeptical about this, with &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; claiming that she is an illegitimate heir to the throne, and that a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; must be called to determine another High King. In the end, the Moot had chosen Svartr as their High King, even though the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;, the deciding factor for High Kings since &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, had chosen Freydis. This caused a Schism in Skyrim, splitting it into an Eastern and Western Kingdom, with Svartr as the High King in the West, and Freydis as the High Queen in the East. The city-state of Morthal and the entirety of Hjaalmarch Hold join Svartr in the Western Kingdom.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Clan Axe-Bearer; the Keepers of the Razor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Axe-Bearer\"&gt;Clan Axe-Bearer&lt;/a&gt; from Morthal were among the original members of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Razor%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Keepers of the Razor&lt;/a&gt;, one of the militia groups that were created in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, in the effort to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. The group came into possession of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt; sometime after the failed expedition to &lt;a href=\"Varsa%20Baalim\"&gt;Varsa Baalim&lt;/a&gt; conducted by &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Frathen Drothan&lt;/a&gt;. The three broke the enchanted dagger into three pieces, given to the highest members of the group, one of them being &lt;a href=\"Lenne%20Axe-Bearer\"&gt;Lenne Axe-Bearer&lt;/a&gt;. For roughly eight generations, the pieces of the Razor were up in the air, essentially lost to time. Clan Axe-Bearer was given the &lt;a href=\"Hilt%20of%20Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Hilt of Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since then, the Keepers of the Razor disbanded, as the wielders of the razor pieces went their separate ways, disappearing all throughout &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Skyrim Civil War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Morthal was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Idgrod%20Ravencrone\"&gt;Jarl Idgrod Ravencrone&lt;/a&gt;, who was a Nordic mystic that was said to have visions granted to her by the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether it was true or not, she was a very spiritual woman. With the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; waging war with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, Jarl Ravencrone, and by extension, the city-state of Morthal allied with &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Idgrod was, however, uninterested in the Civil War, instead, she was focused on what the world has to offer, much to the dismay of the people. Many citizens of Morthal were worried about the Civil War. The Imperial Legion of Morthal was under the command of &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Taurinus%20Duilis\"&gt;Legate Taurinus Duilis&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled out of Highmoon Hall, and was a member of the Court of Morthal. Fort Snowhawk was their regional bulwark.\nThe case of Hroggar &amp; the house fire.\nIn the same year, tragedy struck when the house of &lt;a href=\"Hroggar\"&gt;Hroggar&lt;/a&gt; was burned to the ground, leaving his wife and child amidst the fire. Many were speculative to the incident, implying there was a motive to it since Hroggar stayed with &lt;a href=\"Alva\"&gt;Alva&lt;/a&gt;, another woman in Morthal, which he had an affair with. A &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;traveler&lt;/a&gt; had arrived into Morthal on the night after the fire, and undergone an investigation. It was revealed that Alva was a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;, from the hidden Coven controlled by &lt;a href=\"Movarth%20Piquine\"&gt;Movarth Piquine&lt;/a&gt; in the Marsh. Movarth attempted to enslave the entirety of Morthal, to which the people took to arms until they wimped out. In the end, the Vampire Coven was killed by the traveler, ending the threat that would have plagued Morthal."}

The main stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Snowhawk\"&gt;Fort Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt; that defends Morthal and the hold is located just northwest of Morthal between the swamps that encompass the northwestern part of Hjaalmarch.\nOverview.\nMorthal, said to be named after the great &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, lies deep in the marsh, a foreboding area of Hjaalmarch isolated from other villages and shrouded by a constant and ominous fog.\nMorthal's small population and relatively remote location have kept it distant from most major conflicts in recent years.\u00a0The citizens of Morthal appear reclusive and cautious of outsiders. They are quite vocal about removing the town's more recent settler, a wizard by the name of &lt;a href=\"Falion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falion&lt;/a&gt;. They fear he might upset the balance of their quiet and peaceful existence due to his magical training.\nDue to their distrust of magic, the Jarl does not have an acting &lt;a href=\"court%20wizard\"&gt;court wizard&lt;/a&gt; like many of the other hold capitals do. She remains neutral on the presence of a wizard in her town and allows him to practice &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and sell his supplies in the privacy of his own home.\nDue to its isolation and lagging economy, Morthal remains of little strategic importance in the war. The city's &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; appears to be its only source of trade, a point which the citizens show concern for. To the east of Morthal lies\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stonehills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stonehills&lt;/a&gt;, which supports\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rockwallow%20Mine\"&gt;Rockwallow Mine&lt;/a&gt;, the local &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; mine, but it is owned by &lt;a href=\"Bryling\"&gt;Bryling&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thanes&lt;/a&gt; of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0the provincial capital, under the late &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;'s wife, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;, and the ore is used to support the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; war effort.\nThere are few points of interest: nothing in the way of a market, no general goods stores; armorers, stables, farms and shrines are also notably absent from Morthal. However, there is an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; shop and an &lt;a href=\"Moorside%20Inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; where travelers passing through can look for work, rest and hear the latest rumors. The citizens will often speak of strange sounds, lights and shadows in the shrouded fog of the marshes at night. The city also contains an alchemy shop, and visitors may purchase spell tomes and enchanting supplies out of the home of a wizard recently making his home in Morthal. The\u00a0town also houses a &lt;a href=\"Guardhouse%20%28Morthal%29\"&gt;guardhouse&lt;/a&gt; for an &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Taurinus%20Duilis\"&gt;Imperial Legate&lt;/a&gt; stationed within; Hjaalmarch and its capital are under Imperial control.\nThere's not much to do in Morthal, but herbalists and alchemists will find a bounty of &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"swamp%20fungal%20pod\"&gt;swamp fungal pod&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20Chitin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mudcrab Chitin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Chitin\"&gt;Chaurus Chitin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"giant%20lichen\"&gt;giant lichen&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the vast expanses of swamp and marsh immediately surrounding Morthal. First time visitors to the town may notice an untended, burnt-down house on one edge of the town collecting fresh snowfall near the Moorside Inn. Many of Morthal's residents can be overheard gossiping about the wife and child burned alive in their home, and suspect foul play after noting &lt;a href=\"Laid%20to%20Rest\"&gt;the husband immediately moved in with another woman&lt;/a&gt; the following night.\u00a0Behind the burned down house there exists a small cemetery."}

Pick a leaf from the tree, then head south to collect the cave palm fruit. The palm tree will be besides a cooking fire. Once you have this, head west again ad you will find Satakal's Blossom growing by another well. Head just a bit more to the southwest to find the last ingredient, the cactus powder. The cactus will be growing next to a rock formation. You will also find a copy of the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"Sacrilege%20and%20Mayhem%20in%20the%20Alik%27r\"&gt;Sacrilege and Mayhem in the Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;\" lying around here, so be sure to pick that up. \nOnce you have all the ingredients, head back to the camp and to the tent of the Ash'abah leader Marimah.

The ingredients you gathered were not for a cure but for your initiation.

Circumstances have eventuated that render its continuance inadvisable. Indeed, pursuing the Endeavor would doubtless lead to a loss of Guild lives, as well as being sacrilegious (even more than usual).\nI hasten to point out that no taint of fault should be inferred as to the perfection of your peerless plans, O my Doyen. Following your instructions, our subversion of Motalion Funerary Overseer Parvizh al-&lt;a href=\"Tigonus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tigonus&lt;/a&gt; went flawlessly\u2014indeed, he was willing to accept only 15 percent of the pillaging proceeds when we were willing to go as high as 20 percent. In the weeks since he agreed to our proposal, the looting of the crypts and mausoleums in the southern quadrant of the necropolis was accomplished according to Your Doyenhood's admirably aggressive schedule, despite the back injury suffered by Footpad Quyen in the Crypt of Virtuous Maidens.\nThe harvesting and sale of the Sacred &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Welkynds&lt;/a&gt; was likewise a complete success, and your idea of substituting imitation stones of turquoise glass treated with glow-spells has left none the wiser. The cost of paying Affab the Illuminary to renew the glow-spells once every ten-day is scarab-feed compared to what we were able to realize from the welkynd stones on the thaumaturgical after-market.\nIn hindsight, your advice that we start with the quadrant wherein were interred the most affluent of our ancestors fully justifies the eminent position in which you find yourself. Though we refrained, of course, from irreverent treatment of the sarcophagi, the valuable trappings and regalia of the outer tombs were stripped during those periods when Overseer Parvizh had the watchmen patrolling elsewhere. It is unlikely that the eastern and western quadrants, where the less prosperous of our brethren are buried, would even together equal the take brought in from the southern.\nBut now I must reluctantly turn to the reason for our regrettable abandonment of Your Doyenhood's supremely excellent Motalion Endeavor. The northern quadrant, where the authorities have seen fit to bury the corpses of those who were impious or criminal in life, has been afflicted by a horrific rising of &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ra-Netu\"&gt;Ra-Netu&lt;/a&gt; in numbers have crawled from their crypts, and are now a profane presence across the entire necropolis. This may be due, as I believe, to Overseer Parvizh sending the watchmen too often into the unclean quadrant, or it may be the result of some other desecration. If it was the fault of the Overseer, he has certainly paid the price, as he was one of the first victims of these risen dead.\nI also regret to report the death of Footpad Quyen, whose back went out in an untimely manner while fleeing from a Ra-Netu at the base of the Ninety-Nine Stairs. His surviving family will receive the usual stipend.\nWith the Utmost Esteem,\nOperative Maffud"}

Here I'm told the Dark Mane has holed up. After what it did to Mane Akkhuz-ri, we must destroy it.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20to%20Moonmont\"&gt;The Path to Moonmont&lt;/a&gt;,\" Shazah will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mane%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Mane&lt;/a&gt; has taken up residence in the temple, killed most of the priests, and darkened the beacons that mark the holy site. She will ask for your help in restoring the beacons so that you all can enter the temple proper and fight the Dark Mane. She will give you a piece of paper with a prayer on it, which you should recite to cleanse the beacons. \nThere are four beacons in total, to the northwest, southwest, northeast, and southeast of the holy site. They are hard to miss; giant pillars with darkness swirling around them. Fight your way through the &lt;a href=\"Dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;Dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt; and purify each of the beacons. At the southeastern one, you will meet Shazah, who will tell you that the dark energies here are especially powerful and that she has to do the purifying here while you fend off the Dro-m'Athra. After all of the beacons have been purified, head to the temple itself and talk to &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;Khali&lt;/a&gt; there. When you are done talking, Shazah will dispel the ward on the door, and you can get inside. \nProceed through the temple and fight through the Dro-m'Athra until you reach the middle room. There, you will run into the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Rid-Thar-ri%27Datta\"&gt;Rid-Thar-ri'Datta&lt;/a&gt;; speak with him and he will tell you that the altars in this room need to be realigned with the lunar phases in order to open the door ahead. You can discern which altar should be aligned with which phase by looking at the wall plaques. The altar on the right should be the waxing moons (left-facing crescent), the middle one should be the full moons and the left one should be the waning moons (right-facing crescent). Once the altars are realigned, Shazah will dispel the barrier and you all can proceed. While you are looking for the Dark Mane in the next room, he will capture Shazah and Khali; you will have to face him by yourself. He will summon a spectral Senche to aid him in the battle. \nDefeat the Dark Mane to free Shazah and Khali. He will try to flee but will be captured by Rid-Thar-ri'Datta. Speak with the first Mane and he will tell you that it is now time to choose which of the champions will become the next Mane. The other will stay here in Moonmont to guard the Dark Mane. Speak with bot of them; they will try to convince you that it should be them, not their sister, who stays here and guards the Dark Mane. Whichever one you choose to stay, speak with the other one to finish the quest."}

They also guard the deeper parts of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moths\"&gt;Temple of the Ancestor Moths&lt;/a&gt; where they reside.

Sometimes, the priests may venture out into the world to search for more scrolls for the library in the White-Gold Tower.\nMoth Priests eventually become blind as a result of continuous reading of the Elder Scrolls. Typically, this occurs due to a combined result of both decades of studying the scrolls and old age.

Most of these species have several varieties.\nStats and progression.\nMounts have stats (Speed, Stamina, Carrying Capacity) which may be increased by upgrading at a stablemaster every 20 hours, causing a gain in level for each of the three skills. These gains are permanent and cumulative. The riding skill can be fully upgraded to 60% speed, 60 stamina, and 60 carrying capacity. Crown-bought mounts are purely cosmetic and do not have any advantage over mounts purchased with gold. All mounts start with the same stats regardless of choice.\nEach upgrade level costs 250 . Which amounts to 45,000 spent on feedings and at minimum 3,600 hours spent for a fully upgraded mount.\nA mount's three stats determine the following:\nAcquisition.\nMounts may be bought at any level for various prices from stablemasters in major cities throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt;.

Previously, there was a cheaper 10,000 option, but this is now only unlocked for free upon reaching level 10, and the cheapest &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt;-bought mount is 900 . There are no level restrictions on purchasing a mount meaning that players may ride one at any level. Players may have multiple mounts, although they can only have one with them at a time. You can change your primary mount at any time in the Collections menu. The appearance of a mount is determined by both the species of mount and the level of the three riding skills.\nList of mounts.\nThe following are mounts that appear in \"The Elder Scrolls Online\":"}

{"id": "796484", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=796484", "title": "Mournhold", "text": "Mournhold, Almalexia, or the City of Light and Magic is one of the eight major cities in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and is the capital of &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;. Mournhold is also the seat of the Great House Indoril, a very orthodox and conservative political house with a strong connection to the religious culture of Morrowind.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nMournhold is located within the center of the Deshaan Plains, on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Amaya\"&gt;Lake Amaya&lt;/a&gt;, in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Lagomere\"&gt;Lagomere&lt;/a&gt; region and it depends heavily on the trade between House Hlaalu and House Dres and the river basin around the city. Mournhold is nestled in between two mountains that lead into the &lt;a href=\"Redolent%20Loam\"&gt;Redolent Loam&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Ghost%20Snake\"&gt;Vale of the Ghost Snake&lt;/a&gt;. Mournhold is a fortress city, with defense all around the city-state. It is divided into five districts, each serving a different purpose than each other. With the rise of Tiber Septim, Almalexia commenced the construction of an outer city which was named Almalexia in her honor, following the same naming scheme as &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. The inner city would be named Mournhold, retaining the name it had held for many years. The farmland south of Mournhold is occupied by the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, which uses it to grow their &lt;a href=\"Saltrice\"&gt;Saltrice&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; is one of several temples dedicated to the Tribunal, and it takes a large portion of Mournhold.\nMournhold is one of the largest cities in the continent of Tamriel, comparable to the likes of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. Mournhold in itself is divided into five districts, each serving a different purpose. The &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Plaza Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt; is the southernmost district and is the center of social commerce in the city. In the middle of the area is a gigantic statue of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, depicting their fight after the Sack of Mournhold. Rivers spewing from Lake Amaya run through the Plaza and give the gardens a vibrant look of colors. The eastern district is called the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bazaar\"&gt;Great Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, housing various stalls and caravans from as far as &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;. There is a theatre located in the western portion of the Bazaar. The district of the west is called &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt; and is the home of the nobility and the west entrance of Mournhold, leading into the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Gorge\"&gt;Obsidian Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Because Mournhold is the capital of House Indoril, many Indoril nobles live in Godsreach. The central area is the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20Banking%20District\"&gt;Mournhold Banking District&lt;/a&gt;, which was converted into the Palace of Mournhold, where the Dukes of Mournhold live. The northern district is the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Courtyard\"&gt;Temple Courtyard&lt;/a&gt;, surrounding the Tribunal Temple of Mournhold, which is where &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; resides.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Staff of Chaos &amp; Modern-Day Mournhold.\nMany years ago, the city-state of Mournhold was one nation, combined with the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Lian\"&gt;Queen Lian&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of the great &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;, Witch-King of Ebonheart. When Lian passed away, her two sons were left joint thrones, and so the city of Ebonheart split into the modern-day Ebonheart and modern-day Mournhold. To ensure its safety, Moraelyn had left the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; underneath the city of Mournhold, supposedly the birthplace of &lt;a href=\"Ephen\"&gt;Ephen&lt;/a&gt;, a God of Morrowind. The Staff remained within the confines of Mournhold for many years.\nThe Sack of Mournhold; Enter the Second Age.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Mournhold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;, the Duke-Prince of Mournhold and was an ally of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. Dorom had an affair with a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i witch named &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt;, who hailed from the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Phrygias\"&gt;Barony of Phrygias&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt;. When it was confirmed that Turala was pregnant, she was cast out of Mournhold and Brindisi's domain. That child was named &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in the &lt;a href=\"Kavas%20Rim%20Pass\"&gt;Kavas Rim Pass&lt;/a&gt;, in between Cyrodiil and Morrowind. Sometime later, Brindisi Dorom had paid the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate both &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Juilek Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;, both of which had conquered the province of Morrowind in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;. Months later, the Skeffington Coven was raided, killing many witches in the group as well as the infant Bosriel. Turala believed that the assassins were sent by Brindisi Dorom, killing the bastard child he had with Turala. Because of his grudge against the Tribunal, &lt;a href=\"Cassyr%20Whitley\"&gt;Cassyr Whitley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; lied to Turala, saying that it was Brindisi Dorom that sent these assassins. Believing this lie, Turala called upon &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; and ordered him to destroy the city of Mournhold, like how &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the township of &lt;a href=\"Gil-Var-Delle\"&gt;Gil-Var-Delle&lt;/a&gt;. Brindisi Dorom and many other innocents were killed in the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Mournhold\"&gt;Sack of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged by this, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; battled Mehrunes Dagon, casting him into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; for destroying her city. It was from then on, Almalexia remained in Mournhold, watching over the city as it rebuilds. As time went on Juilek would be assassinated in the &lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dorsza Pass&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and Reman III would be murdered by &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt; of the Morag Tong in his throne room, marking the beginning of the second era.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Blight upon the Land; The Llodos Plague.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt; had swept the entire region of Deshaan, killing off the denizens one by one. The &lt;a href=\"Maulborn\"&gt;Maulborn&lt;/a&gt; was the group responsible for the disease, attempting to diminish the power that the Tribunal had over their province. After the events in &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;, many citizens from Deshaan traveled to Mournhold, to seek refuge and to avoid the plague. &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; of the Tribunal requested the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, to help her people in these dire times. The Vestige and &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; investigated the city in search of a presence of the Maulborn. Through manipulation, the duo uncovered a Maulborn agent entering the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; farmstead and into the Mournhold Underground.\nThe Plot against Mournhold; The Maulborn Cult.\nThe Mournhold Underground houses the ruffians and lowlives of the city-state, as well as the entirety of the Deshaan Plains; it was perfect for the Maulborn to conceived something dangerous. To avoid detection from the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s of Mournhold, the Maulborn utilized barriers created by the Morag Tong to remain hidden. It was in the central tunnel, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Kalara\"&gt;Commander Kalara&lt;/a&gt; had mustered an army of Maulborn warriors to invade the surface. The Vestige and Naryu Virian were cornered by the warriors until Almalexia herself appeared before the two heroes, obliterating the Maulborn threat inside Mournhold. Some of the Maulborn had escaped, infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20Temple\"&gt;Mournhold Temple&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to steal the &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Judgment of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nMission for Veloth's Judgement; Fall of Magistrix Vox.\nThe Maulborn retrieval group was led by a Dunmeri sorcerer named &lt;a href=\"Sathram\"&gt;Sathram&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken the hammer from inside the Tribunal Inner Sanctum. The Maulborn had captured the temple, unleashing daedra to help them in their endeavor. The Vestige entered the temple, defeating the daedra and Maulborn throughout the temple. Because the Inner Sanctum was sealed, the Vestige must be granted the blessing from each aspect of the Tribunal, completing tasks that cater to the Tribunal's specialty. After gaining entrance into the Inner Sanctum, the Vestige defeated Sathram, but the hammer was long gone, in possession of &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Vox\"&gt;Magistrix Vox&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Maulborn. The Tribunal won the battle, but the war was still active. Vox would ravage the &lt;a href=\"Siltreen\"&gt;Siltreen&lt;/a&gt; countryside. Vox would eventually be defeated the Vestige at &lt;a href=\"Eidolon%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Eidolon's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Talosian Conquest &amp; Almalexia City.\nDuring the waning years of the Interregnum, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; had usurped the throne of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the Emperor of Cyrodiil. Septim desired to conquer the provinces of Tamriel, one by one until they bowed down under a single banner. The &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; had garnered control over &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the signing of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;First Treaty of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;. Talos had set out to conquer Morrowind by order of &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt;, besieging settlements ranging from the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; to the township of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;. To protect her beautiful city, Almalexia of the Tribunal commissioned the construction of an outer city, surrounding the already established Mournhold. This more significant city was called Almalexia, following the naming scheme of the other Tribunal domains, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. However, this extension was unnecessary because Tiber Septim and Vivec had created the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt;, which incorporated Morrowind into the Septim Empire. This treaty also made the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; prohibited to the outsiders of Morrowind.\nEnter Barenziah, the Queen of Morrowind.\nTiber Septim invaded the province of Morrowind after the Great Houses decided not bend to his whim. When Septim invaded the city of Mournhold, the King and Queen had taken their daughter, &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; into hiding and was taken by &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, a Dunmeri General in the Septim Empire to the township of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoor\"&gt;Darkmoor&lt;/a&gt;, located in central Skyrim. There Barenziah was taken care off by &lt;a href=\"Count%20Sven%20Advensen\"&gt;Count Sven Advensen&lt;/a&gt; of Darkmoor. Barenziah eventually escaped Darkmoor and fled to the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; near Lake Ilinalta with a stable boy, &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;. Both had a relationship together and eventually moved to the city of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, where Symmachus discovered Barenziah and dealt with Straw behind Barenziah's back. Symmachus took her back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; where she would await the day she would become the Queen of Mournhold.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nightingale's Legacy &amp; Jagar Tharn.\nAt the age of eighteen, Barenziah assumed the throne of Mournhold, with Symmachus as her advisor. As time went on, Barenziah and Symmachus fell in love, leading to two marrying years later. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20376\"&gt;3E 376&lt;/a&gt;, Barenziah had her first child named &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, and eight years later, she had her second child, &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, who was named after Symmachus' mother. Around the same time as the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; was stolen within the vaults of Mournhold by an illustrious stranger known as &lt;a href=\"Drayven%20Indoril\"&gt;the Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;, this news was suppressed and was forgotten sometime later. The Nightingale supposedly had an affair with Barenziah, having a child named &lt;a href=\"Dralsi%20Indoril\"&gt;Dralsi Indoril&lt;/a&gt; who was abandoned by her mother, to hide the truth of the Nightingale's identity. The man who she claimed was the Nightingale, was &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, who did obtain the Staff of Chaos, by hiring the Nightingale to retrieve it. Dralsi traveled the world seeking her father and finally finding him in &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt;, where he passed the mantle of Nightingale to her, she eventually passed that mantle to her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;, who was active in the fourth era.\nMournhold during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Mournhold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Zirik\"&gt;King Zirik&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arnesian War &amp; King Eadwyre of Wayrest.\nRelations between Mournhold and the Empire were slowly deteriorating, causing civil unrest throughout the Kingdom of Mournhold in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking a reason for this, Barenziah traveled to the Imperial City to seek an audience with Uriel Septim VII to learn what had happened in the Heartland of the Empire. Symmachus remained in Mournhold to deal with the revolution stirring up inside the city. However, Symmachus had unfortunately fallen in battle during the slave's revolt, bring dread to the Court of Mournhold. Learning that his friend had passed, &lt;a href=\"King%20Eadwyre\"&gt;King Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the city to comfort his friend's mourning wife. Eadwyre had visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; appearing in his dreams and revealing the truth about Jagar Tharn. Barenziah had left a key that helped the Eternal Champion escape the Imperial Dungeons, both Eadwyre and Barenziah fled to Wayrest to escape Tharn's wrath, waiting for the time when the Eternal Champion would defeat the Imperial Battlemage. Eadwyre and Barenziah grew fond of each other and married together, remaining in Wayrest with Helseth and Morgiah. Her family member, &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne in her absences.\nThe Nerevarine Prophecy &amp; Helseth Hlaalu.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, portions of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; had been fulfilled by slaying the vile &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; atop of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Thus preventing the spread of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blight\"&gt;the Blight&lt;/a&gt; onto the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of Tamriel. Around the same time, High King Athyn Llethan had passed, ending his reign as the King of Mournhold. Without any direct heirs, his great-nephew, Helseth Hlaalu assumed the throne. Many people believed that it was Helseth that poisoned Llethan, seeing how Helseth is infamous for pursuing his goals, one way or the other. To quote a Nordic Diplomat, \"The new king is manipulative, ruthless, and calculating. He is exactly what Morrowind needs.\" In his youth as a Prince of Wayrest, he would blackmail, bribe, and assassinate nobles to grow his step-father's Kingdom further. Supposedly, because of the Nerevarine's infinite power, Helseth had sent the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to kill them, ultimately leading to end of the Mournhold Chapter of the Brotherhood by the hand of the Nerevarine. When the warrior tried to dispute this, the whole situation was swept under the rug.\nThe Nerevarine Exploits in Mournhold &amp; the Fabricants.\nAs time went on, the Nerevarine ventured throughout the bustling metropolis of Mournhold, dealing with the issues that threaten the denizens of Indoril capital, among other requests straight from &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; herself. There have been tales of the Nerevarine's exploits, ranging from seeking a &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; Army from deep within the catacombs of Mournhold to retrieving a &lt;a href=\"Barilzar%27s%20Mazed%20Band%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Mazed Band&lt;/a&gt;. Which originated from &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;, the former apprentice of the great &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. Almalexia grew pleased with her new champion but soon concluded, coming to realize the true identity of the Nerevarine. The Nerevarine Prophecy was instituted in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, sealing the fate of the Tribunal. Not wanting to lose what she had accumulated since then, Almalexia plotted against the Nerevarine from within the shadows and slowly went mad as a result. Traversing into the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia killed her longtime friend, Sotha Sil and unleashed his &lt;a href=\"Fabricant\"&gt;Fabricant&lt;/a&gt;s onto the city of Mournhold, where she quickly returned to her temple.\nMission to Bamz-Amschend; Sotha Sil the Tinkerer.\nAlmalexia sent the Nerevarine on a mission to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwarven Ruins housing the Clockwork City and a Weather Changing Machine built by the Dwemer, within a celestial sphere. It was there; the Nerevarine discovered that the Dwarven Animunculi of Bamz-Amschend were fighting the Fabricants of the Clockwork City. With this news, the Nerevarine reported back to the Ordinators and Helseth Hlaalu, where they would investigate the attack on &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Plaza Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that this warrior was indeed the Nerevarine, Almalexia told the story of &lt;a href=\"Hopesfire\"&gt;Hopesfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trueflame\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;, and that the champion should reforge the weapon, Trueflame, the blade that once belonged to her lover, &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. With the newly reforged Trueflame, Almalexia teleported the Nerevarine to the Clockwork City where they would confront the Fabricants and eventually Sotha Sil, the one who supposedly unleashed the Fabricants onto Mournhold. The Nerevarine discovered the deceased corpse of Sotha Sil perched on a pole as his body decomposes, he was dead long before the champion had found him.\nFulfilling the Nerevarine Prophecy; Tale of Almalexia the Mad.\nBefore the Nerevarine could return to Tamriel, they were encountered by Almalexia, who wielded the blade, Hopesfire. Knowing that her fate was coming to an end, Almalexia intentionally attacked her city. Almalexia unleashed the Fabricants so that she could protect them from the conflict, reinstating the love and support that she had manifested throughout the eras. Out of the three Tribunal, Almalexia did not hold remorse for her actions as much as &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and Sotha Sil, living the life of a god had taken a toll on her, filling the hole where her love for Nerevar was original. Almalexia and the Nerevarine fought with the twin blades, Trueflame and Hopesfire. But as the prophecy foretold, the champion had killed Almalexia, ending the Mad God and her scheme against the Nerevarine. With &lt;a href=\"Barilzar%27s%20Mazed%20Band\"&gt;Barilzar's Mazed Band&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior returned to Mournhold.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Red Year &amp; the Fall of the Tribunal's Morrowind.\nAs time went on, the Tribunal's influence had disappeared in the province of Morrowind. Rumors arose throughout the province that Almalexia had gone mad and killed Sotha Sil in his domain, where the Nerevarine would eventually kill her. All that remained of the Tribunal was Vivec, who resided in his city of Vivec until he disappeared, out of the public eye. The Nerevarine Prophecy indicates that Vivec would have died at the hands of the Nerevarine, but it is unknown whether this was the case. Vivec's magic held the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; atop of his city and now that he is gone, the magic that held the meteor faded, and it continued to fall until it was restored by a machine known as the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;, being operated by &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the Ingenium had failed, and the meteor had finally destroyed Vivec City, leaving it as the &lt;a href=\"Scathing%20Bay\"&gt;Scathing Bay&lt;/a&gt;. This year would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, since &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted as an after effect by the destruction of Vivec City. Mournhold was not affected by this event, but it caused an uproar in Mournhold and the Almalexia City. It was at this time, faith in the Tribunal began to dwindle. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; councilor in Mournhold created a relief effort to rebuild all the settlements destroyed in the sub-continent of Vvardenfell, which includes &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suran\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, Vvardenfell is continuing to be rebuilt.\nTerror from the Marsh; Enter the An-Xileel.\nIn the aftermath of the Red Year, Morrowind was in repair and a vulnerable position. The past five or six years have been rough for all of the provinces in Tamriel, more specifically for Morrowind. The &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; besieged several locations, most notably the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. The Oblivion Crisis in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was barely an issue with the newly formed government, the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;. The An-Xileel were able to push back the Daedric forces into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, establishing their rule over Black Marsh. With their combined power, the Argonians invaded Morrowind. In &lt;a href=\"4E%206\"&gt;4E 6&lt;/a&gt;, Mournhold was sacked by the Argonians, leaving the city in ruins. Because of this, the capital of Morrowind was changed from Mournhold to &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; had left Morrowind in shambles, resulting in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; and many &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; being relocated to Skyrim and eventually, &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, which was given to Morrowind by the High King of Skyrim in &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Accession War; Modern-Day Mournhold.\nBy &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Mournhold had been fully repaired. Many of the people that had fled northwards had returned to the city. When the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt; established the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, any remnants of Almalexia and the Tribunal were removed from the Mournhold Temple. In its place, the Temple built a new sanctuary for the Real Tribunal, which consisted of the Daedric Princes &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. House Indoril lost a majority of their power with the loss of the Tribunal but remained a Great House after the fact. Plaza Brindisi Dorom had changed significantly when the architects of House Redoran built a new building for priests and pilgrims coming to Mournhold, to pay respects to the New Temple. Even though Mournhold thrived once again, Blacklight remained the capital of the province, especially since House Redoran became the primary house of Morrowind."}

Almalexia, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and Vivec were too late to stop the Daedric Prince but managed to banish him back to Oblivion. The ruins of the city then became known as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mournhold\"&gt;Old Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, while the city was built anew on top of the ruins.\nMournhold is a large temple-city within the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, the largest and oldest city in Morrowind, named for its patron goddess. Almalexia is truly an ancient city, possibly predating the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. It is reputed to be built over the ruins of a vast &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; city named &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt; , although the current inhabitants vigorously deny this.\nThis is also the seat of government for the Dark Elves, where the priests of the Tribunal rule in the name of their legendary deities. Mournhold was not destroyed like some of the other cities in Morrowind after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Mournhold is the setting of the Tribunal questline during the Tribunal expansion pack.\nIn DLC, it is stated that Mournhold was\u00a0sacked by &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; some time in the 4th Era, during the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, but is in the process of rebuilding. The province's capital then switched to &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;.\nDistricts.\nMournhold is separated by large walls into five distinct districts:\nGodsreach.\nGodsreach is on the far west side of Mournhold and is the upscale residential area of Mournhold. Located here are manors, The Craftsmen's Hall, a tavern, and the Mournhold Museum of Artifacts. One of several entrances to the Mournhold Sewers is located in Godsreach. It is connected to the Temple Courtyard and Plaza Brindisi Dorom.\nThe Great Bazaar.\nThe Great Bazaar is the merchant quarter of Mournhold. There is an outdoor theater located on the west side of this quarter. The east side has two rows of shops. The north row has a magic shop, armorer, and bookseller. The south row has a clothier, pawnbroker, and trader. At the very south corner of the Great Bazaar is the entrance to the Bazaar Sewers. The Great Bazaar is connected to the Temple Courtyard (Northeast Gate) and Plaza Brindisi Dorom (Southeast Gate).\nThe Plaza Brindisi Dorom.\nThe Plaza Brindisi Dorom occupies the southernmost area of Mournhold. It is an arboretum dominated by a great &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20and%20Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; at its center.

The palace is in the center of the city and is accessible from the Temple Courtyard, Plaza Brindisi Dorom, and the Palace Sewers.\nTemple Courtyard.\nThe Temple Courtyard is an enclosed area dominated by Almalexia's High Temple. It is connected to Godsreach, Royal Palace, and the Great Bazaar.\nUnderground Sublocations.\nOld Mournhold.\nOld Mournhold is found under the city of Mournhold. It is the ruins of the ancient city over which Mournhold was built. Old Mournhold can be accessed from many trapdoors found around the city and serves partly as sewers, and houses many hostile beings.\nBamz-Amschend.\nBamz-Amschend is a large Dwemer ruin buried under Plaza Brindisi Dorom's &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20and%20Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorenen-dur.\nNorenen-dur is a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; shrine found under Mournhold.

She will also provide an optional target, &lt;a href=\"Nilsine%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Nilsine Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;, however Nilsine does not have to be killed to complete this quest. Furthermore, if Alain was killed prior to the start of the quest, Muiri will become intimidated and not offer the optional part of this quest. \nTalk to Muiri.\nAfter Astrid assigns the contract and points out who to speak to, the quest continues in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, where Muiri can be found.

Once inside, Dufont can be reached in two ways: by moving past the flames to a leveled locked gate, and directly into a room with Dufont and two bandits; or by working around the ruin using stealth. Working up and around the ruin, going through a second Master level gate will lead to a platform above Dufont. On this platform there will be two levers, and next to them are the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Ballista%20Trap\"&gt;Dwarven ballista traps&lt;/a&gt; they fire. These fire explosives down at Dufont and his bandit comrades if the levers are activated.\nReward.\nMuiri will provide the Dragonborn with 600\u20131200 depending on their level for the successful assassination of Dufont\nKill Nilsine Shatter-Shield (optional).\nThere is a bug that may prevent completion of this quest unless the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;\" is completed first.\nThis part of the quest is located in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest way to locate Nilsine is to make this quest active, then follow her quest arrow. If Dufont is killed before beginning \"Mourning Never Comes,\" the optional objective to kill Nilsine will not be available, even if she is also killed beforehand.\nReward.\nMuiri will give the Dragonborn &lt;a href=\"Muiri%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Muiri's Ring&lt;/a&gt; if Shatter-Shield is killed as an optional objective.\nReturn to Muiri.\nMuiri will provide the Dragonborn their reward or rewards after they return to her in Markarth to report the success of the contract.

In the Great Hall, Rurelion explains that the Mourning Stone is required to trap Uldor in his tomb. Depending on who is chosen to bond with Uldor, either he or Gathwen will fetch it to seal the tomb.

Deaths during raids do occur, but they are incidental and usually regretted and many raids conclude with no fighting whatsoever.\nWhen a tribe member is slain, they are symbolically replaced via a hostage-taking raid. The tribe will seize a captive from a neighboring band. If the deceased was an especially powerful or prestigious member of the tribe, multiple captives may be taken to replace them.\nAfter a period of physical torture (supposedly to test their worthiness) the captive is joyously welcomed into the clan.

The Mournoth on the High Rock side of the Bjoulsae is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim to the northeast, and &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrouble in Evermore; Imperial Incursion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; was under the rule of King &lt;a href=\"Eamond%20Guimard\"&gt;Eamond Guimard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Arzhela\"&gt;Queen Arzhela&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom had children named Elara and Adrien. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; of the Empire and &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign for the territory across the Bjoulsae River and the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Eamond Guimard caught wind of the situation and traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt; in the south to deal with the threat, they were ultimately defeated, and both Eamond and Adrien passed away. Arzhela of Cumberland mourned for both her husband and son's death and sought aid from the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Renchant\"&gt;Duke Renchant&lt;/a&gt; became the de facto leader of Evermore and both him and Arzhela governed the Kingdom in the impending battle against the Legion. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the Covenant traveled to Evermore to learn of the situation. Strange talking crows began to appear before the Vestige and told them of Imperial agents throughout Evermore. The Vestige was able to uncover the agents and saved Evermore from betraying the Covenant. It was later revealed that Duke Renchant was responsible for bringing them into Evermore and saw the Empire as the only viable option now. He was later apprehended. The Crows appeared before the Vestige and told them off another invasion from the north, the crows worked for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Witnesses\"&gt;Dark Witnesses&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, they planned on invading Evermore.\nThe Battle of Northglen; Dark Witnesses in Bangkorai.\nThe Evermore militia led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Eugien%20Gaercroft\"&gt;Captain Eugien Gaercroft&lt;/a&gt; advanced into the farming settlement of &lt;a href=\"Northglen\"&gt;Northglen&lt;/a&gt; where the Dark Witnesses have captured the farm and grown bloodthorns across the fields. The Vestige traveled into the Northglen countryside and met with the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Wyrd\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Woods\"&gt;Viridian Woods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Delphique\"&gt;Wyress Delphique&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige destroyed the Reachmen markers throughout the fields that were growing &lt;a href=\"Lurcher\"&gt;Lurcher&lt;/a&gt;s and other battlements. The leader of the Reachmen was &lt;a href=\"Duraeg\"&gt;Duraeg&lt;/a&gt;, who was defeated by both the Vestige and the Wyress. From there, the Evermore militia was able to kill off the Reachmen seeds growing the creatures. The battle was over, but it would soon continue to the northern end of the &lt;a href=\"Halcyon%20Lake\"&gt;Halcyon Lake&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Jackdaw%20Cove\"&gt;Jackdaw Cove&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Glenmoril Wyrd and Uela the Dark Witness.\nThe Glenmoril have stationed outside of the Jackdaw Cove area with their leader, &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Rashan\"&gt;Wyress Rashan&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige and Rashan hatched a plan to infiltrate the ruins and to destroy their totems, the ones controlling their Lurchers. Rashan transformed the Vestige into an ethereal wolf and sent them off to destroy the totems across the ruins. With the totems obliterated, the Vestige approached &lt;a href=\"Uela\"&gt;Uela&lt;/a&gt;'s tower. Uela was the leader of the Reachmen Tribe; she was stationed in a tower on an island in the middle of Halcyon Lake. The Vestige defeated the witch and took her heart as a trophy for the Glenmoril. The Dark Witness conflict was over, but the Seventh Legion advanced into the &lt;a href=\"Ephesus\"&gt;Ephesus&lt;/a&gt; region in the south, they reportedly took the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress between High Rock and Hammerfell.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMournoth during the Warp in the West.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Fiefdom of Mournoth was independent among the other twenty-three regions of the Iliac Bay. Mournoth was located deep within the Dragontail Mountains and was situated in the Hammerfell side of the Bjoulsae River. Later on, in the same year, the Fiefdom of Mournoth was annexed into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; along with the other nations around the Bjoulsae Riverbank."}

{"id": "582068", "revid": "1968856", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=582068", "title": "Muatra", "text": "Muatra, meaning Milk-Taker, is either a metaphorical or literal spear wielded by the god-king &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Texts such as the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\" also use \"spear\" metaphorically to represent the genitals of Vivec and others.\nVivec supposedly made the spear from his own love and turned it into a deadly weapon by utilizing a secret he \"bit off\" &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s spear while they were married. After attacking Molag Bal, Vivec used his new spear to kill all the thousands of offspring he had birthed with his then spouse, turning them into barren and withered bone-shapes. It was at this point that it was named Muatra.\nThe Eight Monsters.\nAfter killing the offspring Vivec had with Molag Bal he had learned that eight monsters had escaped Muatra. Though one of the monsters he had already defeated with his decision to create the \"Book of Hours,\" Vivec needed to hunt down eight monsters with Muatra, who lived in the \"middle world.\" Vivec launched these attacks from his vantage point in the Provisional House he created in the non-spatial space.\nThe fights themselves are of a legendary and symbolic manner, many of which probably did not truly happen in history as recorded in the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;36 Lessons&lt;/a&gt;\". They were said to represent the issues of Vivec and be imaginary allegories of unknown incidents.\nMoon Axle.\nMoon Axle was the First monster to come from the Muatra, and was said to be born twice. Moon Axle was comprised of many straight lines which did not stay in a single place for extended periods of time, giving him an inherent dual nature. Avoiding all true segments, Moon Axle was therefore immune to spears. In order to kill him, Vivec struck him with a curved sword and wrapped him with the rounded souls of nix hounds he found in a canyon, solving its nature. The soul resin made Moon Axle unable to move and rendered his immunity to spears useless. Vivec then pierced Moon Axle with Muatra, which made him completely static and shattered him.\nThe Treasure Wood Sword.\nThe Treasure Wood Sword was not as much of a monster as it was a sword. The antique existed before lines of martial arts had shown that straight lines could be bent into the sine waves necessary for Moon Axle's nature. Those who wielded the sword were said to become self-known. The sword was being safeguarded in an old ancestor tomb of House Mora, held by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; who were obligated by a deal with the House's prince. However, the King of Assassins awarded the sword to Vivec after he proved his worth through a mass movement of sex and murder. This possibly denoting the point in history when the Morag Tong began revering Vivec in place of his anticipation, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde Mountain.\nHorde Mountain, the third monster to escape Muatra, was a large conical shaped being formed from modular patterns of warriors being stacked upon each other so high the upmost could cut the clouds. Before Vivec actually fought the monster, the armies of three lower houses had trapped the mountain in a net made of doubtful-doctrine. Vivec celebrated the three houses and had their leaders marry to form his &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec then killed Horde Mountain by piercing it with Muatra, with its bones becoming the foundation stones for the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pocket Cabal.\nThe Pocket Cabal was the fourth monster to escape Muatra, and hid itself within the spell-list of the greatest &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i wizards of the East. Vivec disguised himself as a traveler and Muatra as a dwarf, but after a year or two of concealment and Muatra eating the Pocket Cabal's words, it discovered Vivec and hid within the mouths of penned slaves, making them erupt in a babble of arcane knowledge that pierced into the &lt;a href=\"Lyg\"&gt;Adjacent Place&lt;/a&gt;. The greatest of the wizards confronted Vivec with the mess he caused, but was killed by Vivec for his arrogance. The wizard's large bug harness then fell on the slave pen, accidentally releasing them all. In order to contain the Pocket Cabal, Vivec created a dome headed demon and trapped all the slaves within it, stating that this land was now a land where sorcery was broken and maligned. &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, who was very intrigued by the Cabal, was given permission to treasure the monster.\nRuddy Man.\nThe fifth monster to escape Muatra was the Ruddy Man, who took the form of an old image of Molag Bal, worshiped back when the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s ruled the world. Vivec considered him to be the least complicated monster to escape Muatra, as he was merely an armor who made whoever wore him into a killer. The Ruddy Man corrupted a child from &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; and his clash with Vivec was said to have created the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;, with Vivec finally defeating him in &lt;a href=\"Koal%20Cave\"&gt;Koal Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec awarded the Ruddy Man's shell to the queen of the Dreughs with the promise that they would safe guard it from the outside world. However, in ten years time, the Ruddy Man rose again near &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, being worn by a priest of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;. The Dreughs had modified the armor to allow for mythical inflexibility, allowing it to grow massive in scale. Vivec took on his giant form and once more slew the Ruddy Man, this time gifting its shell to the loyal mystics of the Number Room.\nCity-Face.\nCity-Face was the sixth monster to escape Vivec's Muatra and was originally named Ha-Note. Vivec was vexed and frustrated by his inability to track the location of this monster, which was described as a bare urge or power and esoteric wind-nerve that was tuned to the frequency of huddled masses. Ha-Note became perplexed by the people's resonating culture, and so slid into the Adjacent Place where he began to absorb new immortal emotions and was captured by the Grabbers. The Grabbers, who had never built a city of their own, coveted Vivec's City, and so built their tower-hope upon Ha-Note's face. The monster, City-Face, bore physical likeness to both Vivec and the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;image of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; being constructed by the Dwemer. City-Face, who's citizenry died from his obscure emotions, sought out his mother-father himself, hoping to either have Vivec correct his culture or take Vivec's by force. Vivec, who felt a growing sense of urgency with the Dwemer, and weary of killing his children, corrected City-Face's culture before slaying him with the Ethos Knife.\nLie Rock.\n&lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Lie Rock&lt;/a&gt; was the seventh monster to escape Muatra, and was born through Vivec's Second Aperture. Lie Rock was a massive moonlet that flew to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent\"&gt;Hidden Heaven&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to learn unmatched divinity from the being known as the \"Void Ghost,\" the lost spirit of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec eventually spotted the Rock, thinking him foolish, as the Void Ghost's deals were meant only for &lt;a href=\"Ruling%20King\"&gt;Ruling King&lt;/a&gt;s. Vivec then sent &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; to kill Lie Rock, but he was distracted by the Void Ghost giving Lie Rock the opportunity to launch an attack on Vivec City. As it looked like Lie Rock was about to destroy the city, Vivec merely rose his hand freezing Lie Rock in the air and then proceeded to pierce him with Muatra. Vivec decided to keep the Rock above his city so that if his peoples love ever failed him, the rock would fall and destroy them all, henceforth becoming the Ministry of Truth.\nGULGA MOR JIL.\nGULGA MOR JIL was the eighth and strongest of the monsters to escape Muatra but acted much less belligerent than the others. When Vivec went to kill him, GULGA MOR JIL only sadly asked why he must die. Vivec told him that it was his nature to return to oblivion, but this did not satisfy GULGA MOR JIL, so Vivec recited an old prayer for those doomed to die.\nWith these words, GULGA MOR JIL accepted his death and Vivec pierced him with Muatra. His bones became the foundation to the city of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Trial of Vivec.\nAt the end of Vivec's Trial, which occurred shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, he revealed that his true reasoning behind his agreement to be put on trial was so that he could get revenge on &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; for all her actions since her cursing of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. After fully binding her to &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec thrust Muatra down her throat and banished her from the world."}

He is the primary antagonist of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Star%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Black Star&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHistory.\nYears ago, Malyn was exiled from the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; for pursuing controversial research with &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt;, killing a student, and many other unacceptable experiments. He sought to find a way to become immortal, and he believed that storing his soul in &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; would prevent him from dying. The problem with this is that one of the properties of the star is that no humanoid soul could enter.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Nelacar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nelacar&lt;/a&gt;, the further Malyn progressed towards his goal, the more &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; cursed him. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt; drove Malyn insane, causing him to hallucinate: he \"heard voices\" that were not there, saw people that were not there, and eventually, even murdered one of his students. For this, he was expelled, whereupon he gathered a band of followers, and continued his research at &lt;a href=\"Ilinalta%27s%20Deep\"&gt;Ilinalta's Deep&lt;/a&gt;, an abandoned &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; outpost that collapsed into the lake due to earlier experiments by Malyn and his accomplices.\nThere, he sought to capture his own soul in the Star to achieve a state of immortality. He achieved this goal to some extent, however he must continually be \"fed\" souls from the outside world to continue his state of existence. This was the purpose of the necromancers stationed in the sunken outpost, and the appearance of so many skeletons within suggest they had been doing it for quite some time.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Star%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Black Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn finds Azura's Star beside Malyn's skeleton at Ilinalta's Deep, and with the help of Azura, purifies it by entering it and purging Malyn's soul.\nAlternatively, the Dragonborn may have brought the Star to Nelacar and had him perform the purification, which causes the Star to &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Star%20%28Item%29\"&gt;turn black&lt;/a&gt; and trap black souls within it, similar to a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven when the star is cleansed however, an unknown adversary sends two apprentice &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down the Dragonborn and reclaim Azura's Star.\nCombat.\nThe staff and dagger that Malyn wield are leveled and random. Occasionally throughout the fight, he switches to casting &lt;a href=\"Oakflesh\"&gt;Oakflesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nFighting alongside him are three &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;. While the Dremoras' fire spells do a lot of damage, and make them hard to see, they are not difficult to drain and kill if they are approached enough. As long as the Dragonborn has good fire shielding and/or a lot of health potions, the battle can be fought long enough to kill them. Using a full strength &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; while he is attempting to run away after the initial conversation allows him to be easily defeated.\nFor a magic-based character, a Dovahkiin sufficiently skilled in Conjuration can summon a pair of Storm Atronachs or Thralls, whose attacks can easily drain the Dremora's magicka, rendering them vulnerable to melee attacks.\nAs for thief-type characters, with a high enough &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill, even without the Shadow Warrior Perk, it is possible to stay crouching behind a crystal pillar, out of view of Malyn and the Dremora, and become hidden again, and backstab all four of them, by sneaking up on each of them individually. This is best done with the Mehrune's Razor, a set of Ancient Shrouded Armor, and, if the player is an Orsimer, the Berserker power active. The Dragonborn must also have unlocked Assassin's Blade to achieve the maximum damage.\u00a0\nThree &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra Hearts&lt;/a&gt; can be collected once the Dremora have been slain, but only if their corpses were not knocked off the edges of the crystalline floor during battle. They also carry leveled (possibly difficulty dependent if not random) one and two-handed weaponry. A way to even the odds is to dual-wield the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Sparks&lt;/a&gt;, draining their health and magical capabilities simultaenously.\nMalyn can be &lt;a href=\"resurrected\"&gt;resurrected&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Thrall\"&gt;Dead Thrall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;. He will not initially follow the Dragonborn out of the Azura Star, but he later reappears after &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast-traveling&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"Ah, my disciples have sent me a fresh soul.

Sometimes, they are successful in bringing temporary peace to the province; however, this does not last very long. Historically, the Mane has been known to reside in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;, where he is protected by his Warrior Guard.\nBirthright.\nKhajiit tradition holds that only one Mane can be alive at any one time and that there is only one Mane, who is simply reborn in different bodies. Twins &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;Khali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shazah\"&gt;Shazah&lt;/a&gt; were born as twins during the alignment of the moons, making them both Lunar Champions. They had to compete with each other to become the new Mane.\nA Mane can be born only under a rare alignment of the moons &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; when, according to legend, a third moon appears in the sky. In ancient times, the Khajiit would shave off their own manes in deference to the Mane, braiding them into locks that he would incorporate into his own, gigantic mane. Over time, as the population of the region grew, this ritual became impractical.\nNow, while all Khajiit still remove their manes, they do so largely as a symbolic sacrifice. The current Mane still wears the hair-locks and braids of his own tribe as well as those of his Warrior Guard, which encompasses hundreds of Khajiit. He is so weighted down by the hair of his kinsmen that he cannot move without aid, and often travels about the countryside by means of a palanquin."}

Ours is a civil fraternity, to which we are bound - every one - by our dual hunger for flesh and influence. By the virtue of Imperial structure and bureaucracy, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; has become our stronghold in the third era, and we suffer no savage rivals within our boundaries, reveal ourselves to none, and manipulate the hand of society to mete out our agendas.\nOn Our Dual Patrons:.\nTo Kin-father &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, who brought forth the Bloodmatron &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Beolfag\"&gt;Lamae&lt;/a&gt; to spite &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, we owe our existence, as do all vampires, though not all honor Him. For him we revel in the feast, and acknowledge the gift adrift in our veins.\nTo patron &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, beacon o\u2019er our affairs, we owe our successes and social stature. Our bond with Vile makes us unique among our kind, for his guidance steels our savage craving with reason and savvy. For him we live amidst mankind, and twist them to our will from offices of power.\nOn Our Rivals:.\nMost barbaric tribes think themselves powerful by the gift of Bal\u2019s blood alone, and squander the gift. There are those, however, who show signs of enlightenments, and earn our attention - those such as the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witches\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;, who live within the walls of &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; cities, or the Whet-Fang sodality of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, who use magicka to keep captives catatonic and harvest from them the red nectar. These foes may one day threaten to impugn our sovereignty within the boundaries of Cyrodiil, thus compelling our vigilance. Should any encroach upon our dominion, our wrath must be swift and total.\nOn Our Conduct:.\nTo preserve our ideals and way of life, two primary edicts shall be observed. Above all, reveal thyself and &lt;a href=\"Manifesto%20Cyrodiil%20Vampyrum\"&gt;our Order&lt;/a&gt; to no other, for discretion is the greatest of our virtues. Do not feed where you may be found out, or on those who may suspect your passing. Avoid daylight by lifestyle; dispel common belief in our kind, and maintain supple appearance through satisfaction of the thirst. Second, devote your pursuits to the procurement of influence, political and otherwise. Our strength is not in physical numbers, but in skillful manipulation of society. Always be mindful of our Patrons, and preserve the Order. Devote yourself to these ideals always, and the Order shall count you amongst our own."}

Camoran appears to be a \"typical\" mage; in reality, however, he and his children appear to be immortal. It is unknown for sure how old Camoran is, but it is said that he was born in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after his father, Camoran the Usurper, died.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\nMankar Camoran was born to &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; (better known as the \"Camoran Usurper\") and his &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; mistress. Mankar was born and raised in a shelter for war refugees in the region of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;. He and his mother lived there while his father waged a bloody war on across southern &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nMankar was supposedly born towards the end of the conflict, as he was described as a baby at the end of the year 3E 276, which was the exact date of the Usurper's death. Shortly after his birth, his mother (who the other refugees noted performed the birth entirely herself) left the shelter and never returned for her son. This is contradicted by &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt;, however, who claims that the Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes, which were written by Mankar, are contemporary with Tiber Septim.\nFounding the Dawn.\nLater, Camoran founded a Daedric cult called the Order of the Mythic Dawn. Mankar developed a close relationship with the Prince of Destruction Mehrunes Dagon. Dagon granted Camoran his own plane of Oblivion which he shaped to resemble \"Dawn's Beauty\", a vision of how he believed the world would look once he helped Dagon take control.\nDaedric invasion of Tamriel.\nIn 3E 433, Mankar plotted to destroy the Septim bloodline and prevent the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; from being lit, so that the barriers between Nirn and Oblivion could dissolve, allowing Dagon to enter the realm. The Mythic Dawn started by assassinating Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;'s heirs, the Princes &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enman%20Septim\"&gt;Enman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebel%20Septim\"&gt;Ebel Septim&lt;/a&gt;. This prompted Uriel to attempt to go into hiding, taking a secret escape route through the Imperial Prison out of the city.\nHowever, Camoran had apparently foreseen this\u00a0and had one of his lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Eldamil\"&gt;Eldamil&lt;/a&gt;, arrange Uriel's own assassination inside the escape route. Though the Mythic Dawn agents succeeded in murdering the Emperor, a prisoner in the Imperial Prison (who is the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;) was sent away with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere was one remaining heir to the Imperial throne, an illegitimate son named &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Camoran apparently knew this\u00a0and had Martin's home city, &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, invaded and completely destroyed to kill Martin. Though the city was destroyed, Martin was safely brought to &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt; by the Hero. However, in the meantime, Camoran had Mythic Dawn agents attack Weynon Priory and steal the Amulet of Kings.\nWith the Amulet of Kings, Camoran entered Gaiar Alata to wait for the barriers between Nirn and Oblivion to dissolve completely, while the Hero and Martin collected several artifacts needed to follow him there.\nAfter being victorious in a great battle near Bruma, the Hero was sent to Gaiar Alata to kill Camoran and retrieve the Amulet of Kings. After fighting Camoran in his palace, Carac Agaialor, the Hero defeated him, which caused Gaiar Alata to dissolve.\nGaiar Alata.\nMankar Camoran's &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;, also known as \"Gaiar Alata,\" is a small island realm in Oblivion created by Camoran by using the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;. When a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; dies in his service, they ascend to the Paradise. While it appears heavenly, it is in fact quite hellish.\nIn the Paradise, Mankar's followers are constantly attacked by &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;. If killed, they are not freed from their hell. Instead, they will be resurrected only to have to endure the process all over again. The only way to escape the Paradise is through a portal called the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Grotto\"&gt;Forbidden Grotto&lt;/a&gt;. To gain access to the grotto, one must gain the &lt;a href=\"Bands%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Bands of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. These are only given to people who are highly trusted by Camoran.\nOnce someone passes into the grotto, they are never heard from again. It is later found out that the Forbidden Grotto is not a place of salvation, but a torture chamber, from which the only method of escape is removal of the Bands. Such a feat is impossible by conventional methods.\nCommentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes.\nMankar Camoran's &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries\"&gt;Commentaries&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt; is a four-volume set of books written by Camoran. The\" Commentaries\" are sought after by those who wish to join the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. To join it, a potential initiate must find a secret meaning hidden within the books. The player character uses the books to recover the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from Camoran.\nThe books are:\nDialogue.\nParadise.\n\"I have waited a long time for you, Champion of Old Tamriel. You are the last gasp of a dying age. You breathe the stale air of false hope. How little you understand! You cannot stop Lord Dagon. The walls between our worlds are crumbling. The Mythic Dawn grows nearer with every rift in the firmament. Soon, very soon, the lines now blurred will be erased. Tamriel and Oblivion rejoined! The Mythic Age reborn! Lord Dagon shall walk Tamriel again. The world shall be remade. The new age shall rise from the ashes of the old. My vision shall be realized. Weakness will be purged from the world, and mortal and immortal alike purified in the refiner's fire. My long duel with the Septims is over, and I have the mastery. The Emperor is dead. The Amulet of Kings is mine. And the last defender of the last ragged Septim stands before me, in the heart of my power. Let us see who at last has proved the stronger!\"\nIf spoken to directly:\n\"You came for the Amulet. Take it then!\"\nParadise.\nWhile in Paradise, Mankar Camoran has various things to say about his realm.\nWhen first entering, he will announce:\n\"So, the cat's-paw of the Septims arrives at last. You didn't think you could take me unawares, here of all places? In the Paradise that I created? Look now upon my Paradise. Gaiar Alata, in the old tongue. A vision of the past... and the future.\"\nAt the Savage Garden, he will say:\n\"Behold the Savage Garden, where my disciples are tempered for a higher destiny: to rule over Tamriel Reborn. If you are truly the hero of destiny, as I hope, the Garden will not hold you for long. Lift your eyes to Carac Agaialor, my seat at the pinnacle of Paradise. I shall await you there.\"\nAfter obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Bands%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Bands of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"\"How little you understand! You cannot stop Lord Dagon! The Principalities have sparkled as gems in the black reaches of Oblivion since the First Morning. Many are their names and the names of their masters: the Coldharbour of Meridia, Peryrite's Quagmire, the ten Moonshadows of Mephala, and... ... and Dawn's Beauty, the Princedom of Lorkhan... misnamed 'Tamriel' by deluded mortals. Yes, you understand now. Tamriel is just one more Daedric realm of Oblivion, long since lost to its Prince when he was betrayed by those that served him. Lord Dagon cannot invade Tamriel, his birthright! He comes to liberate the Occupied Lands! Ask yourself! How is it that mighty gods die, yet the Deadra stand incorruptible? How is it that the Daedra forthrightly proclaim themselves to man, while the gods cower behind statues and the faithless words of traitor-priests? It is simple... they are not gods at all. The truth has been in front of you since first you were born: the Daedra are the true gods of this universe. Julianos and Dibella and Stendarr are all Lorkhan's betrayers, posing as divinities in a principality that has lost its guiding light. What are Scholarship, Love, and Mercy when compared to Fate, Night, and Destruction? The gods you worship are trifling shadows of First Causes. They have tricked you for Ages. Why do you think your world has always been contested ground, the arena of powers and immortals? It is Tamriel, the realm of Change, brother to Madness, sister to Deceit. Your false gods could not entirely rewrite history. Thus you remember tales of Lorkhan, vilified, a dead trickster, whose heart came to Tamriel. But if a god can die, how does his heart survive? He is daedroth! TAMRIEL AE DAEDROTH! \"This heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.\" You all remember this. It is in every legend. Daedra cannot die, so your so-called gods cannot erase him from your minds completely.\"\"\nAfter advancing through the Forbidden Grotto:\n\"Well done, champion! Your progress is swift and sure. Perhaps you will reach me after all. You think I mock you? Not at all. In your coming, I hear the footsteps of Fate. You are the last defender of decadent Tamriel. I am the midwife of the Mythic Dawn, Tamriel Reborn. I welcome you, if you truly are the agent of Fate. I tire of the self-styled heroes who set themselves in my path, only to prove unworthy in the event.\"\nConversations.\nDagon Shrine.\nMythic Dawn Acolytes: \"Praise be!\"\nHarrow: \"Praise be!\"\nMankar Camoran: \"The Dragon Throne is empty, and we hold the Amulet of Kings!

He began his magical studies as a student of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, and went on to manipulate the political powers of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; throughout later parts of his life. He went as far as to control the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire%23The%20Sixth%20Century%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodiilic Empire&lt;/a&gt; as his puppet state during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, and put forward the events that led to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Tamriel called the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. Mannimarco went on to become a Lich, later ascending to godhood as the \"&lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Moon\"&gt;Necromancer's Moon&lt;/a&gt;\" in his undeath, and left a legacy that would last for ages to come.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nIt is said that Mannimarco was born to royal blood, but to which line is uncertain. He was said to be present during the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted between &lt;a href=\"1E%201200\"&gt;1E 1200&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1E%202208\"&gt;1E 2208&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;s taught him \"his mystery.\" At some point, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, an island of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and gained a reputation for being one of the greatest students who ever joined the order. His skill in magic was rivaled only by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding the Worm Cult.\nAt some point, Mannimarco began to study &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, and was fascinated by the secrets of necromancers. Eventually, he was seduced into trapping and enslaving souls. After one of his spells caught the notice of Vanus, the latter confronted Mannimarco under the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;, where he told his fellow student to cease his dark ways:\nBut Mannimarco hated the ways of life and peace and continued his research. When the leaders of the order found out about Mannimarco's experiments, they exiled him to the mainland. Once there, he began to spread his influence throughout the continent, as dark wizards and witches made their way to him. They gave him magical artifacts from which he absorbed their dark energy, turning him into a living corpse but expanding his life because of it. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; began and soon grew a large following.\nThe Planemeld.\nMannimarco eventually came under the service of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; Molag Bal, who tasked him with tricking the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; into performing a ritual that would weaken the barriers between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, thus allowing Molag Bal's forces to invade Tamriel. Using the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;, Molag Bal hoped to merge Nirn with his own plane of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, Mannimarco had no loyalty to the prince and planned to trap him, where over time he would absorb his essence, transforming him into the new lord of domination. To do this, Mannimarco required the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and the help of &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, the chancellor of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; who would later betray Mannimarco.\nDuring this time, Mannimarco sacrificed an individual who would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to Molag Bal, stealing their soul along with many others. Eventually, the Vestige would escape Coldharbour and continually ruin Mannimarco's plan of obtaining the Amulet of Kings. The Vestige would later fight and kill Mannimarco, but his spirit remained, telling the Vestige that death would not slow him down. Just then, Molag Bal appeared, revealing that he had known of Mannimarco's intentions all along and dragged his spirit down to Coldharbour, where he would be tortured by the undead. Later, when the Vestige, along with the Five Companions, arrived in Coldharbour to finally end the invasion, they found Mannimarco shackled to a table. The Vestige had a choice; leave Mannimarco to his fate, or free him. Either way, he eventually escapes Coldharbour and returns to Tamriel.\nThe Great Battle.\nVanus Galerion never forgot about Mannimarco, and when the latter resurfaced, Vanus, along with an army of mages and &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Lamp\"&gt;Lamp Knights&lt;/a&gt;, prepared to attack Mannimarco's army of necromancers. When Galerion and Mannimarco at last met again, Galerion gave his former classmate the chance to surrender, saying, \"Worm King, surrender your artifacts and their power to me, and you shall live as befits the dead,\" to which Mannimarco allegedly replied, with a hollow laugh, \"You die first.\"\nAn epic battle ensued, with \"waves of fire and frost\" and \"lightning arching forth.\" During the battle, Mannimarco turned himself into one of the first-ever &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es, preceded only by liches from the time of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;. Galerion's army won the battle, but he was killed in the process, while Mannimarco went into hiding.\nThe King of Worms would continue to manipulate the political infrastructure of the province, granting the necromancer &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt; domain over &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20N%27Gasta\"&gt;an island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt;'s reign.\nWarp in the West and Godhood.\nAround &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco had come to possess a vast knowledge of things that most others did not. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; often sought out Mannimarco to complete tasks or quests for him.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; (the most recent &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;) occurred, where the region of &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; was split into several separate but simultaneous timelines. Mannimarco, by this time an immensely powerful lich, gained control of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, turning himself into a plane(t) called the \"Necromancer's Moon\" or the \"Revenant\" in one of the timelines.\nOblivion Crisis.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco's divine celestial form, the Revenant, became the patron god of necromancers, shading &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; and helping with black soul gem creation. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful Altmer necromancer calling himself Mannimarco surfaced to overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and re-establish the Worm Cult.\nMannimarco and his Worm Cult gained a large following, partially due to the Guild Arch-Mage &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;'s ban against necromancy. He led attacks on the Mages Guild and all of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and is said to have resurrected his arch-rival Vanus Galerion's corpse as a thrall. Eventually, Mannimarco's plans were foiled by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, who would go on to kill him."}

had magic bold and bright as day.He confronted Mannimarco beneath gray &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;,Saying, 'Your wicked &lt;a href=\"mysticism\"&gt;mysticism&lt;/a&gt; is no way to wield your power,Bringing horror to the spirit world, your studies must cease.'Mannimarco scoffed, hating well the ways of life and peace,And returned to his dark artistry; his paints, death and decay.\nO sacred isle Artaeum, how slow to perceive the threat,When the ghastly truth revealed, how weak the punishment.The ghoulish Mannimarco from the isle of the wise was sentTo the mainland &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Dawn's Beauty&lt;/a&gt;, more death and souls to reap.'You have found a wolf, and sent the beast to flocks of sheep,'Galerion told his Masters, 'A terror on Tamriel has set.\nSpeak no more of him,' the sage Cloaks of Gray did say.'Twas not the first time Galerion thought his Masters callous,Unconcerned for men and mer, aloof in their island palace.'Twas not the first time Galerion thought 'twas time to buildA new Order to bring true magic to all, a mighty &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.But 'twas the time he left, at last, fair Artaeum's azure bay.\nO, but sung we have of Vanus Galerion many times before,How cast he off the Psijics' chains, bringing magic to the land.Throughout the years, he saw the touch of Mannimarco's hand,Through Tamriel's deserts, forests, towns, mountains, and seas.The dark grip stretching out, growing like some dread diseaseBy his dark &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, collecting cursed artifacts of yore.\nThey brought to him these tools, mad wizards and witches,And brought blood-tainted herbs and oils to his cave of sin,Sweet &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;

He is the primary antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; questline in . He was originally a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; and a fellow student of &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. At some point Mannimarco abandoned the Psijic Order to further practice the dark arts of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Between this point in time and Mannimarco's last battle with Galerion, he transformed himself into the first &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt; ever, gaining immortality. After this battle, he went into hiding, most likely staying at &lt;a href=\"Scourg%20Barrow\"&gt;Scourg Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, a large, well-fortified center of operations in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, he has cleverly played all the political games and powers for millennia. His influences have even reached back to the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the homeland of the Altmer. The &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, whose domain is the Thrassian &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Kingdom\"&gt;Coral Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, worship him as a \"King of Worms.\"\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nMannimarco was born around 2E 210, most likely in the Summerset Isles. He was of royal blood, but from which line he descends is unknown. When he became a member of the Psijic Order, he quickly gained a reputation as being one of the most brilliant students that ever trained to become a member of the Order. The only one who could match this success was a mage named &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt one point, Mannimarco began to make a study of the school of necromancy. Time passed, and he became fascinated by the secrets of necromancers, and was seduced into the practice of entrapping and enslaving souls. When Mannimarco experimented with a dark spell, he drew the attention of &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. Vanus confronted his fellow student beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ceporah%20Tower\"&gt;Ceporah Tower&lt;/a&gt;, saying \"Your wicked mysticism is no way to wield your power. Your studies must cease, because you only bring horror to the spirit world.\" Corrupted by his experiences, Mannimarco laughed; he had come to hate the ways of life and peace. He returned to his studies, and continued his experiments on death and decay.\n&lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Mannimarco established a base of operations, he stretched his dark grip throughout Tamriel's deserts, forests, towns, mountains, and seas. While Mannimarco dabbled deeper and deeper into secrets long forgotten, the rot of necromancy sunk to his very core. He gathered many followers and servants. Corrupted wizards and witches from all over Tamriel came to him with cursed artifacts and gifts. The Order of the Black Worm was born.\nMages who joined him brought him tomes, &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, blood-tainted herbs and oils, &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; poison, &lt;a href=\"Bonemeal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bonemeal&lt;/a&gt; of dead saints, and human skin, toadstools, roots and other alchemical ingredients. Mannimarco absorbed the dark energy out of these objects, and as a result, life-energy was sucked out of him. His body became that of a corpse with blood poison and acid. His power and the duration of his life grew along with his arsenal.\nThe Great Battle.\nVanus Galerion had never forgotten his nemesis, Mannimarco. He had always searched for clues of the necromancer's presence, but did not find him. When Mannimarco resurfaced, Galerion amassed an army of his most loyal mages and Lampknights and traveled north to a cursed mountain path to settle his business with Mannimarco. \"Before my last breath, I must face the tyranny of worms, and kill the undeath at last,\" he vowed.\nMannimarco left his lair with an army of necromancers and undead, and met Galerion's force on the mountain path, both sides ready to do battle. Galerion cried for Mannimarco, \"Worm King, surrender your artifacts and their power to me, and you shall live as befits the dead.\" Mannimarco answered with a hollow laugh, \"You die first.\" It was since then, that Mannimarco carried the name King of Worms.\nThe two armies then clashed, lightning and frost cascading around them. The necromancers summoned various undead creatures to their sides which were slain by streams of light forged by the battlemages. Before the end of the battle Galerion discovered that Mannimarco was no longer alive, but had turned himself into the first lich ever and thus gained immortality. Galerion's army won the battle and managed to crush the remaining necromancers. Mannimarco disappeared from the scene and was not seen again until ages beyond.\nUnfortunately, Galerion died in the great battle along with a thousand other battlemages and necromancers, though his legacy lived on in Tamriel's history and literature.\n&lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco went into hiding at &lt;a href=\"Scourg%20Barrow\"&gt;Scourg Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this was his lair from before the battle is not known, but wizards and witches still found their way to him to learn the school of necromancy. One of these apprentices was the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; battlemage &lt;a href=\"Arielle%20Jurard\"&gt;Arielle Jurard&lt;/a&gt;, who would later turn &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kain\"&gt;Lord Kain&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lainlyn\"&gt;Lainlyn&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Hero%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Hero&lt;/a&gt; after attempting to restore him back to life.\nMannimarco used the Order to influence political events through the ages in order to gain more power. He resurfaced between &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt; in the regions of &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. He became in league with &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Morgiah\"&gt;Princess Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, because she needed his influence on the dead to gain influence over her future husband, the king of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. In return she promised him her first born son.\nHero of Daggerfall.\nAt some point, Mannimarco met the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, who was sent to Scourge Barrow by Princess Morgiah. Due to his age and dark magic, Mannimarco had knowledge of things that very few mortals know of. He knew for example, that Prince &lt;a href=\"Karolis\"&gt;Karolis&lt;/a&gt;, the great grandfather of the late &lt;a href=\"King%20Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, roamed the deeps of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Sentinel\"&gt;Castle Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; as a lich. This was one of numerous secrets of the royal dynasty of Sentinel. The Hero was ordered to trap the soul of Karolis in order to get some useful information about the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;, an old enemy of Mannimarco, for his investigation. After this mission, the Hero frequently sought out Mannimarco and fulfilled quests for him.\nWarp in the West.\nWhen the Hero later obtained the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, he was warned by the artifact that only someone of royal blood could wield it. Almost all major political factions in the Iliac Bay sent letters to the Hero including Mannimarco, promising him vast fortunes if he would give them the Totem. This resulted in the mysterious event called the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warp%20in%20the%20West%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Warp of the West&lt;/a&gt;, when Queen &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel, King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, Lord &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Gortwog&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, the Underking and Mannimarco each used the Totem to achieve their own goals. Mannimarco used the divine power of the artifact to achieve godhood and disappeared once again. The Order of the Black Worm now worshipped their master as the deity called the Revenant Moon or God of Worms.\nMages Guild First Schism.\nIn 3E 431 &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt; became Arch-Mage of the Mages Guild, by a narrow margin, mainly because of his strict stance against necromancy. He implemented new restrictions against necromancy which were strongly supported by some members, but also strongly opposed by others. Half of the council resigned in protest after which only Traven, &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irlav%20Jarol\"&gt;Irlav Jarol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caranya\"&gt;Caranya&lt;/a&gt; remained. Traven also implemented new regulations governing guild membership, which made it more difficult to join the guild. The Mages Guild was weakened by these events and Mannimarco saw time fit to settle the score with his old enemies.\nA person called Mannimarco, apparently a mortal part of him that was separated from the God of Worms part during the Warp in the West, resurfaced in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and moved his base of operations to &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Cave%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Echo Cave&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Working in the shadows, he began placing his servants all over Cyrodiil and also secretly recruited new servants, who fulfilled important positions in Cyrodiliic society and could work as spies and informants. The most important of these secret agents were &lt;a href=\"Mercator%20Hosidus\"&gt;Mercator Hosidus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt; and Caranya.\nFalcar in particular received a very important task. He was ordered to research the creation of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt;, in order to capture and wield the power of the souls of all those who would oppose the King of Worms. Falcar succeeded in this task.\nHero of Kvatch.\nWhether it was coincidence or fate, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; became a member of the Mages Guild at the same time of Mannimarco's return. While the Hero completed tasks to earn free passage to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered Falcar, head of the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, to be a necromancer. This proved to be unimportant because now Falcar was free from the eyes of the Mages Guild and could continue his research on Black Soul Gems. Mannimarco sent him to &lt;a href=\"Silorn\"&gt;Silorn&lt;/a&gt; to search for further possibilities.\nMannimarco ordered his servant &lt;a href=\"Noveni%20Othran\"&gt;Noveni Othran&lt;/a&gt; and five others to invade &lt;a href=\"Wellspring%20Cave\"&gt;Wellspring Cave&lt;/a&gt;. They murdered &lt;a href=\"Zahrasha\"&gt;Zahrasha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eletta\"&gt;Eletta&lt;/a&gt;, two apprentices, when the Hero arrived. The Hero killed all six necromancers and reported back to &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt;. The Mages Guild became aware of the offense that necromancers had launched but did not know who was behind it.\nAfter the massacre at Wellspring Grove, the Mages Guild sent the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; to spy on Count &lt;a href=\"Janus%20Hassildor\"&gt;Janus Hassildor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, to see what connections he had with the necromancers. However, Mercator Hosidus, a liaison of the court of Skingrad, fooled the Hero into a false appointment at the hills of Skingrad and tried to kill him with his allies &lt;a href=\"Arterion\"&gt;Arterion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mondrar%20Henim\"&gt;Mondrar Henim&lt;/a&gt;, probably an order given by Mannimarco himself. The Hero escaped the trap and met Hassildor, who told the Hero to explain to Raminus that he had no connections with the necromancers and that they should not send anyone else under false pretenses.\nLater on, Count Hassildor discovered Mannimarco's part in the necromancer threat. He sent a message to the Mages Guild and asked for the Hero, whom he had come to trust. Although before giving the vital information to the hero, Janus asked him to deal with some vampire hunters who had come to Skingrad. After completing the task, Hassildor informed the Hero of Mannimarco's return.\nAttack on Bruma.\nThe Hero's actions caused quite a few setbacks in Mannimarco's plans and it forced the King of Worms to advance the start of the actual attack. Enraged by the incompetence of his servants, Mannimarco himself led the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; Mages Guild chapter, the town nearest to &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Cave%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Echo Cave&lt;/a&gt;. After a period of basically doing nothing, he took great delight in slaughtering everyone and draining their souls into Black Soul Gems. When the attack was over, Mannimarco ordered his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Camilla%20Lollia\"&gt;Camilla Lollia&lt;/a&gt; to stay behind because he sensed the Hero would come. He told her to return to Echo Cave after dealing with the Hero, and that they then would proceed to destroy the entire Mages Guild. During this conversation Mannimarco became aware of the fact that the survivor &lt;a href=\"J%27skar\"&gt;J'skar&lt;/a&gt; eavesdropped the conversation while being invisible. He looked directly at J'skar and smiled. The King of Worms left J'skar alive in order to tell the Council of Mages about what had transpired and the location of Echo Cave. This was a scheme to eventually lure Arch-Mage Traven to his doom.\nAfter a period of not receiving messages from Bruma, Traven sent the Hero there. The Hero dealt with Mannimarco's lingering &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt; and eventually killed Camilla. It was then that &lt;a href=\"J%27skar\"&gt;J'skar&lt;/a&gt; revealed himself to the Hero, recognizing him from their time in the Guild. After being informed by his fellow mage, the Hero returned to the Arcane University.\nMages Guild Second Schism.\nAfter hearing word of the attack on Bruma, the Mages Guild was in chaos. The Council of Mages debated about what had to be done to stop Mannimarco but could not find a solution. The King of Worms instructed his servant Caranya to carefully manipulate the Council into heavy disputes, in order to weaken them further. Caranya succeeded and her schemes resulted in &lt;a href=\"Irlav%20Jarol\"&gt;Irlav Jarol&lt;/a&gt; and Caranya leaving the Guild, each taking with them many followers.\nMannimarco's plan to cripple the Guild worked but he also had a second goal. Caranya was ordered to steal the &lt;a href=\"Bloodworm%20Helm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bloodworm Helm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Amulet%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, but she only came in possession of the latter because Irlav Jarol took the Helm with him to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Teleman\"&gt;Fort Teleman&lt;/a&gt;. While Caranya traveled to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ontus\"&gt;Fort Ontus&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco sent various necromancers and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to Fort Teleman in order to kill Irlav and obtain the Helm.\nHowever Traven sent the Hero to both &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Teleman\"&gt;Fort Teleman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ontus\"&gt;Fort Ontus&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero retrieved the Bloodworm Helm before the necromancers could but failed to save Irlav in time. At Fort Ontus he asked Caranya to return to the Guild but she revealed herself to be Mannimarco's servant and attacked the Hero. She was killed and as a result the Amulet too was lost to Mannimarco.\nColossal Black Soul Gem.\nEven when his plans failed, Mannimarco did not view the battle with the Mage's Guild a lost cause. Word came from Silorn that Falcar had succeeded in creating a &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Black%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Colossal Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;. Mannimarco's intention was to use this artifact to capture the soul of Hannibal Traven.\nTraven also received word of Falcar's creation and sent the Hero and contingent of battlemages to storm Silorn. Falcar was killed and the Hero obtained the unique gem. Back in the Imperial City Traven explains that he knew that Mannimarco intended the gem for Traven's own soul. He orders the Hero to capture his soul in the gem, because by carrying the filled soul gem the Hero would be immune to Mannimarco's attempts to turn the Hero into a Worm Thrall. Traven then gives his life and captures his soul into the Colossal Black Soul Gem on his own - an act Mannimarco had not foreseen.\nDeath of Mannimarco, King of Worms.\nMannimarco did not know Traven was dead and expected the deceased Arch-Mage to confront him in Echo Cave. But it was the Hero of Kvatch who came to his lair. The Hero killed &lt;a href=\"Bolor%20Savel\"&gt;Bolor Savel&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco's last lieutenant and doorkeeper of Echo Cave and entered the domain of Mannimarco.\nThe Hero fought his way to the Necromancer's Chamber and confronted Mannimarco on a little island. Mannimarco summoned a finger-bone railing from the ground and, for all intents and purposes, trapped the Hero on the island. He then paralyzed the Hero. For some unknown reason Mannimarco was charmed by the Hero and started a monologue about his goals and his views on necromancy, something the King of Worms had not done since the days of Galerion. \"Power, my dear friend. I seek power, and so I acquire and study those who have some degree of it. We are after the same things, your guild and I. Yet you worry about 'good' and 'evil' and do not accept they are manifestations of the same thing. So you brand me a villain, and make vain attempts to destroy me. I watch, and I wait, and I collect you when you come for me. Instead of drawing Traven out, I have received you instead. Perhaps I shall personally go and collect him when we are done here.\"\nAfter the conversation Mannimarco tried to transform the Hero into a Worm Thrall. His magic was however rendered useless by the energy stored in the Colossal Black Soul Gem. Mannimarco did not know what was happening and attacked the Hero with dagger, spell and minion. This all proved to be futile because the Hero was protected by the Black Soul Gem. Eventually Mannimarco, King of Worms, was slain by the Hero.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Confront%20the%20King\"&gt;Confront the King&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I see Bolor was unsuccessful in delaying you. Very well; I shall reanimate him once we are done here. Perhaps we shall chat for a while, since you really have no other options? I must say, I expected Arch-Mage Traven, rather than his star pupil. I am disappointed to see that he could not face me himself. I have met so many of his predecessors over the years. I developed a particular fondness for Galerion, ill-preserved though he may be. But here you are instead. Skilled enough to make it this far, which speaks volumes about you. Perhaps you'll be as useful to me as Traven would.\"\nArtifacts.\nDespite Mannimarco's great age, only a few artifacts have been identified by scholars as belonging to him:"}

While Vanus was a good person, Mannimarco was described to have a dark demeanor, and this eventually led him down the path of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. He is also mentioned in the book \"&lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%2C%20King%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Mannimarco, King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;\" in .\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven%20in%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Soul Shriven in Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco will sacrifice you and your soul will be sent to &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, turning you into a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; of your former self.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; is rescued, he will have a battle with a projection of Mannimarco.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tharn%20Speaks\"&gt;The Tharn Speaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter using the speaking stones, a vision of Mannimarco will appear, talking about Sai Sahan:\nMannimarco: \"The Redguard's iron will cannot be overcome with standard interrogation techniques. Physical tortures appear to be useless. I have therefore instructed the Daedra to move Sai Sahan into the Halls of Torment. The Duchess will be most pleased to have a new ... guest. His flesh is strong, but perhaps her tortures of the mind will break him. I have come too far to allow this upstart swordmaster to thwart my plans. I will find the amulet, one way or another.\"\nAfterwards, Mannimarco can be seen projected at another stone, talking about the Amulet of Kings:\nMannimarco: \"Chim-el Adabal. The Amulet of the Kings of Glory. An artifact of the Divines, a badge of office for the ruling emperors of Cyrodiil, and the key to my ascendancy. Yet it eludes me. Exploiting its power to bring about the calamity of our age was intoxicating. It made me aware of the limitless possibilities available to one strong enough, and fearless enough, to use it to achieve his own ends. The Amulet has the power to create or destroy. But it also has the power to undo the damage caused by the Soulburst, to mend the tear in the barrier between Nirn and Oblivion. I must recover it before some fool fixes that which must remain broken.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt;.\nNear the starting area of the halls, Abnur Tharn can be heard torturing Sai and saying \"\"Where is the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;?\"\" It is later revealed to be a doppelg\u00e4nger of Abnur saying this.\n&lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Valley of Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nA projection of Mannimarco appears in the crypt after the ring is recovered, and will list several demands, following which he will then resurrect the skeletons of famed Redguard heroes, who will attack the Vestige and the Five Companions.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Shadow of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nProjections of Mannimarco will appear as you and the companions traverse through &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. After you kill him, his soul will rise and mock you, saying death cannot stop him. Molag Bal then appears through a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; and takes the King of Worms' spirit away into his realm.\n&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Five%20Companions\"&gt;Council of the Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Please! No more! It was a misunderstanding, great one! Let me serve you. Let me prove my loyalty. No more, I beg of you!\"\nVaren gives you the option of viewing Mannimarco being tortured by Molag Bal. In the vision, he is repeatedly whipped by skeletons.\n&lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Schemes\"&gt;God of Schemes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Grief\"&gt;Heart's Grief&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco will be bound to the floor. You are given the option of freeing him or letting him remain imprisoned.\n&lt;a href=\"Half-Formed%20Understandings\"&gt;Half-Formed Understandings&lt;/a&gt;.\nMannimarco appears in flashbacks in &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Traitor's Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Elder Scrolls Online.\nOne of the original &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco tricked them into using the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in a ritual that caused a &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, which would weaken boundaries between\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0enough to allow Molag Bal's followers to use the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to try to merge Nirn into\u00a0Coldharbour\u00a0in an event known as a Planemeld.\u00a0He worked with the Chancellor of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, after the latter pledged loyalty to him shortly after the soulburst occurred.\nIn reality, Mannimarco had no intention of remaining Molag Bal's servant; he intended to use the Amulet of Kings to trap the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; and absorb his essence over time, eventually taking his place as the Lord of Brutality and Domination. To this end, he required the Amulet of Kings.\u00a0\nAfter the Soulburst ritual, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; fled the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; with the Amulet and hid it in the catacombs of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. He was captured shortly after and imprisoned in the dungeons beneath the Imperial City. After Mannimarco concluded he needed a better place to break the descendant of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; he sent Sahan to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour, where the &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Duchess of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; tortured him mentally and physically for years. During this time, Mannimarco placed an enchantment upon Sahan in the event that he escaped. This proved wise, as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was\u00a0able to rescue him.\nMannimarco was eventually betrayed by Abnur Tharn, who was rescued from the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt; by the Vestige and &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;. The two mages fought a magic duel which Mannimarco lost when the Vestige struck him from behind, breaking his concentration and allowing them to escape.\nDuring Sahan's torture, Mannimarco learned that Sai would require the Ring of Stendarr's Mercy to retrieve the Amulet from its hiding place. The King of Worms dispatched a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt; to the ring's location, the Abbey of Blades in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige, Lyris Titanborn, Abnur Tharn and Sai Sahan arrived shortly after and were able to dispatch the beast, though not before it destroyed most of the abbey and killed most of the students. The leader of the abbey, &lt;a href=\"Kasura\"&gt;Kasura&lt;/a&gt;, had hid the ring in the nearby catacombs which housed the remains of Sai's ancestors. Mannimarco appeared in the catacombs and raised the dead within in an attempt to stop the Vestige, to no avail.\nMannimarco continued to monitor Sai's movements through his enchantment. Eventually the Five Companions went to Sancre Tor to retrieve the Amulet, and the King of Worms traveled there himself and revealed his plan for Molag Bal to them, explaining that the wards of Stendarr Sai had placed on the chamber containing the Amulet would hide him from Molag Bal's sight until he was ready to strike. Mannimarco then tried to slay them by resurrecting the dead within. The Vestige was able to confront Mannimarco and kill him, yet his spirit survived and promised death would not slow him for long.\nAt that moment, Molag Bal appeared in Sancre Tor and seized Mannimarco's spirit, revealing he had known of his impending betrayal and dragged him screaming into Coldharbour. There he was tortured relentlessly by &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Grief\"&gt;Heart's Grief&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of Molag Bal's power in Coldharbour.\nWhen the Five Companions arrived in Heart's Grief to perform the ritual with the Amulet of Kings, they found Mannimarco magically shackled to a stone table. The Vestige is then given the choice to free him or leave him to his grim fate.\u00a0\nIf he is freed, Mannimarco vanishes from Coldharbour, claiming future generations would curse the Vestige for their decision.\nDialogue.\n\"You! Come to gloat at my torment? Or is your appearance here a part of it?\"\nConversations.\nMannimarco: \"\"Now, now, Tharn. No telling my secrets. Go to your room, Abnur. I will deal with your shortly. Ah, dear Lyris. Your old position at the Foundry is still available. We'll even give you your own set of unbreakable chains. And you. The thorn in my side. The pebble in my shoe. How strong are you?

You know nothing! Chim-el Adabal, the red diamond at the center of the Amulet of Kings, is the most powerful Soul Gem ever created! With the amulet in my possession, I will absorb Molag Bal's power, reducing him to an empty husk of ethereal flesh. Then I will trap his essence within the gem! In time, the name Molag Bal will be forgotten! In time, all of Tamriel will bow down before me!

This place has all the charm of a Riften brothel. It must feel very much like home to you, Titanborn.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You mean a crypt filled with the rotting corpses of inbred kings and failed statesmen. Must be what it's like at a Tharn family reunion.\"\nSai Sahan: \"It is more pleasant in the summer months.\"\nVault Antechamber.\nMannimarco: \"Your pathetic efforts will not succeed!

It was used as a replacement for the Heart of Lorkhan to power the Numidium, which was utilized by Tiber Septim to conquer all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and destroy all those who did not entirely accept his reign. The Numidium was eventually demolished by the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; with its remains scattering and the Mantella being blasted into &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, to be lost for centuries. Without the Heart, Wulfharth falls into a state of semi-slumber,\u00a0and the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; began the painstaking task of recovering all of the Numidium's lost pieces, while the Underking's agents search for the Mantella.\nEvents of Daggerfall.\nAfter many generations, the Blades were able to recover and rebuild every piece of Numidium, lacking only its power source which could not be found. However, in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20401\"&gt;3E 401&lt;/a&gt;, the sorceress &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt; discovered the location of the Mantella within the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherial&lt;/a&gt; realm known as the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt;, while on one of her astral travels. Seeing the benefit this discovery could have, Nulfaga sent a letter to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, promising to disclose the Mantella's location to him as long as he agreed to never use the Numidium to hinder the power of her son, &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;, or his &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Uriel Septim, not fond of blackmail, refused her offer and instead schemed to find a way to gain the information from Nulfaga without accepting her deal. After reacquiring the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Agent of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; was sent a message from Nulfaga stating that she would give him the location of the Mantella. Once the Agent arrived at Shedungent, Nulfaga teleported him to the Mantellan Crux where the Mantella was freed from its prison. The Mantella was then used to power the Numidium, allow the Underking to die, and turn the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Worms\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt; into a god, in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore information.\nWhether or not the Mantella was the heart of Wulfarth or Zurin Arctus is debatable, but most sources seem to point to it being Zurin's heart.\u00a0Obscure mythology reasons that the Mantella is the \"Heart of Tiber Septim\" because Tiber Septim himself was born through the &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;merged dichotomy&lt;/a&gt; of the individuals Zurin Arctus and General Talos who joined as one to unite Cyrodiil and its people. In this sense, the Mantella forms as a representation of this union.\nSome believe the \"Mantella,\" rather than referring singular object, is actually a re-creatable process first attempted by &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; during the creation of &lt;a href=\"Anumidium\"&gt;Anumidium&lt;/a&gt;, being dubbed a \"Crux of Transcendence.\" It has been said that the Tools of Kagrenac were actually built for the purpose of creating a Mantella, the reenactment of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s sundering through the manipulation of mythical symbolism. By this belief, a Mantella, when created by &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; is more appropriately referred to as a \"\"Mer\"tella.\""}

From this marriage Mantiarco's first son was born. He was named &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Bathorgh\"&gt;Bathorgh&lt;/a&gt;. After growing up Prince Bathorgh became one of the mightiest warriors of Solitude.\nUnfortunately, Queen Amodetha died and left the King widowed.\nAs a sign of peace between Solitude and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, King Mantiarco and &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Uriel Septim II&lt;/a&gt; signed a Promise of Marriage. &lt;a href=\"Galana%20Septim\"&gt;Galana Septim&lt;/a&gt; was to marry the old king. During his ambassadors visit in &lt;a href=\"3E%2080\"&gt;3E 80&lt;/a&gt;, the Promise was stolen and hidden from the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Records\"&gt;Hall of Records&lt;/a&gt; by the young Potema Septim. By doing this she accidentally became the promised bride herself.\nOne year later in &lt;a href=\"3E%2081\"&gt;3E 81&lt;/a&gt;, then 14-year-old Potema married King Mantiarco. Despite the nature of the marriage and the vast age difference, Mantiarco truly loved Potema and allowed her to do whatever she wished. Surprisingly, 15 years later in &lt;a href=\"3E%2097\"&gt;3E 97&lt;/a&gt; Queen Potema gave birth to Mantiarco's second son. The old king wanted to name the boy in his own honor, Mantiarco the Second. Potema, however, had far greater plans for her son, thus he was named &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeritage.\nAfter investigating rumors on treason in &lt;a href=\"3E%2097\"&gt;3E 97&lt;/a&gt;, King Mantiarco found out that his firstborn was in fact son of Queen Amodetha and his trusted warchief &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thone\"&gt;Lord Thone&lt;/a&gt;. Prince Bathorgh was stripped of his rights to the throne and expelled from the kingdom, never to be heard of again.\nIt is unclear if this was indeed truth, as Queen Potema may have created false evidence placed by her trusted warchief and succesor of Lord Thone, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt;. This way Queen Potema also ensured that it was her son that would gain the throne after death of Mantiarco.\nKing Mantiarco died in &lt;a href=\"3E%2099\"&gt;3E 99&lt;/a&gt;, only short while after death of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt;.

This or his heart bursting because of &lt;a href=\"Greenmote\"&gt;Greenmote&lt;/a&gt;, a legend of &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;, has to be done to the duke or duchess by the Champion of Cyrodiil during the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles%20Main%20Quest\"&gt;Shivering Isles Main Quest&lt;/a&gt; of before they finish mantling Sheogorath.\nAkatosh.\nVestige.\nAmulet of Kings\nMartin Septim.\n&lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into the avatar of Akatosh in a battle with Mehrunes Dagon over the fate of Tamriel.\nThe avatar won over Mehrunes Dagon, immediately ending the Oblivion Crisis, and turned to stone. Though Martin is thought to have died, it is believed that he mantled Akatosh when he transformed into him. The Nords believe that it was Talos (Martin\u2019s forefather) lending his aid, not Akatosh.\nPossible examples.\nCelestials.\nThey Celestials are divine beings of Aetherius who are theorized to have once been mortals given so much power that they mantled the constellations through the use of Aetherium. Given how powerful they are, it is difficult to tell if they are powerful mortals or gods. This theory is supported by the Celestials calling one another by mortal names, including Hara for the Thief, Malazar for the Serpent, Valla for the Mage, and possibly Warwyrd for the Warrior.\nThe Tribunal.\nOne of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s writings may imply that the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; have mantled the Anticipations, in claiming that \"Six are the guardians of &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, three before and they are born again,\" Vivec is implying that the Tribunal took on the roles of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; by mantling. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; implies that this may be their orthodox claim to divinity, stating that the Tribunal became \"high ancestor spirits\" where the Daedra are \"ancestor spirits,\" with the strong implication that the Tribunal and the Daedra became one and the same kind of being, at least in respect to Dunmer theology.\n\"The Trial of Vivec\" further implies that the Tribunal stole worship from the Anticipations, and Vivec states, \"from [the Anticipations'] basis did we spring, called to heaven by violence, our people throwing our mantles to us across stars, and across time, and magic and dream, and here we remain.\" However, the same source states that this was not the Tribunal's primary path to godhood."}

Mobility and speed is of paramount importance to these troops. It is recommended that a cuirass and greaves be worn at all times. Helmets, gauntlets and boots are of value to cavalry and skirmishers, but not scouts or archers.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light armor&lt;/a&gt; is made from &lt;a href=\"Fur%20Armor\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chainmail%20Armor\"&gt;chainmail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mithril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the order of their quality and expense, fur being the least protective and cheapest, and glass the best and most expensive. Fur, leather armor, and chainmail are readily available throughout the empire. Mithril, elven and glass are exceedingly rare and are only found in ancient ruins and remote tombs.\n&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; should be reserved for the frontline infantry, pikemen, heavy cavalry or foot knights. All officers should be issued heavy armor. Helmets, cuirass and greaves should be standard issue at all times. Boots and gauntlets are only necessary for the cavalry and foot knights.\nBlacksmiths can forge heavy armor from &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;orchish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the order of their quality and expense, iron being the least useful and cheapest, with daedric the most effective and expensive. Iron and steel plate mail can be found in most any blacksmith's shop. The other materials are rare and armor made from them is only found in ancient treasure hoards hidden deep underground.\nAdvanced practitioners in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; know the secrets of placing enchantments upon pieces of armor. The greatest enchantments are typically placed on armor made from rarer, more durable materials, such as ebony and daedric, but even iron can be made to take an enchantment.\nThe self-styled &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt; of Battle, Amorous Janus, once penned a comedic ballad about a &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; general who was constant removing and re-equipping his armor every few minutes to conserve the &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; powering it. By way of response to the implied criticism, the general had him mounted on the front of a battering ram during the siege of Castle Fallow."}

Skill with a &lt;a href=\"blade\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt; is recommended for &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shortswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shortswords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Longswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;longswords&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Claymores%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;claymores&lt;/a&gt;. Skill with &lt;a href=\"blunt\"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt; weapons is desirable to wield the &lt;a href=\"War%20Axes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;war axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maces%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;battle axe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warhammers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;war hammer&lt;/a&gt;. To the uninitiated, &lt;a href=\"Axes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;axes&lt;/a&gt; and hammers may seem to be very different weapons, but the rhythm, drill, and physical strength used by both weapon types are virtually identical. Only those with &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;marksman&lt;/a&gt; skill should be outfitted with the &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of these weapons are commonly used in combination with a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. The claymore, battle axe and war hammer, however, require both hands to use. These two-handed weapons are best suited to heavily-armored &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;, berserkers and those soldiers that hold the flanks of the line.\nArms have been made from many materials over the ages, and each material varies in weight, durability, and cost. These materials are here ranked in order of desirability and cost, with cheapest and least desirable listed first: &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;, and finally &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt;. Some armorers correctly observe that silver weapons are slightly less durable than steel; nonetheless, its unique ability to affect &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt; and certain types of &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; creatures is undisputed.\nBows can be made with laminated cores of the same materials. This provides a higher tensile strength and therefore greater power on the draw. The materials used in the &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the arrowhead, can affect its mass and penetration. Thus, the quality of the bow and of the arrow are taken together to determine the weapon's overall armor penetration.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt; are mentioned in virtually every fable and song. The magic on such items lies dormant until they strike an opponent. At that moment the enchantment is activated, causing distress and injury to the target. Enchantments on bows are transferred to the arrow at the moment of release. Should the arrow have an enchantment of its own, however, the missile now carries both enchantments and delivers them to the target.\nAn enchanted weapon has a limited reservoir of &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Each blow drains some of its reserves, until finally it is drained dry. The enchantment can be recharged by arcane processes involving &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;. The more powerful the soul in the gem, the more magicka is restored to the item."}

They all had similar early experiences: exposure to magic kindled an interest and/or unlocked some latent ability, followed by years of hard work. These intrepid souls honed their skills, learned new spells, and vigorously trained their minds and bodies to become the formidable figures they were known as during their later lives.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel has long been the first stop on a long road to knowledge and power for many individuals. Providing magical services to the general public, the Guild offers a wide variety of spells for purchase, and is recommended as a first stop for any aspiring spellcaster. Independent dealers may be found, though their selection of spells is often not as comprehensive as that of the Mages Guild.\nMany spells are beyond the capabilities of beginning mages; the ability to render one's self invisible, for example, is an advanced power and is beyond the novice spellcaster. Through practice, a mage may become more skilled in a given school of Magic and find himself proficient enough to begin exploring its more powerful aspects. The fledging mage should not be daunted by his inability to wield certain powers, but should instead use this as a point of focus and a drive for bettering himself. Rather than becoming discouraged, the student should look forward to higher levels of skill, such as the advanced techniques of absorbing spells, summoning lesser (and eventually greater) &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; -- for research purposes only -- and protection against specific types of spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shock\"&gt;Shock&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nMages wishing to specialize in a particular school of magic are encouraged to learn as many spells of possible within that school, and to practice them frequently. All mages, whether specializing or nurturing a general interest, are encouraged to apply for membership within the Mages Guild. Beyond services available to the general public, the accomplished Guild member has access to many exclusive services such as Advanced Spellcraft and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. These services have been deemed potentially dangerous to the public at large, and have been restricted to higher-ranked Guild members in good standing by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council of Mages&lt;/a&gt;.\nCitizens interested in the further use of magic should consult their local Mages Guild &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;."}

It explains how to activate &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;' defense systems and how they work.\nContents.\nOn the subject of &lt;a href=\"Xedilian\"&gt;Xedilian&lt;/a&gt;'s construction, Lord &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, let me begin by extending the warmest regards to you and your noble being. The construction was completed on time and well under budget as you demanded (\"under pain of fun,\" I believe you are quoted as saying) and with only the most infinitesimal loss of life. I am proud to say that by harnessing the energy of that most unusual crystalline formation, Xedilian should maintain itself for years to come (with proper maintenance of course). At your request, I have included the full operation instructions for each section of the site. If you have any other questions, please feel free to bother me anytime (like when you originally thought of this idea in the middle of the night).\nThe heart of Xedilian is its power source, the Resonator of Judgment. By tuning this huge chunk of crystal with the Attenuator of Judgment (a \"tuning fork\" of sorts), we have released a wave of siren-like sound that will draw anyone from outside the Isles. Three Focus Crystals have been placed throughout the site to assist in keeping this wave of sound even and stable. This site will not function without all three Focus Crystals running in unison, so it's important to keep them clean and safe on their \"cradles\" (which I have called their Judgment Nexus). The Focus Crystals are irreplaceable at this time, so take proper precautions guarding the site when not in use.\nXedilian is split into three encounter areas all linked with the latest in arcane transport technology. As the hapless \"Xedilianites\" (it was fun to experiment on them, thank you for that) make their way through each room, they are subjected to a test based either on the &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Manic&lt;/a&gt; philosophy or that of the &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Demented&lt;/a&gt;... whichever suits your whim at the time. All you need do is push a single button, then sit back with your favorite wine (we've provided luxurious observation platforms from which to enjoy the show) and watch the results.\nEach encounter area has a unique theme that matches your requests as close as we could provide. I think you'll be pleased with the results. Below I have detailed each room and the effects you can expect from them (in brief, as I know your lordship is busy):\nChamber of Conversion.\nA fairly empty room with a large grating on the floor and single, half-sized \"harmless\" &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt; wandering in the center.\nManic Result\nOur small, harmless Gnarl will be grown in size to nearly thrice that of the average Xedilianite. Most we observe run around in an attempt to escape the lumbering creature. Eventually, it will stop and fade away. The magic of the room is enhanced by the spore gas we pump in through the grating.\nDemented Result\nOur tiny friend Gnarl is joined by a small swarm of its brethren and they attack our surprised guests! Genius!\nChamber of Avarice.\nIn this room, a huge mound of treasure sits atop a half-ziggurat inside a securely locked cage (to which there is no key).\nManic Result\nWe drop several hundred keys to the ground that are all exact duplicates. It's amusing to watch Xedilianites scramble through the keys for the correct one. Some spend days. Amazing.\nDemented Result\nWhen the Xedilianite reaches the top of the ziggurat; we blast them with a highly concussive flame spell. The blast always sends them flying... good fun for all, discounting those that do not survive.\nChamber of Anathema.\nAs you requested, we saved this one for last. The Xedilianite that has the mettle to make it this far now faces the toughest challenge of all. This room features freshly killed corpses, blood, and plenty of hanging bodies (for your darker moods, my lord).\nManic Result\nWe kill the Xedilianite, and cause a specter of his former self to rise from the body. Not many Xedilianite minds can handle this one... most go insane this far into the site. I must confess, this room is a favorite of mine.\nDemented Result\nNothing better than a good old-fashioned battle! We raise at least double the number of zombies as there are Xedilianites and let them all have at it! Simple, elegant, and deadly.\nI hope you are pleased with the results of Xedilian. I know you'll have just as much fun using it as we had fun constructing it. Strangely, we have yet to receive payment for the site, but I am sure it is just a minor oversight and it will be corrected as soon as your lordship has a mome..."}

Their eyes are clear and milky-white. Maormer's skin is entirely pale and colorless, as though their flesh is made of white limpid jelly. Their skin also has strange, chameleon-like properties, comparable to that of the forest coupling skills of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; is the Maormer ruler of Pyandonea. Orgnum is a deathless wizard who it seems is not only immortal, but grows more youthful by the century, and he is said to be the Serpent God &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;. The Maormer practice a powerful form of snake magic, and with this they have tamed the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Serpent\"&gt;sea serpents&lt;/a&gt; of their island for use as steeds and warbeasts. These sea serpents serve as King Orgnum's guards and occasional mounts.\nMaormeri ships are described as insectoid in appearance, with membranous sails and a rugged chitin hull, flying a markedly alien flag. Waving tendrils of kelp trap all but the Maormer's own ships in the uncharted waters of Pyandonea.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nTranslations of tapestries in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; are the most reliable origin story for the Maormer, and tell the tale of how the Maormer were likely separated in their original homeland of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. According to this story, Orgnum was a massively rich Aldmer nobleman, who used his wealth to rebel against the governments and powers of Aldmeris. He and his followers were exiled from Aldmeris, to a place where they could not take such actions again, via impenetrable mist, Pyandonea, \"The &lt;a href=\"Veil%20of%20Mist\"&gt;Veil of Mist&lt;/a&gt;.\" This proved successful, as they never assaulted Aldmeris again, and became the Maormer.\nFirst &amp; Second Era.\nThe Maormer were relentless in their drive to conquer Summerset, and there is scarcely a year throughout the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; when they did not ravage the coastlines of the Altmer. Every attack launched by the Maormer against Summerset has been led by Orgnum himself, and despite the number of wars and strategies employed by the Maormer, each of these attacks has proved to be an ultimate failure.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20486\"&gt;2E 486&lt;/a&gt;, a small Maormeri fleet was sighted off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, and King &lt;a href=\"Hidellith\"&gt;Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; ordered his navy to give chase. The navy followed the ships through uncharted waters, into an ambush in Pyandonea itself. Most of the Alinori navy was destroyed, but a single warship returned to Summerset, a testament to the maritime genius of the Altmer.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Maormer had some form of control over the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; island &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;a treaty&lt;/a&gt; they agreed to with the city of &lt;a href=\"Mistral\"&gt;Mistral&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ulondil\"&gt;Ulondil&lt;/a&gt;, the Maormer ambassador of the island, along with his followers, later went on to betray the agreement. The &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Vipers\"&gt;Sea Vipers&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful faction of Maormer, was known to have also led attacks against the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; throughout many of its controlled territories. During this time, the Maormer captured the city of &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt; on the island of Summerset.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; made allies of the Maormer, although the Dominion allowed the kings of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate Maormer outposts that had been established along the western coast of the mainland.\nThird Era.\nThe last documented appearance of the Maormer was the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;3E 110&lt;/a&gt;. The united alliance of the kings of Summerset, &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, combining the Imperial fleet, the royal navies of Summerset, and the Psijic's magical powers, succeeded in destroying the Pyandonean invading armada. It was said that the storm brewed by the Psijic of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; so annihilated Orgnum's fleet that he was never again able to muster together enough of a force to dare another battle."}

It consists of nine &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt; and assorted disputed territories.\nBlack Marsh.\nCalled &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt; by its inhabitants, Black Marsh is home to the reptilian race of the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the south-eastern corner of Tamriel and is covered by vast, festering marshes, rainforests, waterways, and immense, impenetrable forests of &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; and mangrove trees. Due to the topography of the land, travel of any distance is difficult for seemingly anyone that isn't Argonian which is a definite factor as to why Black Marsh has never been successfully invaded or mapped. Many cities of Black Marsh, such as &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, were originally founded by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. Little else is known about this mysterious and ill-documented place.\nCyrodiil.\nCyrodiil is the home of one of the four races of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the heart of the continent. It serves as the capital of the many &lt;a href=\"Empires\"&gt;Empires&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Cyrodiil is covered largely by forests in the interior; humid marshes south of the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Niben\"&gt;Lower Niben&lt;/a&gt;; vineyards and farmsteads surrounding &lt;a href=\"County%20Skingrad\"&gt;County Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;; the rolling amber hills of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; to the west; and jagged highlands and tundra of the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the north and east. The capital city, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, is located on the &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;. It is the heart of the Imperial Empire and the seat of the Emperor's power and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nElsweyr.\nElsweyr is the home of the feline race of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and is located in the south of Tamriel, between the Provinces of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Elsweyr is, for the most part, a desert land with majestic, rolling dunescapes and sun-drenched dust plains in the interior and thick forests and jungle surrounding it along its borders with Cyrodiil and Valenwood, with the &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar Forest&lt;/a&gt; covering a large area in the south of the Province.\nHammerfell.\nHammerfell is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, the fourth race of Men, who came to Tamriel after leaving their original homeland of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. Hammerfell has an arid climate and much of the Province is desert, namely the great &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; in the west, with a few forests on the coast and provincial borders with grasslands dominating the south around the Cyrodiil border, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; located along the border with Skyrim. One of the most notable cities in Hammerfell is &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. Stros M'kai is famous for its &lt;a href=\"orrery\"&gt;orrery&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only known fully functional orrery outside the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, in Cyrodiil.\nHigh Rock.\nLocated in the north-west corner of the continent, west of Skyrim, the homeland of the third race of Men, the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. High Rock is a land with a cool, calm climate and rolling hills covered in heather which flow to the foothills of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the plateaus of &lt;a href=\"North%20Kambria\"&gt;North Kambria&lt;/a&gt;. High Rock is a land that is no stranger to battle. The warlords of various Breton clans and houses have been at war on and off for thousands of years. Notable cities include &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; sits on an island called &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorrowind.\nFormerly Resdayn, Morrowind is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (Dark Elves) and is located in the north-east corner of Tamriel. It consists of Mainland Morrowind, where the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; is located, as well as the ruling political body therein, and the large isle of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; where the volcano &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; dominates the landscape. Vvardenfell in particular has a very diverse topography ranging from the marshes of the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt; region and the dense tropical mushroom forests of the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; to the rolling, golden plains of the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; and the choking dust, harsh winds, and ash storms of the volcanic &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; region which dominates the center of the island. Morrowind as a whole is famous for its unusual flora and fauna, in particular the giant insectoid and arthropodan life and towering fungal growths.\nOrsinium.\nThe home of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, more commonly called \"Orcs,\" officially a territory or city-province and not currently recognized as an independent nation and therefore not shown on any modern official map, encompasses a small area in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; within the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. A difficult environment to thrive in as much of the landscape lies above the tree line, there are few abundant resources aside from rock and metals that require mining. Its geography, however, make it a place easy to defend against invading armies. This is fitting as Orsinium is no stranger to conflict and bloodshed: this is exemplified in the ancient conflict which resulted in Orsinium's \"birth\" and the ascension of the Orsimer's king &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; in the Third Era who rediscovered the ancient location and reclaimed it for the Orcs of Tamriel. Following its destruction in the early-Fourth Era, Orsinium was rebuilt in the mountains between Skyrim and Hammerfell, as opposed to the Wrothgarian Mountains in High Rock.\nSkyrim.\nThe original home of Men in Tamriel, Skyrim is located in the frigid north of Tamriel, between &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and is the home of the oldest race of men, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. Skyrim is a rugged, harsh, and unforgiving place of snow-capped, jagged mountains and wind-blasted ice fields standing in contrast to the verdant forests of &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; saw a dramatic change to Skyrim's northern coast during &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;The Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; when the glacier on which the capital city was built shattered and fell into the sea, taking much of the city with it. The &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was unharmed however, and this has fostered a great deal of anger, suspicion, and resentment between the local Nords and the College Mages who insist they had nothing to do with the Collapse. The fact that the Nords have continued to dwell here is testament to their resilience and fortitude.\nSummerset Isles.\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the Isles are the home of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; (High Elves). The main Isle, called &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and home of the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, and the smaller Isle of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; are verdant landscapes dotted with towns and cities of ancient mansions and enchanted towers, similar to those of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; mages of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The Isles also include the island of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, and also used to be home to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nValenwood.\nThe ancestral homeland of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; (Wood Elves). It is located in the south-western corner of Tamriel, west of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, as its name suggests, is a land covered, for the most part, by forests. The topography is hilly and the west coast is choked by seemingly endless mangrove forests and tropical rainforests. The largest Bosmer villages and cities are built high in the boughs of ancient migratory trees which have the ability to move the settlements, in their entirety, wherever they venture."}

They played together, and ran through the woods together, exploring their little world and learning to see things through each other's eyes. This was very different from their parents because Shandar was the son of Maldor, who was captured in a war and forced to work as a slave for the village baron. Their village and another both needed the land between them to feed the villagers, and fought and fought, until many of the villagers died. Maldor was wounded in battle, and left for dead by his fellows. He was captured and forced to work in the fields as punishment. Shandar was not allowed to play with Mara, but she was very small and the other children didn't like to play with her, so she played with Shandar against her father's command. And they learned that they were really not very different at all. They couldn't understand why their parents hated each other so.\nWell, Shandar and Mara played together for many years, and learned to love each other as they grew up. They knew that they couldn't let their parents know, because it was forbidden for them ever to marry, since they were from different villages and the war was still going on. They tried and tried to figure out how they could be happy together, and finally decided that they must run away from their village. They would try to make a new life for themselves in another village, far, far away from where they grew up.\nOne night, while planning their escape, they were discovered by the town guards. Shandar tried to fight them, but they tied him up and dragged him away to the prison inside town. Mara was taken home, and her father was very angry with her, and told her that she could not leave their home again. He went to the house of another farmer, and asked if their son would marry Mara, so that she could never see Shandar again. The marriage was planned for the next week.\nShandar, meanwhile, was to be killed for daring to be with Mara. He was beaten, and placed in a stockade. He was placed in a stockade, and they were to hang him the next day. When Mara found out that Shandar was to be killed, she knew that she could never live without him, and climbed out her window and ran into the woods, crying and crying. She ran and ran, and soon was lost. It was very dark, because back then they did not have any moons in the sky back then to make it safe for little boys and girls. Soon she found herself in a part of the woods she had never been before, and sat down on a rock since she was very tired.\nWell, the rock was a secret entrance to a cave where a very mean &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; lived. When he came back from his hunting, he found Mara curled up asleep on his rock, and thought to himself, \"Hmmm, a tasty little girl. I shall save her for my breakfast!\"\nHe grabbed her and took her into his cave, moving the rock back so that she could not escape. She was sure to die, and tried to escape, but the evil orc just laughed and laughed at her, until she finally gave up.\nWhen the villagers found out that Mara had run off, they were very worried. No one knew the woods very well, and all were afraid of the evil orc that lived there. Only Shandar was not afraid, and he begged and begged for the baron to set him free, so that he could go look for Mara. The Baron finally decided to let Shandar go, for no one else was brave enough to go and rescue Mara. So Shandar was set free, and he set off into the woods to go and rescue her.\nShandar searched and searched, but could not find poor Mara. Finally, he sat down on a rock to rest for a moment, and as he sat down, he noticed a piece of cloth under the rock. It was a piece from Mara's cloak! He realized that she must be under the rock somehow, and knew that the orc had captured her. He pushed and pushed on the rock, and finally was able to roll it aside. He climbed down into the orc's cave, but it was very dark, and he could not see anything. The evil orc, when he heard his front door moving, hid in the shadows to see what was coming into his home. When he saw that it was just a little man-boy, he grinned to himself and thought, \"Now I have lunch, TOO!\"\nWhen Shandar came near, the orc grabbed him, and began to squeeze the life out of him.\nBack in the village, the people soon realized that they were foolish to let a young man go off into the woods by himself. They gathered all of their weapons, and set off to find the two lost children. When they finally came upon the clearing near the orcs' cave, they saw a strange and wondrous sight: A slain orc near the entrance to the cave, and Mara holding the head of poor Shandar in her lap. Shandar had killed the orc, but not before the it gave Shandar a mortal wound.\nMara's tears flowed freely from her eyes and splashed upon Shandar's face, reflecting the light from the villager's torches. Shandar was filled with sorrow at the thought that he had saved Mara, only to lose her because of his own impending death from the battle with the orc. He cried out to Mara's namesake, the &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;goddess of love&lt;/a&gt;, to help them.\nThe Goddess Mara recognized their true love and wept at their loss. Not having power over death, she could do nothing to save Shandar, but she knew that she could not let their love die. She reached down from the heavens and picked up Mara and Shandar in her arms, and placed them high in the heavens. They could be together always, and provide light in the dark night to others so that they may be safe from the evils in the world. The villagers were amazed at this sight, and vowed to honor the love of Shandar and Mara by learning more about themselves and their neighbors, so that the war that had been going on as long as anyone could remember would end. Shandar's sacrifice for the one he loved showed them that he was worthy of their respect, and that those from his village were just as proud and worthy as themselves.\nAnd, that's why, children, every night we can see Mara's Tear and Shandar's Sorrow spending their lives together high in the heavens, lighting the way for all the little boys and girls like you."}
