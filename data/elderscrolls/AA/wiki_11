I spent all my long years as a &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostle&lt;/a&gt; pushing against those boundaries\u2014desperate to see our order truly live its creed: inquiry without limits. In most cases, I endured little more than sighs and grumbles from my superiors. But one topic in particular earns me forceful and genuine condemnation: my exploration of the factotum's inner voice.\nThe order's relationship with &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fabricants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;factotums&lt;/a&gt; has always been prickly. On one hand, we must understand some critical aspects of these creatures' make-up. Their nature and materials informed the creation of our own enhancements. The synthesis of flesh and engineering remains one of our greatest achievements and most enduring traditions. However, delving too deep into the creatures' subroutines and manufacture starts to look less and less like inquiry, and more and more like hubris. Lifting &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;'s skirts, as it were.\nFor my part, I have always been endlessly fascinated by the factotum's voice and behavior. While the factotums perform multitudinous different tasks, they remain linked by their appearance, voice, and confusing (some would say \"troubling\") verbal artifacts.\nWhen exodromals meet a factotum for the first time, they often ask, \"whose voice is that?\" Truthfully, no one knows (aside for Lord Seht, of course.) I've spent countless days in the Archivox researching Lord Seht's past. I even got special dispensation to visit the &lt;a href=\"Mnemonic%20Planisphere\"&gt;Mnemonic Planisphere&lt;/a&gt; once. I'm confident that the truth of the factotum's voice lies somewhere in Lord Seht's personal history.\nMost apostles avoid talking about it, with some notable exceptions, (my friend, &lt;a href=\"Associate%20Zanon\"&gt;Associate Zanon&lt;/a&gt;, for example.) If engaged privately, however, apostles will offer one of three major theories. Some believe the voice is that of Sotha Sil's mother. Others think it's the voice of a lost lover. Then, still others (myself included) believe it's the voice of Sotha Sil's sister.\nThe first and most compelling piece of evidence can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Elegiac%20Replication\"&gt;Elegiac Replication&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a personal memorial of sorts that Lord Seht built in the Radius long ago. One of the memorial plaques refers to a \"Sotha Nall.\" It states that this Sotha Nall possessed a \"soul that deserved transcendence\"\u2014implying a life beyond natural limitations. Nall's face bears a clear resemblance to that of the Clockwork God, indicating that she was a close family member. Her garb does not appear matronly, and her posture does not conform to any psycho-artistic trends that would indicate motherly affection. Additionally, I've seen more than a few references to the fact that Sotha Sil was not an only child. Taken together, I think this makes a clear case for Sotha Nall as sister.\nNaturally, this leads to all kinds of uncomfortable questions about what a soul's \"transcendence\" means in this context. Does some aspect of Nall's animus exist inside the brass laborers we find all over the city? I would say \"no\" if not for the verbal artifacts.\nWhen faced with a query that requires higher cognition, factotums often recite a non sequitur in two parts\u2014brief statements that have a loose connection to one another but no discernible connection to the larger conversation. These non sequiturs (also known as \"verbal artifacts\") tend to be simple recitations of household \"scenes\" They refer to overturned pots, rain on glass, boots by the fire, and so on. Occasionally they stray into more personal terrain, like the complexion of an old woman's hands, or the sound of someone weeping. Then, once in a very great while, they will say something genuinely troubling\u2014statements like \"burning beds \u2026 screaming\" or \"collapsed roof \u2026 crushed child.\" Factotums that say things like that tend to be recalled to the Pneumatic Forge in short order and taken out of circulation indefinitely. But this of course begs the question: where are these verbal artifacts coming from? Are they Sotha Nall's memories? Or some vital sub-function that enhances empathic responses to the concerns of living residents? Though it pains me to consider it, I believe the evidence points to the former rather than the latter. As everyone knows, the False Prince called &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed Sotha Sil's ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt; when our lord was still a youth\u2014leaving him as the sole survivor. Scenes of fire and death may well have been Sotha Nall's final and most traumatic memories.\nI hope it's not true. I hope all these various observations are the product of simple coincidence. But, as scholars, we must acknowledge the possibility that these machines have a deeper and more troubling history than we realize. As I said before, I take my role as an iconoclast seriously. But In this case, perhaps it's best if we never know the truth."}

He will tell you that he saw something very strange in the cave up ahead; when he was camping there for the night, a whole village appeared out of nowhere. He ran out as fast he could, but he will not prevent you from investigating on your own. \nHead into the Shrouded Hollow. Inside, a woman named Laniriel will approach you. She will explain the history of this place: they have a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking\"&gt;Wilderking&lt;/a&gt;; the village will disappear somewhere for many years at a time, then return for a short while every now and then. This usually causes no problems, but this time &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orcs\"&gt;Wood Orcs&lt;/a&gt; have set up camp at the cave's southern entrance. While the village is away, a caretaker tends to its location; a new caretaker is about to be chosen at the Fading Tree, deeper in the hollow. Laniriel will tell you that you can attend this ceremony if you wish; you should go speak with a man named Erunor there. \nHead through to the western hallway, but beware that this cave is quite a maze. There, at the Fading Tree, talk to Erunor. Erunor will tell you that his people made an oath to the Wilderking long ago, but he will not reveal the nature of that oath. He will direct you to the old caretaker, Henodras, who is in this same room. Speak with him and he will tell you the nature of the oath the village took. The village swore to protect the Fading Tree, and in return, the Wilderking sends them somewhere without hunger or pain. The village only returns when a new caretaker needs to be chosen.\nOnce you are done speaking with Henodras, the ceremony will take place. Erunor will be chosen as the new caretaker, but just as the ceremony has been completed, Laniriel will come barging in, shouting that the village is under attack from the Wood Orcs. Speak with her and she will ask you to help in the fight. She will tell you to kill the enemy's leader and burn their tents, so as to create a distraction. To reach the Orc camp, head out of the cave through the southern exit. You will have to fight your way through several waves of &lt;a href=\"Lhurgash%20Clan\"&gt;Lhurgash Clan&lt;/a&gt; Orcs on your way. \n&lt;a href=\"War%20Captain%20Muzgash\"&gt;War Captain Muzgash&lt;/a&gt; will be by the building you see immediately as you leave the cave. Kill him and burn three of the tents in the area, then return to the Shrouded Hollow and talk to Laniriel. He will be happy that the Orcs have been driven off, but she will be less happy that Erunor has been chosen to stay behind as the caretaker. She will reveal that she is pregnant with Erunor's child, and that she wants him to stay with the village to help raise their child and be a family. He does not yet know that she is with child, so she will ask you to go talk to him and convince him to stay with the village. \nHead to the Fading Tree. There, you will witness the final part of the ceremoy where Erunor accepts the role of the new caretaker. Speak with him and tell him everything, and he will tell you that he is in a predicament. The Fading Tree is currently weak, and needs to be tended to quickly. The village must depart again with haste so that the caretaker can tend to it, or the tree might die, causing the village to never return. At this point, you can either tell him to stay behind and tend to the tree, or to go with his wife and be a father. \nIf you tell Erunor to protect the tree, . If you tell him to stay with his wife and child, he will head to Laniriel to tell her. Speak with him again hereafter to finish the quest."}

The tales of their mischief are found in every culture, in most every village, town, and city-states in the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Alternately they are called Faerie, Fey, &lt;a href=\"Illyadi\"&gt;Illyadi&lt;/a&gt;, Sprites, &lt;a href=\"Pixies\"&gt;Pixies&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylphim\"&gt;Sylphim&lt;/a&gt;, and their natures seem to flit from one story to the next with the same variation. It could almost be said that Faeries are anything unpredictable in nature.\nThe noted scholar &lt;a href=\"Ahrtabazus\"&gt;Ahrtabazus&lt;/a&gt; studying at the time in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sumurset%20Isle\"&gt;Sumurset Isle&lt;/a&gt; developed an interesting if controversial theory about Faerie. He organized the Fey variants on a chain, beginning with the glimmering sparks called Pixies or Whilloki by the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; at one end and the godlike beings such as &lt;a href=\"Gheateus\"&gt;Gheateus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chonus\"&gt;Chonus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sygria\"&gt;Sygria&lt;/a&gt; at the other. In the middle are human and semi-human beings generating up to intelligent trees, brooks, rocks, even mountains. All of this was a new and completely original theory and would have prompted enthusiastic, if somewhat skeptical response had Ahrtabazus not added this footnote: \"It may be that elves as a whole are part of this chain, above whilloki and below nephrine. They certainly have similar features and propensities for magicka as the other Faerie.\" (Ahrtabazus, \"The Faerie Chain\" &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"2E%20456\"&gt;2E 456&lt;/a&gt;)\nNo elf liked to be put in a hierarchy slightly above whimsical pranksters like the whilloki, and Ahrtabazus was challenged on his assumptions based on very slight coincidences. Nevertheless, with modification, his Fairie Chain theory has gained wider and wider acceptance since its publication.\nThe hierarchial chain is not, in the strictest sense, an order of command. While Gheateus and Sygria are said to be surrounded by a host of minor Sylphim, faerie on the whole are not followers nor leaders. Their plans and schemes are not governed by a higher purpose, simply by their own whim. To this most faerie scholars agree. Because it is based on coincidental evidence and supported by auxiliary theories, it may very well be wrong."}

Ever since discovering this book, I have been captivated with the idea of this place.\nUnfortunately, the book was lost to me under mysterious circumstances before I was able to commit my translation to writing. But I have transcribed from memory what I can recall of that mesmerizing description.\n\"The great fortress of Carac Dena stood for centuries, held by a hundred Ayleid who had bled into the stone at its creation. The fortress rested high above the coast of Valenwood, a great stone monument and a bulwark against all enemies.\n\"Because of its greatness, it became a wayrest for travelers, a vault for great treasures, and a vast library. It was even said that one could hear singing when one approached the fortress.\n\"... when the great horde* laid siege to the gates, the fortress of Carac Dena stood firm for a hundred years, until the great force beneath threatened to overwhelm the gates. That is when the commanders gathered the hundred original soldiers and convened a meeting. The fateful decision was made. One by one, the soldiers bled on the stones and brought the great fortress crashing to the ground, destroying the enemy host beneath it.\nI have dedicated my life to finding the location of this great fortress. I am now certain that it must have been swallowed by the land after it fell. And indeed, I believe I have at last narrowed down the location. It only remains for me to gather a fitting group of &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt; guides and venture to the spot."}

The gates of Camlorn needs to be opened. Darien suggests that the Vestige take a &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20Volunteer\"&gt;Camlorn Volunteer&lt;/a&gt; to light the fires in the towers to signal his father, and after this is completed, he will take the rest of the civilians and his guards and unlock the gates.\nOnce the fires are lit, the Vestige needs to take on Faolchu alone and keep him busy long enough for Darien and the troops to take the city. They mention needing fire to defeat him. Darien promise fire will come as soon as the archers have arrived.\nEscort the volunteers to each of the three towers and wait outside while they go inside to light the fires. There are werewolves everywhere; keep fighting them until it's time to find Faolchu and confront him.\nHe has taken over a holding in the northern part of the city. Head inside to see a ghostly figure talk to a reborn werewolf Faolchu. Fight him with fire and defeat him. When it's done and Faolchu is dead, head outside to find a group of soldiers and Camlorn citizens stand around, clapping their hands. Walk over and talk to General Gautier. He is really glad to see that the Vestige has killed the beast, but in modesty, they say it was a group effort. However, the General say that if the Vestige hadn't showed up, they would have lost the war.\nAsking the General questions will make him tell the Vestige what will happen to Camlorn now, but it's time for the Vestige to talk to his son Darien before it's time to leave. He is standing nearby. Darien is in a happy mood and jokes a little but the Vestige is impatient and wants him to focus as his father has sent them to Darien to talk.\nDarien wanted to say his thanks personally. He is glad that they came along, because their actions saved lives. Darien adds he will leave the Camlorn Guard now as he is no builder, besides the &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof&lt;/a&gt; thing is still out there. Someone has to go and deal with that.\nHe makes some jokes but the Vestige must move on now and Darien, in his happy mood says that the first one to reach Angof buys the first bottle of wine!"}

Boethiah had been speaking to Veloth in dreams and visions, guiding him to lead a new sect of Aldmeri with the belief that mortals could ascend to become gods. Trinimac's priests condemned the new sect for blasphemy and threatened exile, should they not abandon Veloth. When the priests were to pass judgement, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; appeared, having swallowed Trinimac, and revealed the lies of Trinimac's teachings with Trinimac's own voice. Content the priests were shamed and broken from his revelation, Boethiah relieved himself of Trinimac in front of the assembly to complete his shame. We know not how Trinimac had been defeated, but it is said that after his defeat Boethiah had consumed him and tortured his spirit in her belly. When Boethiah grew bored of Trinimac's torture, she released him from his prison and later exiled him to a plane of choking ash. This torture and dishonor left Trinimac twisted and enraged. Trinimac faded and was reborn as Mauloch, the God of Curses. With his mind bent on revenge, his most devout followers changed to match him and became the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, cursed to wander in exile, a people without a place.\""}

Few people believe the legend anymore, but there most certainly was a Baron &lt;a href=\"Othrok\"&gt;Othrok&lt;/a&gt; of Dwynnen who was destined to become one of true heroes of High Rock, if not all &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe legend, as most any Dwynnen child will tell you, is that years and years ago (archivists have agreed to the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt;), the people of Dwynnen were ruled by a lich and its armies of &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Othrok was blessed by gods and given an army of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and animals to destroy the dead. He brought peace and prosperity to the land, growing more powerful as the land improved. Years later, he led the tiny barony against the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt;, and saved all of Tamriel.\nHow much credit the Baron ought to receive for the defeat of the Camoran Usurper has been debated, but it is an uncontestable fact that in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;, the Camoran Usurper's relentless move north through High Rock was halted around the area of contemporary Dwynnen. Dwynnen is actually larger than it was in the first Baron's day -- it did not, in fact, have a sea port -- but the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; was a coastal battle. The fact that the battle probably did not occur in Dwynnen does not in itself belittle the Baron's participation in it.\nThe Camoran Usurper had conquered &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; by means of a large army, which by legend consisted entirely of undead and &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;, but was mostly composed of &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;. In all probability, the Usurper summoned the daedra and undead in &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; and slowly replaced the original summoned creatures with the armies of his conquered territories. Most armies of Valenwood have been historically mercenary.\nWord of the Usurper's conquests reached High Rock in early &lt;a href=\"3E%20266\"&gt;266&lt;/a&gt;, but preparations to repel the invasion did not begin until early the following year. Historians attribute two factors to High Rock's hesistancy. The primary powers of the &lt;a href=\"Illiac%20Bay\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt; were ruled by particularly inept monarchs -- &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; both had kings in their minority, and &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; was torn by contention between &lt;a href=\"Helena\"&gt;Helena&lt;/a&gt; and her cousin &lt;a href=\"Jilathe\"&gt;Jilathe&lt;/a&gt;. The Lord of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; (now &lt;a href=\"Anticlere%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;) was deathly ill through 266 and finally died at the end of the year. There were, in short, no leaders to unite the province against the Usurper. Of the leaders with any influence, at least eight (the \"&lt;a href=\"Eight%20Traitors\"&gt;Eight Traitors&lt;/a&gt;\" of legend) made secret allegiances with the Usurper to protect their lands.\nThe secondary reason for the lethargy of High Rock had to do with the depth of relations between the province and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time since the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; ruled Tamriel who was neither &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; nor had spent any of his childhood in High Rock. The difference between &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20II\"&gt;Cephorus II&lt;/a&gt; and his cousin &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20IV\"&gt;Uriel IV&lt;/a&gt; who preceded him was appalling to the people of High Rock. Even mad Emperors like &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; revered the Bretons over all other races, and cousins and younger siblings of the Emperors have ruled in High Rock since the foundation of the Empire. Cephorus was a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; sympathies. The attitude of the common men of High Rock was sympathetic toward the Camoran Usurper as an archfoe of this hated Emperor.\nThe Baron and his less legendary allies, the rulers of &lt;a href=\"Ykalon%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;, , and &lt;a href=\"Kambria%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Kambria&lt;/a&gt;, changed this favorable perception. News of the Usurper's barbaric treatment of captives and abuse of conquered lands, mostly true, spread rapidly through their territories, and then to other neutral lands. Within a few months, the greatest navy ever combined organized along the High Rock edge of the Iliac Bay. Only the navy of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20V\"&gt;Uriel V&lt;/a&gt;'s ill-fated invasion of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; was comparable.\nHow the combined forces of High Rock defeated the endless army of the Camoran Usurper is certainly worthy of a lengthy book in itself. And perhaps, it is best left to the public imagination. Certainly the weather worked against the Usurper, which is reason in itself to attribute divine intervention.\nBaron Othrok's divine purpose is the central theme to Othroktide, after all. And as the poet &lt;a href=\"Braeloque\"&gt;Braeloque&lt;/a&gt; wrote, \"To find the facts, the wisest always look first to the fiction.\""}

One of his dragon allies may be able to tell me where he's gone. With the help of the Jarl of Whiterun, I've trapped Odahviing in Dragonsreach. Odahviing revealed that Alduin's lair is located in the ancient temple of Skuldafn, which is only accessible by air. Odahviing has offered to take me there, in return for his freedom.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; escapes from the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the previous quest, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will need to track him down in order to defeat him once and for all. The Dragonborn can speak to &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; to learn that the best way to do this is to trap one of Alduin's dragon allies at Dragonsreach in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; and interrogate him for information.\nIf the Civil War questline has been completed on either side, the Dragonborn can then speak to the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun to get his assistance in preparing the trap.\nIf not, the Jarl will decline to help while the war is still ongoing; this will start the \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, in which a peace treaty must be negotiated at &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; to put the Civil War on hold first. If, however, the Dragonborn had killed Paarthurnax by this point in &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;a quest&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, then the truce cannot be called because Arngeir will refuse to help with the negotiations. In this case, the only way to continue the quest is to bring about peace by completing the Civil War questline before the Jarl will agree to provide assistance.\nOnce the Jarl of Whiterun has agreed to help, the Dragonborn will learn from Esbern or Paarthurnax (if the Dragonborn had not killed him) that the names of all dragons are actually Words of Power, and that &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt; can be used to call them. The Dragonborn will then receive the &lt;a href=\"Call%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Call Dragon&lt;/a&gt; shout which will be used to lure Odahviing into the trap at Dragonsreach.\nThe trap can now be launched by traveling to Dragonsreach and speaking with Jarl &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf&lt;/a&gt; or, if the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Stormcloaks%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; was completed in favor of the Stormcloaks, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;. Exiting through the doors behind the throne room to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach%23Great%20Porch\"&gt;Great Porch&lt;/a&gt; (which Esbern incorrectly calls the \"Courtyard\") allows Odahviing to be called and trapped, using first the Call Dragon shout to lure him out, and then force him down from the sky. Note that it may be helpful to go up on the small balcony to the right and use the Call Dragon shout from there; the shout button must be held down long enough for all three words of the shout to be completed in order to make Odahviing show up.\nSince Odahviing cannot be killed, there is no point in trying to fight him or trying to drain his power. Instead, he can be immediately lured into the enclosed area, and the trap will come down on his neck and hold him in place. He will then speak to the Dragonborn, and offer to take them to Alduin's lair at Skuldafn in exchange for his freedom.\nNote: If followers or characters insist on tanking Odahviing and keeping far away from the trap, attack him until he is \"KO'd\" and then retreat to the doors. When Odahviing's HP is restored (since he is not killable at this point), he should attempt to follow the Dragonborn and get trapped.\nAt this point, &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar&lt;/a&gt; may come in and start running tests on Odahviing, with amusing results.\nWhen choosing to free Odahviing, a guard on the second floor will help release the trap. Speaking with Odahviing again will allow him to carry the Dragonborn to Skuldafn, which immediately starts &lt;a href=\"The%20World-Eater%27s%20Eyrie\"&gt;the next quest&lt;/a&gt;."}

A mercenary told me that some researchers went into the ruins, but that strange things started happening when they did.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAt the ruins of Shada's Tear, at the bottom of the waterfall, you will find a man named Greban. He will tell you that he and his research team were researching Shada's Tear, but half the team drank from the water here which turned out to be cursed. They grew very strong and started attacking everything that moves. His boss is inside the ruins trying to find a solution; Greban will ask you to go talk to him. \nHead into the ruins and talk to Sali'ma there.

Sali'ma suspects that there are nereids there corrupting the water, and will send you to go and deal with them. \nTake care to avoid falling in the water; it will kill you.

Either way, head through the corridors to the southern chamber to face the Nereid &lt;a href=\"Emi%27liah\"&gt;Emi'liah&lt;/a&gt;. She will summon other enemies to her aid, but more important are the vortexes she summons in the water on the floor; these will pull you underwater and make you take massive damage, so stay on the move and watch out for those. Once Emi'liah is dead, head through the door in the north of the room to get back to the start of the crypt wing, then head back out. You will see that the waters on the west side have been cleansed. \nIn the east is the City Wing. You will find several nereids in the waterways here. In the first big room, you will find a woman named &lt;a href=\"Ralai\"&gt;Ralai&lt;/a&gt; on the balcony; she will give you the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Waters%20Run%20Foul\"&gt;Waters Run Foul&lt;/a&gt;\". That quest takes place in the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously. Either way, proceed to the northeasternmost room; here, you will find the nereid &lt;a href=\"Jah%27lah\"&gt;Jah'lah&lt;/a&gt;. This nereid likes to hide underwater and cause geysers of poisoned water to spout from below; stay on the move when she does this. She also likes to summon other enemies to her aid; there is no point in killing these, as she will only summon new ones once the old ones are dead. Once Jah'lah lies dead, head north through the door to the beginning of the City Wing, and then back to the main room. You will find that the waters on the east have now been purified.\nOnce both wings have been purified, head back to the main camp and talk to Sali'ma. He will tell you that Shada awaits in the city's Temple Wing, across the now-cleansed water. Head across and Shada will warn you to leave. Do not be dissuaded; clear through the enemies and head on into the temple wing. Proceed onward, and in the room with the spiders, take the road to the right. From here on, the road is straightforward, if long. In the southern room, there is a spider miniboss called &lt;a href=\"Muhma%20the%20Stinger\"&gt;Muhma the Stinger&lt;/a&gt;, but you can avoid her if you keep your distance. Head on to the northeasternmost room; this is where you will find Shada herself. Shada will summon minions to her aid, but most of those can be safely ignored. There are two exceptions to this though: every once in a while she will summon four maidens to create a shield around her; these must be killed before she can be damaged again. When she talks about the magic of her most powerful servant, she will summon four very powerful mages to the battlefield. These mages will use a very powerful spell to annihilate you; this spell cannot be blocked and can only be survived with a timely dodge. Needless to say, taking out these mages should be your number one priority the moment they appear. \nOnce you have taken out Shada, head back to Sali'ma; you can take a shortcut back by heading up the stairs behind Shada and through the door. Speak with Sali'ma to finish the quest."}

This welcome revelation comes from previously untranslated Aldmeri tapestries within the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The unmitigated truth revealed at last, after painstaking study, speaks not of a common plight of reluctant migration and tragic diaspora, but a tale of treachery and exile.\nThe blood the Maormer spill has always been in the name of greed and hungry ambition. Their corrupt \"king,\" &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt;, thought to usurp our ancient homeland of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; from its rightful rulers, just as he seeks to steal Summerset from us. The Maormer are a despicable people who do not deserve the guilt of conscience some have afforded them for too long. Any debate on the matter is closed, the Maormer apologists are silenced, and the prosecution of war against the Pyandoneans should be carried out without remorse."}

He offers typical merchant items, as well as an odd statue as he mentions. Upon purchase of the statue (for 150 ) the Vestige interacts with the statue in their inventory.\nUpon questioning, Zahshur states that he is unsure of the statue's origins, simply finding it while traveling around the region, suggesting the Vestige visits an acolyte in nearby &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Kragenmoor, the Vestige talks to &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20Raloro\"&gt;Acolyte Raloro&lt;/a&gt;, who is similarly unsure of the statue's nature, but remembers that &lt;a href=\"Haldyn%20Omavel\"&gt;Haldyn Omavel&lt;/a&gt; had visited earlier looking for such a statue, having since traveled to some ruins to the north.\nNorth of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lover%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Lover&lt;/a&gt;, Haldyn, a self-claimed archaeologist, can be found still searching for such a statue.

Their Chitin is prized by alchemists of certain schools (though I would never use it), and their meat has been regarded as a delicacy in some parts of Tamriel, particularly &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy their nature, they seek to defend their rivers, streams, and beaches from what they seem to think is a threat to their territory. They tend to cluster in groups and attack any that come by, fearless, with an overblown sense of their combat prowess. Nothing could turn away the ire of the common mudcrab save for a well-placed strike of an arrow or axe.\nIn my time studying the specimens on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt;, I've noticed an odd tendency in recent months. Where normally, I must tread carefully to avoid their notice lest I am forced to kill the subject, recently, I've been able to make close observations, even so far as to pet the &lt;a href=\"Carapace\"&gt;carapace&lt;/a&gt; without them reacting.\nLast week, I sat in the middle of a clutch, unmolested, fervently noting all the details I tend to miss in more distant studies. However, they are not completely docile. They will respond if directly provoked. I observed as a &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt; tried to pry one open, and a whole clutch came to the defense of their kin, forcing the bear to flee.\nI am positive that they notice me. It's not just ignorance. One even came over and ran his feelers over on my hands, as if he were studying me! What has changed? Is it a breeding season? Could there be something in the water affecting their behavior? Could the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;troubled times&lt;/a&gt; be affecting them? I will continue my observations to find out more."}

It appears as an idyllic countryside, dotted with merchant utopias, fields of white clovers, woodland meadows, twisted foliage, and odd melted-looking places. The air smells of both perfume and rotting flesh, while the sky is blue with cottony clouds, and greenish-gray streaks that stain the atmosphere.\nSecond Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Cyrus\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; once visited the realm in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt; to wager with Vile, who had been given the soul of his sister, &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, by the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;. The wager ended with Cyrus outsmarting Vile, and rescuing the soul of his sister.\nThird Era.\nNear the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Clavicus Vile tasked the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; with returning the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Sword\"&gt;Umbra Sword&lt;/a&gt;, which contained the soul of an adventurer that had dealings with Vile in the past. However, &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, the Hound of Clavicus Vile, foresaw the destruction it would bring to Vile's domain, and attempted to stop its return, as the sword contained a piece of Vile's own power which had become self-aware. Unfortunately, Barbas failed, and the sword was returned to Vile's realm where the entity that called itself Umbra had escaped the sword and proceeded to steal an incredible amount of Vile's power before fleeing to hide in one of the many cities within the realm. To prevent Umbra from leaving with a portion of his power stolen, Vile closed off the borders of his realm, essentially trapping Umbra.\nFourth Era.\nIn the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, a veil was opened into the realm by the Ingenium, a device created by a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;. The veil absorbed power from Vile's domain, which was used to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; from crashing into &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; after the disappearance of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Vuhon forged a pact with Vile, and in return for delivering a constant supply of souls, Vile allowed the veil to remain open. Umbra's curiosity in the veil began to escalate, as the veil began to widen when the ingenium was destroyed. Unable to leave the realm, Umbra decided to cast the Umbra Sword to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Clavicus from trapping him within it. Vuhon was then pulled into Vile's realm, where he met with Umbra. Vuhon forged a deal with him wherein a second ingenium would be constructed, capable of escaping Vile's circumscription,\u00a0if Umbra agreed to spare his life. Umbra then used the power of the second ingenium to rip away a piece of Vile's realm, which was set loose in the Void.\nThis separated piece of Vile's realm contained an inverted pyramid of rock, resembling the appearance of a floating mountain, with an elegant looking city resting at the top of it. It came to be known as &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. The floating island had a unique variation of Hist trees called Um-Hist, which resembled the sentient trees found in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. It was eventually banished back to Oblivion in &lt;a href=\"4E%2040\"&gt;4E 40&lt;/a&gt; by the power contained within the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Despite having regained his lost power, it is unknown if Vile's plane of Oblivion recovered after the ordeal."}

If the survivors are to have any hope of escape, I must drive these monsters back into the sea. Hopefully, the island's defenders will rally behind me.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis walkthrough is written for Normal difficulty. Experiences when playing on Veteran difficulty will differ.\nIn Kyne's Aegis, you will find a man named Thane Ogvar. He will tell you that the island has been overrun by Sea Giants and Vampires under the leadership of a vampire named &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falgravn\"&gt;Lord Falgravn&lt;/a&gt;, and will ask for your help in clearing these beasts off the island. \nHead through the gates to Kyne's Perch. You will be facing your first mobs once you're through; the mobs here require more strategy than just beating them to death. The enemies called Bulwarks will create an area of effect around them that will shield the other enemies from damage; you will have to lure them away from the other enemies. The Tidebreakers like to put their sword in the ground and produce an area of effect that needs to be blocked. The raiders will throw their spears at you, and the stormcallers will produce bolts of lightning that target random players and cannot be blocked. \nYou will have to fight several waves of these enemies as you make your way through the ruined town. Folllow the main path and you will evetually reach the Charred Overlook, where the first boss waits. His name is &lt;a href=\"Yandir%20the%20Butcher\"&gt;Yandir the Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and he has pet Sea Adders and Gryphons. He can heal these creatures if they are too close to him; make sure they stay at a distance from each other. Occasionally, the boss will spawn a white shield around him; this needs to be destroyed quickly or it will deal massive damage. This boss will stop summoning his allies when he is at half health; at 40%, he will start jumping around and dealing shock damage. This boss also likes to summon various totems; his dragon totems will spew fire that must be avoided, his gargoyle totems will turn you to stone if not blocked, his harpy totems will deal fast bolts of magicka and his chaurus totems will poison certain players; stay away from the other players if this happens to you. \nOnce Yandir lies dead, proceed onward into the Span. In this area, you will have to deal with thick mist and lightning strikes as you deal with the mobs. You will also encounter a new kind of enemy, the Shaman, who will heal his allies and cast the same kind of totem seen in the fight against Yandir. These enemies will have to be disposed of quickly. Fight your way through all the enemies and proceed up the path to the Windswept Grove. \nThis is where you will be fighting your next boss, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Vrol\"&gt;Captain Vrol&lt;/a&gt;. The first thing you will notice about this battlefield are the two ballistas aimed at the ship in the background. At the start of the fight, a summoner will spawn on the boat. Later on in the fight, he will be joined by fire mages. These can be taken out by taking ballista parts out of the barrels in the fighting arena and using them to fix and fire the ballistae. The boss himself however is no slouch either; he likes to stomp on the ground and produce lightning effects. He also likes to summon allies; if he summons an apothecary, it will heal him, so dispose of his friends quickly. In addition to that, he will occasionally trap players in a prison that deals damage; said prison must be destroyed quickly by he other players. He will also sometimes summon a storm twin, which is a clone of himself that deals shock damage. Kill this thing quickly.\nOnce Vrol lies dead, continue into the Prospector's Range and continue up the path. The Bitter Knights here have learned Vrol's trick of imprisoning players in damaging prisons; make sure to free players quickly if this happens. You will also be facing Crimson Knights who deal powerful melee attacks, vampire infusers who power up the other enemies and blood knights who create fountains that deal damage in 4 directions. The last horde of enemies before the final boss is particularly tough, as it contains a mix of all the enemies you have been fighting throughout this dungeon. \nProceed on to Falgravn's room to face the final boss. This foe has three phases. In the first phase, it is imperative to keep him in the middle of the room. He likes to create a chain of lightning; players must form a chain between the boss and the wall on the side where the lightning is formed. He also likes to put a lightning area of effect under players; make sure to spread out when he does this. He will continue to use that attack until his third phase. Once the boss is at 70% of his HP, he will destroy the floor and you will fall to the floor below. At this point, the boss will start summoning some of the common enemies you have fought throughout the dungeon. He will also summon balls and things called coagulants; kill these before they reach the ball. At 30% health, the boss will once again shatter the floor and make you fall even deeper. At this point, the fight is rather straightforward; the boss's special mechanics are not threatening here and you can just kill him.\nOnce the vampire lies dead, speak with Thane Ogvar to finish the quest."}

We need to fight our way through &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses and reach the portal to the planar vortex. Only then can we end this threat and save our world.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Citadel%20Must%20Fall\"&gt;The Citadel Must Fall&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; will tell you that they sent in a strike force as a distraction. He will ask you to head on ahead and open the way to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;, after which the main force will follow you. He will then tell you to speak with &lt;a href=\"Hahnin\"&gt;Hahnin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele&lt;/a&gt; about the plans. Gabrielle will tell you that the enemy is using portals to move their troops around, and will ask you to close them. Hahnin will tell you that the fighters guild will come in behind you to secure the line, and that you can bring one soldier with you. Your choice for this is between &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt; if you have not done any sidequests, though other choices will be available if you have done those. \nAfter you have made your choice, speak with &lt;a href=\"King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;King Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;. He will then inform you of the full plan. Your first mission is to close the portals that spawn the daedric reinforcements, so that the mages guild can come in and secure the area. Then you should open the way to the endless stair where the &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Vortex\"&gt;Planar Vortex&lt;/a&gt; is located. The reinforcement portal will be northeast of your location, north of the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Overlook\"&gt;Endless Overlook&lt;/a&gt;. The area is crawling with hostile Daedra, so take care not to get overwhelmed on your way there. You will have to take a long, winding bridge to get over where the portal is; the start of the bridge is north of the start of the bridge to the Endless Overlook.\nThe portal will be guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Gate\"&gt;Guardian of the Gate&lt;/a&gt;, but if you helped the vampires during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Harvest%20Heart\"&gt;The Harvest Heart&lt;/a&gt;,\" they will assist you in killing this beast. Close the portal, then follow the path westward to the entrance of the Labyrinth. When you arrive there, Vanus Galerion will appear. He will tell you that the main force will now strike at Molag Bal's lair while you head into the Labyrinth to find the planar vortex. Gabrielle Benele and a contingent of mages will accompany you inside.\nHead in and talk to Gabrielle. She will tell you that they can't find a way to open the door ahead and will ask you to solve the puzzle. While navigating this room, take care not to fall between the platforms. If you head west of the entrance, you can find a document titled \"&lt;a href=\"How%20the%20Locks%20Work\"&gt;How the Locks Work&lt;/a&gt;\" that will help you along, though you will have to jump down to get to it. It will detail that you need to heat the pipes to open the lock. Jump down from here and you will find a book titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daedric%20Flame\"&gt;The Daedric Flame&lt;/a&gt;\". It will detail how the blue flames in this area work; they can imbue you with energy for a short time, which you can then use to activate machinery.\nHead along the path ahead. If you saved &lt;a href=\"Zur\"&gt;Zur&lt;/a&gt; during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Soul-Meld%20Mage\"&gt;The Soul-Meld Mage&lt;/a&gt;,\" he will be found here, but he will have nothing of note to tell you. Use the energy from the flames to light the cold-fire braziers. You do not need to get close to the braziers to light them; you can fire the blue flame's energy from a distance. Also note that while this place may seem difficult to navigate at first, it is really just one circular path. Once all the braziers are lit, you can go through the door to the next area. After a long bridge, you will find yourself in an area of almost complete darkness. Zur will appear here again if you saved him and will have light magic floating around him; talk to him and he will give you one of his light orbs. The area will still be very dark though, and it is easy to lose your way and wind up where you started. Keep track of where you are going and make sure you continue in the right direction (northwest). Eventually you will reach the door to the next area.\nCross the bridge and head into the Statue Room. There, talk to Gabrielle and tell her you are ready to proceed. Follow her around the room, and you will be attacked by the statues coming to life. There are many of them, but they are not strong individually. Eventually, you and Gabrielle will stumble upon the door to the next area, which is blocked by a ward. Fend off the enemies while Gabrielle gets the door open, then proceed with her to &lt;a href=\"The%20Endless%20Stair\"&gt;The Endless Stair&lt;/a&gt;.\nCadwell and Vanus Galerion will appear here through a portal. Speak with Vanus and he will tell you the battle ouside is going sour; many soldiers including Hahnin have fallen to the daedric forces. He will also tell you that you are getting close to the portal to the Planar Vortex, but Bal will do everything in his power to stop you from reaching it. Head across the bridge. On the other side, you will be ambushed by Daedra, but if you managed to get the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Walkers\"&gt;Shadow Walkers&lt;/a&gt;' help during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%27s%20Embrace\"&gt;The Shadow's Embrace&lt;/a&gt;,\" they will appear and assist you. Head along the path and over the next bridge and you'll face &lt;a href=\"Telkor%20the%20Unforgiving\"&gt;Telkor the Unforgiving&lt;/a&gt;, a strong Daedra with powerful ranged attacks. Once he is dead, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Groundskeeper\"&gt;Groundskeeper&lt;/a&gt; will appear. She will tell you that in order to destroy the planar vortex, you must enter it, destroy the dark anchors there and let shine the light of Meridia at the center of the vortex.\nThe groundskeeper then tells you that she will summon all your allies that still live into the vortex to help you. A dark anchor will appear the moment you enter the vortex, but the Groundskeeper will destroy it, revealing herself to be the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Speak to Meridia and she will tell you that she planned this for a long time, but needed a mortal champion to stop the Planemeld. Your allies will now arrive. Speak with Meridia again and she will tell you that there are three dark anchors here that need to be destroyed before you destroy the vortex itself, or else Nirn would be destroyed as well.\nYour first target will be to the southwest of your current location. You will be ambushed by many daedra along the way. If you have completed many of the sidequests in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, you will have enough companions to easily dispatch these enemies, but if you did not, things will be harder. Once you get close, you will see that the portal is in a place you cannot actually reach, but Meridia will appear and destroy it. You will then witness an interaction between Meridia and Molag Bal; they will start fighting. Your next target is along the road to the north; northwest of where you started. When you reach the dark anchor, you will be set upon by many enemies; make sure you do not get overwhelmed, especially if you brought few allies. Gabrielle Benele and Darien Gautier will stay behind here to destroy the anchor while you search for the focal point.\nThe focal point is along the road to the east. place the light of Meridia there, and Molag Bal will send his council of three elite soldiers to face you in one-on-one combat. These should not be too difficult to dispatch at this point in the game. Meridia will then appear and summon all your allies while Bal sends legions of daedra your way. Meridia throws up a shield to prevent Bal himself from joining the fray while you wait for Gabrielle to use her magic to power up the crystal. After the anchor is destroyed, use Meridia's light to destroy the vortex and end the Planemeld.\nOnce this is done, you will find yourself in what looks like a chapel. Speak with Meridia and she will tell you that all the allies who were present at the final battle are resting in the room below, but that king Dynar has suffered grievous wounds and is near death. He is not actually in the room below, but rather he is lying in the southern corner of the room you are currently in, with Vanus Galerion and Gabrielle standing over him. Speak to Dynar and hear his final words to finish the quest. He will pass away the moment the conversation is over."}

He's convinced that the remains of his great-grandfather, Gratian Caerellius, are at the bottom of the mine and that the East Empire Company has falsely designated his ancestor's death as an accident. He's tasked me with exploring the mine on his behalf to locate the remains, and perhaps discovering what killed Gratian Caerellius.\"\nWalkthrough.\nRaven Rock Mine.\nAfter entering Raven Rock Mine, &lt;a href=\"Aphia%20Velothi\"&gt;Aphia Velothi&lt;/a&gt; and Crescius Caerellius can be seen arguing about venturing into the mine.\nCrescius: \"Damn it, woman! I said leave me be!\"\nAphia: \"Crescius, last time you explored the mine you almost fell to your death. I'm not spending the rest of my days as a widow!\"\nCrescius: \"And I'm telling you that I'll do whatever it takes to find my great-grandfather's remains. He's down here, I can feel it.\"\nAphia: \"That was almost two centuries ago. There may be nothing left to find.\"\nCrescius: \"Just let me go, woman!\"\nAphia: \"Crescius, you're an obstinate old fool and you're going to get yourself killed.\"\nAfter talking to Crescius, the quest starts:\nHello. \"Who in the blazes are you?! Can't you see I'm busy?\"\nCrescius will then give the Dragonborn the unsent letter by Gratian and his key and direct them to explore the mine:\nWhy are you telling me all of this? \"Look, my wife nags that I'm too old to go traipsing around these mines chasing my story. Time's my enemy... it's caught up with me before I could find the answers I'm looking for.\"\nThe Dragonborn can also speak to Crescius' wife, Aphia Velothi:\nWhat were you arguing with Crescius about? \"That foolish old man thinks he's thirty years younger than he is. He's going to get himself killed traipsing around the mine.\"\nThe path heads down until a platform with a cave to the left side is encountered. Here lives a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt; and a skeleton. Further on, a cave can be seen to the right containing some minor loot and a &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;. The path across the wooden platforms leads to another spider. Down the stairs is another spider. Inside the next corner is a fire trap.\nContinuing down the next set of stairs, the path appears blocked, but the wood can be broken. There is an expert-locked &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20strongbox\"&gt;East Empire Company strongbox&lt;/a&gt; on the chest next to the iron gate.\nAfter unlocking the iron gate with the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20Mine%20Key\"&gt;Raven Rock Mine key&lt;/a&gt;, it becomes obvious that the miners accidentally broke into an old tomb, similar to what happened at &lt;a href=\"Soljund%27s%20Sinkhole%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Soljund's Sinkhole&lt;/a&gt; back in Skyrim. The path continues to some water, near which several &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; live. A chest can be found in the left crevice after entering the room with water. The next corner contains a trap. Around the corner and up the stairs, two thrones can be seen in the next room, with a draugr seated on the left one. Around the thrones and through the door at the end are more draugr. They can be killed easily at low levels by using the trap (pressure plate with swinging door).\nThe next room contains many draugr sitting on thrones. To the left side of the room is a master-locked chest. Through the door at the other end of the chamber, to the right, a &lt;a href=\"stalhrim\"&gt;stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; deposit can be found in the draugr crypt on the left. However, this can only be mined with an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pickaxe\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Further down the path is an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; with all sorts of &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, including some added by , specifically two &lt;a href=\"netch%20jellies\"&gt;netch jellies&lt;/a&gt; which are needed for a miscellaneous quest to retrieve five of them for &lt;a href=\"Milore%20Ienth\"&gt;Milore Ienth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurther on is a lightning trap at the place with two torches. Through the water to open the door on the right, the next room contains more draugr, some of which may be &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlords&lt;/a&gt;. Again, they can be easily killed by leading them back to the trap. The archer can be taken care of by sneaking at the entrance and sniping it with a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; because it only stays on the bridge ahead. In the waterfall, a door leads to Bloodskal Barrow. Inside are two urns and a stalhrim deposit with a searchable draugr under it.\nHeading back and going upstairs to the right is a door that must be opened. The button for that door can be found on the opposite side of the chamber. There is an expert-locked chest beneath an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;. Through the door to the left is a chamber with a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; on a pillar. To the right is a ramp with an adept-level chest underneath. There is a lightning trap at the end of the chamber. In the corner of the hall, just past the lightning trap and before turning left, is a chain to open a secret stone door with a chest. Through the already opened wooden door is a walkway with pressure plates just beyond. At the end of the walkway is a door with an adept-locked chest behind it. Turning around, a little alcove is on the right side.\nThe next room contains the destination. Note that, after jumping down, there is no return until the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt; is defeated. After jumping down, the water can be followed to the end, where there is a chest. Afterwards, taking \"Gratian's Journal\" off of his corpse and reading it will give the optional objective.\nPassing Through the Bloodskal Door.\nTo open the door, equip the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodskal Blade&lt;/a&gt;. When doing a power attack, a red beam will come out of the blade. If doing a horizontal attack (done by moving to the side while doing a power attack from a standing position), a horizontal beam will come out, while a straight power attack results in a vertical beam. From the top of the stairs, with the reticle aimed at the\u00a0glowing red fissures found at the left and right sides of the door, a horizontal power attack will unlock a horizontal red fissure. When a vertical fissure appears, a vertical power attack will unlock it. The sections of the walls will alter themselves along with the red fissures; continuing to aim the reticle\u00a0and matching attack directions with the red fissures will eventually result in each side having no visible red fissures left. Now the door can be hit vertically with the reticle aimed along the new, centered red fissure. This will open the door.\nThrough the unlocked door and the swinging blade traps, the lever at the end of the hallway opens a door. In the middle lies a chest. But this appears to be a trap, because it only contains two gold, and approaching it spawns Zahkriisos from his sarcophagus.\nZahkriisos is able to spawn &lt;a href=\"seeker\"&gt;seeker&lt;/a&gt;s to his aid, and can use the master level &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Zahkriisos can be killed by crouching behind a fallen pillar and using the blade's special effect to hit and hide. Having a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; with a bow will also distract him. Alternatively, he can be baited into a tight area, then the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can morph into a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;. He must be cornered so he cannot float over the water.\nAfter he is defeated, the Dragonborn claims his &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; and whatever loot was left in the ash pile Zahkriisos dissolved into, while the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; teaches a word of the &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;. Back at the west end of the room, the exit to the right leads to a stand with a . Reading this will send the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;.\nApocrypha.\nWalking forward (being careful of the tentacles that come out of the water) starts the quest \".\" After completing the quest, the Dragonborn is teleported back to the place where the black book was first picked up.\nReturn to Raven Rock Mine.\nA chest at the left side of the room holds leveled loot. Up the stairs is the door to Bloodskal Barrow. At the end of the passage, activating the chain on the left side opens the stone door. &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;reaver&lt;/a&gt; bandits are present that need to be killed. At the end of the path is a door back to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. All the reavers in both towers need to be killed, in order to allow fast travel. Do not forget the adept-locked chest on top of the second tower. Fast travelling to &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; and returning to Crescius at his house causes him to give a reward of 250\u2013750 when the journal is handed in. The Bloodskal blade cannot be removed from the inventory until the journal is returned to Crescius.\nI've returned. \"You're back! Please, tell me what you've found.\"\nAfter this, Raven Rock Mine will be reopened, which now serves as a large source of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;."}

Can't we continue to learn until we have reached some level of their power?\u201d\n\u201cI have one last story for you,\u201d smiled the Great Sage.\nMany thousands of years ago, long before the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cyrodiilic Dynasty of Reman&lt;/a&gt; and even longer before the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; ruled &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and before there was a &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and when the land called &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; was known as &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, and the land of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; was called &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;, and the only law of the land was the cruel ways of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;, there lived a hermetic enchanter named Dalak who had two apprentices, Uthrac and &lt;a href=\"Loreth\"&gt;Loreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nUthrac and Loreth were remarkable students, both equally assiduous in their learning, the pride of their Master. Both excelled at the arts of the cauldron, mirror castings, the infusion of spiritas into mundus, and the weaving of air and fire. Dalak was very fond of his boys, and they of him.\nOn a springtide morn, Dalak received a message from another enchanter named Peothil, who lived deep in the forests of the Colovian heartland. You must remember that in the dark days of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, mages were solitary practitioners with the only organized consortium being the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. Away from that island, mages seldom saw one another and even more rarely corresponded. Thus, when Dalak received Peothil's letter, he gave it his great attention.\nPeothil was greatly aged, and he had found the peace of his isolation threatened by the Alessian Reform. He feared for his life, knowing that the fanatical priests and their warriors were close at hand. Dalak brought his students to him.\n\u201cIt will be an arduous and perilous journey to the Colovian Estates, one that I would fear partaking even in my youth,\u201d Dalak said. \u201cMy heart trembles to send you two forth to Peothil's cave, but I know that he is a great and benevolent enchanter, and his light must continue to burn in the heart of the continent if we are to survive these dark nights.\u201d\nUthrac and Loreth pled with their teacher not to order them to go to Peothil. It was not the priests and warriors of the Alessian Reform they feared, but they knew their Master was aged and infirm, and could not protect himself if the Reform moved further westward. Finally, he relented and allowed that one would stay with him, and the other would journey forth to the Colovian Estates. He would let them decide which of them would go.\nThe lads debated and discussed, fought and compromised, and at last elected to let fate make the choice. They threw lots, and Loreth came up short. He left early the next morning, miserable and filled with fear.\nFor a month and a day, he tramped through the forests into the midst of the Colovian Estates. Through some planning, some skill, and much assistance for sympathetic peasants, he managed to avoid the ever-tightening circle of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reform\"&gt;Alessian Reform&lt;/a&gt; by crossing through unclaimed mountain passes and hidden bogs. When at last he found the dark caverns where Dalak had told him to search for Peothil, it was still many hours before he could find the enchanter's lair.\nNo one appeared to be there. Loreth searched through the laboratory of ancient tomes, cauldrons and crystalline flutes, herbs kept alive by the glow of mystic circles, strange liquids and gasses (sic) caught in transparent membranes. At last, he found Peothil, or so he presumed. The desiccated shell on the floor of the study, clutching tools of enchantment, scarcely seemed human.\nLoreth decided that he could do nothing further for the mage, and began at once the journey back to his true master Dalak and his friend Uthrac. The armies of the Reform had moved quickly since he passed. After more than one close near encounter, the young enchanter realized that he was trapped on all sides. The only retreat that was possible was back in the caves of Peothil.\nThe first thing to be done, Loreth saw, was to find a means to keep the army from finding the laboratory. That, he found, was what Peothil himself had been trying to do, but by a simple error even an apprentice enchanter could recognize, he had only succeeded in destroying himself. Loreth was able to take what he had learned from Dalak and apply it to Peothil's enchantments, quite successfully. The laboratory was never found or even detected by the Reform.\nMuch time passed. In the &lt;a href=\"1E%20480\"&gt;480th&lt;/a&gt; year of the First Era, the great &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Direnni\"&gt;Aiden Direnni&lt;/a&gt; won many battles against the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian horde&lt;/a&gt;, and many passages and routes that had once been closed were now open. Loreth, now no longer young, was able to return to Dalak.\nWhen at last he found his way to his Master's old hovel, he saw candles of mourning lit in all the trees surrounding. Even before he knocked on the door and met his old fellow student Uthrac, Loreth knew that Dalak had died.\n\u201cIt was only a few months ago,\u201d said Uthrac, after embracing his friend. \u201cHe talked of you every day of every year you were away. Somehow he knew that you had not preceded him to the world beyond. He told me that you would come back.\u201d\nThe gray-haired men sat before the fire and reminisced of the old days. The sad truth was that they both discovered how different they had become. Uthrac spoke of carrying on the Master's work, while Loreth described his new discoveries. They left one another that day, each shaking his head, destined to never see one another again.\nIn the years ahead, before they left the mortal world to join their great teacher Dalak, they both achieved their desires. Uthrac went on to become respected if minor enchanter in the service of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Direnni\"&gt;Clan Direnni&lt;/a&gt;. Loreth took the skills he had learned on his own, and used them to fashion the Balac-thurm, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nMy boys, the lesson is you have to learn from a teacher to avoid those small but essential errors that claimed the life of such self-taught enchanters as Peothil. And yet, the only way to become truly great is to try all the possibilities on your own."}

Speak with her and she will tell you that the mage has devised a plan to shut the Daedric portals. He stole a sacred relic from the temple; you should charge it with the essence of Daedra, and then use it to close the gates. Kill five daedra around town, then use the Fang to close the portal they have been coming through. This will cause all the Daedra to disappear at once.

Your task is to go for the shrines of Jone and Jode to the left and right while she goes for the shrine of Lorkhaj straight ahead. Simply pray at the altars inside the shrines to cleanse them.

Three of them are the major constellations, known as the Guardians. These are the Warrior, the Mage, and the Thief. Each of the Guardians protects its three Charges from the thirteenth constellation, the Serpent.\nWhen the sun rises near one of the constellations, it is that constellation's season. Each constellation has a Season of approximately one month. The Serpent has no season, for it moves about in the heavens, usually threatening one of the other constellations.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Warrior is the first Guardian Constellation and he protects his charges during their Seasons. The Warrior's own season is &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; when his &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; is needed for the harvest. His Charges are &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady\"&gt;the Lady&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Lord\"&gt;the Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under the sign of &lt;a href=\"the%20Warrior\"&gt;the Warrior&lt;/a&gt; are skilled with weapons of all kinds, but prone to short tempers.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;The Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mage is a Guardian Constellation whose Season is &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt; when magicka was first used by men. His Charges are &lt;a href=\"the%20Apprentice\"&gt;the Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;the Golem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Ritual\"&gt;the Ritual&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under the Mage have more magicka and talent for all kinds of spellcasting, but are often arrogant and absent-minded.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Thief\"&gt;The Thief&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Thief is the last Guardian Constellation, and her Season is the darkest month of &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt;.

Those born under the sign of the Thief are not typically thieves, though they take risks more often and only rarely come to harm. They will run out of luck eventually, however, and rarely live as long as those born under other signs.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent\"&gt;The Serpent&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Serpent wanders about in the sky and has no Season, though its motions are predictable to a degree. No characteristics are common to all who are born under the sign of the Serpent. Those born under this sign are the most blessed and the most cursed.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lady\"&gt;The Lady&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lady is one of the Warrior's Charges and her Season is &lt;a href=\"Calendar%23Hearthfire\"&gt;Heartfire&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under the sign of the Lady are kind and tolerant.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Steed\"&gt;The Steed&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Steed is one of the Warrior's Charges, and her Season is &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under the sign of the Steed are impatient and always hurrying from one place to another.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lord\"&gt;The Lord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lord's Season is &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt; and he oversees all of Tamriel during the planting. Those born under the sign of the Lord are stronger and healthier than those born under other signs.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice\"&gt;The Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Apprentice's Season is &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under the sign of the apprentice have a special affinity for magic of all kinds, but are more vulnerable to magic as well.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Atronach (often called the Golem) is one of the Mage's Charges. Its season is &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under this sign are natural sorcerers with deep reserves of magicka, but they cannot generate magicka of their own.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ritual\"&gt;The Ritual&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ritual is one of the Mage's Charges and its Season is &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star\"&gt;Morning Star&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under this sign have a variety of abilities depending on the aspects of the moons and the Divines.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lover\"&gt;The Lover&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lover is one of the Thief's Charges and her season is &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Those born under the sign of the Lover are graceful and passionate.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow\"&gt;The Shadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shadow's Season is &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadow grants those born under her sign the ability to hide in shadows.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Constellation%29\"&gt;The Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tower is one of the Thief's Charges and its Season is &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;.

The discoverer was a nomad wanderer somewhere on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Vread\"&gt;Lake Vread&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Province\"&gt;Province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elswyer&lt;/a&gt;.

All these things and more are the Legendary Baan Dar, he who is called The Bandit God. But what is the Truth?\nBaan Dar, The Man is a much more simple and complex being. I pen this tale as I slowly die of old age and a mortifying &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt; wound. I cannot decide if the truth will add to or subtract from the legend that is Baan Dar, nor if the original Baan Dar would want the truth to be known. Therefore, I will leave this tale hidden when I am done and gone, and let Fate (which was ever Baan Dar's true master and motivator) decide.\nI was a child of 12 Seasons when I first met Baan Dar. Orphan of a Slaver raid during one of the many inter-provincial border wars. Living by my quick wits, nimble fingers, and the grace of Lady Luck in the back alleys and byways of my birth city. I had just \"liberated\" a loaf of bread and a few small apples from a local street vendor in the Bazaar on the edge of the city near the tumbled outer wall, and had withdrawn down an ill-lit alley to feast on my bounty when I was beset by an older band of my ilk. The older and lazier variety which were want to engage in the easier and less dangerous art of stealing from the stealers.\nThere were 5 of the bully boys who had decided they were more deserving of my booty than I, and they were beating me half to death with staves in between bites and laughter at the time. Lying on the ground curled up into as tight a ball as I could manage, trying to protect my head and groin, I heard a quiet voice ask if they were not \"more suited to go down to the wharf and take food from your brother rats, or would you care to try your tricks on game a bit more your size and number?\"\nSince my \"companions\" had become otherwise engaged with the newcomer and had for the nonce ceased thumping, kicking and cuffing at me, I looked up to see a dark shadow of boots, cloak, and chainmail hood leaning against the wall at the end of the alleyway.\nThe others, being what they were, took this as a challenge to their manhood - and easy prey to their superior number with a promise of coin of the realm as added reward (else the first part would have been overlooked). The leader of my band of playmates suggested that the stranger take a leap off the mentioned wharf unless he wished to join me there when they were done with their evening meal.\nHaving drawn chuckles and courage from his underlings, he then proceeded forward with staff at high port. I'm not quite sure exactly what followed, but within a short space of time, Lead Bully was lying in the dirt with a thrown dagger in his chest, number two bully had lost three teeth to a boot (I still carry them in a leather pouch as a keepsake), and number three bully was brought short by his own staff applied forcefully up between his toes (the two big ones!). Bullies four and five thought better of the entertainment and departed rapidly for parts unknown.\nBaan Dar picked me up, dusted me off, and dragged me round to a near tavern where we shared a meal and a mug. I attempted to thank him for saving my life. How can I ever repay this favor, I asked? His reply was short, to the point, and has driven my actions in life ever since...\n\"THE PROPER WAY TO REPAY A FAVOR, IS NOT TO - PASS IT ON INSTEAD.\"\nThings having not progressed well along the lines of health, wealth and welfare for me until that point in my life came upon a sudden change that night. I later learned (along with MANY other things) that Baan Dar had decided to take a direct and immediate interest in me because my situation reminded him very much of the bad start his own life had taken, and the odds he had faced to survive it. On that night he took me under his wing as a kind of apprentice. He saw to it that I learned weaponcraft and stealth, that I learned to read and write! He took me along when he traveled for the next year. I served as messenger, valet, packmule, lookout, cook - many things. I saw other towns, cities, races, provinces, and broadened my view and knowledge of the world far beyond belief. He taught me both morals and coldhearted ruthlessness - and when and how to apply each as the ethics of the situation required.\nAt the end of the year, he gave me good dagger, and decent horse, the 3 teeth, and leave (nay, Command) to make my own way in the world from that day forward - but to remember all I had been given, and to attempt to pass such a gift to another when and where I should find need and opportunity. That I have done, several times... as I assume he has also, and as I hope my various charges have after me (and they theirs).\nThus has the Legendary Baan Dar been seen time and again in various lands of our world at numerous and the same times in days of need. Thus also is the description so very hard to obtain and track - for in truth, there have been, and continue to be, many Baan Dars in the world. The most valuable lesson he ever taught me was that \"for Evil to triumph required not so much that many bad men to do wrong, as for One good man to fail to do what was right.\" We only hope that our combined and concatenated efforts have produced enough single men and women that will not fail to do the right thing, regardless of current local, morals, laws, religion, creed, or lure of coin of the realm.\nThe Legend grows still. Of the Dark Avenging Blade on the Wings of Night that make no sound. The Patron Saint of the Lone Wolf. The Thousand Eyes and Ears, the Hundred Arms direspectful of Time or Distance. Undying, Master of Disguise, Man of a Thousand Faces, Shapes and Sizes, Gentle, Rough-Edged, Gay, Stern. All the Mystery of the \"Man Unknown and Undying\"... not a single man nor God at all, but a string of seeds sown upon the land and left to grow into a forest. How to reconcile this truth with the tales of cruelty and the gangs of \"Baan Dars\" or \"Bandits\"? Some are jealous &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Thieves&lt;/a&gt; who take the name only for the cloak of mystery and hope of hiding in it's Shadow. Others are tales twisted to reverse by those justly served by Baan Dar's unfettered by technicalities of law and custom. Some are backsliders drawn of the true path by temptation and returning to their old ways. Many are the things that any one Baan Dar cannot answer for, as others did the deeds in the same name. Some are tales of fishwives, made up to scare the child into doing what is wanted. Some are left as part of the \"Mystery\" that is both cloak and shield to the hidden purposes - a case where the fear of the tale serves to save the need of arms or action.\nBut, by and large, the true Baan Dar is a string of beings taught to act upon what they believe in, and stand to take the yoke of needed action upon their own shoulders.\nDon't fight if you can avoid blood or war, But if you must make War, do so with all your Heart and Might. Leave it at Threats if Threats be enough - but never make threats you are unwilling to carry to conclusion if required. Use all the arts at hand. But ever keep the true purpose in mind. Stand Tall, but never forget how to bend your knee to help another.\nNote:The rest of the scrolls are tales and tellings of various parts of the Legend, some as passed from Bard to Bard, some as the true tales underlying the Ballads. These fragments are still to be translated and debated. This fragment, however, contains the kernel of the Revelation and the true source of the questions surrounding the Baan Dar Legend. What Say You, Reader? For myself, I do not know... but God or unrelated string of linked souls as laid out here... I do know that Baan Dar IS a force in our Land and Lives, and one that gives Hope to many that need it, and pause to many I despise.\n- &lt;a href=\"Arkan\"&gt;Arkan&lt;/a&gt;, Scribe of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%2024\"&gt;2E24&lt;/a&gt;"}

You can speak with all the important figures from around the Dominion here. Once you are done speaking with them, speak with Kauzanabi-jo. She will tell you what is going to happen: the champions will drink a Moon Sugar Elixir and meet a figure from their past who will help erase any doubts about becoming the next Mane. Your role as Moon Hallowed is to guide them through this journey. After you are done talking to her, the champions will drink their elixir. The third cup is for you; drink it, then talk to either Shazah or Khali. \nAfter speaking with Shazah, follow her through the door behind her. There, you will have to fight your way through visions of &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; victims. Head through the door on the other side of the room, and you will get to witness Shazah's encounter with her guide: her father &lt;a href=\"Ubraz\"&gt;Ubraz&lt;/a&gt;. Ubraz will tell Shazah to learn from her sister, and to pray at the lunar shrines here in this room; guide her to the shrines and pray at them. All three will give you a vision of Ubraz dealing with the Knahaten Flu and succumbing to it. Talk to Shazah afterward and she will tell you that her father was sent to &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt; to help treat the Flu there, but his team were annihilated by it. Shazah was there as a child to see her father die. Victims of the flu did not actually turn to zombies; the zombies you have been facing are the products of Shazah's mind born of her fear of the dead bodies. \nWhen you are done talking, head through the next door and you will have to fight visions of Ubraz's medical team, turned to zombies by the Knahaten Flu. Help Shazah defeat them, then talk to her. She will have learned that decisive action must be taken sometimes and will try to be more like her sister in this regard. With that, return to the Temple Sanctuary; Shazah's journey here is over. There will be a portal in front of the door back to the previous room. \nAfter speaking with Khali, follow her through the door behind her. There, you will have to fight through visions of invading Colovians. Fight your way through to the door on the other side, and head through. There, you will witness Khali's encounter with her guide: her mother &lt;a href=\"Namu\"&gt;Namu&lt;/a&gt;. Namu will tell Khali to learn from her sister, and to pray at the lunar shrines here in this room; guide her to the shrines and pray at them. You will see visions of Namu holding off the Colovians, and getting killed by them. Talk to Khali afterward and she will tell you that her mother led a force to retake Orcrest and &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; from the Colovians, but was killed in the fighting. \nHead through to the next room. There, you will be facing General Quintilius, the Colovian general that killed Namu. Help Khali kill him, then speak with her. She will tell you that despite slayin her mother's killer, she does not actually feel anything. She has learned from this ordeal that it does not just matter who you fight, but also why you fight. With that, a portal will open to take you back to the main room. Khali's journey here is over. \nOnce you have guided both of the champions through their respective journeys, talk to Kauzanabi-jo. She will tell you that it is time for the next part of the ceremony. Stand back and watch the ritual; you will see Shazah and Khali be cleansed by the light of Jone and Jode. Speak with Kauzanabi-jo again hereafter to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20to%20Moonmont\"&gt;The Path to Moonmont&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

But her brother &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; lost and has fled with his mother back to Morrowind, and still Reman has not left her to marry me.\" &lt;a href=\"Gialene\"&gt;Lady Gialene&lt;/a&gt; took a long, slow drag of the hookah and blew out dragon's breath, so the scent of blossoms perfumed her gilded chamber. \"You make a very poor advisor, Kael. I might have spent my time romancing the king of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; instead of the wretched royal husband of Queen &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nKael knew better than to hurt his lady's vanity by the mere suggestion that the King of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; might have come to love his Dunmer Queen. Instead he gave her a few minutes to pause and look from her balcony out over the high cliff palaces of the ancient capitol. The moons shone like crystal on the deep sapphire waters of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. It was ever springtide here, and he could well understand why she would prefer a throne in this land than in Cloudrest or Alinor.\nFinally, he spoke: \"The people are with you, my lady. They do not relish the idea of Reman's Dark Elf heirs ruling the kingdom when he is gone.\"\n\"I wonder,\" she said calmly. \"I wonder if as the King would not give up his Queen for want of alliances, whether she would give herself up out of fear. Of all the people of Firsthold, who most dislikes the Dunmer influence on the court?\"\n\"Is this a trick question, my lady?\" asked Kael. \"The &lt;a href=\"Trebbite%20Monks\"&gt;Trebbite Monks&lt;/a&gt;, of course. Their credo has ever been for pure &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; bloodlines on &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset&lt;/a&gt;, and among the royal families most of all. But, my lady, they make very weak allies.\"\n\"I know,\" said Gialene, taking up her hookah again thoughtfully, a smile creeping across her face. \"Morgiah has seen to it that they have no power. She would have exterminated them altogether had Reman not stopped her for all the good they do for the country folk. What if they found themselves with a very powerful benefactress? One with intimate knowledge of the court of Firsthold, the chief concubine of the King, and all the gold to buy weapons with that her father, the King of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;, could supply?\"\n\"Well-armed and with the support of the country people, they would be formidable,\" nodded Kael. \"But as your advisor, I must warn you: if you make yourself an active foe of Queen &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, you must play to win. She has inherited much of her mother Queen Barenziah's intelligence and spirit of vengeance.\"\n\"She will not know I am her foe until it is too late,\" shrugged Gialene. \"Go to the Trebbite monastery and bring me &lt;a href=\"Friar%20Lylim\"&gt;Friar Lylim&lt;/a&gt;. We must strategize our plan of attack.\"\nFor two weeks, Reman was advised about growing resentment in the countryside from peasants who called Morgiah the \"Black Queen,\" but it was nothing that he had not heard before. His attention was on the pirates on a small island off the coast called &lt;a href=\"Calluis%20Lar\"&gt;Calluis Lar&lt;/a&gt;. They had been more brazen as late, attacking royal barges in organized raids. To deliver a crushing blow, he ordered the greatest part of his militia to invade the island -- an incursion he himself would lead.\nA few days after Reman left the capitol, the revolt of the Trebbite Monks exploded. The attacks were well-coordinated and without warning. The Chief of the Guards did not wait to be announced, bursting into Morgiah's bedchamber ahead of a flurry of maidservants.\n\"My Queen,\" he said. \"It is a revolution.\"\nBy contrast, Gialene was not asleep when Kael came to deliver the news. She was seated by the window, smoking her hookah and looking at the fires far off in the hills.\n\"Morgiah is with council,\" he explained. \"I am certain they are telling her that the Trebbite Monks are behind the uprising, and that the revolution will be at the city gates by morning.\"\n\"How large is the revolutionary army in contrast to the remaining royal militia?\" asked Gialene.\n\"The odds are well in our favor,\" said Kael. \"Though not perhaps as much as we hoped. The country folk, it seems, like to complain about their queen, but stop short of insurrection. Primarily, the army is composed of the Monks themselves and a horde of mercenaries your father's gold bought. In a way of thinking, it is preferable this way -- they are more professional and organized that a common mob. Really, they are a true army, complete with a horn section.\"\n\"If that doesn't frighten the Black Queen into abdication, nothing will,\" smiled Gialene, rising from her chair. \"The poor dear must be beside herself with worry. I must fly to her side and enjoy it.\"\nGialene was disappointed when she saw Morgiah come out of the Council Chambers. Considering that she had been woken from a deep sleep with cries of revolution and had spent the last several hours in consultation with her meager general force, she looked beautiful. There was a sparkle of proud defiance in her bright red eyes.\n\"My Queen,\" Gialene cried, forcing real tears. \"I came as soon as I heard! Will we all be slaughtered?\"\n\"A distinct possibility,\" replied Morgiah simply. Gialene tried to read her, but the expressions of women, especially alien women, were a far greater challenge than those of Altmer men.\n\"I hate myself for even thinking to propose this,\" said Gialene. \"But since the cause of their fury is you, perhaps if you were to give up the throne, they might disperse. Please understand, my queen, I am thinking only of the good of the kingdom and our own lives.\"\n\"I understand the spirit of your suggestion,\" smiled Morgiah. \"And I will take it under advisement. Believe me, I've thought of it myself. But I don't think it will come to that.\"\n\"Have you a plan for defending us?\" asked Gialene, contorting her features to an expression she knew bespoke girlish hope.\n\"The king left us several dozen of his royal &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s,\" said Morgiah. \"I think the mob believes we have nothing but palace guards and a few soldiers to protect us. When they get to the gates are greeted with a wave of &lt;a href=\"fireball\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;s, I find it highly likely that they will lose heart and retreat.\"\n\"But isn't there some protection they could be using against such an assault?\" asked Gialene in her best worried voice.\n\"If they knew about it, naturally there is. But an unruly mob is unlikely to have mages skilled in the arts of &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;, by which they could shield themselves from the spells, or &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, by which they could reflect the spells back on my battlemages. That would be the worst scenario, but even if they were well-organized enough to have Mystics in their ranks -- and enough of them to reflect so many spells -- it just isn't done. No battlefield commander would advise such a defense during a siege unless he knew precisely was he was going to be meeting. And then, of course, once the trap is sprung\" Morgiah winked. \"It's too late for a countering spell.\"\n\"A most cunning solution, your highness,\" said Gialene, honestly impressed.\nMorgiah excused herself to meet with her battlemages, and Gialene gave her an embrace. Kael was waiting in the palace garden for his lady.\n\"Are there Mystics among the mercenaries?\" she asked quickly.\n\"Several, in fact,\" replied Kael, bewildered by her query. \"Largely rejects from the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, but they know enough to cast the regular spells of the school.\"\n\"You must sneak out the city gates and tell Friar Lylim to have them cast reflection spells on all the front line before they attack,\" said Gialene.\n\"That's most irregular battlefield strategy,\" frowned Kael.\n\"I know it is, fool, that's what Morgiah is counting on. There's a gang of battlemages who are going to be waiting on the battlements to greet our army with a barrage of fire balls.\"\n\"Battlemages? I would have thought that King &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; would have brought them with him to fight the pirates.\"\n\"You would have thought that,\" laughed Gialene. \"But then we would be defeated. Now go!\"\nFriar Lylim agreed with Kael that it was a bizarre, unheard-of way to begin a battle, casting reflection spells on all one's troops. It went against every tradition, and as a Trebbite Monk, he valued tradition above every other virtue. There was little other choice, though, given the &lt;a href=\"intelligence\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. He had few enough healers in the army as it were, and their energies could not be wasted casting resistance spells.\nAt dawn's light, the rebel army was in sight of the gleaming spires of Firsthold. Friar Lylim gathered together every soldier who knew even the rudimentary secrets of Mysticism, who knew how to tap in to the elementary conundrums and knots of the energies of magicka. Though few were masters of the art, their combined force was powerful to behold. A great surge of entangling power washed over the army, crackling, hissing, and infusing all with their ghostly force. When they arrived at the gates, every soldier, even the least imaginative, knew that no spell would touch him for a long time.\nFriar Lylim watched his army batter into the gate with the great satisfaction of a commander who has counteracted an unthinkable attack with an outrageous defense. The smile quickly faded from his face.\nThey were met at the battlements not by mages but by common archers of the palace guard. As the flaming arrows fell upon the siegers like a red rain, the healers ran in to help the wounded. Their healing spells reflected off the dying men, one after the other. Chaos ruled as the attackers suddenly found themselves defenseless and began a panicked, unorganized retreat. Friar Lylim himself considered briefly holding his ground before fleeing himself.\nLater, he would send furious notes to Lady Gialene and Kael, but they were returned. Even his best secret agents within the palace were unable to find their whereabouts.\nNeither had, as it turns out, much previous experience with torture, and they soon confessed their treachery to the King's satisfaction. Kael was executed, and Gialene was sent back with escort to her father's court of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;. He has still to find a husband for her. Reman, by contrast, has elected not to take a new royal concubine. The common folk of Firsthold consider this break in palace protocol to be more of the sinister alien influence of the Black Queen, and grumble to all who will listen."}

There were also his ten Totem-Uncles, whose names are too long for ink, but are these in swift: Aldugapadptujenmenhelfnenjaarighuruijleymora, Ghrojarhisysmirirekyetrethaalma, Talochletnoocnenuethethelaldmerysriemaeneynjora, Kjarkaakfajiriutyestrualkethmemvirillichenswalwe, Mnenatmetmoraldumirirekyetrethaalnenjaarighuru, Bjornalijleyyetrethaalmaljarkaakfaltalochletghuru, Mjanorralpaghrohardolwepthuulruelmehykhenharl, Kaejistroonaalmerrisliysmieiltethahldlungalthadnh, Drummersretyaljarkaakfaltalochletgehmoraldukyne, and the Last, whose name cannot even be writ in swift, but you know him. There were his Torc-Nephews, Khaalthhe the Lynx-or-Leopard (this one was more his pet than torc-bearer, but Ysgramor was gregarious and warm), Alabar the Oddly-Colored (his personal Clever Man by blood), Hegm the Deaf, and Bjurl Dahnaorsson who Heard Enough to Let Hegm Know Later. There were his Nieces-of-Snow, Teb the Deaf, Mbjanal the Deaf, Fehg-fehg the Deaf, and Tsjari their Speaker. There were his pets of renown, the Hoagbellows Goat, Bjorga-mawr the Definitely-a-Leopard, Jeorr the Rabbit-Hawk, Heimnelraw the Regular Hawk, Hans the Fox, Fefmem and Gemalleir, the two-headed glow-eel, Dyssl-veb the Bear, whose tusks were adorned in devil-scratch, Dyssl-veb's Wine-Wife Casket-Jane, Gremfell the wicker-what, a creature no one could identify but was counted among the Mighty, Hgmm the Snake, Febhradrneed the Cloud, and Rackety-Nix the Nix-hound. Of Ysgramor's immediate family there were these among the Five Hundred, but he counted among their number and of that of his own hearth his belt, Ysgrim Ysgramorsbelt.\nBy tradition, the Boat-Thanes were allowed to race for the vanguard of their &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, and Morgan the Red and his longboat Drumbeater took the foremost before crashing into the hazards of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%2068\"&gt;1E68&lt;/a&gt;, no souls aboard surviving except for &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf the Dog&lt;/a&gt;, a berserker who had been to &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%27s%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik's Head&lt;/a&gt; a thousand times or more and knew leaping magic. He jumped from the wreckage all the way to Skyrim, landing on Olaf's bridge. He was burnt there for his cheating by the students of &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, which now &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20King%20Olaf\"&gt;happens every year&lt;/a&gt;. Besides his Boat-Thane, Olaf's dead companions were these: Gyre the Old Beater, Grimwelt his Witch-Glass, Stenv Stenvnulson, Jeghwyr and her brothers Fjurlt the Going Grey, Vrolwyr who changed gender on accident, and Deilmark the Master of Oars, the Clever-Man Hguelg the Mumbling, who whipped the sails of the Drumbeater too hard with his mutter-magic, his student Frendlmegh the Kilt (too short for most), his Wine-Wife Shenya Cracked-Casket, Piemaker Maefwe and her cake-uncle Thendjar the Snappily-Clad, the leader of reavers Mjhro-li who bore a three-bladed shield, her Whetstone-Sons Unjor and Hghewenntar and Djaffidd, the whale-addict Gfeful who cracked his face across the ice laughing like a child at fair, the Six Drum quartet, and the oarsmen: Blue Dugal, Ttuj the Driftsman, Einhelf, Amornen and his brother Tefflnen, Gjaarigh, Urul Uruson, Dgaargl who slept through it all, Nenmor Orcsneck, Svir the Unthaned, Saddle-Not the Mule, Hgelhelm the Outcast who once married a snow drake as if no one would notice, Haalj Hgelhelmson (of whose lineage the less the said the better), Crendandel and Hfewl and Nuil and Second Nuil (four brothers who had not talked since their father's death at Sarthaal), and Fvelfrim the Heaven-Scented.\nAfterwards came the crash of the longboat Bloodwood Tongue of Nhemakhela Stare-breaker's belong, no souls aboard surviving. Its loss was grievous and hard enough to break the song out of any flourish, and immediately the Toll-Taker called Gald, Ugawen, Thehp, Naandl, Mjtujjor, Jarnnmegh, Sveinhelf, Nenthwen, Jaaril-ghur, Einmor, Lleymwnnem, Mnoor, Thurwhn, Ghrokarg, Nhsmir, Fire-kin Fhaal, Mjaaloc, Thletnn-li, Bjrochtehl, Nocnenue, Fhethe, Llaldesmiir, Wyndl, Maewyn, Svenredd, Kaene, Einnjoral, Jjarkaak, Nendlfaj, Ciriul, Gwemlthrest, Ruald, Einndmel, Mjuul, Sorshen, Swalne, Njnenya, Thoraj, Frendetter, Rrummrir, Grethnaal, and Swemnen to the Under-Hall some call Hell.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1E%20421\"&gt;1E421&lt;/a&gt;, Ysgramor revised the rites of vanguard and appointed Rebec the Red to lead the return with the Nail-knock, whose longboat counted these Sons and Daughters of Kyne among their number: Rebec's Hearth-Husband Jjauf who shouted out shoes, her Pity-Husbands Korl-jkorl, Heimgrud the Laughing Lake, Njimal, Bjimal Njimalson, and Thalld the Hobbler, found wandering in the forests of Mora with lost feet, who not even Jjauf could help, her Shield-Husband Valomar of the Daggershout, his brother Halomar the Handle-Maker, and their ash-uncle Noaheim who was risen also from the Sack, and her ash-aunt Marthelk, the last two of which bore (the first) Guri Nail-Face, Hgaehmhel, Nbikki the Red, Khalokehl, Ysmehka, Jorgal the Child-Skald, Ghem-fegh, and Dolweppa Heimsdotter, all of which were seen as outcasts from Shor's eye, as dust shall not mate with dust, but Ysgramor's Sovngarde's Plea was enough that they could be Accounted, if only by being ground into the very timbers of Rebec's longboat. And their gathered brothers and sisters were Mjanor, Ralpagh the Red, Rohard the Red, Olwep the Bald who couldn't stand so many reds, Thuulrue Thuulsson, Kaejis, Ntroonaal the Bailiff, Merry Eyesore the Elk, Ysmieil the Younger, Ysmieil Named as Such Because His Parents Forgot They Used That Name Before, Tethahld, Lungalth, Thadnh-eli the betrothed to all &lt;a href=\"Sarthaal\"&gt;Sarthaal&lt;/a&gt; in the manner of the Dibellites, Drum-Maker Haraldmer who was part mer to his sorrow, Ysret the Red, Yaljar who ate a whole bear out of haste because he needed to keep his picnic courtship of Kfalta Lakesdotter going (and she was here with him still but unwed until her tutelage under Chemua was complete), Fegh-let and Lochlet, Gehmora who would never know doom and this maddened her, and Idulkyne the feather-painter. Of the Nail-Knock's Heroes unrelated to Rebec directly were the boat-carls and staghorn-fighters, Taloc of the Thorn-Torc tribe, Hletno who never made up his mind until wasabi, Ocne the Clever Man, Nue his Book-Wife, Thethel the Red, Lundga Aldmer-Eater for she did so, Bysri her sister that once knocked down Ysgramor's belt at the Old Hold fair, Njemae and Neyn, Jora and her younger brother Jorel, Lynx-singer and Clever Kid in turn.\nBehind the bulk of Ysgramor's fleet were the rest of the Boat-Thanes, who are named in full shortly hereafter. The Five Hundred's last few were still in &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Mora\"&gt;Ald Mora&lt;/a&gt; and yet to break sail. These were the Fifty Five Beards of the Broadwall, who gave tithe-torc and swear-casket to their Thoom-Thane, &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt;, born under the strange suns (meaning the sun of Ald Mora and the sun of Merethland) of &lt;a href=\"1E%20208\"&gt;1E208&lt;/a&gt;, and it was his clan that built and broke and rebuilt Broadwall whenever the Nords deigned to sing their return whether forwards or back and they were Vrage's Sky-Wife, Thoom-Sha, the Queen of the Tongues of Men, whose lineage was without end in a language of silent letters and bog-gods that still hide in the moss beneath the previous kalpa and who wore a fake beard everywhere save for bed, and Hwamjar the Bear-Shaper and his brother Hwem, both of which served at the shieldwall of Elhnowhen under the direction of Stuhn, and Olaj Olo the demi-god of Mead, and Jarmungdrung the Hammer who could read rock, and Five-Headed Ysmalos (meaning also Gulgar, Solst, Svon, and Hoomdel), and Gorgos the Greywalk whose stride could cross the perimeter of Broadwall in a the span of a hiccup (a measure of time still used among the Lords of High Hrothgar), and Bhag the Great Debater who would one day be undone by invisible deeds, and Bhag the Counterargument who would also one day be undone, and Fjalr the Fire Trophy, recovered from the void by Vrage his torc-uncle, and &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Harald Hairy-Breeks&lt;/a&gt;, who never looked on Vrage directly for fear of foxes, and Thoom-Hungry Hjeimdal, whose flesh was breaking with his collected shouts, and Baruhk of Baruhk whose paganism would've been disavowed had anyone known its source, and Karkux the Tower of Meat, who even the karstaag-men feared &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; could not eat ever in whole, and Eighteen-Eared Maryx, who listens to all the shouts that predate our dawn and is counted as the king of those mice that the lynx-cats swear fealty to (and his Heroic Ears are these, Accounted: Thirfl, Jhun, Chorj, Penny-Town Pel, Tsmir, Stsmir, Ear Seven, Tark, Herjdel, Aleh-meht, Jhun Jhunson, Orozurhak, Fha-taloc, Doon's Ear, Vrajmel, Tor's Tallow, Khemolech, and Njord), and Haralf Half-a-Casket, whose shouts were drunken and made the snow that heard them drunk thereby, and Fokbar whose daughter will trouble the east, and great &lt;a href=\"Hjalmer\"&gt;Hjalmer&lt;/a&gt; the soon-father of Vrage who left us the 222nd year of these days, and Unn Undershout, long-remembered Idiot Prince of Iil, and Bfehg of the Biggest Beard whose beard covered all others at Broadwall when the hurricanes came, and Thopwil the Swimmer who never knew water, and Ragam the Red Kalpa who held two kalpas one in either eye, and Formdell the Builder who baked bricks in his whispers, and Torc-Minded Tor, a hill-o'-man who gave one ear to Maryx for safekeeping, and Bright Cnechctoth who knew every shape of stone except any thereafter repainted in red, and Jkulgar the Handsome who hid his beard in shame, and Horldrung the Hammerer of the Wounded Roaring, and Idolmaker Khemkel whose urns were made to confuse the Jhunal-men, and Harag the Attack who led the spears of Broadwall in any of its aspect-myriad, and Njarlmuk the Shovel, who buried the Architects of those gone fey, and Bladdermost, the demi-god of mileposts who would make signs on the Broadwall for those that should stay away, and Djemi-thir Unnson the Sail-Maker, whose job it was to ensure no return would suffer delays.\nThe fleet proper included the following Heroes, and they were guarded by the giant karstaag-men who walked the under-ice, the Nine Storms, Potemaic the Wolf-King, whose daughter would be of less height than her father but no less in stature, coming to her own in the nearing solitude, and blue-wristed Telmo of the Wrestling Telmos, whose tumultuous sport caused much upset in the border-makers of the Reach, and the Alehouse Giant, whose woad-markings explained how to build these halls lest some demon make us forget and set us into the ire of a summerlong sobriety, and &lt;a href=\"Jorg%20Helmbolg\"&gt;Helmbolg&lt;/a&gt; with his Coughing that sometimes set the guard lamps of the karstaags into ill record, and Jurg his boon companion whose wind-calling would set it all back aright in calming assurance, and the Chandry-Man with twenty watch-lamps hanging from an icicle-chandelier he held with no hands, and Hogo-o'-Swirls who had been given to cattle-theft until Ysgramor cursed him into indenture (and all Hogo's children thereafter perceived their inherited cow-thieving tendencies differently unto something like a law), and the proud Jhunal-Giant called Mnegmegh the Banner-Lamp who settled affairs with all foreign and jingoistic winds, and Hbolh, Storm Ninth the Name-Caller, whose lamp was lit in loud recitals, and their Crown, Hjal, whose presence will not be explained under &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;the Pact&lt;/a&gt;, for that would lessen the names of the Five Hundred by many times, breaking the genesis of eschaton, and not even Fhalj the Carcass-Mouth wanted that, nor hoarse No-Questions Nidhammer Skald, whose job it was to recite the names and deeds of all present to the un-heroed children brought to ride aboardships with their Accounted parents.\nDespite the swinging lamps of the karstaags, great horns were often blasted from one boat-caller to another to keep the Row of Succession on their proper bearings, for Ysgramor's Gathered have always been an unruly lot, even in make-war time. The first names of the Successor Heroes were these: Vagabond Thane of &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt;, who would always upset those in his wake, and his shield-bearers Fghiul-kul, Morhe, Morhema Morhesdotter, Mtel the Mountain, Korlo the Crevice, and Felji-hoom and Hoomfel, and the six banner-brought daughters of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, named Felki, Grelk, Swimmer-lock, Snow-braid, Bell-striker Bel, and the Holder-of-&lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; who was not yet set against her thane, and the Battlemost Brothers Toad-Capped Thendermah and the Eel-Eared Ghronund, and Jehgmire, Hemf the Fielder, and Jirmoug, Tsek, Malfwe, Svndlkoff the Torcless Kyne-Man, Urysmr, Ffirl the White, Vrendl the Fort, Healkmeat and his hawk-mistress Hgajfwen, their daughter Culecha who looked on Hjal when unlooked on herself, which was seldom for she was fine-looking in every known return.\nThe second names of the Successor Heroes were these: Kilsobrad of All Camps Dunmereth, Djel-the-Diil, whose surname would litter the south, and the four witchmen of Fairhold, Jirlohem, Eloja, Mjolsmar the Smoker, and Hendel Hendson, and once the frontier oars of the blessed longboat &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; were broken, sixty-seven souls were given back to &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;'s keeping before their landing was reformed again to rejoin Ysgramor in Skyrim, known in song as Telhm the Master of Oars, Jwamghli-el his Wine-Queen, Felimyz their lamp-lynx, the high lord of the Collegiate Skalds, Kath Markathson, and his professors, Jirfol the Well-Read, Formu of the rangelands still-in-treaty, Ghemjour and Fehjdwhen, Daarban and Fjork-Stag, Silst and Orl the Flea, Brundhel the Sky-Scribe, her husband Greahj the Monk, and their children-in-dream Greah-li, Brundl Brundsfirst, Hgehwen, Jurldhel, and Wendel-light, and Vrandal's Tongues-in-training, Borthwel the Mace-Biter, Hgul the Weaver, Vhguegel, Naejisl, Neltroon-li, Aald the Candlewick Sweeper, Erris-li, Grunahl the Better, Dlunga the Dwarf (not that kind), Ilthmcnon and his sister lthadnhelda, Rum-Drummer Rselret, Yalj the ark-minded craftsman, Fjaltalo made of marrow, Hjhlet and Gehmor-edda, Ghaldorj the Slave's Whip, Hoegdi and Dehmwe, Vjalor the Knight who would wait in his metal until thaw, Chejor the Twin-Tricked, given to a grief so bitter that even snow-whales would remove themselves from his passage, and Bjorth and Ghilred and Vhehilda and Jkarle the Stoker, Bhwem-li the Succor-Wife of Khel Kehlerson, who manned reef and sail with a face of sleeted scars, and Olagga and Nemweg and Manwehg, and the eighteen oarsmen in chains: Stehn Skelsgard, Tsun's-Folly Mjor, Freckled Ben in exile, who knew of Sarthaal only from Herkl the Shield-Fed rowing beside him, and Arjac and Thendlmegh, Freidlgaard, Nodin Nail-Try (whose face was pocked in a semblance of courage which explains his family's ill fortunes in the Succession), Kjhelknhnel of the Stuttering Tongue, Fjac Welfson, Njacndl Welfson, Hoary Ghonn's Skeleton, an unfleshed rower who no one questioned under the orders of Alabar Kings-Clever, Braadel and Fdedel, who sat behind the stink of Urlfjir Who-Wolves-Won't-Eat, and the triplets beloved by Mara Mora's Wife, Jungarrd, Kjhemger, and Red Relde, who by some contract made these last Heroes even in their chains.\nWith the loss of the Windhelm, Rebec was given leave by the belt of Ysgramor to send an outrunner beyond the range of the karstaag lamps to scout the sludge channels of the Cape ahead for any more trouble. The &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; volunteered her crew, who batted their way south-southeasterly into the were-winds of the Tidal Woe. Their Boat-Thane was &lt;a href=\"Korst%20Wind-Eye\"&gt;Korst Wind-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, who lusted for Telhm's Wine-Wife but was too greedy to pay tithe for her Tent-Hand, and perhaps it was this doom that spelled the loss of the whole. They were Ranalduga the Purser, Padj his Glass-Man, Tujenhelf the Clever who made for them all woad-weird against the eye of the Horned Man, Faern Sargtlin who led Korst's reavers and would forget his place among them all, and Enjaarl and Ighur, and Uora the Witch-Wife of Jarhis (who was sleeping in the ale-ice), Irek the Fanged, Falx the Reefsman, Medoch that watched the moons move awry, and thirty-eight more names whose skins were sent back to the fleet in sacks of hair, and while those names are Accounted it is now only by the howling echoes of lost Hbolhl the Giant, who, after a blight-shaped litany of profanities against Rebec's haste, abandoned this return in his blood-mourning.\nWith his brother-in-karstaag gone, Helmbolg took his leave, as well, coughing out the lamps as he did so, for he was beyond anger now and into madness, and &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurg the Calm&lt;/a&gt; had to swallow its storms lest even the sun went out in the shouting. The issue of Borgasa, &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;, ill-omened, the Broken-Born, then called for a reformation of the Pact, and many of the Boat-Thanes came to his side. Ysgramor could have none of it and the Heroes fell on each other as Jurg and his remaining brethren watched, called the Battle of the Guarded Sun. The dead were these, Accounted: King &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric&lt;/a&gt; and all the crew of the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, including Felmar of Teed, Gjhul-li, Killimjir, Bori Fehdson, Helmudela the Cult Maiden of the Circling Faith, Eingen the Skald, Rejnrile the Daggerlad, Mehga the Mead-Milker, her brewery-cow Cephor, the Four Nieces of Victory, the Twins of New Teed, Fevorl the Run-Like-Hell, Thistle-Song Slekka and her Tusk-Brother Jhan the Compass, and oarsmen Ghemeldart, Undel Bjem, Bjem the Elder, Corlecain, Nelfast, Svenjerl the Hale, Ghurlik the Stripped of His Cleverness, Broken-Torc Deimdel, Jarrolend and his brother Jardrung, Hammer of Caskets, who left his rowing to reaver topside, spilling the wine-hold of the Gore Use and then shouted it aflame, claiming it and all aboard, Lav Larich her Boat-Thane and his Shield-Wife Briin-Willow, and his Hearth-Wife Nulfaha, and his Orc-Orphans Settle-Down, Behave-Ye-Now, Touch-None-Here, Brought-His-Own-Blanket, and Numc the Number-Man, his three Nieces-of-Snow, their Boar Bristleback that once laid low the offal-army of Hirc, Dorald and his Autumn-Wife Kendral of Falkreath, and the oarsmen Juryl the Hairshirt, Ben Bvdel the Wide, Kjurl \"Curly\" Mop-Head, Vendr, Solsven, Storenar, Colhe Mehnson, Count Sthedth in exile, Ukil the Whirlpool, Hghenaard, Evanghl Dunson, and Muurldek who won his love at the Totem-Wife Fair of 1E478. Bagpipe-for-a-Back Hjuro-Gul the Giant (Accounted now that he showed, for he had been summoned long before now) rose from the ice and roared the sixty two souls of the Skin-Greed into Shor's domain and was slain in turn by the thooms of the Ten &lt;a href=\"Tongue\"&gt;Tongue&lt;/a&gt;s of the Merkiller. Reavers and archers and shield-biters were crow-bones by the third serpent-month of the battle, including four from Clan Dire, eight Rye Slaves of Ris, Rhoar the Oak, Ghemgaard the Beaked, Skarb the Haunter, two Wind-Wives of South Mereth, seven berserkers of Clan Gant, a thundernach who was granted hearth rights at the thirteenth burning of Sarthaal, eighteen Arrows of the Scrying Eyes Side-Tribe, and three fighting sharks of the King of the &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; (who was ravaged by his pets renown when he attempted to hunt alongside them covered in ambergris). The last to die was Borgas himself, written in viscera across the ice by the power shouts of the Lord of the Wulf's Hart, and no one gave pity when the monsters of the changewinds arrived to claim their bond on the soul of the son of Borgasa. Pyres-in-tribute delayed the return for another month, but the smoke of the kin-strife had sealed the Pact again, if only for now in shame.\nIt is customary here that the song of return removes the one-hundred and seventy-six dead (or might-as-well-be) from the numbers of the Five Hundred for going to war without Ysgramor's leave, who have become now Unaccounted (even the Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulf's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, who had ended Borgas, and for this he still wishes Skyrim ill). The annual reckoning of the Thirteenth of Sun's Dawn &lt;a href=\"Feast%20for%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Feast for the Dead&lt;/a&gt; allows the skaldsingers to pause for mead and then to hearken the Reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, sent by Shor himself to replace the traitors, and whose number reset the sum neatly at &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;'s delight, for no march of the Sons and Daughters of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; can be ever ended.

(If that's not exactly one-hundred and seventy-six names it's because I'm drunk and everyone here just yell out your names to make the difference, for you were there as you are here and let Shor's hole-shadow beleaguer ye not.)\nAnd now the 500 were reunited, and Ysgramor sent the Four-Score ahead to blast the ice with its varlianced prow, and we were beset upon by the Devils we would rule and lose and rule again, but the Boat-Thane was a sacred Tor-Queen, her skirts and hides covered in southern moths, who made manifest in that coming fight with the crow-headed spirits of the Morag. Aboard the Four-Score were these that opposed them (and won): Aol the Oars-Body, who was mainly made of living Atmoran wood and looked a bit like a maniacal puppet but no one cared when things came to needing proper raiding speed, and Ghemel-Huhn his Whittling-Wife (a marriage type that was made solely for their own), and Wuhlnjar the lookout, and Kalo Wuhlson his son whose eyes had been Cleverly replaced by lenses of Dwemer-make, and Apletnoo and Pocne and Dooir the Devil-Bellied, and Pale Pass the snake-fighter, and Ysmanue and Jhethen the siblings who fashioned their beards as &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt; once did, and Hgil who used a ridiculously-large Totem of Kyne as a club, and Baarl who wore a Colovian Arrow-Catcher even though it was dyed yellow, and the Remanites called D'Arleunce and Jean-Piet and Camorleigh and Alexe, and Umjanor and Ralpag and Old Hrolhdar and Mothol Mothsdotter and Galaej peerless in the Voice who yet vowed never to use it, and finally Varoonaal who plucked the poison darts from the body of the King of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrod&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Morag broken and sent into the eastern slush, we finally caught sight of &lt;a href=\"Snow-Throat\"&gt;Snow-Throat&lt;/a&gt;, and knew that our journey was near its ending again. It was the World-Eater's-Waking that broke shore first, Shouting our victory and doom, whose Boat-Thane was Ysmaalithax the Northerly Dragon, his first-clutch-sons Tsuunalinfaxtir and St'unuhaslifafnal, whose Tear-Jills were Vorramaalix, Jarliallisuh, Alleirisughus, and the Dewclaw Widow Who Foreswore Her Name, whose Void-Jills were Eljaalithathisalif Hate-Fire and Ingridaaligu who lost her minutes in the mending, and Mjaariliaalunax Half-Fire, whose Earth-Jills were none awoke, and whose Aether-Jills were none survived, and whose Magne-Jills were Shanu'ujeneen the Star-Woven and Jaalhngithaax Whose-Name-Stays-in-its-Egg. There were also the twenty-two Thunder-Scaled Jills unbound by time and so served as Ysmaalithax's oracle-oocytes until the Ald'uin would burn them away: Unaalthiigas, Hriimaalixixigis, Kuujhe'elthilax of the Kalpa of the Orsidoon, Ingriidarligar who used her tailclaw as a song, Faajoorliidovahilagar, Ma'aheemi, Sorress'lilargus, Ansahaalifar whose gigantic feathered-crown was stripped from a Dawn Goddess that was eaten before she could fully congeal, Khelsadaalix and Akheelaalix who traded heads daily out of some geas, Vemmaabilthax, Borgaasaalthoom, Nuum'hyetthex, Vashuunaliasthoom, Fraalxshildadoon, Daahnaarlilagus, Mehemeem'yetthex Aththoommua who held secret syllables \"unneeded yet\", and their five eldest, called the Five Eldest of the Thunder-Scaled Jills. There were also Ysmaalithax's ten Shed-Uncles, whose names cannot be heard in the language of Men. There were his Clutch-Nephews, Khaalthaheelodoon the Jill-or-Drake (this one was more his pet than descendent, but Ysmaalithax was expressive and endless), Aalabarliggus the Oddly-Colored (his personal Shout Holder by neck-blood), Hegmaaligus the Mute, and Basdsdajurlahnaor who Shouted Enough to Give Hegmaaligus His Leave. There were his Nieces-of-Clock, Teeablalidoon the Mute, Mabaanaalix the Mute, Feehuugfe'hg the Mute, and Tsjaarlilargus their Chorus. There were his shed skins of renown, the Hell-Bellows Ghost, the Rabid-Thought, Heimnelraaliagus the Regular Thought, Pelinaalilargus the Pragmatist, Fefmem and Gemalleir, the two-headed rhetoric, Dyssle'vehb the Stoic Shout, whose dewclaws were adorned in numantia-scratch, Gremmelfellixl the Elenchus, Haa'gmmel the Logoi, Febhraadrnaalis the Trivium, and Ysmaalthoom the Ar\u00eate. Of those Nords that stepped back onto Skyrim from the World-Eater's-Waking there were these among the Five Hundred, but Ysmaalithax counted that the first was his destroyer, Ysgramor the Returned."}

The fools wanted to pay for stories that would be written anyway, so this one took their gold and questioned no further.\nAfter filling little Zabzag's belly with fresh greens and a night at &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Randy%20Netch%20Inn\"&gt;Randy Netch Inn&lt;/a&gt;, this one packed up to explore the wetlands of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. For two nights nothing more than the common creeping pests came across my path. What misfortune! In all other stories, they found their way across my path during desperate times. How does one seek out such things? Perhaps I, Zabia-ko, was the fool for taking the guild's gold.\nWhile wallowing in misfortune, it was the smell that drew this one's attention. Large flies, with wide glowing wings buzzed by this one's head. &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; call them the \"&lt;a href=\"fetcherfly\"&gt;fetcherfly&lt;/a&gt;.\" It seems a mere pest, but do not be fooled! When one landed on my arm, it smoked, singeing the fur.\nThere was no choice. The creature must be followed so the tale can be told and the gold can be earned. Tracking the creature back to its nest, there was discovered a large rock the size of two &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; (or one Orc, if the Orc tells it). Thousands of the flying fires swarmed the rock, which glowed from the heat, its pores venting smoke and life. Suddenly, the whole nest shifted. When it stood, understanding came on how wrong I was. It was the size of at least three Orcs.\nI dove flat into the rotten mud as the creature of rock and flies began to amble in my direction. This one is no slayer of great beasts! Why must it pick on me? Swarms of smoking insects fluttered around, hissing as they landed on wet fur. Poor Zabzag shrieked and fled. The end of Zabia-ko would be face down in the mud.\nBut, obviously, it was not so. The hive golem must have thought this one was no longer a threat, so it plodded off like an &lt;a href=\"Echatere\"&gt;echatere&lt;/a&gt; with a belly full of snow truffles. This one returned to the inn with many things: a story to tell, a clothes full of burn holes, and mud-caked fur.\nSo if you're ever in the wilds of Vvardenfell, you will wonder as this one did whether the Dark Elves named the fetcherfly because it was annoying or if the word \"fetcher\" came from these pests."}

Generations tried, but the gryphon would never succumb.\nThe foolish thought to net the creatures in the wild, to break them like a common horse. The gryphon spared future generations from their stupidity. More clever tribes of Altmer managed to scale the cliffs and crags of the isle, taking eggs from the nests of absent parents. Alas, these gambits for years offered no flying mounts, for the eggs would never hatch. Some small comfort was found in the great feasts that followed, for these eggs were held to be delicacies for kings.\nOne small clan, in the isle's south, would stand up to the untamed splendor of the gryphon and assert itself. Ulorome, whose line would go on to become the Kinlords of &lt;a href=\"Sunhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;, found an egg in an abandoned nest during a hunt. Thinking it would never hatch, he brought the egg to his tribe, and prepared it for feast by setting it within the flames of his mighty hearth. Singing the ancient songs of hearth and family, &lt;a href=\"Ulorome\"&gt;Ulorome&lt;/a&gt; sought to bless the meal before his clan would feast\u2014but lo! The warmth of the hearth and the gentle singing brought life to the cold egg, and from it burst a fledgling gryphon. So red did its feathers look in the firelight, that it was thought to be a &lt;a href=\"phoenix\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt; by some. Ulorome, crying out in thanks to the gods for such a gift, wrested the creature from the burning embers and christened it &lt;a href=\"Cel-hinwe\"&gt;Cel-hinwe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe legends do not say if Cel-hinwe ever carried his master into battle, but it is known that this creature, the Red Wind of &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; legend, would become the progenitor of Sunhold's famed gryphon line. These two lines are woven around one another, the kinlords and their gryphons, to the point where one cannot be said to exist without the other. The gryphons have in turn been adopted as the heart of Sunhold, its burning symbol of defiance."}

Like most of Craglorn it was settled mainly by those unfit for life inside the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it was a dangerous place, lacking true leadership or even laws to govern it, and constant prey to the predations of bandits and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orc&lt;/a&gt; raiders from &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;the mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly in the Second Era, however, a group of mages led by the illuminated Felix \"Blackcaster\" Augustus, left the comfort and confines of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; to practice their arts in Craglorn.\nCommon myth suggests that &lt;a href=\"Blackcaster%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Blackcaster and his mages&lt;/a&gt; were nothing more than unruly, morally questionable, and undisciplined hedge mages, rebelling against Mages Guild authority. This tale is perpetuated by the lawless element that still lingers in Craglorn. They would have you believe that the mages that first settled in Elinhir were no more a civilizing influence than the bandits who regularly raided the city.\nThis could not be farther from the truth! One need only comb the archives of the Mages Guild in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to learn that Felix Blackcaster was, in fact, a guild member of high standing. His leaving the guild had nothing to do with any disagreement in discipline or practice, but with the desire to set out to new territories beyond the guild's reach. Correspondence shows that Blackcaster remained in constant communication with his superiors in the guild as late as ten years after the Apex Accord was signed by the leaders of Elinhir.\nThis correspondence sheds ample light on the situation Blackcaster and the other mages found on their arrival in Elinhir and the lengths to which they went to persuade the unruly populace to accept their leadership and protection. I will not go into exhaustive detail, but I will summarize. Blackcaster and his mages, intrigued by the sight of the then-empty Apex Towers in the city, had previously pleaded with the town's mayor (he was really more of a warlord) for access to the towers. Having been denied multiple times, they were despondent and about to give up their quest.\nTheir fortunes shifted, however, when Iron Orcs came down from the mountains and laid siege to the city. Using their considerable power, Blackcaster and his mages drove off the Orcs, quickly winning the love of the fickle people of Elinhir. They acclaimed Blackcaster their new mayor and shortly after the Apex Accord was struck\u2014an agreement that stands to this day and states that the mages of Elinhir's Apex Towers will provide protection for the city for as long as the city supports them in the operation of their mages' academy.\nSome have argued that the appearance of the Iron Orcs is not all it seemed. They have even gone so far as to declare that Blackcaster and his mages made a deal with the Orcs in order to win over the people of Elinhir. I find this suggestion both dubious and insulting. Such trickery would have been beneath one of Felix Blackcaster's stature and reputation, not to mention the fact that the Iron Orcs are notoriously intransigent in matters of cooperation and negotiation.\nThe truth is that from the time of the Apex Accord until now, Elinhir has flourished under the guidance and protection of the Blackcaster mages, becoming a prominent center of civilization in the wilderness of Craglorn."}

She will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Elara%20Guimard\"&gt;Princess Elara Guimard&lt;/a&gt; is in these forests, and that she is being kept alive by the Viridian Sentinel, a man with power over these woods. She will tell you that if you wish to help, you should look for them near the lake to your east. \nAt the lake, you will find the princess laying on an altar. She appears to be asleep. Upon examining her, the Viridian Sentinel, &lt;a href=\"Stenwick%20Gurles\"&gt;Stenwick Gurles&lt;/a&gt;, will appear; talk to him and he will ask you to help him save the child. He will give you an amulet and task you with using it to draw energy from the earth to keep the princess alive. Aroun the lake, there are rings of mushrooms called fairy rings; head to these rings and use the amulet there to draw power from the earth. Be wary though, as the rings are guarded by spriggans. Once you have drawn power from four fairy rings, head to Stenwick's hut east of the river. Stenwick has brought the princess there; hand him the amulet and he will use it to create a salve that will transfer his energy into the princess. Apply said salve to the princess and she will wake up. \nSpeak to the newly awakened princess and she will be confused about what is going on. Wyress Demara will then enter and issue a threat to Stenwick; after she is gone, speak with him and he will tell you that the salve was but a reprieve. To truly save the princess, you need a bud freely given my the oldest and wisest spriggan of the forest, and you will need the Wyrd's help for that. He will give you his amulet so that the spriggans will know you are with him.\nHead out and look for this spriggan, the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Voice of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. You can kill a spriggan and follow its spores to the Voice, but this may anger it. If you do this, a green orb will appear from the spriggan and guide you to the voice; she is located at the end of a narrow path in the east of the forest. You can persuade her to give you the bud; if you do not persuade her, . Once you have the bud, take it to &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Demara\"&gt;Wyress Demara&lt;/a&gt;'s camp in the west of the forest. She will talk about how this means Elara will be Stenwick's successor, but will not elaborate on what this means, She will also refuse to cooperate with the ritual, but at that moment, Elara will arrive and have an argument with the wyress. Once they are done, talk to both of them. \nYou will learn that Stenwick intends for Elara to be the next Viridian Sentinel. The Wyresses are unhappy about this, but they will cooperate with the ritual. They will take you to a sacrificial altar, upon which a deer has been prepared for sacrifice. Once the deer is sacrificed, use it to bless the spriggan bud, then talk to Princess Elara. She will ask you to take it to Stenwick at his house. Once you arrive there, you will find Stenwick lying on the floor. He is dying because of how much power he used to save Elara; once he is dead, take his essence and meet Princess Elara at the altar at the lake. She will be distraught at his passing, and ask you to bring his amulet to the altar to hojour him and start the ritual to become the next Sentinel.\nOnce you pray at the altar, you will get a vision of the Voice of the Forest; she will tell you that to complete the ritual and make Elara the Sentinel, you must gather the moted from around the lake. Alternatively, you can choose to destroy the bud and free the forest from the control of the sentinel, though this will kill Elara. If you choose to destroy the bud, . if you choose to complete the ritual, guide Elara through the glowing lights on the lake, but beware that you will be set upon by &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ice Wraiths&lt;/a&gt; along the way. Once the ritual is complete, return to the altar and speak with Princess Elara to finish the quest. She is now the Viridian Sentinel."}

The serpentine &lt;a href=\"Chalass\"&gt;Chalass&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Amronal%20Wispmother\"&gt;Amronal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut unlike these mythic creatures, most scholars concede that Wispmothers actually exist. Though rare, credible reports of their sightings are simply too frequent to be ignored. Herein, a synopsis of what can be gleaned from provincial legends, and the dominant theories on what they may actually be.\nWispmothers.\nMost tales agree on only a few basic facts about Wispmothers. They are always female. They take the form of human (some say Elven) spirits, wreathed in mist and decaying rags. They have an affinity for frost magic, rarely appearing in more temperate climates.\nBut beyond that, the tales differ wildly. Some say they are &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, waiting to be laid to rest. Others, that they are all that remains of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; who once ruled Skyrim. Some say they are native to &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; (or the north more generally), but other tales mention them in forgotten places, on the mountaintops as far away as the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jeralls&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost reputable scholars dismiss these stories, preferring instead to focus on the few documented sightings from recent years. From these, two dominant theories have emerged:\nBased on his extensive research into necromancy and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; culture, Master &lt;a href=\"Sadren%20Sarethi\"&gt;Sadren Sarethi&lt;/a&gt; posits that Wispmothers are a necrologic state, a type of &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;-dom developed by a now-forgotten &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; culture. Under his theory, these are no mere ghosts - they are a cult of powerful sorceresses who achieved eternal life through undeath.\nAlternately, &lt;a href=\"Lydette%20Viliane\"&gt;Lydette Viliane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Synod\"&gt;the Synod&lt;/a&gt; contends that Wispmothers are not undead at all, but rather elemental manifestations arising out of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; itself. By noting several similarities to &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spriggans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, she contends that the Wispmothers are essentially elemental personifications of snow or mist, innately wielding the power of their element, instead of manipulating it through conventional sorcery.\nWisps.\nIn most accounts, the victim is initially drawn to the Wispmother by glowing, ghostly lights. Although initially passive, these creatures later attack in tandem with her, distracting the victim and draining their energy.\nPopular legend holds that these are the spirits of the Wispmother's previous victims. These spirits strengthen her, so anyone hoping to destroy her must first release the souls of those she has killed.\nTo scholars, this description immediately recalls the &lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp\"&gt;Will-o-the-Wisp&lt;/a&gt;, a rare and dangerous swamp denizen of southern Tamriel. Oddly Cyrodilic legends invariably refer to Wisps as lone predators, while these appear to exist in some sort of symbiotic relationship with others of their kind.\nViliane argues that these Wisps are a sub-species of true Wisps, scavengers that lure prey to the Wispmother and share in the psychoetherial energy released by her kills. As co-dependent scavengers, they most likely lack the formidable defenses of their predatory cousins, rendering them far more vulnerable.\nAlternately, Sarethi posits that these \"Wisps\" are merely emanations or conjurations of the Wispmother, and not free-living creatures. This is supported by one incident in which an adventurer reportedly killed a Wispmother directly, only to observe the remaining Wisps immediately perish as well, though the source is considered highly unreliable.\nIn summary, scholarly opinion about Wispmothers and Wisps is sharply divided, and is likely to remain so for some time. But all sources agree on one crucial point: these are highly dangerous foes, and should be avoided at all costs."}

Aranias is already on her way to the Wilderking. To get to the Wilderking, the Vestige must take part in a story. The story is an event from Aranias' past, but she thinks it is happening now. The Vestige will play her friend and influence the person she becomes.\nThe Vestige stands and looks into the fire as Maruin begins the story. The Vestige enters the story and goes to &lt;a href=\"Silatar\"&gt;Silatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAranias is reuniting with her childhood friend before her parents return to Silatar. She challenges the Vestige to a race to the lighthouse. As soon as they get close to her, she will summon thorny vines to stop them.\u00a0\nThe Vestige asks her about the vines she summoned. Aranias is one of two &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; who can shape the land. Her parents forbid her to leave after she smashed a ship with land from beneath it. She says it just happens. She can also feel when the land is in pain, and a farm is burning. She senses there are invaders in Silatar.\u00a0\nShe and the Vestige clear the farm to the east of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. However, she becomes suspicious of the Vestige, asking where they were when her parents tested her and what they want from her. She apologizes for her suspicion when the Vestige replies that they just want to help. They agree to meet at the manor later after cleaning up.\nThe Vestige then hears Maruin ask to speak with them. He is standing in the middle of the path to the north. He reveals that Aranias was \"volatile\" in the past due to her parents leaving her to fight bandits alone. She was bitter and vulnerable to outside influences. He shows the Vestige more of her past, when she discovered her powers.\nAranias made an island and a tree. She shows it to her parents, but they just complain about the wet ground. They disappear, and Maruin reappears. He tells the Vestige to watch the lighthouse story, then help Aranias as her parents arrive with what they thought was her only hope\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore entering the Lighthouse, the Vestige can see the wrecked ship and the island in the harbor. They enter the lighthouse and climb a wooden ladder to the top where they see Aranias' parents get angry at her for wrecking the ship.\nThe Vestige goes to the manor where they see her parents announce they are leaving for Summerset and that she needs training. The Vestge then changes clothes and meets Aranias in the garden. She asks the Vestige to find out what her parents want &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt; to see.\u00a0\nThe Vestige eavesdrops on Estre and &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt; to discover that &lt;a href=\"Andur\"&gt;Andur&lt;/a&gt; can also shape the land and they want multiple demonstrations.\u00a0\nThe Vestige goes to the field to meet Andur. He is standing next to an injured &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and reveals that Aranias is supposed to demonstrate her powers on the Bosmer's wife. The Vestige is forced to defeat Andur when he realises they aren't with the Heritance. He wields a &lt;a href=\"Two%20Handed%20%28Online%29\"&gt;two handed&lt;/a&gt; sword and has a lot of health, but, if the Vestige can keep him distracted with summoned creatures or companions, he won't even hit them once.\nThe Vestige then goes to talk to &lt;a href=\"Salalin\"&gt;Salalin&lt;/a&gt;, the Bosmer. The &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; took his wife, but the Vestige refuses to let them kill her. Maruin stops the Vestige on the way back to the party. In real life, Andur became very dangerous. The Heritance sent him to make sure Aranias kills the Wilderking or die if she fails.\nThe Vestige sees Aranias trap the Bosmer woman at Estre's command, but she hesitates when Estre tells her to kill the woman. While talking with the Vestige, Aranias decides to trust herself to make the right decision.

It was full of odd trees and murky water. When I asked a local what this place was, he said \"This is the Hag Fens. A swamp, as anyone with eyes can plainly see.\" I asked what I might find within, if I were to explore these Fens. The fellow responded rather tersely, \"Hags, you git. Why do you think we call it that?\" (I do enjoy speaking to the natives. It always adds an element of raw authenticity to my travels.)\nWhen pressed to explain about the hags, the local told me that they are some sort of witch. Exciting news! I like researching the different ways that &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; is employed across the land. I asked the taciturn fellow where I might find the ladies of the swamp and he made a rather rude noise. \"If ye're fool enough to go looking for the 'ladies,' as you call them, then head to the North Fens. Maybe they'll invite you to tea.\" Locals are always leery of those that use magic, but I am sure the swamp witches would welcome some scholarly discussion.\nI found the area of the Fens where the hags dwell. Unfortunately, I lost one boot, my walking stick, and one of my packs to the rather aggressive crocodiles that also call these fens home. But I can see some of the tree dwellings that I believe belong to the hags nearby. I have been observing from my hiding place behind a small shrub. My notes forthwith:\nHags have some strange deformity and rely on a walking staff to get around.\nThe hags appear rather unkempt and are obviously old.\nHags apparently use materials found in these Fens to craft attire that is rather rustic.\nThere are a group of younger, prettier witches who do not abide with the elderly hags.\nHags must send their menfolk off to work, as I have observed no male hags up to this point. Perhaps the males dwell in a separate camp? Note: Ask hags about their menfolk.\nOne of the hags nearest my observation post seems to be cooking something in a rather large cauldron. A bit of hot stew and a cup of tea would be welcome after my mishaps in the swampy fens. I shall approach slowly, so as not to startle the elderly lady.\n\u2014 Notation from &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Galliane\"&gt;Wyress Galliane&lt;/a&gt;:\nWe found a rather tattered &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; crawling out of the fens. He had barely survived an encounter with the hags and a &lt;a href=\"crocodile\"&gt;crocodile&lt;/a&gt; or two. He was delirious and kept begging for tea and stew. We healed him and sent him on his way, although not before he attempted to proposition nearly every wyress in our camp. He left some of his notes, which we have preserved, though his complete lack of wit with regard to local creatures and customs, and his absurd observation skills, do not bode well for him surviving another journey."}

Upon approaching the Ghost, he will say:\n\"Oh! You're here to climb the tower? Just keep in mind you will find what you need for each puzzle on the same floor. Don't go running up and down stairs wondering where to go. Just keep looking. In exchange for that info, please, don't be too rough with my friends. They're supposed to slow you down, but they're not really fighters.

You found it, give it here. You can have whatever's in this room as a reward. See you again later, I hope? Oh, and if you see my daughter &lt;a href=\"Greidil%20Horse-Mouth\"&gt;Greidil&lt;/a&gt;, tell her I said hello.\"\"\nHe opens a room containing a Gold Chest along with other loot, commencing the end of the quest."}

Her name was &lt;a href=\"Quintilla\"&gt;Quintilla&lt;/a&gt;, the most beauteous princess in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, skilled at all the maidenly skills and an accomplished sorceress.\nEleven years a widower with a young son named &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;, Pelagius arrived at court to find that the city-state was being terrorized by a great demon &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of wooing, Pelagius and Quintilla together went out to save the kingdom. With his sword and her sorcery, the beast was slain and by the powers of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, Quintilla chained the beast's soul to a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius had the gem made into a ring and married her.\nBut it was said that the soul of the wolf stayed with the couple until the birth of their first child.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%2080\"&gt;Year 3E 80&lt;/a&gt;\n\"The ambassador from &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, your majesty,\" whispered the steward &lt;a href=\"Balvus\"&gt;Balvus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Right in the middle of dinner?\" muttered the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; weakly. \"Tell him to wait.\"\n\"No, father, it's important that you see him,\" said Pelagius, rising. \"You can't make him wait and then give him bad news. It's undiplomatic.\"\n\"Don't go then, you're much better at diplomacy than I am. We should have all the family here,\" Emperor Uriel II added, suddenly aware how few people were present at his dinner table. \"Where's your mother?\"\n\"Sleeping with the archpriest of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;,\" Pelagius would have said, but he was, as his father said, diplomatic. Instead he said, \"At prayer.\"\n\"And your brother and sister?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Septim\"&gt;Amiel&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Galana%20Septim\"&gt;Galana&lt;/a&gt;, though we won't be telling this to the ambassador, of course, is preparing for her wedding to the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;. Since the ambassador expects her to be marrying his patron the King of Solitude instead, we'll tell him that she's at the spa, having a cluster of pestilent boils removed. Tell him that, and he won't press too hard for the marriage, politically expedient though it may be,\" Pelagius smiled. \"You know how queasy &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; are about warty women.\"\n\"But dash it, I feel like I should have some family around, so I don't look like some old fool despised by his nearest and dearest,\" growled the Emperor, correctly suspecting this to be the case. \"What about your wife? Where's she and the grandchildren?\"\n\"Quintilla's in the nursery with &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. Antiochus is probably whoring around the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;City&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know where &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt; is, probably at her studies. I thought you didn't like children around.\"\n\"I do during meetings with ambassadors in damp staterooms,\" sighed the Emperor. \"They lend an air of, I don't know, innocence and civility. Ah, show the blasted ambassador in,\" he said to Balvus.\nPotema was bored. It was the rainy season in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt;, wintertide, and the streets and the gardens of the City were all flooded. She could not remember a time when it was not raining. Had it been only days, or had it been weeks or months since the sun shone? There was no judging of time any more in the constant flickering torch-light of the palace, and as Potema walked through marble and stone hallways, listening to the pelting of the rain, she could think nothing but that she was bored.\n&lt;a href=\"Asthephe\"&gt;Asthephe&lt;/a&gt;, her tutor, would be looking for her now. Ordinarily, she did not mind studying. Rote memorization came easily to her. She quizzed herself as she walked down through the empty ballroom. When did &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; fall? &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;Year 1E 980&lt;/a&gt;. Who wrote &lt;a href=\"Tamrilean%20Tractates\"&gt;Tamrilean Tractates&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=\"Khosey\"&gt;Khosey&lt;/a&gt;. When was Tiber Septim born? .

Who is the current &lt;a href=\"The%20Silvenar\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=\"Varbarenth\"&gt;Varbarenth&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Varbaril\"&gt;Varbaril&lt;/a&gt;. Who is the Warlord of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;? Trick question: it's a lady, &lt;a href=\"Ioa\"&gt;Ioa&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat will I get if I'm a good girl, and don't get into any trouble, and my tutor says I'm an excellent student? Mother and father will renege on their promise to buy me a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; of my own, saying they never remembered that promise, and it's far too expensive and dangerous for a girl my age.\nThere were voices coming from the Emperor's stateroom. Her father, her grandfather, and a man with a strange accent, a Nord. Potema moved a stone she had loosened behind a tapestry and listened in.\n\"Let us be frank, your &lt;a href=\"imperial\"&gt;imperial&lt;/a&gt; majesty,\" came the Nord's voice. \"My sire, the King of Solitude, doesn't care if Princess Galana looked like an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;. He wants an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Imperial Family&lt;/a&gt;, and you agreed to give him Galana or give back the millions of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; he gave to you to quell the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;. This was the agreement you swore to honor.\"\n\"I remember no such agreement,\" came her father's voice, \"Can you, my liege?\"\nThere was a mumbling noise that Potema took to be her grandfather, the ancient Emperor.\n\"Perhaps we should take a walk to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Records\"&gt;Hall of Records&lt;/a&gt;, my mind may be going,\" the Nord's voice sounded sarcastic. \"I distinctly remember your seal being placed on the agreement before it was locked away. Of course, I may verily be mistaken.\"\n\"We will send a page to the Hall to get the document you refer to,\" replied her father's voice, with the cruel, soothing quality he used whenever he was about to break a promise. Potema knew it well. She replaced the loose stone and hurried out of the ballroom. She knew well how slowly the pages walked, used to running errands for a doddering Emperor. She could make it to the Hall of Records in no time at all.\nThe massive Ebony door was locked, of course, but she knew what to do. A year ago, she caught her mother's &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; maid pilfering some &lt;a href=\"jewelry\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, and in exchange for her silence, forced the young woman to teach her how to &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;pick locks&lt;/a&gt;. Potema pulled two pins off her red &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; broach and slid the first into the first lock, holding her hand steady, and memorizing the pattern of tumblers and grooves within the mechanism.\nEach lock had a geography of its own.\nThe lock to the kitchen larder: six free tumblers, a frozen seventh, and a counter bolt. She had broken into that just for fun, but if she had been a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;poisoner&lt;/a&gt;, the whole Imperial household would be dead by now, she thought, smiling.\nThe lock to her brother Antiochus' secret stash of Khajiiti pornography: just two free tumblers and a pathetic poisoned quill trap easily dismantled with pressure on the counterweight. That had been a profitable score. It was strange that Antiochus, who seemed to have no shame, proved so easy to blackmail. She was, after all, only twelve, and the differences between the perversions of the cat people and the perversions of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;s seemed pretty academic. Still, Antiochus had to give her the diamond broach, which she treasured.\nShe had never been caught. Not when she broke into the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;archmage's&lt;/a&gt; study and stole his oldest &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt;. Not when she broke into the guest room of the King of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, and stole his crown the morning before Magnus's official Welcoming ceremony. It had become too easy to torment her family with these little crimes. But here was a document the Emperor wanted, for a very important meeting. She would get it first.\nBut this, this was the hardest lock she ever opened. Over and over, she massaged the tumblers, gently pushing aside the forked clamp that snatched at her pins, drumming the counterweights. It nearly took her a half a minute to break through the door to the Hall of Records, where the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; were housed.\nThe documents were well organized by year, province, and kingdom, and it took Potema only a short while to find the &lt;a href=\"Promise%20of%20Marriage\"&gt;Promise of Marriage&lt;/a&gt; between Uriel Septim II, by the Grace of the Gods, Emperor of the Holy Cyrodiilic &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel and his daughter the Princess Galana, and His Majesty &lt;a href=\"King%20Mantiarco\"&gt;King Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude. She grabbed her prize and was out of the Hall with the door well-locked before the page was even in sight.\nBack in the ball room, she loosened the stone and listened eagerly to the conversation within. For a few minutes, the three men, the Nord, the Emperor, and her father just spoke of the weather and some boring diplomatic details. Then there was the sound of footsteps and a young voice, the page.\n\"Your Imperial Majesty, I have searched the Hall of Records and cannot find the document you asked for.\"\n\"There, you see,\" came Potema's father's voice. \"I told you it didn't exist.\"\n\"But I saw it!\" The Nord's voice was furious. \"I was there when my liege and the Emperor signed it! I was there!\"\n\"I hope you aren't doubting the word of my father, the sovereign Emperor of all Tamriel, not when there's now proof that you must have been ... mistaken,\" Pelagius's voice was low, dangerous.\n\"Of course not,\" said the Nord, conceding quickly. \"But what will I tell my king? He is to have no connection with the Imperial Family, and no gold returned to him, as the agreement \u2014 as he and I believed the agreement to be?\"\n\"We don't want any bad feelings between the kingdom of Solitude and us,\" came the Emperor's voice, rather feeble, but clear enough. \"What if we offered King Mantiarco our granddaughter instead?\"\nPotema felt the chill of the room descend on her.\n\"The Princess Potema? Is she not too young?\" asked the Nord.\n\"She is thirteen years old,\" said her father. \"That's old enough to wed.\"\n\"She would be an ideal mate for your king,\" said the Emperor. \"She is, admittedly, from what I see of her, very shy and innocent, but I'm certain she would quickly grasp the ways of court \u2014 she is, after all, a Septim. I think she would be an excellent Queen of Solitude. Not too exciting, but noble.\"\n\"The granddaughter of the Emperor is not as close as his daughter,\" said the Nord, rather miserably. \"But I don't see how we can refuse the offer. I will send word to my king.\"\n\"You have our leave,\" said the Emperor, and Potema heard the sound of the Nord leaving the stateroom.\nTears streamed down Potema's eyes. She knew who the King of Solitude was from her studies. Mantiarco. Sixty-two years old, and quite fat. And she knew how far Solitude was, and how cold, in the northernmost clime. Her father and grandfather were abandoning her to the barbaric Nords. The voices in the room continued talking.\n\"Well-acted, my boy. Now, make sure you burn that document,\" said her father.\n\"My Prince?\" asked the page's querulous voice.\n\"The agreement between the Emperor and the King of Solitude, you fool. We don't want its existence known.\"\n\"My Prince, I told the truth. I couldn't find the document in the Hall of Records. It seems to be missing.\"\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;!\" roared her father. \"Why is everything in this palace always misplaced? Go back to the Hall and keep searching until you find it!\"\nPotema looked at the document. Millions of gold pieces promised to the kingdom of Solitude in the event of Princess Galana not marrying the king. She could bring it into her father, and perhaps as a reward he would not marry her to Mantiarco. Or perhaps not. She could blackmail her father and the Emperor with it, and make a tidy sum of money. Or she could produce it when she became Queen of Solitude to fill her coffers, and buy anything she wanted. More than a Daedric katana, that was for certain.\nSo many possibilities, Potema thought. And she found herself not bored anymore."}

His son &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt; was made the Emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management.\nAs the new Queen of Solitude, Potema faced opposition from the old &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic houses, who viewed her as an outsider. Mantiarco had been widowed, and his former queen was loved. She had left him a son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Bathorgh\"&gt;Prince Bathorgh&lt;/a&gt;, who was two years older than his stepmother, and loved her not. But the king loved his queen, and suffered with her through miscarriage after miscarriage, until her 29th year, when she bore him a son.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%2097\"&gt;3E 97&lt;/a&gt;\n\"You must do something to help the pain!\" Potema cried, baring her teeth. The healer &lt;a href=\"Kelmeth\"&gt;Kelmeth&lt;/a&gt; immediately thought of a she-wolf in labor, but he put the image from his mind. Her enemies called her the Wolf Queen for certes, but not because of any physical resemblance.\n\"Your Majesty, there is no injury for me to heal. The pain you feel is natural and helpful for the birth,\" he was going to add more words of consolation, but he had to break off to duck the mirror she flung at him.\n\"I'm not a pig-nosed peasant girl!\" She snarled, \"I am the Queen of Solitude, daughter of the Emperor! Summon the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;! I'll trade the &lt;a href=\"Souls\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; of every last subject of mine for a little comfort!\"\n\"My Lady,\" said the healer nervously, drawing the curtains and blotting out the cold morning sun. \"It is not wise to make such offers even in jest. The eyes of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; are forever watching for just such a rash interjection.\"\n\"What would you know of Oblivion,\u00a0healer?\" she growled, but her voice was calmer, quieter. The pain had relaxed. \"Would you fetch me that mirror I hurled at you?\"\n\"Are you going to throw it again, your Majesty?\" said the healer with a taut smile, obeying her.\n\"Very likely,\" she said, looking at her reflection. \"And next time I won't miss. But I do look a fright. Is &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; still waiting for me in the hall?\"\n\"Yes, your Majesty.\"\n\"Well, tell him I just need to fix my hair and I'll be with him. And leave us. I'll howl for you when the pain returns.\"\n\"Yes, your Majesty.\"\nA few minutes later, Lord Vhokken was shown into the chamber. He was an enormous bald man whose friends and enemies called Mount Vhokken, and when he spoke it was with the low grumble of thunder. The Queen was one of the very few people Vhokken knew who was not the least bit intimidated by him, and he offered her a smile.\n\"My queen, how are you feeling?\" he asked.\n\"Damned. But you're looking like Springtide has come to Mount Vhokken. I take it from your merry disposition that you've been made warchief.\"\n\"Only temporarily, while your husband the King investigates whether there is evidence behind the rumors of treason on the part of my predecessor &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thone\"&gt;Lord Thone&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"If you've planted it as I've instructed, he'll find it,\" Potema smiled, propping herself up in the bed. \"Tell me, is &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Bathorgh\"&gt;Prince Bathorgh&lt;/a&gt; still in the city?\"\n\"What a question, your highness,\" laughed the mountain. \"It's the &lt;a href=\"Tournament%20of%20Stamina\"&gt;Tournament of Stamina&lt;/a&gt; today, you know the Prince would never miss that. The fellow invents new strategies of self-defense every year to show off during the games. Don't you recall last year, where he entered the ring unarmored and after twenty minutes of fending off six bladesmen, left the games without a scratch? He dedicated that bout to his late mother, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Amodetha\"&gt;Queen Amodetha&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Yes, I recall.\"\n\"He's no friend to me or you, your highness, but you must give the man his due respect. He moves like lightning. You wouldn't think it of him, but he always seems to use his awkwardness to his advantage, to throw his opponents off. Some say he learned the style from the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; to the south. They say he learned from them how to anticipate a foe's attack by some sort of supernatural power.\"\n\"There's nothing supernatural about it,\" said the Queen, quietly. \"He gets it from his father.\"\n\"Mantiarco never moved like that,\" Vhokken chuckled.\n\"I never said he did,\" said Potema. Her eyes closed and her teeth gritted together. \"The pain's returning. You must fetch the healer, but first, I must ask you one other thing -- has the new summer palace construction begun?\"\n\"I think so, your Highness.\"\n\"Do not think!\" she cried, gripping the sheets, biting her lips so a stream of blood dripped down her chin. \"Do! Make certain that the construction begins at once, today! Your future, my future, and the future of this child depend on it! Go!\"\nFour hours later, King Mantiarco entered the room to see his son. His queen smiled weakly as he gave her a kiss on the forehead. When she handed him the child, a tear ran down his face. Another one quickly followed, and then another.\n\"My Lord,\" she said fondly. \"I know you're sentimental, but really!\"\n\"It's not only the child, though he is beautiful, with all the fair features of his mother,\" Mantiarco turned to his wife, sadly, his aged features twisted in agony. \"My dear wife, there is trouble at the palace. In truth, this birth is the only thing that keeps this day from being the darkest in my reign.\"\n\"What is it? Something at the tournament?\" Potema pulled herself up in bed. \"Something with Bathorgh?\"\n\"No, it's isn't the tournament, but it does relate to Bathorgh. I shouldn't worry you at a time like this. You need your rest.\"\n\"My husband, tell me!\"\n\"I wanted to surprise you with a gift after the birth of our child, so I had the old summer palace completely renovated. It's a beautiful place, or at least it was. I thought you might like it. Truth to tell, it was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; idea. It used to be &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Amodetha\"&gt;Amodetha's&lt;/a&gt; favorite place.\" Bitterness crept into the king's voice. \"Now I've learned why.\"\n\"What have you learned?\" asked Potema quietly.\n\"Amodetha deceived me there, with my trusted warchief, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thone\"&gt;Lord Thone&lt;/a&gt;. There were letters between them, the most perverse things you've ever read. And that's not the worst of it.\"\n\"No?\"\n\"The dates on the letters correspond with the time of Bathorgh's birth. The boy I raised and loved as a son,\" Mantiarco's voice choked up with emotion. \"He was Thone's child, not mine.\"\n\"My darling,\" said Potema, almost feeling sorry for the old man. She wrapped her arms around his neck, as he heaved his sobs down on her and their child.\n\"Henceforth,\" he said quietly. \"Bathorgh is no longer my heir. He will be banished from the kingdom. This child you have borne me today will grow to rule &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"And perhaps more,\" said Potema. \"He is the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; grandson as well.\"\n\"We will name him Mantiarco the Second.\"\n\"My darling, I would love that,\" said Potema, kissing the king's tear-streaked face. \"But may I suggest &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, after my grandfather the Emperor, who brought us together in marriage?\"\nKing Mantiarco smiled at his wife and nodded his head. There was a knock at the door.\n\"My liege,\" said Mount Vhokken. \"His highness Prince Bathorgh has finished the tournament and awaits you to present his award. He has successfully withstood attacks by nine archers and the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Scorpion\"&gt;giant scorpion&lt;/a&gt; we brought in from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The crowd is roaring his name. They are calling him The Man Who Cannot Be Hit.\"\n\"I will see him,\" said King Mantiarco sadly, and left the chamber.\n\"Oh he can be hit, all right,\" said Potema wearily. \"But it does take some doing.\""}

He had ruled over a difficult seventeen years. In order to fill the bankrupt treasury, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; had dismissed the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, forcing them to buy back their positions. Several good but poor councilors had been lost. Many say the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; had died as a result of being poisoned by a vengeful former Council member.\nHis children came to attend his funeral and the coronation of the next Emperor. His youngest son Prince &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, 19 years of age, arrived from &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, where he had been a councilor to the royal court. 21-year-old Prince &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; arrived from &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; bride, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bianki\"&gt;Queen Bianki&lt;/a&gt;. Prince &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt; at 43 years of age, the eldest child and heir presumptive, had been with his father in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The last to appear was his only daughter, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, the so-called Wolf Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. Thirty years old and radiantly beautiful, she arrived with a magnificent entourage, accompanied by her husband, the elderly King &lt;a href=\"Mantiarco\"&gt;Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt; and her year-old son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll expected Antiochus to assume the throne of the Empire, but no one knew what to expect from the Wolf Queen.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%2099\"&gt;Year 3E 99&lt;/a&gt;\n\"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; has been bringing several men to your sister's chambers late at night every night this week,\" offered the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Spymaster&lt;/a&gt;. \"Perhaps if her husband were made aware --\"\n\"My sister is a devotee of the conqueror gods &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, not the love goddess &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. She is plotting with those men, not having orgies with them. I'd wager I've slept with more men than she has,\" laughed Antiochus, and then grew serious. \"She's behind the delay of the council offering me the crown, I know it. Six weeks now. They say they need to update records and prepare for the coronation. I'm the Emperor! Crown me, and to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; with the formalities!\"\n\"Your sister is surely no friend of yours, your majesty, but there are other factors at play. Do not forget how your father treated the Council. It is they who need following, and if need be, strong convincing,\" The Spymaster added, with a suggestive stab of his &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Do so, but keep your eye on the damnable Wolf Queen as well. You know where to find me.\"\n\"At which brothel, your highness?\" inquired the Spymaster.\n\"Today being &lt;a href=\"Day\"&gt;Fredas&lt;/a&gt;, I'll be at the &lt;a href=\"Cat%20and%20Goblin\"&gt;Cat and Goblin&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe Spymaster noted in his report that night that Queen Potema had no visitors, for she was dining across the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Garden\"&gt;Imperial Garden&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; with her mother, the Dowager Empress &lt;a href=\"Quintilla\"&gt;Quintilla&lt;/a&gt;. It was a warm night for wintertide and surprisingly cloudless though the day had been stormy. The saturated ground could not take any more, so the formal, structured gardens looked as if they had been glazed with water. The two women took their wine to the wide balcony to look over the grounds.\n\"I believe you are trying to sabotage your half-brother's coronation,\" said Quintilla, not looking at her daughter. Potema saw how the years had not so much wrinkled her mother as faded her, like the sun on a stone.\n\"It's not true,\" said Potema. \"But would it bother you very much if it were true?\"\n\"Antiochus is not my son. He was eleven years old when I married your father, and we've never been close. I think that being heir presumptive has stunted his growth. He is old enough to have a family with grown children, and yet he spends all his time at debauchery and fornication. He will not make a very good Emperor,\" Quintilla sighed and then turned to Potema. \"But it is bad for the family for seeds of discontent to be sown. It is easy to divide up into factions, but very difficult to unite again. I fear for the future of the Empire.\"\n\"Those sound like the words -- are you, by any chance, dying, mother?\"\n\"I've read the omens,\" said Quintilla with a faint, ironic smile. \"Don't forget -- I was a renowned sorceress in &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. I will be dead in a few months time, and then, not a year later, your husband will die. I only regret that I will not live to see your child Uriel assume the throne of Solitude.\"\n\"Have you seen whether --\" Potema stopped, not wanting to reveal too many of her plans, even to a dying woman.\n\"Whether he will be Emperor? Aye, I know the answer to that too, daughter. Don't fear: you'll live to see the answer, one way or the other. I have a gift for him when he is of age,\" The Dowager Empress removed a necklace with a single great yellow gem from around her neck. \"It's a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, infused with the spirit of a great werewolf your father and I defeated in battle thirty-six years ago. I've enchanted it with spells from the &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;School of Illusion&lt;/a&gt; so its wearer may charm whoever he choses. An important skill for a king.\"\n\"And an Emperor,\" said Potema, taking the necklace. \"Thank you, mother.\"\nAn hour later, passing the black branches of the sculpted douad shrubs, Potema noticed a dark figure, which vanished into the shadows under the eaves at her approach. She had noticed people following her before: it was one of the hazards of life in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; court. But this man was too close to her chambers. She slipped the necklace around her neck.\n\"Come out where I can see you,\" she commanded.\nThe man emerged from the shadows. A dark little fellow of middle-age dressed in black-dyed goatskin. His eyes were fixed, frozen, under her spell.\n\"Who do you work for?\"\n\"Prince Antiochus is my master,\" he said in a dead voice. \"I am his spy.\"\nA plan formed. \"Is the Prince in his study?\"\n\"No, milady.\"\n\"And you have access?\"\n\"Yes, milady.\"\nPotema smiled widely. She had him. \"Lead the way.\"\nThe next morning, the storm reappeared in all its fury. The pelting on the walls and ceiling was agony to Antiochus, who was discovering that he no longer had his youthful immunity to a late night of hard drinking. He shoved hard against the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; wench sharing his bed.\n\"Make yourself useful and close the window,\" he moaned.\nNo sooner had the window been bolted then there was a knock at the door. It was the Spymaster. He smiled at the Prince and handed him a sheet of paper.\n\"What is this?\" said Antiochus, squinting his eyes. \"I must still be drunk. It looks like &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"I think you will find it useful, your majesty. Your sister is here to see you.\"\nAntiochus considered getting dressed or sending his bedmate out, but thought better of it. \"Show her in. Let her be scandalized.\"\nIf Potema was scandalized, she did not show it. Swathed in orange and silver silk, she entered the room with a triumphant smile, followed by the man-mountain Lord Vhokken.\n\"Dear brother, I spoke to my mother last night, and she advised me very wisely. She said I should not battle with you in public, for the good of our family and the Empire. Therefore,\" she said, producing from the folds of her robe a piece of paper. \"I am offering you a choice.\"\n\"A choice?\" said Antiochus, returning her smile. \"That does sound friendly.\"\n\"Abdicate your rights to the Imperial throne voluntarily, and there is no need for me to show the Council this,\" Potema said, handing her brother the letter. \"It is a letter with your seal on it, saying that you knew that your father was not Pelagius Septim II, but the royal steward &lt;a href=\"Fondoukth\"&gt;Fondoukth&lt;/a&gt;. Now, before you deny writing the letter, you cannot deny the rumors, nor that the Imperial Council will believe that your father, the old fool, was quite capable of being cuckolded. Whether it's true or not, or whether the letter is a forgery or not, the scandal of it would ruin your chances of being the Emperor.\"\nAntiochus's face had gone white with fury.\n\"Don't fear, brother,\" said Potema, taking back the letter from his shaking hands. \"I will see to it that you have a very comfortable life, and all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires.\"\nSuddenly Antiochus laughed. He looked over at his Spymaster and winked. \"I remember when you broke into my stash of &lt;a href=\"Khajit\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; erotica and blackmailed me. That was close to twenty years ago. We've got better locks now, you must have noticed. It must have killed you that you couldn't use your own skills to get what you wanted.\"\nPotema merely smiled. It didn't matter. She had him.\n\"You must have charmed my servant here into getting you into my study to use my seal,\" Antiochus smirked. \"A spell, perhaps, from your mother, the witch?\"\nPotema continued to smile. Her brother was cleverer than she thought.\n\"Did you know that &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; spells, even powerful ones, only last so long? Of course, you didn't. You never were one for magic. Let me tell you, a generous salary is a stronger motivation for keeping a servant in the long run, sister,\" Antiochus took out his own sheet of paper. \"Now I have a choice for you.\"\n\"What is that?\" said Potema, her smile faltering.\n\"It looks like nonsense, but if you know what you're looking for, it's very clear. It's a practice sheet -- your handwriting attempting to look like my handwriting. It's a good gift you have. I wonder if you haven't done this before, imitating another person's handwriting. I understand a letter was found from your husband's dead wife saying that his first son was a bastard. I wonder if you wrote that letter. I wonder if I showed this evidence of your gift to your husband whether he would believe you wrote that letter. In the future, dear Wolf Queen, don't lay the same trap twice.\"\nPotema shook her head, furious, unable to speak.\n\"Give me your forgery and go take a walk in the rain. And then, later today, unhatch whatever other plots you have to keep me from the throne.\" Antiochus fixed his eyes on Potema's. \"I will be Emperor, Wolf Queen. Now go.\"\nPotema handed her brother the letter and left the room. For a few moments, out in the hallway, she said nothing. She merely glared at the slivers of rainwater dripping down the marble wall from a tiny, unseen crack.\n\"Yes, you will, brother,\" she said. \"But not for very long.\""}

By his second wife, &lt;a href=\"Gysilla\"&gt;Gysilla&lt;/a&gt;, he had a daughter in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20104\"&gt;Year 3E 104&lt;/a&gt;, who he named &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt;, after his great-great-great grandaunt, the &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20I\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt;. Enormously fat and marked by every venereal &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; known to the Healers, &lt;a href=\"Antiochus\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt; spent little time on politics. His siblings, by marked contrast, excelled in this field. &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; had married &lt;a href=\"Hellena\"&gt;Hellena&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; Queen of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; -- the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; priest-king having been executed -- and was representing the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; interests in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; admirably. &lt;a href=\"Cephorus\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Bianki\"&gt;Bianki&lt;/a&gt; were ruling the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; with a healthy brood of children. But no one was more politically active than &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf-Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nNine years after the death of her husband, King &lt;a href=\"Mantiarco\"&gt;Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt;, Potema still ruled as regent for her young son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;. Their court had become very fashionable, particularly for rulers who had a grudge to bear against the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. All the kings of Skyrim visited &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Solitude\"&gt;Castle Solitude&lt;/a&gt; regularly, and over the years, emissaries from the lands of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; did as well. Some guests came from even farther away.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;Year 3E 110&lt;/a&gt;\nPotema stood at the harbor and watched the boat from &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; arrive. Against the gray, breaking waves where she had seen so many vessels of Tamrielic manufacture, it looked less than exotic. Insectoid, certainly, with its membranous sails and rugged chitin hull, but she had seen similar if not identical seacraft in Morrowind. No, if not for the flag which was markedly alien, she would not have picked out the ship from others in the harbor. As the salty mist ballooned around her, she held out her hand in welcome to the visitors from another island empire.\nThe men aboard were not merely pale, they were entirely colorless, as if their flesh were made of some white limpid jelly, but she had been forewarned. At the arrival of the King and his translator, she looked directly into their blank eyes and offered her hand. The King made noises.\n\"His Great Majesty, King &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the translator, haltingly. \"Expresses his delight at your beauty. He thanks you for giving him refuge from these dangerous seas.\"\n\"You speak &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; very well,\" said Potema.\n\"I am fluent in the languages of four continents,\" said the translator. \"I can speak to the denizens of my own country Pyandonea, as well as those of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, and here, in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Yours is the easiest, actually. I was looking forward to this voyage.\"\n\"Please tell his highness that he is welcome here, and that I am entirely at his disposal,\" said Potema, smiling. Then she added, \"You understand the context? That I am just being polite?\"\n\"Of course,\" said the translator, and then made several noises at the King, which the King reacted to with a smile. While they conversed, Potema looked up the dock and saw the now familiar gray cloaks watching her while they spoke with &lt;a href=\"Levlet\"&gt;Levlet&lt;/a&gt;, Antiochus's\u00a0man. The &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Very bothersome.\n\"My diplomatic emissary &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; will show you to your rooms,\" said Potema. \"Unfortunately, I have some other guests as well who require my attention. I hope your great majesty understands.\"\nHis Great Majesty King Orgnum did understand, and Potema made arrangements to dine with the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Pyandoneans&lt;/a&gt; that evening. Meeting with the Psijic Order required all of her concentration. She dressed in her simplest black and gold robe and went to her stateroom to prepare. Her son, Uriel, was on the throne, playing with his pet joughat.\n\"Good morning, mom.\"\n\"Good morning, darling,\" said Potema, lifting her son in the air with feigned stain. \"&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, but you're heavy. I don't think I've ever carried such a heavy ten-year-old.\"\n\"That's probably because I'm eleven,\" said Uriel, perfectly aware of his mother's tricks. \"And you're going to say that as an eleven-year-old, I should probably be with my tutor.\"\n\"I was fanatical about studying at your age,\" said Potema.\n\"I am king,\" said Uriel petulantly.\n\"But don't be satisfied with that,\" said Potema. \"By all rights, you should be Emperor already, you understand that, don't you?\"\nUriel nodded his head. Potema took a moment to marvel at his likeness to the portraits of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. The same ruthless brow and powerful chin. When he was older and lost his baby fat, he'd be a splitting image of his great great great great great granduncle. Behind her, she heard the door opening and an usher bringing in several gray cloaks. She stiffened slightly, and Uriel, on cue, jumped down from the throne and left the stateroom, pausing to greet the most important of the &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Good Morning, Master &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;,\" he said, enunciating each syllable with a regal accent that made Potema's heart soar. \"I hope your accommodations at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Solitude\"&gt;Castle Solitude&lt;/a&gt; meet with your approval.\"\n\"They do, King Uriel, thank you,\" said Iachesis, delighted and charmed.\nIachesis and his Psijics entered the chamber and the door was shut behind them. Potema sat only for a moment on the throne before stepping off the dais and greeting her guests.\n\"I am so sorry to have kept you waiting,\" said Potema. \"To think that you sailed all the way from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and I should keep you waiting any longer. You must forgive me.\"\n\"It's not all that long a voyage,\" said one of the gray cloaks, angrily. \"It isn't as if we sailed all the way from Pyandonea.\"\n\"Ah. You've seen my most recent guests, King Orgnum and his retinue,\" said Potema breezily. \"I suppose you think it unusual, me entertaining them, as we all know the Pyandoneans mean to invade &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. You are, I take it, as neutral in this as you are in all political matters?\"\n\"Of course,\" said &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt; proudly. \"We have nothing to gain or lose by the invasion. The &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; preceded the organization of Tamriel under the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and we shall survive under any political regime.\"\n\"Rather like a flea on whatever mongrel happens along, are you?\" said Potema, narrowing her eyes. \"Don't overestimate your importance, Iachesis. Your order's child, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, has twice the power you have, and they are entirely on my side. We are in the process of making an agreement with King Orgnum. When the Pyandoneans take over and I am in my proper place as Empress of this continent, then you shall know your proper place in the order of things.\"\nWith a majestic stride, Potema left the stateroom, leaving the grey cloaks to look from one to the other.\n\"We must speak to Lord Levlet,\" said one of the grey cloaks.\n\"Yes,\" said &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;. \"Perhaps we should.\"\nLevlet was quickly found at his usual place at the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20and%20Nausea\"&gt;Moon and Nausea&lt;/a&gt; tavern. As the three grey cloaks entered, led by Iachesis, the smoke and the noise seemed to die in their path. Even the smell of tobacco and flin dissipated in their wake. He rose and then escorted them to a small room upstairs.\n\"You've reconsidered,\" said Levlet with a broad smile.\n\"Your &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Iachesis, and then corrected himself, \"Our Emperor originally asked for our support in defending the west coast of Tamriel from the &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;n fleet in return for twelve million gold pieces. We offered our services at fifty. Upon reflection on the dangers that a Pyandonean invasion would have, we accept his earlier offer.\"\n\"The Mages Guild has generously -- \"\n\"Perhaps for as low ten million gold pieces,\" said Iachesis quickly.\nOver the course of dinner, Potema promised &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;King Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; through the interpreter, to lead an insurrection against her brother. She was delighted to discover that her capacity for lying worked in many different cultures. Potema shared her bed that night with King Orgnum, as it seemed the polite and diplomatic thing to do. As it turned out, he was one of the better lovers she had ever had. He gave her some herbs before beginning that made her feel as if she was floating on the surface of time, conscious only of the gestures of love after she had found herself making them. She felt herself like the cooling mist, quenching the fire of his lust over and over and over again. In the morning, when he kissed her on the cheek, and said with his bald white eyes that he was leaving her, she felt a stab of regret.\nThe ship left harbor that morning, en route to the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the imminent invasions. She waved them off to sea as she footsteps behind her. It was Levlet.\n\"They will do it for eight million, your highness\" he said.\n\"Thank &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Potema. \"I need more time for an insurrection. Pay them from my treasury, and then go to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and get the twelve million from Antiochus. We should make a good profit from this game, and you, of course, will have your share.\"\nThree months later, Potema heard that the fleet of the &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;ns had been utterly destroyed by a storm that had appeared suddenly off the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. The home port of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"King%20Orgnum\"&gt;King Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; and all of his ships had been utterly annihilated.\n\"Sometimes making people hate you,\" she said, holding her son &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt; close, \"Is how you make a profit .\""}

His greatest victory was in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Isle\"&gt;War of the Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20110\"&gt;Year 3E 110&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; fleet and the royal navies of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, together with the magical powers of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded in destroying the &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; invading armada. His siblings, King &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, ruled well and relations between the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; were much improved. Still, centuries of neglect had not repaired all the scars that existed between the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the kings of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring a rare visitation from his sister and nephew &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;, who had suffered from several illnesses over his reign, lapsed into a coma. For months, he lingered in between life and death while the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; prepared for the ascension of his fifteen-year-old daughter &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; to the throne.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;Year 3E 120&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"Mother, I can't marry &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Uriel, more amused by the suggestion than offended. \"She's my first cousin. And besides, I believe she's engaged to one of the lords of &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Modellus\"&gt;Modellus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"You're so squeamish. There's a time and a place for propriety,\" said Potema. \"But you're correct at any rate about &lt;a href=\"Modellus\"&gt;Modellus&lt;/a&gt;, and we shouldn't offend the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; at this critical juncture. How do you feel about &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Rakma\"&gt;Princess Rakma&lt;/a&gt;? You spent a good deal of time in her company in &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"She's all right,\" said Uriel. \"Don't tell me you want to hear all the dirty details.\"\n\"Please spare me your study of her anatomy,\" Potema grimaced. \"But would you marry her?\"\n\"I suppose so.\"\n\"Very good. I'll make the arrangements then,\" Potema made a note for herself before continuing. \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Lleromo\"&gt;King Lleromo&lt;/a&gt; has been a difficult ally to keep, and a political marriage should keep &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt; on our side. Should we need them. When is the funeral?\"\n\"What funeral?\" asked Uriel. \"You mean for &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Uncle Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Of course,\" sighed Potema. \"Anyone else of note die recently?\"\n\"There were a bunch of little &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; children running through the halls, so I guess &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; has arrived. Magnus arrived at court yesterday, so it ought to be any day now.\"\n\"It's time to address the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt; then,\" said Potema, smiling.\nShe dressed in black, not her usual colorful ensembles. It was important to look the part of the grieving sister. Regarding herself in the mirror, she felt that she looked all of her fifty-three years. A shock of silver wound its way through her auburn hair. The long, cold, dry winters in northern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; had created a map of wrinkles, thin as a spiderweb, all across her face. Still, she knew that when she smiled, she could win hearts, and when she frowned, she could inspire fear. It was enough for her purposes.\nPotema's speech to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps helpful to students of public speaking.\nShe began with flattery and self-abasement: \"My most august and wise friends, members of the Elder Council, I am but a provincial queen, and I can only assume to bring to issue what you yourselves must have already pondered.\"\nShe continued on to praise the late &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, who had been a popular ruler, despite his flaws: \"He was a true &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt; and a great warrior, destroying -- with your counsel -- the near invincible armada of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBut little time was wasted, before she came to her point: \"The &lt;a href=\"Gysilla\"&gt;Empress Gysilla&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately did nothing to temper my brother's lustful spirits. In point of fact, no whore in the slums of the city spread out on more beds than she. Had she attended to her duties in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; bedchamber more faithfully, we would have a true heir to the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, not the halfwit, milksop bastards who call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; children. The girl called &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; is popularly believed to be the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Gysilla\"&gt;Gysilla&lt;/a&gt; and the Captain of the Guard. It may be that she is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Gysilla\"&gt;Gysilla&lt;/a&gt; and the boy who cleans the cistern. We can never know for certain. Not as certainly as we can know the lineage of my son, Uriel. The eldest true son of the Septim Dynasty. My lords, the princes of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; will not stand for a bastard on the throne, that I can assure you.\"\nShe ended mildly, but with a call to action: \"Posterity will judge you. You know what must be done.\"\nThat evening, Potema entertained her brothers and their wives in the &lt;a href=\"Map%20Room\"&gt;Map Room&lt;/a&gt;, her favorite of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; dining chambers. The walls were splashed with bright, if fading representations of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and all the known lands beyond, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;. Overhead the great glass domed ceiling, wet with rain, displayed distorted images of the stars overhead. Lightning flashed every other minute, casting strange phantom shadows on the walls.\n\"When will you speak to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Potema as dinner was served.\n\"I don't know if I will,\" said Magnus. \"I don't believe I have anything to say.\"\n\"I'll speak to them when they announce the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt;,\" said &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;. \"Merely as a formality to show my support and the support of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"You can speak for all of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Potema, with a teasing smile. \"The Redguards must love you very much.\"\n\"We have a unique relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;,\" said &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus's&lt;/a&gt; wife, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bianki\"&gt;Bianki&lt;/a&gt;. \"Since the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, it's been understood that we are part of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but not a subject.\"\n\"I understand you've already spoken to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Magnus's wife, &lt;a href=\"Hellena\"&gt;Hellena&lt;/a&gt;, pointedly. She was a diplomat by nature, but as the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; ruler of an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; kingdom, she knew how to recognize and confront adversity.\n\"Yes, I have,\" said Potema, pausing to savor a slice of braised jalfbird. \"I gave them a short speech about the coronation this afternoon.\"\n\"Our sister is an excellent public speaker,\" said &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You're too kind,\" said Potema, laughing. \"I do many things better than speaking.\"\n\"Such as?\" asked &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bianki\"&gt;Bianki&lt;/a&gt;, smiling.\n\"Might I ask what you said in your speech?\" asked Magnus, suspiciously.\nThere was a knock on the chamber door. The head steward whispered something to Potema, who smiled in response and rose from the table.\n\"I told the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Council&lt;/a&gt; that I would give my full support to the coronation, provided they proceed with wisdom. What could be sinister about that?\" Potema said, and took her glass of wine with her to the door. \"If you'll pardon me, my niece &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; wishes to have a word with me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; stood in the hall with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;. She was but a child, but on reflection, Potema realized that at her age, she was already married two years to &lt;a href=\"Mantiarco\"&gt;Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt;. There was a similarity, to be certain. Potema could see &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; as the young queen, with dark eyes and pallid skin smooth and resolute like marble. Anger flashed momentarily in &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra's&lt;/a&gt; eyes on seeing her aunt, but emotion left her, replaced with calm &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; presence.\n\"Queen Potema,\" she said serenely. \"I have been informed that my coronation will take place in two days time. Your presence at the ceremony will not be welcome. I have already given orders to your servants to have your belongings packed, and an escort will be accompanying you back to your kingdom tonight. That is all. Goodbye, aunt.\"\nPotema began to reply, but &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; and her guard turned and moved back down the corridor to the stateroom. The Wolf Queen watched them go, and then reentered the &lt;a href=\"Map%20Room\"&gt;Map Room&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Sister-in-Law,\" said Potema, addressing &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bianki\"&gt;Bianki&lt;/a&gt; with deep malevolence. \"You asked what I do better than speaking? The answer is: 'war'.\""}

Her uncles &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, were in attendance, but her aunt, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, had been anished from the court. Once back in her kingdom, Queen Potema began assembling the rebellion, which was to be known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. All the allies she had made over the years of disgruntled kings and nobles joined forces with her against the new Empress.\nThe first early strikes against the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; were entirely successful. Throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt; found themselves under attack. Potema and her forces washed over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; like a plague, inciting riots and insurrections everywhere they touched. In the autumn of the year, the loyal Duke of &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; on the coast of High Rock sent an urgent request for reinforcements from the Imperial Army, and Kintyra, to inspire the resistance to the Wolf Queen, led the army herself.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;\"We don't know where they are,\" said the Duke, deeply embarrassed. \"I've sent scouts out all over the countryside. I can only assume that they've retreated up north upon hearing of your army's arrival.\"\n\"I hate to say it, but I was hoping for a battle,\" said Kintyra. \"I'd like to put my aunt's head on a spike and parade it around the Empire. Her son &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt; and his army are right on the border to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt;, mocking me. How are they able to be so successful? Are they just that good in battle or do my subjects truly hate me?\"\nShe was tired after many months of struggling through the mud of autumn and winter. Crossing the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, her army nearly marched into an ambush. A blizzard snap in the normally temperate &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; was so unexpected and severe that it must certainly have been cast by one of Potema's wizard allies. Everywhere she turned, she felt her aunt's touch. And now, her chance of facing the Wolf Queen at last had been thwarted. It was almost too much to bear.\n\"It is fear, pure and simple,\" said the Duke. \"That is her greatest weapon.\"\n\"I need to ask,\" said Kintyra, hoping that by sheer will she could keep her voice from revealing any of the fear the Duke spoke of. \"You've seen the army. Is it true that she has summoned a force of undead warriors to do her bidding?\"\n\"No, as a matter of fact, it's not true, but she certainly fosters that rumor. Her army attacks at night, partly for strategic reasons, and partly to advance fears like that. She has, so far as I know, no supernatural aid other than the standard battlemages and nightblades of any modern army.\"\n\"Always at night,\" said Kintyra thoughtfully. \"I suppose that's to disguise their numbers.\"\n\"And to move her troops into position before we're aware of them\" added the Duke. \"She's the master of the sneak attack. When you hear a march to the east, you can be certain she's already on top of you from the south. But listen, we'll discuss this all tomorrow morning. I've prepared the castle's best rooms for you and your men.\"\nKintyra sat in her tower suite and by the light of the moon and a single tallow candle, she penned a letter to her husband-to-be, &lt;a href=\"Modellus\"&gt;Lord Modellus&lt;/a&gt;, back in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. She hoped to be married to him in the summer at the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; her grandmother &lt;a href=\"Quintilla\"&gt;Quintilla&lt;/a&gt; had loved so much, but the war may not permit it. As she wrote, she gazed out the window at the courtyard below and the haunted, leafless trees of winter. Two of her guards stood on the battlements, several feet away from one another. Just like Modellus and Kintyra, she thought, and proceeded to expound on the metaphor in her letter.\nA knock on the door interrupted her poetry.\n\"A letter, your majesty, from Lord Modellus,\" said the young courier, handing the note to her.\nIt was short, and she read it quickly before the courier had a chance to retire. \"I'm confused by something. When did he write this?\"\n\"One week ago,\" said the courier. \"He said it was urgent that I make it here as quickly as possible while he mobilized the army. I imagine they've left the City already.\"\nKintyra dismissed the courier. Modellus said that he had received a letter from her, urgently calling for reinforcements to the Battle of Glenpoint. But there was no battle at Glenpoint, and she had only just arrived today. Then who wrote the letter in her handwriting, and why would they want Modellus to bring a second army out of the Imperial City into High Rock?\nFeeling a chill from the night air at the window, Kintyra went to shut the latch. The two guards on the battlements were gone. She leaned over at the sound of a muffled struggle behind one of the barren trees, and did not hear the door open.\nWhen she turned, she saw Queen Potema and &lt;a href=\"Mentin\"&gt;Mentin&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of Glenpoint, in the room with a host of guards.\n\"You move quietly, aunt,\" she said after a moment's pause. She turned to the Duke. \"What turned you against your loyalty to the Empire? Fear?\"\n\"And gold,\" said the Duke simply.\n\"What happened to my army?\" asked Kintyra, trying to look Potema steadily in the face. \"Is the battle over so soon?\"\n\"All your men are dead,\" smiled Potema. \"But there was no battle here. Merely quiet and efficient assassination. There will be battles ahead, against Modellus in the Dragontail Mountains and against the remnants of the Imperial Army in the City. I'll send you regular updates on the progress of the war.\"\n\"So I am to be kept here as your hostage?\" asked Kintyra, flatly, suddenly aware of the solidity of the stones and the great height of her tower room. \"Damn you, look at me! I am your Empress!\"\n\"Think of it this way, I'm taking you from being a fifth rate ruler to a first rate martyr,\" said Potema with a wink. \"But I understand if you don't want to thank me for that.\""}

Some believe she was slain shortly after her imprisonment in the &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;121st year&lt;/a&gt;, while others maintain that she was likely kept alive as a hostage until shortly before her uncle &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, reconquered western &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the summer of the 125th year. The certainty of Kintyra's demise rallied many against the &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Wolf Queen Potema&lt;/a&gt; and her son, who had been crowned &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; four years previously when he invaded the under-guarded &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nCephorus concentrated his army on the war in High Rock, while his brother &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, brought his &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; troops through loyal &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to fight in Potema's home province. The reptilian troops fought well in the summer months, but during the winter, they retired south to regroup and attack again when the weather was warm. At this stalemate, the War lasted out two more years.\nAlso, in the 125th year, Magnus's wife &lt;a href=\"Hellena\"&gt;Hellena&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to their first child, a boy who they named &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, after the Emperor who fathered Magnus, Cephorus, the late Emperor &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;, and the dread Wolf Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;Potema sat on soft silk cushions in the warm grass in front of her tent and watched the sun rise over the dark woods on the other side of the meadow. It was a peculiarly vibrant morning, typical of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; summertide. The high chirrup of insects buzzed all around her and the sky surged with thousands of fallowing birds, rolling over one another and forming a multitude of patterns. Nature was unaware of the war coming to Falconstar, she surmised.\n\"Your highness, a message from the army in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;,\" said one of her maids, bringing in a courier. He was breathing hard, stained with sweat and mud. Evidence of a long, fast ride over many, many miles.\n\"My queen,\" said the courier, looking to the ground. \"I bring grave news of your son, the Emperor. He met your brother King Cephorus's army in Hammerfell in the countryside of Ichidag and there did &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;. You would be proud, for he fought well, but in the end, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and your son, our Emperor, was captured. King Cephorus is bringing him to Gilane.\"\nPotema listened to the news, scowling. \"That clumsy fool,\" she said at last.\nPotema stood up and strolled into camp, where the men were arming themselves, preparing for battle. Long ago, the soldiers understood that their lady did not stand on ceremony, and she would prefer that they work rather than salute her. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; was ahead of her, already meeting with the commander of the battlemages, discussing last minute strategy.\n\"My queen,\" said the courier, who had been following her. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\"I'm going to win this battle with &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, despite his superior position holding the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kogmenthist%20Castle\"&gt;Kogmenthist Castle&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Potema. \"And then when I know what Cephorus means to do with the Emperor, I'll respond accordingly. If there's a ransom to be paid, I'll pay it; if there's a prison exchange needed, so be it. Now, please, bathe yourself and rest, and try not to get in the way of the war.\"\n\"It's not an ideal scenario,\" said &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; when Potema had entered the commander's tent. \"If we attack the castle from the west, we'll be running directly into the fire from their &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s. If we come from the east, we'll be going through swamps, and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; do better in that type of environment than we do. A lot better.\"\n\"What about the north and south? Just hills, correct?\"\n\"Very steep hills, your highness,\" said the commander. \"We should post bowmen there, but we'll be too vulnerable putting out the majority of our force.\"\n\"So it's the swamp,\" said Potema, and added, pragmatically. \"Unless we withdraw and wait for them to come out before fighting.\"\n\"If we wait, &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; will have his army here from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and we'll be trapped between the two of them,\" said &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt;. \"Not a preferable situation.\"\n\"I'll talk to the troops,\" said the commander. \"Try to prepare them for the swamp attack.\"\n\"No,\" said Potema. \"I'll speak to them.\"\nIn full battlegear, the soldiers gathered in the center of camp. They were a motley collection of men and women, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, youngbloods and old veterans, the sons and daughters of nobles, shopkeepers, serfs, priests, prostitutes, farmers, academics, adventurers. All of them under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Imperial Family&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"My children,\" Potema said, her voice ringing out, hanging in the still morning mist. \"We have fought in many battles together, over mountaintops and beach heads, through forests and deserts. I have seen great acts of valor from each one of you, which does my heart proud. I have also seen dirty fighting, backstabbing, cruel and wanton feats of savagery, which pleases me equally well. For you are all warriors.\"\nWarming to her theme, Potema walked the line from soldier to soldier, looking each one in the eye: \"War is in your blood, in your brain, in your muscles, in everything you think and everything you do. When this war is over, when the forces are vanquished that seek to deny the throne to the true &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, you may cease to be warriors. You may choose to return to your lives before the war, to your farms and your cities, and show off your scars and tell tales of the deeds you did this day to your wondering neighbors. But on this day, make no mistake, you are warriors. You are war.\"\nShe could see her words were working. All around her, bloodshot eyes were focusing on the slaughter to come, arms tensing around weapons. She continued in her loudest cry, \"And you will move through the swamplands, like an unstoppable power from the blackest part of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and you will rip the scales from the reptilian things in &lt;a href=\"Kogmenthist%20Castle\"&gt;Kogmenthist Castle&lt;/a&gt;. You are warriors, and you need not only fight, you must win. You must win!\"\nThe soldiers roared in response, shocking the birds from the trees all around the camp.\nFrom a vantage point on the hills to the south, Potema and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt; had excellent views of the battle as it raged. It looked like two swarms of two colors of insect moving back and forth over a clump of dirt which was the castle ruins. Occasionally, a burst of flame or a cloud of acid from one of the mages would flicker over the battle arresting their attention, but hour after hour, the fighting seemed like nothing but chaos.\n\"A rider approaches,\" said &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vhokken\"&gt;Lord Vhokken&lt;/a&gt;, breaking the silence.\nThe young &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; woman was wearing the crest of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;, but carried a white flag. Potema allowed her to approach. Like the courier from the morning, the rider was well travel-worn.\n\"Your Highness,\" she said, out of breath. \"I have been sent from your brother, my lord King Cephorus, to bring you dire news. Your son Uriel was captured in Ichidag on the field in battle and from there transported to Gilane.\"\n\"I know all this,\" said Potema scornfully. \"I have couriers of my own. You can tell your master that after I've won this battle, I'll pay whatever ransom or exchange --\"\n\"Your Highness, an angry crowd met the caravan your son was in before it made it to Gilane,\" the rider said quickly, \"Your son is dead. He had been burned to death within his carriage. He is dead.\"\nPotema turned from the young woman and looked down at the battle. Her soldiers were going to win. &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus's&lt;/a&gt; army was in retreat.\n\"One other item of news, your highness,\" said the rider. \"King Cephorus is being proclaimed Emperor.\"\nPotema did not look at the woman. Her army was celebrating their victory."}

This uncle, &lt;a href=\"Cephorus\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;, was thereafter proclaimed &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and rode to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The troops formerly loyal to Emperor Uriel and his mother, the Wolf Queen &lt;a href=\"Potema\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, pledged themselves to the new Emperor. In return for their support, the nobility of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Hammerfell, the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; demanded and received a new level of autonomy and independence from the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; was at an end.\nPotema continued to fight a losing battle, her area of influence dwindling and dwindling until only her kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; remained in her power. She summoned &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to fight for her, had her &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s resurrect her fallen enemies as undead warriors, and mounted attack after attack on the forces of her brothers, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; Cephorus Septim I and King &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. Her allies began leaving her as her madness grew, and her only companions were the &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s she had amassed over the years. The kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; became a land of death. Stories of the ancient Wolf Queen being waited on by rotting skeletal chambermaids and holding war plans with &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; generals terrified her subjects.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt;Magnus opened up the small window in his room. For the first time in weeks, he heard the sounds of a city: carts squeaking, horses clopping over the cobblestones, and somewhere a child laughing. He smiled as he returned to his bedside to wash his face and finish dressing. There was a distinctive knock on the door.\n\"Come in, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pel&lt;/a&gt;,\" he said.\nPelagius bounded into the room. It was obvious that he had been up for hours. Magnus marveled at his energy, and wondered how much longer battles would last if they were run by twelve-year-old boys.\n\"Did you see outside yet?\" Pelagius asked. \"All the townspeople have come back! There are shops, and a &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and down by the harbor, I saw a hundred shops come in from all over the place!\"\n\"They don't have to be afraid anymore. We've taken care of all the zombies and &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s that used to be their neighbors, and they know it's safe to come back.\"\n\"Is &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Uncle Cephorus&lt;/a&gt; going to turn into a zombie when he dies?\" asked Pelagius.\n\"I wouldn't put that past him,\" laughed Magnus. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\"I heard some people saying that he was old and sick,\" said Pelagius.\n\"He's not that old,\" said Magnus. \"He's sixty years old. That's just two years older than I.\"\n\"And how old is Aunt Potema?\" asked Pelagius.\n\"Seventy,\" said Magnus. \"And yes, that is old. Any more questions will have to wait. I have to go meet with the commander now, but we can talk at supper. You can make yourself busy, and not get into any trouble?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Pelagius. He understood that his father had to continue to hold siege on aunt Potema's castle. After they took it over and locked her up, they would move out of the inn and into the castle. Pelagius was not looking forward to that. The whole town had a funny, sweet, dead smell, but he could not get even as close as the castle moat without gagging from the stench. They could dump a million flowers on the place and it wouldn't make any difference at all.\nHe walked through the city for hours, buying some food and then some ribbons for his sister and mother back in &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. He thought about who else he needed to buy gifts for and was stumped. All his cousins, the children of Uncle Cephorus, &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Uncle Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;, and Aunt Potema, had died during the war, some of them in battle and some of them during the famines because so many crops had been burned. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Bianki\"&gt;Aunt Bianki&lt;/a&gt; had died last year. There was only he, his mother, his sister, his father, and his uncle the Emperor left. And Aunt Potema. But she didn't really count.\nWhen he came upon the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; earlier that morning, he had decided not to go in. Those places always spooked him with their strange smoke and crystals and old books. This time, it occurred to Pelagius that he might buy a gift for Uncle Cephorus. A souvenir of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude's&lt;/a&gt; Mages Guild.\nAn old woman was having trouble with the front door, so Pelagius opened it for her.\n\"Thank you,\" she said.\nShe was easily the oldest thing he had ever seen. Her face looked like an old rotted apple framed with a wild whirl of bright white hair. He instinctively moved away from her gnarled talon when she started to pat him on the head. But there was a gem around her neck that immediately fascinated him. It was a single bright yellow jewel, but it almost looked there was something trapped within. When the light hit it from the candles, it brought out the form of a four-legged beast, pacing.\n\"It's a &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;,\" she said. \"Infused with the spirit of a great demon &lt;a href=\"werewolf\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;. It was enchanted long, long ago with the power to &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; people, but I've been thinking about giving it another spell. Perhaps something from the &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;School of Alteration&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Lock\"&gt;Lock&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shield\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\" She paused and looked at the boy carefully with yellowed, rheumy eyes. \"You look familiar to me, boy. What's your name?\"\n\"Pelagius,\" he said. He normally would have said \"Prince Pelagius,\" but he was told not to draw attention to himself while in town.\n\"I used to know someone named &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;,\" the old woman said, and slowly smiled. \"Are you here alone, Pelagius?\"\n\"My father is... with the army, storming the castle. But he'll be back when the walls have been breached.\"\n\"Which I dare say won't take too much longer,\" sighed the old woman. \"Nothing, no matter how well built, tends to last. Are you buying something in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"I wanted to buy a gift for my uncle,\" said Pelagius. \"But I don't know if I have enough gold.\"\nThe old woman left the boy to look over the wares while she went to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Guild&lt;/a&gt; enchanter. He was a young &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, ambitious, and new to the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. It took little persuasion and a lot of gold to convince him to remove the Charm spell from the soul gem and imbue it with a powerful curse, a slow poison that would drain wisdom from its wearer year by year until he or she lost all reason. She also purchased a cheap ring of &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"For your kindness to an old woman, I've bought you these,\" she said, giving the boy the necklace and the ring. \"You can give the ring to your uncle, and tell him it has been enchanted with a &lt;a href=\"Levitation%20spell\"&gt;Levitation spell&lt;/a&gt;, so if ever he needs to leap from high places, it will protect him. The soulgem is for you.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said the boy. \"But this is too kind of you.\"\n\"Kindness has nothing to do with it,\" she answered, quite honestly. \"You see, I was in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Records\"&gt;Hall of Records&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; once or twice, and I read about you in the foretellings of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. You will be &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; one day, my boy, the Emperor Pelagius Septim III, and with this soul gem to guide you, posterity will always remember you and your deeds.\"\nWith those words, the old woman disappeared down an alley behind the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius looked after her, but he did not think to search behind a heap of stones. If he had, he would have found a tunnel under the city into the very heart of &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Castle Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. And if he had found his way there, he would have found, past the shambling &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; and the moldering remains of a once grand palace, the bedroom of the queen.\nIn that bedroom, he would find the &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Wolf Queen&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude in repose, listening to the sounds of her castle collapsing. And he would see a toothless grin growing on her face as she breathed her last.\nFrom the pen of &lt;a href=\"Inzolicus\"&gt;Inzolicus&lt;/a&gt;, Second Century Sage:\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt;Potema Septim died after a month long siege on her castle. While she lived, she had been the Wolf Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, Daughter of the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, Wife of King &lt;a href=\"Mantiarco\"&gt;Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt;, Aunt of the Empress &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt;, Mother of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt;, and Sister of the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s Antiochus and Cephorus. At her death, &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; appointed his son, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, as the titular head of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, under guidance from the royal council.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20140\"&gt;3E 140&lt;/a&gt;The Emperor &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; died after falling from his horse. His brother was proclaimed the Emperor Magnus Septim.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20141\"&gt;3E 141&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;, King of Solitude, is recorded as \"occasionally eccentric\" in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Annals\"&gt;Imperial Annals&lt;/a&gt;. He marries &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, Duchess of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20145\"&gt;3E 145&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; Magnus Septim dies. His son, who will be known as &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Pelagius the Mad&lt;/a&gt;, is coronated."}

It is given to the Dragonborn after they complete the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;The Man Who Cried Wolf&lt;/a&gt;,\" provided that they have reached &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 10.\nBackground.\n\"Potema has been summoned from beyond the grave and is gathering power. Styrr has given me the key to Potema's Catacombs. I must enter the catacombs and prevent Potema from fully resurrecting by acquiring her bones.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOnce a level is gained after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;The Man Who Cried Wolf&lt;/a&gt;,\" a &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;courier&lt;/a&gt; will approach with a letter from Falk Firebeard, asking the Dragonborn to return to him. Upon reaching Falk, he will inform the Dragonborn that, despite popular belief, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; (The Wolf Queen) was not destroyed when the ritual was stopped, and remains a significant threat. He says to talk to &lt;a href=\"Styrr\"&gt;Styrr&lt;/a&gt;, who is in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;. Styrr will explain that since the Dragonborn stopped the ritual, they have a connection to Potema. The Dragonborn must investigate the catacombs beneath the chapel that lead to her. Styrr requests the remains of Potema so he can bless them. He provides the character with a &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; spell which causes these enemies to flee from the Dragonborn for a brief amount of time.\nEnter the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple is located on the upper courtyard of Solitude, opposite the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;'s barracks. Once inside, the quest marker can be misleading, as it sends the Dragonborn to the wall on the right of the entrance. The entrance to the catacombs is in the basement, so one will need to go forward almost to the shrines and turn left twice. A path will lead down to a locked gate. With the key obtained previously the Dragonborn can now open the gate. Once through the locked door, a path to the left leads to &lt;a href=\"Potema%27s%20Catacombs\"&gt;Potema's Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotema's Catacombs.\nHead down the first set of stairs. Around the corner there is a statue of a wolf and a blocked door. The doorway has several thick bars blocking it. Potema will speak to the Dragonborn and then open the gate. In the following room there is a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;. Around the corner to the right the Dragonborn will come to a room with a bar and a hallway directly across from it covered in spider webs. Pass through the webs and turn left. Another quick left leads to a staircase. The upper pathway is blocked with rubble. The lower path leads down to a small room. There will be two chests and several barrels to loot.\nPassing through the small room leads to a very large room with a staircase leading down to a lower level. The upper balcony has one draugr directly to the right upon entering the room. The lower level will have several enemies, one of which is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Nightstalker\"&gt;Vampire Nightstalker&lt;/a&gt;. Beware as if the Dragonborn is not already a vampire or a werewolf, the vampires' Drain Life spell can inflict &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt; on them. Head down the stairs to the lower level. There is a skill book on the table and a path leading downward. The path leads to another doorway. Upon opening it, one will find themselves in a short hallway leading to a large room with a draugr patrolling it.\nAnother draugr is hung upon the wall, but it will remain passive. The area directly in front of it is part of a fire trap. The draugr will have a weapon and a helm that can be taken. Around the corner there is a switch. The switch opens the gate, leading to a stairway down, but across the way is another dead draugr on the wall. This one will attack when the Dragonborn gets close. Once down the stairs another draugr to the right will eventually rise from his coffin, but can be shot quickly in &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak mode&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis hallway has an upper and lower level. Besides the draugr in his coffin, another patrols the hallway. Once killed, go up the stairs to the higher level. The doorway leads to an underground cavern with a set of stairs leading down. Down the first hallway is a leveled &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;. Turn left at the end of the hallway and down the corridor one will find another split level area, with water in the lower area and two draugr. There is also an urn in the water with a few gold coins in it. The doorway leading out of here is booby-trapped with the typical wall spike trap activated by a foot switch. The next room has more barrels to loot and takes the Dragonborn to a larger open cavern with more water, and two draugr standing against the right wall. There are several hanging cages, one of which has a dead draugr. There is a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; and a booby-trapped chest on the left. Standing to either side of the chest when looted will allow one to avoid the poison darts that shoot from the walls. Keep going down the path, and it will lead to a switch. This is a preview of some later doorway puzzles. It should be noted that whether it was intentional or not, these revolving type doors generally shut after a period of time. In any case, the doorway revolves one way or another depending on the direction of the switch. Once through the doorway, one will encounter another room decorated with carvings of Potema and an alchemy table. The doorway leads to &lt;a href=\"Potema%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Potema's Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nPotema's Refuge.\nPotema's Refuge is a large underground network of caverns like most other draugr dungeons. The path leads down to where the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will encounter another leveled draugr. The path to the left is a dead end. Taking the path on the right leads to a room with three switches that open the three revolving doors. Before going through the revolving doors, open the gate on the right. Another blooded vampire resides within. A switch behind the coffin reveals a hidden door. This leads down a passageway to a chest with a window to the next room one will be entering. Head back to the room with the three switches. Activating the first lever in line will stop and start the first revolving door, etc. Stop all three doors when the entrance is open and head through to the next room. The Dragonborn can see the window here with the chest that they just looted. At the end of the hall are two soul gems on pedestals. They are the source of a fire trap, and the Dragonborn will be blasted by intermittent bursts of flame which can be stopped by taking the soul gems off the pedestals. The room to the left is an empty chamber leading to a doorway with a staircase. The staircase leads to a throne room where a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Fledgling\"&gt;Vampire Fledgling&lt;/a&gt; is accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt;, or something of a lower level if the Dragonborn is not of a sufficient level yet to face that kind of enemy. The vampire should have a key to Potema's Sanctum on his body, but there is also a copy of the key on one of the two thrones. The grate in the center of the room shows the Dragonborn a dead draugr, but there is no way to get to it at the time. Through the double doors with the new key and taking the hallway to another set of doors will lead to Potema's Sanctum.\nPotema's Sanctum.\nUpon first entering there is a short hallway leading to a burial chamber. Several burial urns can be found here, along with a dead draugr on an altar. The draugr is not a concern immediately. However, in the next room another &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Mistwalker\"&gt;Vampire Mistwalker&lt;/a&gt; will be found and they may raise the draugr on the altar to life using their &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; spells to reanimate dead bodies, which if the spellcaster is slain, the resurrected corpse disintegrates into a pile of ashes. Two more draugr will follow the vampire into the fray. Once these creatures are defeated, a skeleton can be found wandering the next hallway past the two thrones.\nThe next room on the left is filled with many dead draugr and vampires. They may have valuable loot on them, such as gold and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;. Potema's voice will speak again at this point. She will then proceed to resurrect a number of draugr and the single vampire in the room. Before they are raised (before Potema speaks), one can take the enemies' weapons away from them, making them easy to kill. The higher the Dragonborn's level, the stronger the draugr, and the lone vampire if possible, and the more she resurrects. A cloak spell would be helpful here, as is an immediate fast retreat to the passageway in order for foes to be killed individually or in smaller groups. Otherwise, if one waits, Potema's spell will wear off and the draugr and vampire will keel over dead again, allowing safe passage. There is nothing in the next chamber, except a couple of &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Shock%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Resist Shock&lt;/a&gt; potions that will come in handy against Potema; however, upon entering the following room, there will be more enemies. It would be recommended to save at this point.\nPotema congratulates the Dragonborn on doing so well, but then asks if they are capable of making it past her \"inner council.\" The now familiar purple energy whirlwind from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Man%20Who%20Cried%20Wolf\"&gt;previous quest&lt;/a&gt; will also begin to resurrect draugr. This is a difficult stage, as the energy in the room creates difficulty seeing while draugr attack from all over. The purple energy drains significant health and magicka on each hit, so it would be recommended to enter the room to get Potema's attention, then stay in the previous room to avoid the shock elemental &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic Potema discharges around the room. For melee-oriented Dragonborn, they can wait for the draugr to come to them through the door; archers and mages can stand just beyond the door and attack. Since the draugr will have to funnel through the door, this also makes them lined-up targets for &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;, as well as spells such as &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Flaming%20Familiar\"&gt;Flaming Familiar&lt;/a&gt; spell will also be useful, as sneaking and continuing to conjure the Familiar in the center of the room (after it explodes) attracts the draugr to it instead of the Dragonborn. One may be able to defeat all of the enemies that Potema summons with this spell alone. After each wave, Potema will resurrect killed draugr to attack the Dragonborn again. Expect to deal with a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Wight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Wight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Scourge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the first wave, and a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; in the last wave, possibly with an ebony weapon, depending on the Dragonborn's level. Eventually, the last one will be killed for the last time, and the Dragonborn will receive the objective to get Potema's remains. However, the Dragonborn will now have to defeat Potema's ghost, which awaits on the throne in the next room after the whirlwind of energy that is Potema retreats there to await the Dragonborn. She can summon Atronachs, and uses the spell &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; and Conjuration to resurrect the lower level draugr to fight for her. She also has the Unrelenting Force Shout and will most likely have a leveled enchanted weapon. Once defeated, the Dragonborn is instructed to seize Potema's skull. There is also a chest near the back door containing loot. Her ghostly remains carry little in terms of loot, unless careful use of the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt;, if obtained beforehand, allows her to be defeated to claim her rare &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Raiment\"&gt;Fine Raiment&lt;/a&gt; clothes her ghost was wearing.\nThere may be another draugr up the stairs depending on the Dragonborn's level beyond this point. One will pass a room with two thrones. Each throne will be occupied, probably by a Draugr Deathlord and another type (which is level-dependent). Once the Dragonborn exits here they will find themselves on a ledge on the side of the mountain north of Solitude. Another chest rests on the ledge, along with one or two potions and a leveled weapon.\nReturn Potema's remains to Styrr so he can sanctify them and then head to &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; for the reward. Returning Potema's remains to Styrr counts towards helping the people of Haafingar Hold to become Thane of Haafingar for Elisif."}

Between a slim wall that stretched from the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; to the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; and a surrogate champion in the form of his nephew &lt;a href=\"Count%20Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Carolus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding countryside were spared both the retaliation of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and the degradation of the war that followed. But there were still plenty of opportunities for the Wolf of Kvatch to take on the Imperial Dragon.\nCarolus Aquilarios idolized his uncle and was eager to help when Varen declared open rebellion against the Emperor. In fact, Carolus wanted to join Varen and fight alongside him as he marched toward the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. But Varen had other plans for Carolus. He wanted someone he could trust to protect the homefront - someone like his honorable nephew. Disappointed not to be beside Varen and in the midst of the action, Carolus nevertheless vowed to keep Kvatch and its people safe, just as his uncle knew he would. He immediately assumed temporary command of the County of Kvatch.\nShortly after Varen and the majority of Second Legion departed the Gold Coast, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prefect\"&gt;Imperial Prefect&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ephem%20Benirus\"&gt;Ephem Benirus&lt;/a&gt;, the Count of Anvil, sent &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; forces stationed in the coastal city inland to seize Varen Aquilarios's property and holdings. Carolus rallied the single cohort of the Second Legion that Varen left in his command, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Warders\"&gt;Kvatch Warders&lt;/a&gt; - the famed defenders of the city. Kvatch's defenders met the Imperial forces on the plains below the city. The battle was short and fierce, ending with the remnants of Anvil's forces - now greatly reduced - retreating back the way they had come. The Wolf of Kvatch had repelled an attack by the Imperial Dragon.\nBefore the year was out, Anvil sent its dwindling Imperial troops against Kvatch three more times, and each time they came away beaten and fewer than they were before. Then, word reached the region that Varen Aquilarios has ascended to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Carolus, who was being called the Wolf of Kvatch for his bravery and leadership, officially inherited the title of Count of Kvatch and took the wolf's head symbol and his own.\nUnfortunately, Kvatch's good fortune wouldn't last long. As soon as Carolus was officially named as Count of Kvatch, &lt;a href=\"Artorius%20Ponticus\"&gt;Artorius Ponticus&lt;/a&gt;, Primate of Kvatch, began working to undermine the count's authority and carve out more power and influence for himself. Always ambitious and powerful in his own right as the religious authority of Cyrodiil, the Primate had a grudgingly civil relationship with Varen, and had put aside his ambitions while Carolus struggled to keep Kvatch safe. With the change in regime in the capital, however, it appeared that the Primate sought a more influential position in the city's hierarchy. Before this challenge could come to a head, however, something significant occurred in Anvil.\nBut that's a tale for another book."}

After numerous attempts by the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; soldiers stationed at the port city to invade Kvatch, the barracks in Anvil were practically empty due to defeat after defeat at the Wolf's hands. Captain Fortunata's loyal pirates and buccaneers quickly took control of the city and she claimed the title of Provincial Governor for herself.\nThat might have been the end of things, as far as Count Carolus was concerned, except for what the Pirate Queen decided to do next. She declared that the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; was now an independent state, free and separate from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When she requested that Kvatch join Anvil as part of the new order, the count refused, preferring to continue to owe fealty to &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor Varen&lt;/a&gt;. Not feeling totally confident at the time, Fortunata didn't press the demand. But she wouldn't forget the count's lack of support. When the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; occurred and Varen disappeared, she took advantage of Kvatch's sudden isolation to make her demands more forceful.\nAnvil began pressing Kvatch to join the Gold Coast, both diplomatically and by increasingly underhanded means. Marauders and bandit gangs began to appear along the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; around Kvatch, disrupting trade and harassing travelers. Kvatch's elite guards, the Warders, were dispatched to deal with the bandits, but each time the bandits were able to escape to the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;. They returned in greater numbers, amplifying their attacks by raiding outlying farms and sending frightened refugees into the city for protection.\nDespite these acts of aggression, Carolus remained staunch and refused to negotiate with the Pirate Queen. Infuriated, Fortunata announced that Kvatch would be formally annexed into the Gold Coast. She sent the &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil Guard&lt;/a&gt; to take command of the city. The Count of Kvatch responded by putting the Warders upon the walls and sending the cohort out to confront the invaders. The opposing forces met on the Gold Road, near the &lt;a href=\"Gottshaw%20Inn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gottshaw Inn&lt;/a&gt;. The more disciplined and highly trained cohort scattered the motley guards from Anvil, but the situation wasn't as it appeared. It was a trap. An army of pirates exploded out of hiding and surrounded the cohort. While ragged and undisciplined, the pirates outnumbered the legionaries six to one. The cohort was wiped out in what has come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Gottshaw%20Massacre\"&gt;Gottshaw Massacre&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarolus Aquilatios had no choice. Without the support of the cohort, he had no option other than to swear fealty to the Gold Coast. Now, caught between the Pirate Queen and the Primate of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Count seethes at his powerlessness, all while doing everything he can to honor his vow and protect Kvatch and its people."}

She thought fancies were not appropriate to the son of a warrior.\n\"But there's it's tail! And the fangs drip with blood!\"\n\"It's a cloud,\" she repeated. She pushed me back into our home and closed the heavy wooden door behind her, bolting it for good measure. Even though I was but four or five at the time, I realized her anger was not directed at me. My mother was afraid of the wolf.\nFrom then on, I said nothing, though I often saw it. In the sky, in the woods, and sometimes out of the corner of my eye, I knew the wolf followed me wherever I went. And though it frightened my mother, I remained unafraid.\nUntil the day of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, I hid the wolf from others. But when we Nords were told by our &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl&lt;/a&gt;s that we were allied with &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; and their pets, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lizardfolk&lt;/a&gt;, I joined the rebellion.\nAnd in doing so, knowing we were now traitors to our own leaders, I decided to invoke the power of the wolf.\nOn the night of a new moon, I piled branches atop a hill to summon it with a bonfire. Trophies from my various kills, , blubber, and twisted bundles of dried sage joined the dried wood. I chanted, but the sounds were no words I'd ever heard before. They tumbled from my lips as I prepared to set my pyre ablaze.\nI saw it. I always saw it. Through the smoke, the wolf gained a more corporeal shape, its eyes as red as embers.\n\"Wolf! I know you not!\" I cried, throwing my arms open wide. \"But all my life you have been beside me. Join us in our rebellion against this unholy Pact!\"\nThe wolf sat, tilting its head to the side. Then it threw back its head and howled \u2026 with laughter!\n\"You mortals are so amusing!\" said the wolf. \"What makes you think a wolf would do anything useful? Now, I need to get out of this thing. It's got fleas.\"\nSo saying, the wolf leapt into the fire and was consumed. And I \u2026 I stood in shock, mouth agape. Who or what had followed me all my life, I cannot say.\nI was arrested that night beside my bonfire, I and my companions (none of whom, I add, had seen or heard the wolf), and I will be put to death tomorrow for my deeds.\nMy mark goes here, to show this is written by the monk's hand as my last request: X"}

It's said that Svargrim stood eye-to-eye with Kruntharth from atop the battlements as the monstrous warrior demanded tribute of our king and kingdom for his mercy. But did our high king yield? Nay! He leapt from the walls and tore open the throat of that Giant like a wolf preying upon a mammoth.

Of course, I've had to put up with more than my share of milk-drinkers and &lt;a href=\"horker\"&gt;horkers&lt;/a&gt;, but that's to be expected whenever we venture far from the borders of our beloved &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. But let me tell you about the experiences I've had.\nFirst, they say the stars have fallen from the sky and walk like men in this wasteland. I don't know about that, but I saw warriors of sand and dust rise from the battlefield like ancient specters. They were tough, but nothing that honest Nord steel couldn't take down.\nThen I ran into these strange monstrosities that seemed to be a mix of various creatures.

The locals called it a \"&lt;a href=\"Mantikora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mantikora&lt;/a&gt;.\" I called it ugly and hit it with my axe. A lot.\nAnd did I mention the cultists in my last letter? Yes, Craglorn has them, too. But these cultists are special. Call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; and give themselves high-and-mighty titles such as \"regents\" and \"exarchs.\" What a bunch of horkers! And would you believe it? They worship some kind of sky snake! Of all the possible deities to choose from, they decided that a creature that wiggles around on its belly was the end all and be all. I hit them with my axe. A lot. And it felt good!\nNow I'm enjoying a mead and preparing to enter the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Arena\"&gt;Dragonstar Arena&lt;/a&gt;. You'd be so proud of me, Papa! I've gathered a decent group of warriors and I think we have a chance to win this competition. Who knew a Nord, a Dark Elf, and two Argonians would make such a good team? I haven't been able to get all the details on what we'll be up against, but I figure it can't be much harder than the &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt; games. I'll write again after we win the trophy. Or whatever it is we win.\nYour daughter, &lt;a href=\"Belinka\"&gt;Belinka&lt;/a&gt;"}

Only slightly more stringent are the clan lines, which are matrilineal in nature. Ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt;, or head tribesman, these serve little purpose other than providing protection during times of war.

Unless a threat to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; presents itself, Bosmer consider the slaying of others to be simply unnecessary, and wagers are even made prior to raids regarding the theft of prized possessions without a drop of blood spilled.

There, he hoped to live in peace with his family.\nThe woodcutter's family lived well for a time, but without warning, the weather turned bitterly cold and spoiled the harvest. Before long, with their meager supply of food all but gone, the family was starving.\nLate one snowy night, a traveler knocked on the cabin door seeking shelter from the biting cold. Always generous of heart, the woodcutter welcomed the stranger into his home, apologizing that he had no food to offer.\nWith a smile, the traveler cast off his cloak to reveal the garments of a mage. As the woodcutter and his family looked on, the mysterious visitor reached into his satchel and withdrew a scroll tied with a silver ribbon. No sooner had the wizard unfurled the scroll and read the words aloud, when a great feast appeared from out of thin air. That night, nobody in the woodcutter's cabin went hungry. Day by day, the snow piled up. Every night, the mage produced another scroll from his bag and read the words, each time summoning a new feast. On the fifth night, the woodcutter's wife awoke her husband to confess her mistrust of their magical guest. Surely, she argued, there was some price to pay for the magical feasts that everyone enjoyed night after night.\nThe woodcutter would have none of it. After nearly dying from the lack of food, his family was eating well. The Divines had sent them a gift, he explained, and it was foolish to question their wisdom.\nBut the woodcutter's wife would not be persuaded. Every night, she grew more fearful and more desperate. She was certain that the family had entered into a Devil's bargain, and the time would soon come when the mage would ask for something unspeakable in return for his gifts.\nWhile everyone in the cabin slept, the woodcutter's wife snuck out of bed and took her husband's axe in hand. She crept into the traveler's room and with one swing, lopped off his head.\nSuddenly, the wizard's disembodied head awoke. His eyes opened wide and when he beheld his maimed body, he let forth a terrible cry.\nAwakened by the horrified scream, the woodcutter and his children rushed into the room and gasped at the terrible sight of the decapitated mage.\nWith his last gasp of breath, the traveler laid a fearful curse on the woodcutter's wife. After her mortal death, she was damned to rise once again and walk the woods alone only to burn at the rising of the sun.\nTo this day, those who walk the pine forest late at night tell tales of a weeping woman glimpsed between the trees. She carries a bloody axe, the stories say, and is terrifying to behold."}

One of his legs was thinner than the other. Sometimes he forgot.\n\"Now to figure out where I am,\" Willowleg said. He looked at the swaying leaves high above, the hint of blue sky occasionally peeking through. To anyone but a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt;, those brief glimpses would convey nothing, but Willowleg immediately turned to continue on his way.\nSoon, he realized he wasn't alone. A little to his left walked another Wood Elf, dark green hair hanging unkempt about his face. Willowleg, used to traveling alone, noticed that his silent companion adjusted his pace to remain close without overtaking him.\n\"Going to &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, too?\" Willowleg asked.\n\"Yes.\"\nWillowleg said congenially, \"I hope I reach the summer site before it's too late.\"\nThe green-haired Wood Elf said, \"You'll be fine.\" His tone indicated he didn't wish to speak further, so Willowleg simply nodded and kept walking.\nThey traveled together, silently, for the rest of the day. When Willowleg stopped to rest, the stranger also stopped. Willowleg shared water and dried meat. Then they began the last part of their journey. The trees thinned out, leaving a clearing into which Falinesti fit perfectly.\nAt the clearing's edge, the stranger stopped and put a hand on Willowleg's arm. Surprised, Willowleg realized the green-haired Elf's skin was rough and thick, like bark.\n\"Stay here,\" the stranger said, murmuring an incantation.\nWillowleg, unable to move or speak, watched his companion walk to Falinesti's base and touch its bark with his forehead. The tree-city shuddered and began to move slowly, lifting its roots from the earth.\nAs the green-haired Elf walked off, leading Falinesti away, Willowleg felt the strange spell over him break, and movement returned with a tingling force through his limbs. He glanced down and saw that not only had his thin leg healed, but his shoes were missing.\n\"The Woodsmer,\" Willowleg whispered in awe. The Woodsmer, the mythic one who led the unwary astray in the woods, was also known to bestow favors on those who knew their way.\nAs Falinesti moved southward, Willowleg wondered which the city was."}

His portal to Sovngarde is located in the ancient dragon temple of Skuldafn, high in the Jerall Mountains. The only way to reach it is to set Odahviing free so he can fly the Dragonborn there.\"\nWalkthrough.\nFreeing Odahviing.\nThe quest will begin after speaking directly to Odahviing following his capture. The only way to reach Sovngarde's portal is to fly on Odahviing. Freeing him can be done by talking to a guard, located on the second floor of the Great Porch, who will pull the chain.\u00a0The trap can also be released by the Dragonborn pulling the chain. Odahviing will then offer to carry the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; cannot accompany the Dragonborn to Skuldafn. However,\u00a0if \"&lt;a href=\"Bound%20Until%20Death\"&gt;Bound Until Death&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spectral Assassin&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0can be summoned to use as company, as can other &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; creatures. If the player has completed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Chief%20of%20Thirsk%20Hall\"&gt;The Chief of Thirsk Hall&lt;/a&gt;\" added with , &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt; may randomly appear to help. An exception to this is Odahviing, who states on arrival that he can take the Dragonborn no further and indeed, &lt;a href=\"Call%20Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Call Dragon&lt;/a&gt; does not work in Skuldafn.\nBeware that, once Skuldafn is reached, there is no turning back, as fast travel is impossible. The player should get rid of all the non-essential items, and if one desires to collect the maximum amount of loot, equip as many armor parts enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Carry%20Weight\"&gt;Fortify Carry Weight&lt;/a&gt; as possible, as well as potions which increase maximum &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;carry weight&lt;/a&gt; even further. If they use enchanted weapons, stocking up on filled soul gems is practical, as there will be nowhere to restock or recharge until the Dragonborn exits Sovngarde. Once mounted on Odahviing to take them to Skuldafn, that's the point of no return until completing \"&lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonslayer\"&gt;Dragonslayer&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSkuldafn Temple's Courtyard.\nOdahviing leaves the Dragonborn on a small area west of the Skuldafn temple. As soon as the Dragonborn arrives, it is likely that they will encounter a leveled &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; will also be guarding the temple and must be dealt with or sneaked past. The path crosses a bridge to the east, proceeds under an arch, then turns south. Another dragon will be likely waiting further ahead.\nThe first of two optional areas (Skuldafn South Tower) is straight ahead to the south. It contains random treasures and draugr. The courtyard turns to the left (east) and climbs up a set of stairs to the second level. There are many leveled draugr waiting above, positioned at high vantage points throughout the courtryard area, which makes this area challenging to get through. Just beyond the top of the steps are two archways that lead under a bridge. Beyond that,\u00a0Skuldafn North Tower can be seen in the southeast corner of the courtyard, on the third level, but it can't yet be reached because there is a relatively sheer wall that can't be climbed.\nThe path through the courtyard turns left (north), besides the path that hugs the wall in the right, there is a doorway to a short tower on the left. A set of wooden steps inside the tower lead up to a second floor with a chest, otherwise the tower is a dead end. Back outside, the path north leads to another two archways under a bridge, then to a set of stairs that finally lead up to the level of the bridges (the third level) and then on to the fourth (top) level. At the landing between the two halves of the stairs, it is possible to turn left (west), then left again (south) and walk along a ledge that leads to the bridges previously walked under.\nThe first bridge encountered (the second one walked underneath) leads east to a ledge that runs north and south. To the north is the landing previously encountered. To the south is the main body of the upper courtyard, with Skuldafn North Tower ahead against the left (east) wall. This tower contains more draugr and chests.\nThere are three other sets of stairs leading up from this third level. The stairs to the northeast, and the stairs that are found by staying to the right and walking around to the west side of the third level, lead up to the fourth level of the courtyard, which is the level of the temple itself (this can also be reached by simply continuing up the stairs from the landing noted earlier). Another set of stairs from the south side of the third level leads to a table with a chest on it that contains nothing but some gold.\nA treasure chest is located to the left (west) of the temple's entrance, around the corner on a ledge, which only holds some gold.\nSkuldafn Temple.\nThe temple itself begins in a large area with a huge column directly ahead (north). To the right is a table with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Embalming%20Tool\"&gt;embalming gear&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and several potions. To the right of the column is a chest containing minor loot, while a dart trap protects the path on the left side. There are several leveled draugr to deal with. On the north side of the column is a table with six urns (three on each side).\nFrom there, two sets of stairs lead further north to the first puzzle room, which is guarded by several lower-level draugr. This puzzle is made of three pillars with three sides each: the first depicting a bird, the second a snake, and the third a whale. A lever is just north of the pillars. Two different combinations each open a different gate. The gate to the right (against the east wall) opens to a treasure chest, while the one to the left (against the west wall) opens the way to the rest of the temple. When looking at the puzzle from the lever, the left pillar's wall-facing side (i.e. its left side) should depict a snake (facing the matching plate on the wall), while the right pillar should have a whale facing the other wall with the matching plate. The center pillar dictates which gate opens. The bird opens the right gate, while the snake opens the left gate.\nStanding at the lever facing the pillars, this is what should be seen:\n[Bird] [Bird] [Bird]-\u00a0opens right gate\n[Bird] [Snake] [Bird] - opens left gate\nThe direction the lever points makes no difference. Simply activating it, regardless of its position, will open or close the gate corresponding to the center pillar's position.\nThe path through the left gate proceeds up stairs, then turns left (west) where there are more stairs up. The path leads to the upper level of a medium-sized two-level room with several draugr at the bottom of wooden ramps leading down. A table supports the corpse of a draugr and several urns, while between the ramps is a chest. Through a narrow opening to the west is a web-covered crypt area that leads to the right (north), where three &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; are at the top of a ramp. The path turns right (east) and leads through a web-covered doorway that needs to be cut. Beyond that, the path turns back left (north), where another spider is found guarding a short set of steps up. At the end of a short hall, the path again turns right (east), leading up another set of steps to more spiders and an iron door. There is a chest buried under the spider web just before and to the right of the iron door, near the egg sac.\nBehind the door is the second puzzle room, which is guarded by several more leveled draugr. This is a two-leveled room, where there is a log ramp leading up to the second level. The correct symbol for the pillar directly in front of the door is snake (found behind the pillar) on that side of the platform is a chest. The correct symbols for the other two pillars are above the alcoves where the pillars are located. The one on the second level to the right is bird, and the one on the second level to the left is whale, then activate the lever on top of the central platform, dropping a drawbridge leading to a door to another part of Skuldafn Temple. The puzzle can be bypassed by using the Whirlwind Sprint shout while on the platform near the lever, or by jumping across.\nBeyond the door, the path leads east, then turns north to a two-leveled room with several draugr. A table in the center of the bottom of the room holds an empty chest. Steps lead up to the north, then the path turns right (east) and leads clockwise around the room until the bridge is reached. Across the bridge is a doorway to a path leading west, then north to the base of a spiral staircase. However, a trap trigger will cause a lantern to drop onto the oil-covered floor, setting it ablaze, and also launches darts at the doorway. There are several urns and various loot around the bottom of the staircase.\nAt the top of the stairs is a gate to the north that cannot yet be opened, and a door to the south. Behind the door are three leveled draugr, a chest to the right, and a lever to the left that opens the gate. Through the gate is a slight upward incline, then the path turns right (east) and opens on a long hallway that is split into sections. At the end of the second section, a chest is on the right. Between the second and third sections is a trap trigger that will cause another lantern to fall on the oil-covered floor.\nAt the end of the hall, the path turns left (north), where the third puzzle room is found. The Dragonborn will have to face a leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;. The Diamond Claw should be looted from his dead body. Like all the dragon claws, the puzzle door's key is found on the claw's palm. It is, from the top to the bottom: [Fox]-[Moth]-[Dragon]\nBeyond the door, a word of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Call\"&gt;Storm Call&lt;/a&gt; shout is on a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; found at the north end of the room. This will be the only chance to obtain this word since the Dragonborn can never return to Skuldafn.\nJust before exiting there is a room on the right containing loot, including a random assortment of gems in a basin underneath a linen wrap.\nEntering Sovngarde.\nOn the roof of Skuldafn Temple, there is one elder dragon and one leveled dragon on each side of the portal, as well as four leveled\u00a0draugr. By luring the draugr close to the edge of the roof, it is possible to knock them off with &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;. If done quickly, they can be ran around while the shout recharges and be thrown off one or two at a time. The dragons will remain neutral unless provoked with &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;, an attack, or transforming into a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nDirectly across from the entrance to the roof (west), there is a tower with a leveled chest on the lowest level.\nA dragon priest is just ahead of the dragons' pillars. The priest's name is &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;, and his staff is the key to going to Sovngarde. After killing him, his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Staff%20%28Wall%20of%20Lightning%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest Staff&lt;/a&gt; can be looted from his body. This is also the only opportunity to get &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;his mask&lt;/a&gt;. To enter Sovngarde, his staff must be used on the altar, before jumping into the portal.\nIt is possible to enter the portal without fighting Nahkriin if the Dragonborn runs to the portal before it is closed (by Nahkriin reclaiming his staff). Conversely, if Nahkriin is sneak killed before he gets a chance to take his staff, it will still be in the seal. Despite the \"activate seal\" label on the seal, it cannot be activated nor the staff taken. At this point, the Dragonborn needs simply to walk into the portal.\nTactics to defeat Nahkriin.\n&lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt; can be difficult for lower leveled characters, especially those who are not resistant to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nNahkriin relies heavily on ranged attacks and will, at all times, keep his distance. In some cases, he will also cast a cloak spell and conjure a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronach&lt;/a&gt; before the fight, as a form of defense against melee-oriented foes, which means that attacks should be carefully planned. He may also cast &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt;, slowing the Dragonborn drastically for a short period of time, leaving them more vulnerable to attacks.\nLike every other Dragon Priest, Nahkriin wields a high-leveled staff, and having a good amount of healing potions might be necessary both for this fight and later on for Sovngarde. A few methods can be used to make the fight easier:"}

The Green Mother. Spirit of Harmony. Though her spirit has diminished, Nirni can still be felt in the warm sands, dense jungles, and all places where mortals have not disturbed the earth. The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; are her secret defenders, for her spirit seeds life on the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mortal Plane&lt;/a&gt;. This was &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;'s gift to Nirni. Because she always tried to compete with &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;'s favor, she is sometimes called the Jealous Sister. Despite this, it is said she was the only spirit more beautiful than Azurah.\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffer\"&gt;Y'ffer&lt;/a&gt;. The Elden Shaper. One of the Bastard Sons of &lt;a href=\"Ahnurr\"&gt;Ahnurr&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike his father, he was wise and kind. He convinced Nirni to be his mate by creating the first flower, and they had many children. Y'ffer was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Darkness\"&gt;Great Darkness&lt;/a&gt; sometime after the death of Lorkhaj. Consumed by chaos, Y'ffer struck Nirni, killing her. Azurah, &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; destroyed him in vengeance and made a cairn for Nirni out of his bones. Some &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;woodland folk&lt;/a&gt; say they can still hear his voice, but we Khajiit no longer speak of him.\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;. The Hunter. Spirit of Pursuit and Purposeful Change. Hircine was in love with Nirni, but she chose Y'ffer as her mate. In his sorrow, Hircine slew Y'ffer's champion, the &lt;a href=\"Graht-Elk\"&gt;Graht-Elk&lt;/a&gt;. Now he wears its head as a trophy. He is fond of Nirni's children and walks among them often. Khajiit should pray to Hircine when they have strayed from the Path, for the Father of the Hunt will always set them back upon it. Some tribes claim Hircine is the father of Nirni's first litter, who were as changeable as the &lt;a href=\"Moons\"&gt;Moons&lt;/a&gt;. They say these children were chosen as vessels for the &lt;a href=\"ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermorah\"&gt;Hermorah&lt;/a&gt;. The Watcher. Spirit of the Tides. Hermorah records all the events he perceives and stores them away in a &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;great library&lt;/a&gt; under the sea. A patient spirit, he helped Azurah maintain the Moons and their Motions after the world was made and Khenarthi could no longer bear to do so. He is the Keeper of the Knowledge of Others, and he shares all he learns with Azurah, who walks the halls of his library often. You should not call on this spirit unless you wish to be tested along the Path. It is best to leave Hermorah to his duty.\n&lt;a href=\"Sangiin\"&gt;Sangiin&lt;/a&gt;. Blood God of the Second Litter. Sangiin is not an evil spirit by nature, but Khajiit must know that all things within his sphere turn True Cats from the Path. These are the urges of blood and pleasure without purpose. To fall to Sangiin is not to give in to the Dark, but to give in to the flesh. He tries to tempt Khajiit into making their flesh &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;, and this is a prison to all spirits of the ja-Kha'jay. Sangiin is therefore a spirit that will test you on the Path and must be overcome. The secret to defeating him is to ignore him, and this we learned from &lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt;, who said: Lust for nothing but Truth."}

One good thing I can say about Orcs (and trust me there are few) is that they keep to themselves. They know their place, and they're about as trusting to those outside their kith as the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Good. That's how you survive.\nThough I am always aware of my superiority to other races, I am not above a conversation. Any fellow traveler may one day be met again on the road, and it's often pertinent for them to hold a good view of you. Many of my fellow Dark Elves would do far better if they knew when to smile, especially my compatriots who refuse to cling to the cities like babes to a teat.\nThis particular Orc introduced himself to me as Morbrogug as he sat beside me. The cornerclub that night was uncommonly crowded, and I was unable to maintain my usual lone table. Still, I smiled. I fought the urge to take my meal elsewhere, and held my breath against his odor. I even asked his destination.\nHe easily admitted that he wasn't sure, that he was just seeking a steady wage. His skills were limited to his strength, as is common among Orcs. I suggested mining or quarry work, tasks I've found wherein his breed often excels. He was hesitant to accept my suggestion, instead describing his supposed prowess as a warrior. I simply nodded and conceded the point, though I knew he was more than likely to end up doing physical labor than find work as a mercenary while in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was at this point that Morbrogug pointed out my armor. I noticed he had been eying it intently as we spoke, his eyes almost glittering at its sight. Yes, I do pride myself on taking proper care of my armor, but I suspected he had never seen its like before. Surely enough, he soon asked me what it was made of, and I held back my sigh and told him.\n\"Glass?\" he asked with a scrunch of his nose and a scratch to his head. \"What, like what they use in windows?\"\nAnother day, another ignorant member of the common rabble. \"No, it's not quite that,\" I replied with a forced grin. \"You see, it's made from malachite, which has the appearance of crystal. It's quite hard, but light enough for easy maneuverability. Though a metal, it's commonly referred to as glass, as are the mines where it's harvested. Always causes a bit of confusion with outlanders.\"\nMorbrogug rolled his eyes and banged his leather breastplate. \"We Orcs know the true worth of leather and metal! Give me that over your fancy glass any day. I bet I could shatter your armor with one swing of my ax. You've obviously never been up against a true warrior.\"\nNow, I do appreciate a sense of pride, but when pride turns to insults...\nI simply raised a brow. \"A bet, is it? Well then, I'll take you up on that wager. I'll give you my armor, which should at the very least turn you a pretty profit, if you defeat me in a duel. And if I win I'll have your leather armor. After all, fair's fair.\"\nHe stroked his wine stained chin and nodded. \"Deal. I could use some gold for a new weapon.\"\nThe only details of the fight that I care to recall was that it was quick and effortless, at least on my part. At the end of it all I had a sobbing Orc, begging me to take back my sacred word, claiming he could never find mercenary work without his own set of armor.\nI could only shrug as I gathered the leather pieces in my arms. \"There's always the quarry.\"\nYes, it is good to make friends while traveling. But it is far better to make a profit."}

And the last of the line, High King Ar-Azal, was most noble of all, for he it was who, for a time, brought an end to the strife of brother against brother, of &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow did this come to be? Hearken, and I shall tell the tale.\nUpon the passing of &lt;a href=\"Ja-Fr\"&gt;Ja-Fr&lt;/a&gt;, the estimable father of Ar-Azal, the Prince of &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;, and wore the &lt;a href=\"Diadem%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Diadem of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, and bore the title High King of Hammerfell. And all the nobles of Hammerfell sojourned to Hegathe to pay him obeisance. But the new High King, though so youthful as to be barely bearded, was in no wise (sic) a fool, and knew full well that his nobles' show of faithfulness was like unto a cloud, apparent but bereft of substance. For the Forebear nobles liked him not insomuch as Ar-Azal was a Crown, and the Crown nobles mistrusted him insomuch as his father had not crushed the Forebears. And Ar-Azal was in a quandary, for he must needs rule Hammerfell as High King, and yet his support was as weak as a woman who has just given birth.\nSo the Worthy Ar-Azal gazed from his High Tower upon the azure &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean&lt;/a&gt;, and prayed many prayers, and thought many thoughts. And presently he thought of the Admirable Zaqeeb, his tutor and mentor, a Priestess of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; and a sage renown. And he went to the Temple and spake unto the &lt;a href=\"Admirable%20Zaqeeb\"&gt;Admirable Zaqeeb&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he could not solve the riddle of how to reconcile the Crowns and Forebears. And the Admirable Zaqeeb gave him a libation, saying, \"Drink this tonight, O King, and dream.\" And taking the libation, the Worthy Ar-Azal retired in gratitude, and did as he was bade.\nAnd that night the Worthy Ar-Azal dreamed a dream of Satakal the World-Snake, who came to him in the guise of a &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Snakehead Potentate&lt;/a&gt;. And the Potentate did homage unto the High King, for he said it was given only to the Worthy Ar-Azal to solve this riddle. And the answer, he said twice, speaking once with each tongue, was to be found at the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;, being a Divine who received the veneration of both Forebears and Crowns.\nThen Ar-Azal heard the cry of a &lt;a href=\"Goshawk\"&gt;Goshawk&lt;/a&gt;, which bird is sacred to &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;, and he awoke, and it was the dawn of the day. And he made haste to the Shrine of Tava in Hegathe, wherein is the Fresco of the Goshawk, which depicts Tava in his nest with his mate. And lo, where once there was one mate depicted in the nest, now there were two, the second mate agleam in the morning light. And Ar-Azal said, \"Truly the Divines have shown me the answer. For has not the greatest Forebear Grandee, &lt;a href=\"Ebrahim\"&gt;Ebrahim&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, a fair and lissome daughter, &lt;a href=\"Fereshtah\"&gt;Fereshtah&lt;/a&gt;? And has not the greatest Crown Grandee, &lt;a href=\"Murahd\"&gt;Murahd&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;, a fierce and clever daughter, &lt;a href=\"Arlimahera\"&gt;Arlimahera&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nAnd that concludes, O Prince, my tale of Ar-Azal, your Worthy Great-Grand-Uncle. For I know that you are quick of wit, and will work out yourself how the High King solved his riddle."}

There is something life-changing about being in love,\u201d said Kepkajna gra-Minfang, sometimes called the Wraith. \u201cI haven't wanted to rob anyone or anything in weeks. Why, the other day, I saw the door wide open at a wealthy merchant's house, but my mind was fully occupied with what I should wear on my wedding day.\u201d\n\u201cYou have been out of the right society for very long now,\u201d frowned her friend Khargol approvingly. \u201cYou never told me what happened to your first husband, you know, the one the shaman gave you?\u201d\n\u201cTorn apart by ash ghouls,\u201d smiled Kepkajna dreamily. \u201cIt was rather saddish. But I know nothing like that would happen to Wodworg. No life of adventure for him. He's practically an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, he is one. Did I tell you how we met?\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of times,\u201d grumbled Khargol, reaching for his flagon. \u201cHe was your jailer, and he refused you food until you promised to marry him.\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever heard of anything so madly romantic in all your life?\u201d sighed Kepkajna, and then grew serious. \u201cI was going to say that I hope my old friends will wish me well, but as Old Bosriel used to say, there's no point in hoping for what cannot be. We'll leave with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Knights\"&gt;Imperial Knights&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; immediately after the wedding, but as long as we're in &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt;, the gang will find some way of disrupting my love life and bring me back to the light. I know it.\u201d\nAs the days approached towards the Wraith's wedding day, there was certainly something sinister in the air that Kepkajna could smell when she was not transported by heady bliss. Dark figures seemed to shift in the shadows and disappear when approached. She recognized the clothing of some beggars near Wodworg's cottage as costumes, but the mendicants hurried away before she could recognize which of her old gang was stalking her.\nBut these moments of apprehension were few. Kepkajna was truly happy, making arrangements for the ceremony to be performed at the very dungeon where Wodworg had imprisoned her. Her father was long since dead -- another victim of the ash ghouls -- but her fiance's commander volunteered to act in his behalf. Of course, Kepkajna had to supply her own dowry. She spent every last mark of her savings of ill-gotten gain to buy her beloved a truly wonderful present.\nThe wedding was set for the stroke of midnight, as is &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; tradition. The handmaidens, wives of Imperial officers, were busily sewing her into her gown of red velvet and fine gold filigree in the mid-morning. Dolcetta, one of the handmaidens, remarked that she had heard that Kepkajna had bought Wodworg a truly beautiful gift for her dowry.\n\u201cLet me show it to you,\u201d Kepkajna giggled, dashing from the room half-dressed to her hidden alcove. The present had been stolen.\nThe women were horrified, but the Wraith found herself merely irritated, not surprised. This was truly the old gang's style. They knew that a wedding ceremony without a dowry was marked as unlucky. She asked her handmaidens to finish dressing her quickly while she pondered what the burglars would have done with her treasure.\nThe whole region was honeycombed with secret lairs and abandoned sites thieves used to store their loot. There were obvious places, of course, but after much reflection, she thought of where she would have put it under similar circumstances. Once the handmaids had finished, Kepkajna bade them to make certain that the ceremony went on as scheduled, and not to fret as she might be a little late. She wrapped herself in a shawl to protect her gown from dungeon dust and set off for the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wraith had never before attempted to rob her own friends, and though she was peeved at them for trying to ruin her happiness, she had no interest in hurting them physically. Her style was to avoid conflict, though she knew it would be inevitable. The lessons her mentor Khargol had given her had helped her avoid the lances and blades of guards and Imperial Knights over the years: now she would see if they would allow her to survive a den of thieves and the unknown dangers of the Shrine. Without, most importantly, ruining her dress.\nThe desolate place was so empty as she delved into it that she feared she might have made a miscalculation. It was not until she found the small room hidden down a long corridor that she knew she was at the right place, and that it was well suited for an ambush. She grabbed the chest with her treasure within, and turned to face the assault.\nTwo of her old gang, Yorum and Yohr-i the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; twin brother and sister, were outside the door as she came from the room. They knew the Wraith better than to taunt her and immediately attacked. Yorum struck out with a left thrust of his blade while Yohr-i sought to rush her. The Wraith neatly sidestepped Yohr-i, while dropping her weight to her rear left leg, shifting her right shoulder to the left to slip past Yorum's strike. The twins crashed into one another and Kepkajna passed swiftly on.\nAlmost immediately, she was set on by the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; Binyaar, his mace whistling through the air at her head. They had never much liked one another. The Wraith snapped into a duck, so the mace whacked with a tremendous clamor against the stone wall. Binyaar was thrown off balance, giving her a few seconds lead hurrying up the passage. Ahead she could smell the fresh night air.\nThe last of her dowry's defenders was Sorogth, an Orc with whom she had shared a brief romance. It was he who Kepkajna knew had masterminded the theft. In a way and in context, she thought, his devotion to her misery was rather sweet. At the moment, though, she was most concerned with avoiding his barbed ax that seemed ideal for breaking her dress's fine stitchwork and the flesh beneath.\nBending her knees slightly, bobbing to avoid strikes to the head, weaving her head to confuse Sorogth of her next move, shuffling her feet arrhythmically, the Wraith made an impossible target. She ducked inside his thrusts, sidestepped his swings, and then sidestepped his thrusts, and ducked his swings. As erratic as she tried to make her defensive moves, Sorogth still kept pace with her, refusing to budge from his position at the dungeon outlet.\nMidnight was coming, and the Wraith finally decided that she must end the confrontation. When Sorogth swung out next, she sidestepped to her left, swayed down, and ducked her head, so the ax whistled over her right shoulder. In that instant, his right side was exposed, and she reluctantly smashed the chest hard into his torso. There was not enough time for Kepkajna to see if she had killed him or merely knocked him unconscious. In truth, she thought of nothing else but rushing to her wedding ceremony.\nAt precisely midnight, Wodworg and Kepkajna were united together. He was delighted with her dowry gift, a fine suit of armor that would make him the envy of other &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; jailers. Even more, he was enchanted by his wife's tale of retrieving it from the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u201cDid it occur to you to put on the armor when you knew that it was an ambush?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cI didn't want to dent your present,\u201d she replied, between kisses. \u201cAnd I certainly didn't want to wrinkle my gown.\u201d"}

Astara has asked me to back him up.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Ghost%20from%20the%20Past\"&gt;A Ghost from the Past&lt;/a&gt;,\" you may find &lt;a href=\"Grazda\"&gt;Grazda&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Gold Coast Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that Astara has a task for you, and that you should head to the sanctuary. Alternatively, the quest can be started by talking to Astara directly. \nAstara will tell you that she sent &lt;a href=\"Green-Venom-Tongue\"&gt;Green-Venom-Tongue&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Viria\"&gt;Lyra Viria&lt;/a&gt;, and that your job is to support him in that, or finish the job if he fails. Venom has tracked her to Knightsgrave in the northwest of the Gold Coast. Make your way there and head inside. Once there, look for hints on Green-Venom-Tongue's whereabouts, examining the statues on the way. You will find Green-Venom-Tongue down the stairs; he will ask you to help him solve the puzzle to open the door ahead. There are four braziers here, each paired with a statue similar to the ones you passed on the stairs. You must light the braziers in the order of these heroes' importance to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe correct order is as follows:\nOnce you have lit the braziers, follow Green-Venom-Tongue through the door. You will be taunted by a shadow of the Black Dragon; she is tracking your progress. Proceed down the stairs to the right and fight your way through several &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Minotaurs&lt;/a&gt;, then proceed into the Overlook of Time. Here, you will see a &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Sithis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrath of Sithis&lt;/a&gt; roaming the halls. Proceed on to the Chamber of the Enduring Flame. There will be a closed gate here; Green-Venom-Tongue can climb over it but you cannot. He will go on without you, but as he does so, another shadow of the Black Dragon will appear and open a hole in the wall, from which two minotaurs will come and attack you. Kill them, the head through the hole. \nIn the room with the statue, head west into the Order Armory. Make another left turn and fight your way through several undead until you find Venom again. He lost the fight with the Black Dragon and is now severely injured. Before he dies, he will tell you that Sithis is hunting her too. With his death, the task of killing the Dragon now falls on you. Proceed on into the Chamber of Shadow; along the way, the Dragon's shadow will tell you that she now sees through &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Primate Artorius&lt;/a&gt;'s lies. \nIn the circular room in the northeast of the dungeon, you will have to face off against the Dragon's shadows. There are five of them in total; they will start spawning once you step on the hourglass in the center of the room. When they are all dead, the Black Dragon will hint that this entire conflict was orchestrated by Primate Artorius and that this fight is exactly what he wants. Proceed through the door to the north and the Dragon will inform you that Primate Artorius knows the location of the sanctuary; she told him after she tortured its location out of &lt;a href=\"Brema\"&gt;Brema&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead on into the cave and you will find the real Black Dragon by the dragon statue. In combat, she likes to summon more of her shadows, so be prepared for that. Once you kill her, her soul will be taken by the Wrath of Sithis. \nAfter the Dragon is dead, leave the cave through the exit in the north, then head back to the Sanctuary and speak with Astara to finish the quest.

What a ghastly, ghastly day.\nI got up before dawn to see the sun rise over the mist banks, and inspect my garden (someone has been sampling the best leaves from my orlinber vines, and I don't know whether the thief be man, mer, beast, or spirit. At least the burglar left tracks behind this time, and apparently it has a tail. Unfortunately, that scarcely narrows things down.) Stichael &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; met me at the arbor gates, and the expression on his face, while not necessarily disgruntled, was far from gruntled.\nI don't know if I told you about the latest debates in our particular college, but the lines have been drawn between my students and those of that ridiculous cretin, that slave to pre-&lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran&lt;/a&gt; dogma, \"Master\" Balec Frel. Direnni was somewhat caught in between and tried to remain neutral, for which I respected him, but Frel did everything he could to lure him into his camp. Not surprisingly, Direnni saw through all the flattery, but today I've learned the depths of Frel's mendacity. Worse yet, Direnni believed him.\nOf course I was outraged by the suggestion that I would have plagiarized my friend's work and left in flash, literally.\nBack in my tower room, I felt the chill of a mid-morning breeze (you know how drafty these three thousand year old towers can be better than anyone) and I set about making a fire. I decide to use as kindling some papers that were lying around and as I was shoving them into the fireplace, who should knock on the door but Direnni and Frel? They assumed the absolute worst when they noticed that the papers that were in the fireplace were copies of Direnni's thesis about Oblivion being Being, that I was attempting to mask my \"crime.\" Preposterous. Over the course of the day, I convinced Direnni, at least, of my relative innocence, but clearly the fight is heating up.\nWhen I returned home to read your latest letter, I realized that I must have accidentally dropped it into the fire in my haste for warmth.\nWould you mind writing back and telling me what you had to say? It sounded very interesting from the few scraps I was able to retrieve from the coals.\nYours,Master Gosleigh Horlington.\nXal's letter - Day of the Counted Hours.\nDay of the Counted Hours&lt;a href=\"The%20Ruins%20of%20Kemel-Ze\"&gt;The Ruins of Kemel-Ze&lt;/a&gt;Port Telvanis&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;V\u00e9loth&lt;/a&gt;\nAch, Gosleigh, what you may have cost us both! Burnt or not, what was written was written in tibrol-oil, by the &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephalites&lt;/a&gt;, and you know what that means. All of Nicrythe will have to be warded against poetronachs. I send my luck.\nHere is the brunt of it (my fellow &lt;a href=\"Maruhkati\"&gt;Maruhkati&lt;/a&gt; have been summoned to the Cacophany at Sil and we leave at dawn):\n&lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, who you may recall from our days at Gwylim, has the whole of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; interested in the varied guises of &lt;a href=\"PSJJJJ\"&gt;PSJJJJ&lt;/a&gt; again. One of his cohorts, who signs only 'B', has pulled all manner of pamphlets to the fore in an effort to get at the heart of the matter. And, though they know it not, the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; is trembling as they near themselves to truth. (Incidentally, I have petitioned the Murder House for a Dram simulacrum, sixth-measure, in case Fyr or 'B'-- a Borgite, perhaps?-- come too close to waking the Sleepers.)\nThough the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Selective&lt;/a&gt; and Artaeum diverge on many matters of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Endeavour&lt;/a&gt;, I implore you to release to me the Scroll of Adompha; at the very least, have one of your scribes make me a copy (with all the requisite Direnni text-protections) and send it at haste.\nAfter I return to Kemel-Ze, I shall send another letter detailing my purpose, but do not let its absence hinder your favor. As forward compensation, perhaps you might take a visit to Master Frel on your way to the archives, and see what Eastern demon I have sent to visit his face.\nYours,Xal\nGosleigh's letter - 6th Rain's Hand.\n6th Rain's HandNicrythe Tower,Artaeum,Sumurset.\nMy dear Xal,\nHow dramatic things are in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. I had scarcely shot off my letter, and within but a few hours, I had your reply. Imagine how much more efficient the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; would run if they had our sort of delivery service. Why &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; would have some idea of the sort of \u2026 well, we can certainly get to that at a later date.\nSo, what I burnt was anointed by the Mephalites. They do make such a bother about things, don't they? I wouldn't be at all surprised if someone had to be sacrificed to the sixth spirit, old Black Hands the Spinner herself. Is the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; still in operation? We lose touch of such things down our way.\nYou needn't tell me about this \"B.\" Despite the attempts of our agent, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; (the lad who took the name of the &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; to inspire fear, though he hardly lives up to it), he continues to delve. I can see the use of the Scroll, but it seems \u2013 and you must excuse my, oh let me say it, &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt; protectionism on this \u2013 a little bit much. I mean to say, honestly. Really. Seriously. What is the worst that can happen?\nI know I shouldn't say that. But I do.\nHalf-way through this letter, I paid a visit on Master Balec Frel, and was informed that he had gone out for the evening. Inquiring further, I found he had been eaten. Though he would not be the first of the Psijics to be eaten by a hound of Oblivion and survived, I must admit a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\nPerhaps in lieu of the Scroll of Adompha, you will accept in my sincere appreciation, this, a very, very rare recipe for a potion which will cause whatever person is to the immediate left of you to be cured of &lt;a href=\"lycanthropy\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of their years under its spell. I can see how this might not be of much value in Morrowind, where lycanthropy is more rare than a sexually normal &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; mage, but it took considerable expertise, and not a little bit of luck, to perfect it.\nOh, and if you have an opportunity while in Kemel-Ze, would you be so kind as to ask a question about the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; for me to that ... you know who I'm talking about it, but her name escapes me ... she's kind of big, and ugly ... and she smells like death? ... anyhow, if you could ask her to reply to the letter I sent her a fortnight ago about whether the Kothringi and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; had, well, certain relations, that would be very helpful. Primary sources, of course.\nAnd now, I'm off to bed. I wonder why they call them Seducers \u2026\nYours ever,Gosleigh\nGosleigh's letter - 9th Rain's Hand.\n9 Rain's HandNicrythe Tower,Artaeum,Sumurset.\nMy Dear Xal,\nPlease reply back at your earliest convenience.\nI sent the potion, and I understand it wasn't quite what you were asking for, but if you have read my letters and understand the frailty of my position politically, you would understand that it would be very dangerous for me to ship items like the Scroll of Adompha to Morrowind Mephalites at this time. I hope you are merely furious at me and that's why you haven't written back, but I have heard, well, frankly, I've heard rumors of strange goings on in Morrowind of which I hope, for your sake, you are not a part. I fear though, knowing you, that you are involved.\nLife on Artaeum has not been without its drama either.\nA scandal erupted in my own college where one of my students (a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, a very sweet girl but given to brooding as so many of her kind are far from their chilly home) sought to explain the difference between possession and mind control by demonstrating them both. Chaos obviously ensued until I, Master Direnni, and Master il-Anselma were able to soothe the angry ancestral spirits.\nAn extremely ugly statue of Iachesis was destroyed (no great loss), but the part of my garden where I had all the marshmerrow and trama root you were so good to send me last springtide (and some Hammerfedlian poppies I had bought myself in Runcibae) and has been laid waste, utterly. And the blooms were growing so well too, even in our climate (if \"climate\" is really a meaningful word in Artaeum) it truly broke my heart.\nIt also made me reconsider your request.\nI have set one of my more discreet scribes to copying the Scroll for you, and I was hoping that in return, you might send me some marshmerrow seeds or rootlings and some trama cuttings for my garden, knowing how plentiful such weeds at out your way. Please reply back with all haste. At the end of next month, it will be too late for me to begin a new harvest.\nYours very fondly,Gosleigh\nXal's letter - Day of the Power/Knowledge.\nDay of the Power/KnowledgeDeshaan PlainV\u00e9loth\nDear Gosleigh,\nThe Cacophany wear gold and hideous masks and their instruments are built into their armor. Most have flute helms that span a foot or more, while the leader plays his ribs like a xylophone with broken bird bones. Their bottom halves all dance the same kind of impetuous, exaggerated march, kicking up dust, scaring off &lt;a href=\"scrib\"&gt;scrib&lt;/a&gt;s. The natives say this is all that's left of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe that's why there are so many Swooners, silk-webbed women (or painted men) that crawl behind them, crawl or wriggle in the dirt, an entourage of excess in the din. That's what strikes you most.\nWhat strikes you most is the clamor, their red noise wandering, a boom-boom-blare as they advance through the plain. They say this is a membership drive or a spell or a reenactment. They say this might all be a great joke of Sotha Sil. One Swooner dies or pretends to. The priest beside me, a Mephalite sporting a sigil-halo in lieu of the regular horned abbot's hat, tells me that these are the last dead leaves of the Velothi south. Seeing that I don't understand, he tries to correct himself: 'but the music they make is a skill that has been useful to &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt; many times since. Songs are words reborn.' By which, I guess, he meant to counteract the common saying, 'By the word I mean the dead.'\nAch, if only you were here, Gosleigh! Your notions that the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; shaper talents have moved east and into melody are proved correct!\nWe left earlier than expected. I doubt our correspondence will be as immediate as it has been in the past. Perhaps you have already responded; if so, forgive my delay, as the road through the south mainland is full of listening frames that I dare not compromise. Again, I urge you to procure for me the Adompha scroll, and hope that you will not meet with hindrance.\nBegging your patience,Xal\nGosleigh's letter - 10 Rain's Hand.\n10 Rain's HandNicrythe Tower,Artaeum,Sumurset.\nMy Dear Xal,\nThis will probably be the third of the letters you receive in &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvanni\"&gt;Port Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; when you arrive. I received your letter within hours after sending off a copy of the Scroll, which you'll learn in the first of the letters, was not my initial impulse. It's too early to say what the repercussions will be sending it to you, but I hope it will help. I will be fascinated to hear how the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecies\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecies&lt;/a&gt; play out, as I understand they will, and very soon. I count on you to keeping me informed about that, whatever you hear.\nI'm fascinated by your story about Kemel-Re. Was it a special ceremony you witnessed, a festival, something religious in nature? Is this anything that happens in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; as well, or is it a strictly mainland ritual?\nOn the Ayleids, ah yes. Don't tell me you saw any of them in Morrowind did you? You might look for a series of books I understand are being published there about the last year of the First Era, which feature an encounter with the Ayleids in the middle of the series, maybe book 4 or 5. I would appreciate it if you would give me a copy if you come across it, together with those roots and seeds I mentioned before.\nNow I must finish and send this letter off. I am being called to a meeting of the Masters of Artaeum.\nYours,Gosleigh\nGosleigh's letter - 20 Rain's Hand.\n20 Rain's HandNicrythe Tower,Artaeum,Sumurset.\nMy Dear Xal,\nIt's been ten days and I've yet to receive any word from you. I'm hoping that you're not dead. I'm hoping further that the seeds and saplings I asked you to send are en route with a letter. Springtide is turning to Summertide and if I don't have the plants soon, it will be too late to set them properly.\nI've instructed my assistant Jolfer to take care of anything I receive over the next couple of days or weeks. I can't go into the details, but suffice it to say, I will be in the Dreaming Cave. Yes. And to your next question, no, there is no one but me who can go on this. Believe me, Direnni, who is a fool (which is made plainer every day) would take my place if he could.\nSo you see there is no telling how long I will be gone. I've specifically told Jolfer not to open any letters addressed to me (fearing that you might make reference to my recent shipment, which the Council of Artaeum might frown upon), but don't let that hold you back. I demand as my right as your friend to hear everything about your trip.\nNow I must go. They must tattoo me for my trip. I'm sure I'll look like a perfect ass. The daedra should be very amused.\nYours,Gosleigh"}

Not until the sun burned through her window, infusing the light wood and flesh colors of her chamber in a milky glow did she open her eyes. It was quiet and serene, a stunning reverse of the flavor of her dreams, so full of blood and celebration. For a few moments, she simply stared at the ceiling, trying to sort through her visions.\nIn the courtyard of her palace was a boiling pool which steamed in the coolness of the winter morning. At the wave of her hand, it cleared and she saw the face and form of her lover &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; in his study to the north. She did not want to speak right away: he looked so handsome in his dark red robes, writing his poetry as he did every morning.\n\"Vivec,\" she said, and he raised his head in a smile, looking at her face across thousands of miles. \"I have seen a vision of the end of the war.\"\n\"After eighty years, I don't think anyone can imagine an end,\" said Vivec with a smile, but he grew serious, trusting Almalexia's prophecies. \"Who will win? Morrowind or the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Without &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind, we will lose,\" she replied.\n\"My intelligence tells me the Empire will strike us to the north in early springtide, by &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt; at the latest. Could you go to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; and convince him to return?\"\n\"I'll leave today,\" she said, simply.\n4 Morning Star, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;The Empress&lt;/a&gt; paced around her cell. Wintertide gave her wasteful energy, while in the summer she would merely sit by her window and be grateful for each breath of stale swamp wind that came to cool her. Across the room, her unfinished tapestry of a dance at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Court seemed to mock her. She ripped it from its frame, tearing the pieces apart as they drifted to the floor.\nThen she laughed at her own useless gesture of defiance. She would have plenty of time to repair it and craft a hundred more. The Emperor had locked her up in Castle Giovesse seven years ago, and would likely keep her here until he or she died.\nWith a sigh, she pulled the cord to call her knight, &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt;. He appeared at the door within minutes, fully uniformed as befitted an Imperial Guard. Most of the native &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; tribesmen of Black Marsh preferred to go about naked, but Zuuk had taken a positive delight to fashion. His silver, reflective skin was scarcely visible, only on his face, neck, and hands.\n\"Your Imperial Highness,\" he said with a bow.\n\"Zuuk,\" said Empress Tavia. \"I'm bored. discuss methods of assassinating my husband today.\""}

The air above it vibrated with the waves of heat. Though each student kept his or her face sturdy and emotionless, as a true &lt;a href=\"Psijic\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt; should, their terror was nearly as palpable as the heat. &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; closed his eyes and uttered the charm of fire resistance. Slowly, he walked across the basin of leaping flames, climbing to the other side, unscathed. Not even his white robe had been burned.\n\"The charm is intensified by the energy you bring to it, by your own skills, just as all spells are,\" he said. \"Your imagination and your willpower are the keys. There is no need for a spell to give you a resistance to air, or a resistance to flowers, and after you cast the charm, you must forget there is even a need for a spell to give you resistance to fire. Do not confuse what I am saying: resistance is not about ignoring the fire's reality. You will feel the substance of flame, the texture of it, its hunger, and even the heat of it, but you will know that it will not hurt or injure you.\"\nThe students nodded and one by one, they cast the spell and made the walk through the fire. Some even went so far as to bend over and scoop up a handful of fire and feed it air, so it expanded like a bubble and melted through their fingers. Sotha Sil smiled. They were fighting their fear admirably.\nThe Chief Proctor Thargallith came running from the arbor arches, \"Sotha Sil! &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; has arrived on Artaeum. &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt; told me to fetch you.\"\nSotha Sil turned to Thargallith for only a moment, but he knew instantly from the screams what had transpired. The Nord lad Wellig had not cast the spell properly and was burning. The smell of scorched hair and flesh panicked the other students who were struggling to get out of the basin, pulling him with them, but the incline was too steep away from the entry points. With a wave of his hand, Sotha Sil extinguished the flame.\nWellig and several other students were burned, but not badly. The sorcerer cast a healing spell on them, before turning back to Thargallith.\n\"I'll be with you in a moment, and give Almalexia the time to shake the road dust from her train,\" Sotha Sil turned back to the students, his voice flat. \"Fear does not break spells, but doubt and incompetence are the great enemies of any spellcaster. Master Wellig, you will pack your bags. I'll arrange for a boat to bring you to the mainland tomorrow morning.\"\nThe sorcerer found Almalexia and Iachesis in the study, drinking hot tea, and laughing. She was more beautiful than he had remembered, though he had never before seen her so disheveled, wrapped in a blanket, dangling her damp long black tresses before the fire to dry. At Sotha Sil's approach, she leapt to her feet and embraced him.\n\"Did you swim all the way from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;?\" he smiled.\n\"It's pouring rain from &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; down to the coast,\" she explained, returning his smile.\n\"Only a half a league away, and it never rains here,\" said Iachesis proudly. \"Of course, I sometimes miss the excitement of Summerset, and sometimes even the mainland itself. Still, I'm always very impressed by anyone out there who gets anything accomplished. It is a world of distractions. Speaking of distractions, what's all this I hear about a war?\"\n\"You mean the one that's been bloodying the continent for the last eighty years, Master?\" asked Sotha Sil, amused.\n\"I suppose that's the one I mean,\" said Iachesis with a shrug of his shoulders. \"How is that war going?\"\n\"We will lose it, unless I can convince Sotha Sil to leave Artaeum,\" said Almalexia, losing her smile. She had meant to wait and talk to her friend in private, but the old &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; gave her courage to press on. \"I have had visions; I know it to be true.\"\nSotha Sil was silent for a moment, and then looked at Iachesis, \"I must return to Morrowind.\"\n\"Knowing you, if you must do something, you will,\" sighed the old Master. \"The Psijics' way is not to be distracted. Wars are fought, Empires rise and fall. You must go, and so must we.\"\n\"What do you mean, Iachesis? You're leaving the island?\"\n\"No, the island will be leaving the sea,\" said Iachesis, his voice taking on a dreamy quality. \"In a few years, the mists will move over Artaeum and we will be gone. We are counselors by nature, and there are too many counselors in Tamriel as it is. No, we will go, and return when the land needs us again, perhaps in another age.\"\nThe old Altmer struggles to his feet, and drained the last sip of his drink before leaving Sotha Sil and Almalexia alone: \"Don't miss the last boat.\""}

I thought perhaps you were ... indisposed with the lovely &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"She's taking the baths at &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup\"&gt;Mir Corrup&lt;/a&gt;,\" the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; said miserably.\n\"Please, come in.\"\n\"I've reached the stage where I can only trust three people: you, my son the &lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;, and Rijja,\" said the Emperor petulantly. \"My entire council is nothing but a pack of spies.\"\n\"What seems to be the matter, Your Imperial Majesty?\" asked the Potentate Versidue-Shaie sympathetically, drawing closed the thick curtain in his chamber. Instantly all sound outside the room was extinguished, echoing footsteps in the marble halls and birds in the springtide gardens.\n\"I've discovered that a notorious poisoner, an &lt;a href=\"Orma\"&gt;Orma&lt;/a&gt; tribeswoman from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Catchica\"&gt;Catchica&lt;/a&gt;, was with the army at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Suvio\"&gt;Caer Suvio&lt;/a&gt; while we were encamped there when my son was poisoned, before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;battle at Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure she would have preferred to kill me, but the opportunity didn't present itself,\" The Emperor fumed. \"The Council suggests that we need evidence of her involvement before we prosecute.\"\n\"Of course they would,\" said the Potentate thoughtfully. \"Particularly if one or more of them was in on the plot. I have a thought, Your Imperial Majesty.\"\n\"Yes?\" said Reman impatiently. \"Out with it!\"\n\"Tell the Council you're dropping the matter, and I will send out the Guard to track this Catchica down and follow her. We will see who her friends are, and perhaps get an idea of the scope of this plot on Your Imperial Majesty's life.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Reman with a satisfied frown. \"That's a capital plan. We will track this scheme to whomever it leads to.\"\n\"Decidedly, Your Imperial Majesty,\" smiled the Potentate, parting the curtain so the Emperor could leave. In the hallway outside was Versidue-Shaie's son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;. The boy bowed to the Emperor before entering the Potentate's chamber.\n\"Are you in trouble, father?\" whispered the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; lad. \"I heard the Emperor found out about whatshername, the poisoner.\"\n\"The great art of &lt;a href=\"speechcraft\"&gt;speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;, my boy,\" said Versidue-Shaie to his son. \"Is to tell them what they want to hear in a way that gets them to do what you want them to do. I need you to get a letter to Catchica, and make certain that she understands that if she does not follow the instructions perfectly, she is risking her own life more than ours.\"\n13 Second Seed, 2920\nMir Corrup, Cyrodiil\nRijja sank luxuriantly into the burbling hot spring, feeling her skin tingle like it was being rubbed by millions of little stones. The rock shelf over her head sheltered her from the misting rain, but let all the sunshine in, streaming in layers through the branches of the trees. It was an idyllic moment in an idyllic life, and when she was finished she knew that her beauty would be entirely restored. The only thing she needed was a drink of water. The bath itself, while wonderfully fragrant, tasted always of chalk.\n\"Water!\" she cried to her servants. \"Water, please!\"\nA gaunt woman with rags tied over her eyes ran to her side and dropped a goatskin of water. Rijja was about to laugh at the woman's prudery\u2014she herself was not ashamed of her naked body\u2014but then she noticed through a crease in the rags that the old woman had no eyes at all. She was like one of those Orma tribesmen Rijja had heard about, but never met. Born without eyes, they were masters of their other senses. The Lord of Mir Corrup hired very exotic servants, she thought to herself.\nIn a moment, the woman was gone and forgotten. Rijja found it very hard to concentrate on anything but the sun and the water. She opened the cork, but the liquid within had a strange, metallic smell to it. Suddenly, she was aware that she was not alone.\n\"Lady Rijja,\" said the Captain of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Guard\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt;. \"You are, I see, acquainted with Catchica?\"\n\"I've never heard of her,\" stammered Rijja before becoming indignant. \"What are you doing here? This body is not for your leering eyes.\"\n\"Never heard of her, when we saw her with you not a minute ago,\" said the captain, picking up the goatskin and smelling it. \"Brought you &lt;a href=\"neivous%20ichor\"&gt;neivous ichor&lt;/a&gt;, did she? To &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; the Emperor with?\"\n\"Captain,\" said one of the guards, running up to him quickly. \"We cannot find the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;. It is as if she disappeared into the woods.\"\n\"Yes, they're good at that,\" said the captain. \"No matter though. We've got her contact at court. That should please His Imperial Majesty. Seize her.\"\nAs the guards pulled the writhing naked woman from the pool, she screamed, \"I'm innocent! I don't know what this is all about, but I've done nothing! The Emperor will have your heads for this!\"\n\"Yes, I imagine he will,\" smiled the captain. \"If he trusts you.\""}

Besides himself and his companion, there were only a couple of old seadogs in the shadowy room, and they were more unconscious from drink than aware of what was going on around them. The grime of the unwashed floor was something you felt rather than saw. Copious dust hung in the air, unmoving in the sparse rays of dying sunlight.\n\"You have experience in heavy combat?\" asked Zuuk. \"The reward is good for this assignment, but the risks are great as well.\"\n\"Certainly I have combat experience,\" replied Miramor haughtily. \"I was at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; just two months ago. If you do your part and get the Emperor to ride through Dozsa Pass with a minimal escort on the day and the time we've discussed, I'll do my part. Just be certain that he's not traveling in disguise. I'm not going to slaughter every caravan that passes through in the hopes that it contains Emperor\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nZuuk smiled, and Miramor looked at himself in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi'&lt;/a&gt;s reflective face. He liked the way he looked: the consummate, confident professional.\n\"Agreed,\" said Zuuk. \"And then you shall have the rest of your gold.\"\nZuuk placed the large chest onto the table between them. He stood up.\n\"Wait before leaving,\" said Zuuk. \"I don't want you following me. Your employers wish to maintain their anonymity, if by chance you are caught and tortured later.\"\n\"Fine by me,\" said Miramor, ordering another grog.\nZuuk rode his mount through the cramped labyrinthine streets of Gideon, and both he and his horse were happy to pass through the gates into the country. The main road to Castle Giovese was flooded as it was every year in springtide, but Zuuk knew a shorter way over the hills. Riding fast under trees drooping with moss and over treacherous, slime-coated rocks, he arrived at the castle gates in two hours' time. He wasted no time in climbing to\u00a0Tavia's cell at the top of the highest tower.\n\"What did you think of him?\" asked the Empress.\n\"He's a fool,\" replied Zuuk. \"But that's what we want for this sort of assignment.\"\n30 Second Seed, 2920 &lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\nRijja screamed and screamed and screamed. Within her cell, her only audience was the giant gray stones, crusted with moss but still sturdy. The guards outside were deaf to her as they were deaf to all prisoners. The Emperor, miles away in the Imperial City, had likewise been deaf to her cries of innocence.\nShe screamed knowing well that no one would likely hear her ever again.\n31 Second Seed, 2920 &lt;a href=\"Kavas%20Rim%20Pass\"&gt;Kavas Rim Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nIt had been days, weeks since Turala had seen another human face, Cyrodiil or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. As she trod the road, she thought to herself how strange it was that such an uninhabited place as Cyrodiil had become the Imperial Province, seat of an Empire. Even the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0must have more populated forests than this Heartland wood.\nShe thought back. Was it a month ago, two, when she crossed the border from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0into Cyrodiil? It had been much colder then, but other than that, she had no sense of time. The guards had been brusque, but as she was carrying no weaponry, they elected to let her through. Since then, she had seen a few caravans, even shared a meal with some adventurers camping for the night, but met no one who would give her a ride to a town.\nTurala stripped off her shawl and dragged it behind her. For a moment, she thought she heard someone behind her and spun around. No one was there. Just a bird perched on a branch making a sound like laughter.\nShe walked on, and then stopped. Something was happening. The child had been kicking in her belly for some time now, but this was a different kind of spasm. With a groan, she lurched over to the side of the path, collapsing into the grass. Her child was coming.\nShe lay on her back and pushed, but she could barely see with her tears of pain and frustration. How had it come to this? Giving birth in the wilderness, all by herself, to a child whose father was the Duke of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;? Her scream of rage and agony shook the birds from the trees.\nThe bird that had been laughing at her earlier flew down to the road. She blinked, and the bird was gone and in its place, a naked Elf man stood, not as dark as a Dunmer, but not as pale as the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. She knew at once it was an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;, a Wild Elf. Turala screamed, but the man held her down. After a few minutes of struggle, she felt a release, and then fainted away.\nWhen she awoke, it was to the sound of a baby crying. The child had been cleaned and was lying by her side.

Ald Iuval and its sister city on the other side of the lake &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Malak\"&gt;Ald Malak&lt;/a&gt; were strategically important fortresses. He had been expecting a move against them for some time. His captain pulled down a map of southwestern Morrowind from the wall and smoothed it out, fighting a gentle summer sea breeze wafting in from the open window.\n\"They were heavily armored, you say?\" asked the captain.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Cassyr. \"They were camped out near &lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt; in the Heartland, and I saw nothing but &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt;, fine &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"siege%20equipment\"&gt;siege equipment&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"How about spellcasters and boats?\" asked Vivec.\n\"A horde of &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s,\" replied Cassyr. \"But no boats.\"\n\"As heavily armored as they are, it will take them at least two weeks, like you said, to get from &lt;a href=\"Bethal%20Gray\"&gt;Bethal Gray&lt;/a&gt; to Lake Coronati,\" Vivec studied the map carefully. \"They'd be dragged down in the bogs if they then tried to circle around to Ald Marak from the north, so they must be planning to cross the straits here and take Ald Iuval. Then they'd proceed around the lake to the east and take Ald Marak from the south.\"\n\"They'll be vulnerable along the straits,\" said the captain. \"Provided we strike when they are more than halfway across and can't retreat back to the &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Your intelligence has once again served us well,\" said Vivec, smiling to Cassyr. \"We will beat back the Imperial aggressors yet again.\"\n3 Mid Year, 2920\nBethal Gray, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Will you be returning back this way after your victory?\" asked &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bethal\"&gt;Lord Bethal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; barely paid the man any attention. He was focused on the army packing its camp. It was a cool morning in the forest, but there were no clouds. All the makings of a hot afternoon march, particularly in such heavy armor.\n\"If we return shortly, it will be because of defeat,\" said the Prince. He could see down in the meadow, the &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; paying his lordship's steward for the use of the village's food, wine, and whores. An army was an expensive thing, for .\n\"My Prince,\" said Lord Bethal with concern. \"Is your army beginning a march due east? That will just lead you to the shores of Lake Coronati. You'll want to go south-east to get to the straits.\"\n\"You just make certain your merchants get their share of our gold,\" said the Prince with a grin. \"Let me worry about my army's direction.\"\n16 Mid Year, 2920\nLake Coronati, Morrowind\nVivec stared across the blue expanse of the lake, seeing his reflection and the reflection of his army in the cool blue waters. What he did not see was the Imperial Army's reflection. They must have reached the straits by now, barring any mishaps in the forest. Tall feather-thin lake trees blocked much of his view of the straits, but an army, particularly one clan in slow-moving heavy armor, could not move invisibly or silently.\n\"Let me see the map again,\" he called to his captain. \"Is there no other way they could approach?\"\n\"We have sentries posted in the swamps to the north in case they're fool enough to go there and get bogged down,\" said the captain. \"We would at least hear about it. But there is no other way across the lake except through the straits.\"\nVivec looked down again at his reflection, which seemed to be distorting his image, mocking him. Then he looked back on the map.\n\"Spy,\" said Vivec, calling Cassyr over. \"When you said the army had a horde of battlemages, what made you so certain they were battlemages?\"\n\"They were wearing gray robes with mystical insignia on them,\" explained Cassyr. \"I figured they were mages, and why else would such a vast number travel with the army? They couldn't have all been healers.\"\n\"You fool!\" roared Vivec. \"They're mystics schooled in the art of Alteration. They've cast a spell of water breathing on the entire army.\"\nVivec ran to a new vantage point where he could see the north. Across the lake, though it was but a small shadow on the horizon, he could see gouts of flame from the assault on Ald Marak. Vivec bellowed with fury and his captain got to work at once redirecting the army to circle the lake and defend the castle.\n\"Return to &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Vivec flatly to Cassyr before he rode off to join the battle. \"Your services are no longer needed nor wanted.\"\nIt was already too late when the Morrowind army neared Ald Marak. It had been taken by the Imperial Army."}

Truth be told, a greater number would have turned out had &lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;the Prince&lt;/a&gt; returned, and the &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; knew it. Still, it pleased him to no end. Never before had citizens of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; cheered the arrival of an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; into their land.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; greeted him with a warm embrace, and then tore into the letter he had brought from the Prince.\n\"I don't understand,\" he said at last, still joyous but equally confused. \"You went under the lake?\"\n\"Ald Marak is a very well-fortified fortress,\" explained the Potentate. \"As, I might add, the army of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; has rediscovered, now that they are on the outside. To take it, we had to attack by surprise and with our soldiery in the sturdiest of armor. By casting the spell that allowed us to breathe underwater, we were able to travel faster than &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; would have guessed, the weight of the armor made less by the aquatic surroundings, and attack from the waterbound west side of the fortress where their defenses were at their weakest.\"\n\"Brilliant!\" the Emperor crowed. \"You are a wonderous tactician, Versidue-Shaie! If your fathers had been as good at this as you are, Tamriel would be Akaviri domain!\"\nThe Potentate had not planned to take credit for Prince Juilek's design, but on the Emperor's reference to his people's fiasco of an invasion two hundred and sixteen years before, he made up his mind. He smiled modestly and soaked up the praise.\n21 Mid Year, 2920\nAld Marak, Morrowind\nSavirien-Chorak slithered to the wall and watched through the arrow slit the Morrowind army retreating back to the forestland between the swamps and the castle grounds. It seemed like the opportunity to strike. Perhaps the forests could be burned and the army within them. Perhaps with Vivec in their enemies' hands, the army would allow them possession of Ald Iuval as well. He suggested these ideas to the Prince.\n\"What you seem to be forgetting,\" laughed Prince Juilek, \"is that I gave my word that no harm to the army or to their commanders during the truce negotiations. Do you not have honor during warfare on Akavir?\"\n\"My Prince, I was born here in Tamriel, I have never been to my people's home,\" replied the snake man. \"But even so, your ways are strange to me. You expected no quarter and I gave you none when we fought in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Arena\"&gt;Imperial Arena&lt;/a&gt; five months ago.\"\n\"That was a game,\" replied the Prince, before nodding to his steward to let the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; battle chief in.\nJuilek had never seen Vivec before, but he had heard he was a living god. What came before him was but a man. A powerfully built man, handsome, with an intelligent face, but a man nonetheless. The Prince was pleased: a man he could speak with, but not a god.\n\"Greetings, my worthy adversary,\" said Vivec. \"We seem to be at an impasse.\"\n\"Not necessarily,\" said the Prince. \"You don't want to give us Morrowind, and I can't fault you for that. But I must have your coastline to protect &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt; from overseas aggressions, and certain key strategic border castles, such as this one, as well as Ald Umbeil, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, and Tel Mothrivra.\"\n\"And in return?\" asked Vivec.\n\"In return?\" laughed Savirien-Chorak. \"You forget we are the victors here, not you.\"\n\"In return,\" said Prince Juilek carefully. \"There will be no Imperial attacks on Morrowind, unless in return to an attack by you. You will be protected from invaders by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;. And your land may expand by taking certain estates in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, whichever you choose, provided they are not needed by the Empire.\"\n\"A reasonable offer,\" said Vivec after a pause. \"You must forgive me, I am unused to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiils\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt; who offer something in return for what they take. May I have a few days to decide?\"\n\"We will meet again in a week's time,\" said the Prince, smiling. \"In the meantime, if your army provokes no attacks on mine, we are at peace.\"\nVivec left the Prince's chamber, feeling that &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; was right. The war was at an end. This Prince would make an excellent Emperor."}

Studded with statuary and fountains, the north gardens fit the Emperor's mood, as well as being the coolest acreage in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;the City&lt;/a&gt; during the heat of summertide. Austere, tiered flowerbeds of blue-gray and green towered all around them as they walked.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; has agreed to the &lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s terms for peace,\" said Reman. \"My son will be returning in two weeks' time.\"\n\"This is excellent news,\" said the Potentate carefully. \"I hope the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; will honor the terms. We might have asked for more. The fortress at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;, for example. But I suppose the Prince knows what is reasonable. He would not cripple &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt; just for peace.\"\n\"I have been thinking lately of &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; and what caused her to plot against my life,\" said the Emperor, pausing to admire a statue of the Slave Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; before continuing. \"The only thing I can think of to account for it is that she admired my son too much. She may have loved me for my power and my personality, but he, after all, is young and handsome and will one day inherit my throne. She must have thought that if I were dead, she could have an Emperor who had both youth and power.\"\n\"The Prince \u2026 was in on this plot?\" asked Versidue-Shaie. It was a difficult game to play, anticipating where the Emperor's paranoia would strike next.\n\"Oh, I don't think so,\" said Reman, smiling. \"No, my son loves me well.\"\n\"Are you aware that &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, Rijja's sister, is an initiate of the &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; conservatorium in &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked the Potentate.\n\"Morwha?\" asked the Emperor. \"I've forgotten: which god is that?\"\n\"Lusty fertility goddess of the &lt;a href=\"Yokudans\"&gt;Yokudans&lt;/a&gt;,\" replied the Potentate. \"But not too lusty, like &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. Demure, but certainly sexual.\"\n\"I am through with lusty women. The Empress, Rijja, all too lusty, a lust for love leads to a lust for power,\" the Emperor shrugged his shoulders. \"But a priestess-in-training with a certain healthy appetite sounds ideal. Now what were you saying about the Black Gate?\"\n6 Sun's Height, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil\nRijja stood quietly looking at the cold stone floor while the Emperor spoke. He had never before seen her so pale and joyless. She might at least be pleased that she was being freed, being returned to her homeland. Why, if she left now, she could be in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; by the Merchant's Festival. Nothing he said seemed to register any reaction from her. A month and a half's stay in Thurzo Fortress seemed to have killed her spirit.\n\"I was thinking,\" said the Emperor at last. \"Of having your younger sister Corda up to the palace for a time. I think she would prefer it over the conservatorium in Hegathe, don't you?\"\nReaction, at last. Rijja looked at the Emperor with animal hatred, flinging herself at him in a rage. Her fingernails had grown long since her imprisonment and she raked them across his face, into his eyes. He howled with pain, and his guards pulled her off, pummeling her with blows from the back of their swords, until she was knocked unconscious.\nA healer was called at once, but the Emperor Reman III had lost his right eye.\n23 Sun's Height, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\nVivec pulled himself from the water, feeling the heat of the day washed from his skin, taking a towel from one of his servants. &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; watched his old friend from the balcony.\n\"It looks like you've picked up a few more scars since I last saw you,\" said the sorcerer.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; grant it that I have no more for a while,\" laughed Vivec. \"When did you arrive?\"\n\"A little over an hour ago,\" said Sotha Sil, walking down the stairs to the water's edge. \"I thought I was coming to end a war, but it seems you've done it without me.\"\n\"Yes, eighty years is long enough for ceaseless battle,\" replied Vivec, embracing Sotha Sil. \"We made concessions, but so did they. When the old Emperor is dead, we may be entering a golden age. Prince Juilek is very wise for his age.

This matter must be settled with diplomacy or battle.\"\n25 Sun's Height, 2920\nTel Aruhn, Morrowind\nThe Night Mother met Sotha Sil in her salon, lit only by the moon. She was cruelly beautiful, dressed in a simple silk black robe and lounging across her divan. With a gesture, she dismissed her red-cloaked guards and offered the sorcerer some wine.\n\"You've only just missed your friend, the Duke,\" she whispered. \"He was very unhappy, but I think we will solve his problem for him.\"\n\"Did he hire the Morag Tong to assassinate the Emperor?\" asked Sotha Sil.\n\"You are straightforward, aren't you? That's good. I love plain-speaking men: it saves so much time. Of course, I cannot discuss with you what the Duke and I talked about,\" she smiled. \"It would be bad for business.\"\n\"What if I were to offer you an equal amount of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for you not to assassinate the Emperor?\"\n\"The Morag Tong murders for the glory of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and for profit,\" she said, speaking into her glass of wine. \"We do not merely kill. That would be sacrilege. Once the Duke's gold has arrived in three day's time, we will do our end of the business. And I'm afraid we would not dream of entertaining a counter offer. Though we are a business as well as a religious order, we do not bow to supply and demand, Sotha Sil.\"\n27 Sun's Height, 2920\nThe &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nSotha Sil had been watching the waters for two days now, waiting for a particular vessel, and now he saw it. A heavy ship with the flag of Mournhold. The sorcerer took the air and intercepted it before it reached harbor. A caul of flame erupted over his figure, disguising his voice and form into that of a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Abandon your ship!\" he bellowed. \"If you would not sink with it!\"\nIn truth, Sotha Sil could have exploded the vessel with but a single ball of fire, but he chose to take his time, to give the crew a chance to dive off into the warm water. When he was certain there was no one living aboard, he focused his energy into a destructive wave that shook the air and water as it discharged. The ship and the Duke's payment to the Morag Tong sunk to the bottom of the Inner Sea.\n\"Night Mother,\" thought Sotha Sil, as he floated towards shore to alert the harbormaster that some sailors were in need of rescue. \"Everyone bows to supply and demand.\""}

Water rushed down the narrow streets ankle-deep, and the Prince had to shout to be heard by his captains, who were but a few feet away from him.\n\"There's an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; up ahead! We'll wait there for the storm to pass before pressing on to Ald Lambasi!\"\nThe inn was warm and dry, and bustling with business. Barmaids were rushing back and forth, bringing &lt;a href=\"greef\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; to a back room, evidently excited about a famous visitor. Someone who was attracting more attention than the mere heir to the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Amused, Juilek watched them run until he overheard the name of \"Vivec.\"\n\"My Lord Vivec,\" he said, bursting into the back room. \"You must believe me, I knew nothing about the attack on &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; until after it happened. We will, of course, be returning it to your care forthwith. I wrote you a letter to that effect at your palace in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, but obviously you're not there,\" he paused, taking in the many new faces in the room. \"I'm sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Juilek Cyrodiil.\"\n\"My name is Almalexia,\" said the most beautiful woman the Prince had ever seen. \"Won't you join us?\"\n\"Sotha Sil,\" said a serious-looking &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in a white cloak, shaking the Prince's hand and showing him to a seat.\n\"Indoril Brindisi Dorom, Duke-Prince of Mournhold,\" said the massively built man next to him as he sat down.\n\"I recognize that the events of the last month suggest, at best, that the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt; is not under my control,\" said the Prince after ordering some wine. \"This is true. The army is my father's.\"\n\"I understood that the Emperor was going to be coming to Ald Lambasi as well,\" said Almalexia.\n\"Officially, he is,\" said the Prince cautiously. \"Unofficially, he's still back in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. He's met with an unfortunate accident.\"\nVivec glanced at the Duke quickly before looking at the Prince. \"An accident?\"\n\"He's fine,\" said the Prince quickly. \"He'll live, but it looks like he'll lose an eye. It was an altercation that has nothing to do with the war. The only good news is that while he recovers, I have the use of his seal. Any agreement we make here and now will be binding to the Empire, both in my father's reign and in mine.\"\n\"Then let's start agreeing,\" smiled Almalexia."}

Had he been in a better mood, the sight would have been breathtaking. As it was, he could only think that in practical terms, a small village like this would have meager provisions for himself and his horse.\nHe rode down into the main square, where an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt; called the Eagle's Cry stood. Directing the stable boy to house and feed his horse, Cassyr walked into the inn and was surprised by its ambience. A minstrel he had heard play once in &lt;a href=\"Gilverdale\"&gt;Gilverdale&lt;/a&gt; was performing a jaunty old tune to the clapping of the mountain men. Such forced merriment was not what Cassyr wanted at that moment. A glum &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman was seated at the only table far from the noise, so he took his drink there and sat down without invitation. It was only when he did so that he noticed that she was holding a newborn baby.\n\"I've just come from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;,\" he said rather awkwardly, lowering his voice. \"I've been fighting for &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Army\"&gt;Imperial Army&lt;/a&gt;. A traitor to my people, I guess you'd call me.\"\n\"I am also a traitor to my people,\" said the woman, holding up her hand which was scarred with a branded symbol. \"It means that I can never go back to my homeland.\"\n\"Well, you're not thinking of staying here, are you?\" laughed Cassyr. \"It's certainly quaint, but come wintertide, there's going to be snow up to your eyelashes. It's no place for a new baby. What is her name?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt;. It means 'Beauty of the Forest.' Where are you going?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, on the bay in High Rock. You're welcome to join me, I could use the company.\" He held out his hand. \"Cassyr Whitley.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the woman after a pause. She was going to use her family's name first, as is tradition, but she realized that it was no longer her name. \"I would love to accompany you, thank you.\"\n19 Last Seed, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Ald%20Lambasi\"&gt;Ald Lambasi&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nFive men and two women stood in the silence of the Great Room of the castle, the only sound the scrawl of quill on parchment and the gentle tapping of rain on the large picture window. As the Prince set the seal of Cyrodiil on the document, the peace was made official. The Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; broke out in a roar of delight, ordering wine brought in to commemorate the end of eighty years of war.\nOnly &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; stood apart from the group. His face betrayed no emotion. Those who knew him best knew he did not believe in endings or beginnings, but in the continuous cycle of which this was but a small part.\n\"My Prince,\" said the castle steward, unhappy at breaking the celebration. \"There is a messenger here from your mother, &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;the Empress&lt;/a&gt;. He asked to see your father, but as he did not arrive\u2014\"\n&lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Juilek&lt;/a&gt; excused himself and went to speak with the messenger.\n\"The Empress does not live in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Vivec.\n\"No,\" said &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, shaking her head sadly. \"Her husband has imprisoned her in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, fearing that she was plotting a revolution against him. She is extremely wealthy and has powerful allies in the western &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20estates\"&gt;Colovian estates&lt;/a&gt; so he could not marry another or have her executed. They've been at an impasse for the last seventeen years since Juilek was a child.\"\nThe Prince returned a few minutes later. His face betrayed his anxiety, though he took troubles to hide it.\n\"My mother needs me,\" he said simply. \"I'm afraid I must leave at once. If I may have a copy of the treaty, I will bring it with me to show the Empress the good we have done today, and then I will carry it on to the Imperial City so it may be made official.\"\nPrince Juilek left with the fond farewells of &lt;a href=\"the%20Three\"&gt;the Three&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind. As they watched him ride out into the rainswept night south towards Black Marsh, Vivec said, \"&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; will be much healed when he has the throne.\""}

The massive piles of earth and dung had been piled high in antiquity by some primitive, long-dead tribe of Black Marsh, hoping to keep out some evil from the north. Evidently, the evil had broken through at Dorsza Pass, the large crack in the sad, lonely rampart that stretched for miles.\nThe black twisted trees that grew on the barrier cast strange shadows down, like a net tangling. The Prince's mind was on his mother's cryptic letter, hinting at the threat of an invasion. He could not, of course, tell the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; about it, at the very least until he knew more and had notified his father. After all, the letter was meant for him. It was its urgent tone that made him decide to go directly to &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Empress had also warned him about a band of former &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; who attacked caravans going into Dorsza Pass. She advised him to be certain to make his &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; shield visible, so they would know he was not one of the hated Dunmeri slavers. Upon riding into the tall weeds that flooded through the pass like a noxious river, the Prince ordered that his shield be displayed.\n\"I can see why the slaves use this,\" said the Prince's captain. \"It's an excellent location for an ambush.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Juilek&lt;/a&gt; nodded his head, but his thoughts were elsewhere. What threat of invasion could the Empress have discovered? Were the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; on the seas again? If so, how could his mother from her cell in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Giovesse\"&gt;Castle Giovesse&lt;/a&gt; know of it? A rustle in the weeds and a single sharp human cry behind him interrupted his ponderings.\nTurning around, the Prince discovered that he was alone. His escort had vanished.\nThe Prince peered over the stretch of the moonlit sea of grass which waved in almost hypnotic patterns to the ebb and flow of the night wind billowing through the pass. It was impossible to tell if a struggling soldier was beneath this system of vibrations, a dying &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; behind another. A high, whistling wind drowned out any sound the victims of the ambush might be making.\nJuilek drew his sword, and thought about what to do, his mind willing his heart not to panic. He was closer to the exit of the pass than the entrance. Whatever had slain his escort must have been behind him. If he rode fast enough, perhaps he could outrun it. Spurring his horse to gallop, he charged for the hills ahead, framed by the mighty black piles of dirt.\nWhen he was thrown, it happened so suddenly, he was hurtling forward before he was truly conscious of the fact. He landed several yards beyond where his horse had fallen, breaking his shoulder and his back on impact. A numbness washed over him as he stared at his poor, dying steed, its belly sliced open by one of several spears jutting up just below the surface of the grass.\nPrince Juilek was not able to turn and face the figure that emerged from the grass, nor able to move to defend himself. His throat was cut without ceremony.\nMiramor cursed when he saw the face of his victim more clearly in the moonlight. He had seen the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; when he had fought in His Imperial Majesty's command, and this was clearly not the Emperor. Searching the body, he found the letter and a treaty signed by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; representing &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and the Prince Juilek Cyrodiil, representing the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Curse my luck,\" muttered Miramor to himself and the whispering grass. \"I've only killed a Prince. Where's the reward in that?\"\nMiramor destroyed the letter, as &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt; had instructed him to do, and pocketed the treaty. At the very least, such a curiosity would have some market value. He disassembled the traps as he pondered his next step. Return to Gideon and ask his employer for a lesser reward for killing the heir? Move on to other lands? At the very least, he considered, he had picked up two useful skills from the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;. From the Dunmer, he had learned the excellent spear trap. And abandoning the Imperial Army, he had learned how to skulk in the grass.\n2 Hearth Fire, 2920\nGideon, Black Marsh\nThe &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress Tavia&lt;/a&gt; lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars. Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands. Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovesse, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation. One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.\n\"She's just heard that her son is dead,\" he said quietly."}

The &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Reman%20III\"&gt;Emperor Reman III&lt;/a&gt; always attended a service at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, while his on and heir &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Juilek\"&gt;Prince Juilek&lt;/a&gt; found it more political to attend a service at a different temple for each religious &lt;a href=\"holiday\"&gt;holiday&lt;/a&gt;. This year, it was at the cathedral &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Benevolence's services were mercifully short, but it was not until well after noon that the Emperor was able to return to the palace. By then, the arena combatants were impatiently waiting for the start of the ceremony. The crowd was far less restless, as the &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Potentate Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; had arranged for a demonstration from a troupe of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; acrobats.\n\"Your religion is so much more convenient than mine,\" said the Emperor to his Potentate by way of an apology, \"What is the first game!\"\n\"A one-on-one battle between two able warriors,\" said the Potentate, his scaly skin catching the sun as he rose.\"Armed befitting their culture.\"\n\"Sounds good,\" said the Emperor and clapped his hands, \"Let the sport commence!\"\nAs soon as he saw the two warriors enter the arena to the roar of the crowd, Emperor Reman III remembered that he agreed to this several months before and forgotten about it. One combatant was the Potentate's son, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, a glistening ivory-yellow eel, gripping his &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wakizashi\"&gt;wakizashi&lt;/a&gt; with his thin, deceptively weak looking arms. The other was the Emperor's son, Prince Juilek, in ebony armor with a savage &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; helm, shield and longsword at his side.\n\"This will be fascinating to watch,\" hissed the Potentate, a wide grin across his narrow face. \"I don't know if I've even seen a &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; fight an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; like this. Usually it's army against army. At last we can settle which philosophy is better--to create armor to combat swords as your people do, or to create swords to combat armor as mine do.\"\nNo one in the crowd, aside from a few scattered Akaviri counselors and the Potentate himself, wanted Savirien-Chorak to win, but there was a collective intake of breath at the sight of his graceful movements. His swords seemed to be a part of him, a tail coming from his arms to match the one behind him. It was a trick of counterbalance, allowing the young serpent man to roll up into a circle and spin into the center of the ring in offensive position. The Prince had to pld forward the less impressive traditional way.\nAs they sprang at each other, the crowd bellowed with delight. The Akaviri was like a moon in orbit around the Prince, effortlessly springing over his shoulder at attempt to blow from behind, but the Prince whirled around quickly to block with his shield. His counterstrike met only air as his foe fell flat to the ground and slithered between his legs, tripping him. The Prince fell to the ground with a resounding crash.\nMetal and air melted together as Savirien-Chorak rained strike after strike upon the Prince, who blocked every one with his shield.\n\"We don't have shields in our culture,\" murmured Versidue-Shaie to the Emperor. \"It seems strange to my boy, I imagine. In our country, if you don't want to get hit, you move out of the way.\"\nWhen Savirien-Chorak was rearing back to begin another series of blinding attacks, the Prince kicked at his tail, sending him falling back momentarily. In an instant, he had rebounded, but the Prince was also back on his feet. The two circled one another, until the snake man spun forward, katana extended. The Prince saw his foe's plan, and blocked the katana with his longsword and wakizashi with his shield. Its short punching blade impaled itself in the metal, and Savirien-Chorak was thrown off balance.\nThe Prince's longblade slashed across the Akaviri's chest and the sudden, intense pain caused him to drop both his weapons. In a moment, it was over. Savirien-Chorak was prostate in the dust with the Prince's longsword at his throat.\n\"The game's over!\" shouted the Emperor, barely heard over the applause from the stadium.\nThe Prince grinned and helped Savirien-Chorak up and over to a healer. The Emperor clapped his Potentate on the back, feeling relieved. He had not realized when he fight had begun how little chance he had given his son at victory.\n\"He will make a fine warrior,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"And a great emperor.\"\n\"Just remember,\" laughed the Emperor, \"You Akaviri have a lot of showy moves, but if just one of our strikes comes through, it's all over for you.\"\n\"Oh, I'll remember that,\" nodded the Potentate.\nReman thought about that comment for the rest of the games, and had trouble fully enjoying himself. Could the Potentate be another enemy, just as the Empress had turned out to be! The matter would bear watching."}

They could have thought he was me!\"\n\"You're certainly correct, Your Imperial Majesty,\" replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously. \"And we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death. But we cannot do it without you. You must be brave for your &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThere was no reply.\n\"At the very least, come out and sign the order for &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Rijja\"&gt;Lady Rijja&lt;/a&gt;'s execution,\" called the Potentate. \"Let us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.\"\nA brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor. Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye. Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in &lt;a href=\"Thurzo%20Fortress\"&gt;Thurzo Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Hand me the order,\" the Emperor snarled. \"I'll sign it with pleasure.\"\n6 Hearth Fire, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\nThe strange blue glow of the &lt;a href=\"will%20o%27%20the%20wisp\"&gt;will o' the wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Tavia&lt;/a&gt; as she looked out her window. Now it seemed strangely comforting. Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon. It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it every day for seventeen years.\n\"Can you think of anything I've forgotten?\" she asked, turning to look back on the loyal &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I know exactly what to do,\" he said simply. He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin. She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.\n\"Make certain you aren't followed,\" she warned. \"I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years. And do take your share of it. You've been a good friend.\"\nThe Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists. Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed. With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; were fading into the misty afternoon. &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, as she plodded the &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; forward into an open pasture. Behind her, head nodding against his chest, &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; slept, cradling &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt;. For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it. Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reins.\nAs the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest. So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state. A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder. Cassyr opened his eyes.\n\"Where are we?\" he hissed.\n\"I don't know,\" Turala stammered, wide-eyed. \"What is that sound?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;,\" he whispered. \"A hunting party. Head for the thicket quickly.\"\nTurala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted. He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes. A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer. Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse. All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed. Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried. Now she was grateful for it. With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field. Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.\n\"With luck,\" he murmured. \"They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.\"\nAs he spoke, a horde of Orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns. Turala had seen Orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence. Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid. The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds. Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded. One of the Orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.\nCassyr quietly unsheathed his &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;, mustering all the confidence he could. His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could. Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.\nSuddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind. The Orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs. Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.\n\"I thought you were going to bring them right to me,\" she whispered, smiling. \"Best come with me.\"\nThe three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill. As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the Orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.\n\"That horse yours?\" she asked. When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. \"That's rich meat, that is. Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning. Serves 'em right.\"\n\"Shouldn't we keep moving?\" whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.\n\"They won't come up here,\" she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. \"They're too afraid of us.\"\nTurala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. \"Witches. Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20Coven\"&gt;Skeffington Coven&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"You are, pet,\" the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. \"I am &lt;a href=\"Mynista%20Skeffington\"&gt;Mynista Skeffington&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"What did you do to those Orcs?\" asked Turala. \"Back there in the thicket?\"\n\"Spirit fist right side the head,\" Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill. Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play. The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. \"Don't you have witches where you come from, child?\"\n\"None that I know of,\" she said.\n\"There are all sorts of wielders of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;,\" she explained. \"The &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; study magic like it's their painful duty. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;battlemages&lt;/a&gt; in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;. We witches commune and &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;conjure&lt;/a&gt; and celebrate. To fell those Orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead. You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls. It's about fostering relations. Being friendly, you might say.\"\n\"Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,\" said Cassyr.\n\"As well you might,\" coughed Mynista. \"Your kind destroyed the Orc homeland two thousand years ago. Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us. Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.\"\nWith that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven."}

It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the axe stroke. Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye. She could not see the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face. She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her. She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.\nThe first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed. The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.\nThe Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, \"Now that's done. You said she had a pretty sister in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n18 Hearth Fire, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;\nThe &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; considered. Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden. Still, there was little to complain about. With the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time. Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland. Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.\n\"How went the war?\" cried his cousin, running to the road. \"Is it true that &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?\"\n\"That's not how it was, was it?\" asked a friend, joining them. \"I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.\"\n\"Isn't there anything interesting happening here?\" Cassyr laughed. \"I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.\"\n\"You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,\" said his friend. \"She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.\"\n\"But that's nothing. What was Vivec like?\" asked his cousin eagerly. \"He supposed to be a living god.\"\n\"If &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,\" said Cassyr haughtily.\n\"And the women?\" asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmeri ladies on very rare occasions.\nCassyr merely smiled. &lt;a href=\"Turala%20Skeffington\"&gt;Turala Skeffington&lt;/a&gt; flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away. She would be happy with &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20coven\"&gt;the coven&lt;/a&gt;, and her child would be well cared for. But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever. Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;."}

A thin glob of saliva burbled down between its fangs, and hung suspended. &lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; had never seen anything of its kind before, reptilian and massive, perched on its hind legs like a man. Mynistera applauded enthusiastically.\n\"My child,\" she crowed. \"You have come so far in so short a time. What were you thinking when you summoned this &lt;a href=\"daedroth\"&gt;daedroth&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nIt took Turala a moment to recall whether she was thinking anything at all. She was merely overwhelmed that she had reached out across the fabric of reality into the &lt;a href=\"realm%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;realm of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and plucked forth this loathsome creature, conjuring it into the world by the power of her mind.\n\"I was thinking of the color red,\" Turala said, concentrating. \"The simplicity and clarity of it. And then\u2014I desired, and spoke the charm. And this is what I conjured up.\"\n\"Desire is a powerful force for a young witch,\" said Mynistera. \"And it is well matched in this instance. For this daedroth is nothing if not a simple force of the spirits. Can you release your desire as easily?\"\nTurala closed her eyes and spoke the dismissal invocation. The monster faded away like a painting in sunlight, still blinking confusedly. Mynistera embraced her &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; pupil, laughing with delight.\n\"I never would have believed it, a month and a day you've been with the coven, and you're already far more advanced than most of the women here. There is powerful blood in you, Turala, you touch spirits like you were touching a lover. You'll be leading this coven one day\u2014I have seen it!\"\nTurala smiled. It was good to be complimented. &lt;a href=\"Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;The Duke of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; had praised her pretty face; and her family, before she had dishonored them, praised her manners. &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; had been nothing more than a companion: his compliments meant nothing. But with Mynistera, she felt she was home.\n\"You'll be leading the coven for many years yet, great sister,\" said Turala.\n\"I certainly intend to. But the spirits, while marvelous companions and faultless tellers of truth, are often hazy about the when and hows. You can't blame them really. When and how mean so little to them.\" Mynistera opened the door to the shed, allowing the brisk autumn breeze in to dispel the bitter and fetid smells of the daedroth. \"Now, I need you to run an errand to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. It's only a week's ride there, and a week's ride back. Bring Doryatha and Celephyna with you. As much as we try to be self-sufficient, there are herbs we can't grow here, and we seem to run through an enormous quantity of gems in no time at all. It's important that the people of the city learn to recognize you as one of the wise women of &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20coven\"&gt;Skeffington coven&lt;/a&gt;. You'll find the benefits of being notorious far outweigh the inconveniences.\"\nTurala did as she was bade. As she and her sisters climbed aboard their horses, Mynistera brought her child, little five-month-old &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt; to kiss her mother goodbye. The witches were in love with the little Dunmeri infant, fathered by a wicked duke, birthed by wild &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; in the forest heart of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Turala knew her nursemaids would protect her child with their lives. After many kisses and a farewell wave, the three young witches rode off into the bright woods, under a covering of red, yellow, and orange."}

A roaring fire in the pit in the center of the room cast an almost sinister glow on all the regulars, and made the abundance of bodies look like a punishment tapestry inspired by the &lt;a href=\"Arcturian%20Heresies\"&gt;Arcturian Heresies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt; took his usual place with his cousin and ordered a flagon of &lt;a href=\"ale\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Have you been to see the Baron?\" asked Palyth.\n\"Yes, he may have work for me in the palace of &lt;a href=\"Urvaius\"&gt;Urvaius&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Cassyr proudly. \"But more than that I can't say. You understand, secrets of state and all that. Why are there so many damned people here tonight?\"\n\"A shipload of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; just came in to harbor. They've come from the war. I was just waiting until you got here to introduce you as another veteran.\"\nCassyr blushed, but regained his composure enough to ask: \"What are they doing here? Has there been a truce?\"\n\"I don't know the full story,\" said Palyth. \"But apparently, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; are in negotiations again. These fellas here have investments they were keen to check on, and they figured things on &lt;a href=\"the%20Bay\"&gt;the Bay&lt;/a&gt; were quiet enough. But the only way we can get the full story is to talk to the chaps.\"\nWith that, Palyth gripped his cousin's arm and pulled him to the other side of the bar so suddenly, Cassyr would have had to struggle violently to resist. The Dunmeri travelers were spread out across four of the tables, laughing with the locals. They were largely amiable young men, well-dressed, befitting &lt;a href=\"merchants\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;, animated in gesture made more extravagant by liquor.\n\"Excuse me,\" said Palyth, intruding on the conversation. \"My shy cousin Cassyr was in the war as well, fighting for the living god, Vivec.\"\n\"The only Cassyr I ever heard of,\" said one of the Dunmer drunkenly with a wide, friendly smile, shaking Cassyr's free hand. \"Was a Cassyr Whitley, who Vivec said was the worst spy in history. We lost &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt; due to his bungling intelligence work. For your sake, friend, I hope the two of you were never confused.\"\nCassyr smiled and listened as the lout told the story of his failure with bountiful exaggerations which caused the table to roar with laughter. Several eyes looked his way, but none of the locals sought to explain that the fool of the tale was standing at attention. The eyes that stung the most were his cousin's, the young man who had believed that he had returned to Dwynnen a great hero. At some point, certainly, the Baron would hear about it, his idiocy increasing manifold with each retelling.\nWith every fiber in his soul, Cassyr cursed the living god Vivec.\n21 Frostfall, 2920\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Corda\"&gt;Corda&lt;/a&gt;, in a robe of blinding whiteness, a uniform of the priestesses of the &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; conservatorium, arrived in the City just as the first winter storm was passing. The clouds broke with sunlight, and the beauteous teenaged &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; girl appeared in the wide avenue with escort, riding toward the Palace. While her sister was tall, thin, angular, and haughty, Corda was a small, round-faced lass with wide brown eyes. The locals were quick to draw comparisons.\n\"Not a month after &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Rijja\"&gt;Lady Rijja&lt;/a&gt;'s execution,\" muttered a housemaid, peering out the window, and winking to her neighbor.\n\"And not a month out of the nunnery neither,\" the other woman agreed, reveling in the scandal. \"This one's in for a ride. Her sister weren't no innocent, and look where she ended up.\""}

It was a pity, he thought, that he was prone to seasickness. There was nothing for him now in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to the east or to the west. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s tale of his poor spycraft had spread to taverns everywhere. The &lt;a href=\"Baron%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Baron of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; had released him from his contract. No doubt they were laughing about him in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, too, and &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt;, probably in &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; for that matter. Perhaps it would be best to drop into the waves and sink. The thought, however, did not stay long in his mind: it was not despair that haunted him, but rage. Impotent fury that he could not assuage.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said a voice behind him, making him jump. \"I'm sorry to disturb you, but I was wondering whether you could recommend an inexpensive &lt;a href=\"tavern\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt; for me to spend the night.\"\nIt was a young man, a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, with a sack over his shoulder. Obviously, he had just disembarked from one of the boats. For the first time in weeks, someone was looking at Cassyr as something other than a colossal, famous idiot. He could not help, black as his mood was, but be friendly.\n\"You've just arrived from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Cassyr.\n\"No, sir, that's where I'm going,\" said the fellow. \"I'm working my way home.

The Baron won't allow me in his sight, but the Baroness has sympathy for me and allowed me the use of their Summoning Chambers.\" Cassyr spat. \"I did all the rituals, made sacrifices, but nothing came of it.\"\n\"That'd be because of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, my old master,\" replied Welleg with some bitterness. \"The &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20princes\"&gt;Daedra princes&lt;/a&gt; have agreed not to be summoned by any amateurs at least until the war ends.

She did not hear the rider approach to her side until he was almost upon her. When she turned and saw &lt;a href=\"Cassyr\"&gt;Cassyr&lt;/a&gt;, she shouted with as much surprise as pleasure at meeting an old friend. His face was pale and drawn, but she took it to be merely from travel.\n\"What brings you back to Phrygias?\" she smiled. \"Were you not treated well in &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Well enough,\" said Cassyr. \"I have need of the &lt;a href=\"Skeffington%20coven\"&gt;Skeffington coven&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Ride with us,\" said Turala. \"I'll bring you to &lt;a href=\"Mynistera\"&gt;Mynistera&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe four continued on, and the witches regaled Cassyr with tales of Wayrest. It was evident that it was also a rare treat for Doryatha and Celephyna to leave Old Barbyn's Farm. They had been born there, as daughters and grand-daughters of Skeffington witches. Ordinary High Rock city life was exotic to them as it was to Turala. Cassyr said little, but smiled and nodded his head, which was encouragement enough. Thankfully, none of the stories they had heard were about his own stupidity. Or at the very least, they did not tell him.\nDoryatha was in the midst of a tale she had heard in a tavern about a thief who had been locked overnight in a pawnshop when they crossed over a familiar hill. Suddenly, she halted in her story. The barn was supposed to be visible, but it was not. The other three followed her gaze into the fog, and a moment later, they rode as fast as they could towards what was once the site of the Skeffington coven.\nThe fire had long since burned out. Nothing but ashes, skeletons, and broken weaponry remained. Cassyr recognized at once the signs of an Orc raid.\nThe witches fell from their horses, racing through the remains, wailing. Celephyna found a tattered, bloody piece of cloth that she recognized from Mynistera's cloak. She held it to her ashen face, sobbing. Turala screamed for &lt;a href=\"Bosriel\"&gt;Bosriel&lt;/a&gt;, but the only reply was the high whistling wind through the ashes.\n\"Who did this?\" she cried, tears streaking down her face. \"I swear I'll conjure up the very flames of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;! What have they done with my baby?\"\n\"I know who did it,\" said Cassyr quietly, dropping from his horse and walking towards her. \"I've seen these weapons before. I fear I met the very fiends responsible in Dwynnen, but I never thought they'd find you. This is the work of assassins hired by the &lt;a href=\"Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Duke of Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nHe paused. The lie came easily. Adopt and improvise. What's more, he could tell instantly that she believed it. Her resentment over the cruelty the Duke had shown her had quieted, but never disappeared. One look at her burning eyes told him that she would summon the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and wreak his, and her, revenge upon &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. And what's more, he knew they'd listen.\nAnd listen they did. For the power that is greater than desire is rage. Even rage misplaced."}

His metallic skin, though exposed only at his face and hands, caught the light of the fireplace and the lightning of the stormy night from the window. The Night Mother noted also that she could see herself as he saw her: serene, beautiful, fear-inspiring. He handed her his letter from the Empress without a word. Sipping her wine, she read it.\n\u201cThe &lt;a href=\"Brindisi\"&gt;Duke of Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; also offered me an appreciable sum to have the Emperor murdered earlier this year,\u201d she said, folding the letter. \u201cHis payment sunk, and never was delivered. It was a considerable annoyance, particularly as I had already gone to the trouble of putting one of my agents in the palace. Why should I assume that your more-than-generous payment, from a dead woman, will arrive?\u201d\n\u201cI brought it with me,\u201d said Zuuk simply. \u201cIt is in the carriage outside.\u201d\n\u201cThen bring it in and our business is complete,\u201d smiled the Night Mother. \u201cThe Emperor will be dead by year's end. You may leave the gold with Apaladith. Unless you'd care for some wine?\u201d\nZuuk declined the offer and withdrew. The moment he left the room, Miramor slipped noiselessly back from behind the dark tapestry. The Night Mother offered him a glass of wine, and he accepted it.\n\u201cI know that fellow, Zuuk,\u201d said Miramor carefully. \u201cI didn't know he worked for the old Empress though.\u201d\n\u201cLet's talk about you some more, if you don't mind,\u201d she said, knowing he would, in fact, not mind.\n\u201cLet me show you my worth,\u201d said Miramor. \u201cLet me be the one to do the Emperor in. I've already killed his son, and you saw there how well I can hide myself away. Tell me you saw one ripple in the tapestry.\u201d\nThe Night Mother smiled. Things were falling into place rather nicely.\n\u201cIf you know how to use a dagger, you will find him at &lt;a href=\"Bodrum\"&gt;Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d she said, and described to him what he must do.\n3 Sun's Dusk, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Morrowind\nThe Duke stared out the window. It was early morning, and for the fourth straight day, a red mist hung over the city, flashing lightning. A freakish wind blew through the streets, ripping his flags from the castle battlements, forcing all his people to close their shudders tightly. Something terrible was coming to his land. He was not a greatly learned man, but he knew the signs. So too did his subjects.\n\u201cWhen will my messengers reach &lt;a href=\"the%20Three\"&gt;the Three&lt;/a&gt;?\u201d he growled, turning to his castellan.\n\u201c&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is far to the north, negotiating the treaty with the Emperor,\u201d the man said, his face and voice trembling with fear. \u201c&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; are in &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps they can be reached in a few days time.\u201d\nThe Duke nodded. He knew his messengers were fast, but so too was the hand of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;."}

He took a moment to admire the day. The whitewashed statue of &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, which the great mage was said to have posed for in ancient days, stood at the precipice of the cliff overlooking the bay. Beyond, ocean, and the misty border between Artaeum and the main island of Summerset.\n\"By and large, acceptable,\" he proclaimed as the last student dropped her fruit in his hand. With a wave of his hand, the fruit and flowers were back in the tree. With another wave, the students had formed into position in a semicircle around the sorcerer. He pulled a small fibrous ball, about a foot in diameter from his white robes.\n\"What is this?\"\nThe students understood this test. It asked them to cast a spell of identification on the mysterious object. Each initiate closed his or her eyes and imagined the ball in the realm of the universal Truth. Its energy had a unique resonance as all physical and spiritual matter does, a negative aspect, a duplicate version, relative paths, true meaning, a song in the cosmos, a texture in the fabric of space, a facet of being that has always existed and always will exist.\n\"A ball,\" said a young &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; named Welleg, which brought giggles from some of the younger initiates, but a frown from most, including Sotha Sil.\n\"If you must be stupid, at least be amusing,\" growled the sorcerer, and then looked at a young, dark-haired &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; lass who looked confused. \"Lilatha, do you know?\"\n\"It's &lt;a href=\"grom\"&gt;grom&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Lilatha, uncertainly. \"What the &lt;a href=\"dreugh\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt; meff after they've k-k-kr-krevinasim.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Karvinasim\"&gt;Karvinasim&lt;/a&gt;, but very good, nonetheless,\" said Sotha Sil. \"Now, tell me, what does that mean?\"\n\"I don't know,\" admitted Lilatha. The rest of the students also shook their heads.\n\"There are layers to understanding all things,\" said Sotha Sil. \"The common man looks at an object and fits it into a place in his way of thinking. Those skilled in &lt;a href=\"the%20Old%20Ways\"&gt;the Old Ways&lt;/a&gt;, in the way of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, can see an object and identify it by its proper role. But one more layer is needed to be peeled back to achieve understanding. You must identify the object by its role and its truth and interpret that meaning. In this case, this ball is indeed grom, which is a substance created by the dreugh, an underwater race in the north and western parts of the continent. For one year of their life, they undergo karvinasim when they walk upon the land. Following that, they return to the water and meff, or devour the skin and organs they needed for land-dwelling. Then they vomit it up into little balls like this. Grom. Dreugh vomit.\"\nThe students looked at the ball a little queasily. Sotha Sil always loved this lesson.\n4 Sun's Dawn, 2920\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Spies,\" muttered the Emperor, sitting in his bath, staring at a lump on his foot. \"All around me, traitors and spies.\"\nHis mistress &lt;a href=\"Rijja\"&gt;Rijja&lt;/a&gt; washed his back, her legs wrapped around his waist. When he was in a mood like this, it was best to be calmly, soothingly, seductively sensual. And not to say a word unless he asked her a direct question.\nWhich he did: \"What do you think when a fellow steps on his Imperial Majesty's foot and says 'I'm sorry, Your Imperial Majesty'? Don't you think 'Pardon me, Your Imperial Majesty' is more appropriate? 'I'm sorry,' well, that almost sounds like the bastard Argonian was sorry I am his Imperial Majesty. That he hopes we lose the war with Morrowind, that's what it sounds like.\"\n\"What would make you feel better?\" asked Rijja. \"Would you like him flogged? He is only, as you say, the Battlechief of &lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;. It would teach him to mind where he's stepping.\"\n\"My father would have flogged him. My grandfather would have had him killed,\" the Emperor grumbled. \"But I don't mind if they all step on my feet, provided they respect me. And don't plot against me.\"\n\"You must trust someone.\"\n\"Only you,\" smiled the Emperor, turning slightly to give Rijja a kiss. \"And my son &lt;a href=\"Juilek\"&gt;Juilek&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose, though I wish he were a little more cautious.\"\n\"And your council, and the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;?\" asked Rijja.\n\"A pack of spies and a snake,\" laughed the Emperor, kissing his mistress again. He whispered, \"As long as you're true, I can handle the world.\"\n13 Sun's Dawn, 2920\n&lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Turala\"&gt;Turala&lt;/a&gt; stood at the black, bejeweled city gates. A wind howled around her, but she felt nothing.\nThe Duke had been furious upon hearing his favorite mistress was pregnant and cast her from his sight. She tried again and again to see him, but his guards turned her away. Finally, she returned to her family and told them the truth. If only she had lied and told them she did not know who the father was. A soldier, a wandering adventurer, anyone. But she told them that the father was the Duke, a member of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;. And they did what she knew they would have to do, as proud members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon her hand was burned the sign of Expulsion her weeping father had branded on her. But the Duke's cruelty hurt her far more. She looked out the gate and into the wide winter plains. Twisted, sleeping trees and skies without birds. No one in Morrowind would take her in now. She must go far away.\nWith slow, sad steps, she began her journey."}

If Queen Hasaama knew what her husband was going to do, she did not try to stop him. He had been erratic of late, prone to fits and even occasional seizures. But she never suspected the depths of his madness, and his loathing for the bard and his tale of the wickedness and perversity found in mortal man.\n19 Sun's Dawn\nGilverdale, Valenwood\n\"Listen to me again,\" said the old carpenter. \"If cell three holds worthless brass, then cell two holds the gold key.

She dismounted and joined her retinue.\n\"Where are we now?\" she asked.\nOne of her ladies pulled out a map. \"I thought we were approaching a town called Gilverdale.\"\nAlmalexia closed her eyes and opened them again quickly. The vision was too much to bear. As her followers watched, she picked up a piece of brick and a fragment of bone, and clutched them to her heart.\n\"We must continue on to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;,\" she said quietly."}

Lord Glavius had a luxurious villa, but it was not close to being large enough to house the entire army within its walls. Tents lined the hillsides, and the soldiers were flocking to enjoy his lordship's famous hot springs. Little wonder: winter chill still hung in the air.\n\"Prince Juilek, your son, is not feeling well.\"\nWhen Potentate Versidue-Shaie spoke, the Emperor jumped. How that Akaviri could slither across the grass without making a sound was a mystery to him.\n\"Poisoned, I'd wager,\" grumbled Reman. \"See to it he gets a healer. I told him to hire a taster like I have, but the boy's headstrong. There are spies all around us, I know it.\"\n\"I believe you're right, Your Imperial Majesty,\" said Versidue-Shaie. \"These are treacherous times, and we must take precautions to see that Morrowind does not win this war, either on the field or by more insidious means. That is why I would suggest that you not lead the vanguard into battle. I know you would want to, as your illustrious ancestors Reman I, Brazollus Dor, and Reman II did, but I fear it would be foolhardy. I hope you do not mind me speaking frankly like this.\"\n\"No,\" nodded Reman. \"I think you're right. Who would lead the vanguard then?\"\n\"I would say Prince Juilek, if he were feeling better,\" replied the Akaviri. \"Failing that, Storig of Farrun, with Queen Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Warchief Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.\"\n\"A Khajiit at left flank and an Argonian at right,\" frowned the Emperor. \"I never do trust beastfolk.\"\nThe Potentate took no offense. He knew that \"beastfolk\" referred to the natives of Tamriel, not to the Tsaesci of Akavir like himself. \"I quite agree, Your Imperial Majesty, but you must agree that they hate the Dunmer. Ulaqth has a particular grudge after all the slave-raids on his lands by the Duke of Mournhold.\"\nThe Emperor conceded it was so, and the Potentate retired. It was surprising, thought Reman, but for the first time, the Potentate seemed trustworthy. He was a good man to have on one's side.\n18 First Seed, 2920\nAld Erfoud, Morrowind\n\"How far is the Imperial Army?\" asked Vivec.\n\"Two days' march,\" replied his lieutenant. \"If we march all night tonight, we can get higher ground at the Pryai tomorrow morning. Our intelligence tells us the Emperor will be commanding the rear, Storig of Farrun has the vanguard, Naghea of Riverhold at left flank, and Ulaqth of Lilmoth at right flank.\"\n\"Ulaqth,\" whispered Vivec, an idea forming. \"Is this intelligence reliable? Who brought it to us?\"\n\"A Breton spy in the Imperial Army,\" said the lieutenant and gestured towards a young, sandy-haired man who stepped forward and bowed to Vivec.\n\"What is your name and why is a Breton working for us against the Cyrodiils?\" asked Vivec, smiling.\n\"My name is Cassyr Whitley of Dwynnen,\" said the man. \"And I am working for you because not everyone can say he spied for a god.

It was an idyllic site, lightly wooded where the water took the bend around a steep bluff to the east with a gorgeous wildflower meadow to the west. The strange flora of Morrowind met the strange flora of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; on the border and commingled gloriously.\n\"There will be time to sleep when you've finished!\"\nThe soldiers had been hearing that all morning. It was not enough that they had been marching all night, now they were chopping down trees on the bluff and damming the river so its waters spilled over.

If you recruit a hundred or so others, it won't take you more than a few hours to make all we need.\"\nThe soldier wearily did as he was bade. The men and women got to work, fashioning spears from the trees.\n\"If you don't mind me asking,\" said the lieutenant. \"The soldiers don't need any more weapons. They're too tired to hold the ones they've got.\"\n\"These spears aren't for holding,\" said Vivec and whispered, \"If we tired them out today, they'll get a good night's sleep tonight,\" before he got to work supervising their work.\nIt was essential that they be sharp, of course, but equally important that they be well balanced and tapered proportionally. The perfect point for stability was a pyramid, not the conical point of some lances and spears. He had the men hurl the spears they had completed to test their strength, sharpness, and balance, forcing them to begin on a new one if they broke. Gradually, out of sheer exhaustion from doing it wrong, the men learned how to create the perfect wooden spears. Once they were through, he showed them how they were to be arranged and where.\nThat night, there was no drunken pre-battle carousing, and no nervous neophytes stayed up worrying about the battle to come. As soon as the sun sank beneath the wooded hills, the camp was at rest, but for the sentries.\n20 First Seed, 2920\nBodrum, Morrowind\nMiramor was exhausted. For last six days, he had gambled and whored all night and then marched all day. He was looking forward to the battle, but even more than that, he was looking forward to some rest afterwards. He was in the Emperor's command at the rear flank, which was good because it seemed unlikely that he would be killed. On the other hand, it meant traveling over the mud and waste the army ahead left in their wake.\nAs they began the trek through the wildflower field, Miramor and all the soldiers around him sank ankle-deep in cold mud. It was an effort to even keep moving. Far, far up ahead, he could see the vanguard of the army led by Lord Storig emerging from the meadow at the base of a bluff.\nThat was when it all happened.\nAn army of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; appeared above the bluff like rising &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, pouring fire and floods of arrows down on the vanguard. Simultaneously, a company of men bearing the flag of the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; galloped around the shore, disappearing along the shallow river's edge where it dipped to a timbered glen to the east. Warchief Ulaqth nearby on the right flank let out a bellow of revenge at the sight and gave chase. Queen Naghea sent her flank towards the embankment to the west to intercept the army on the bluff.\nThe Emperor could think of nothing to do. His troops were too bogged down to move forward quickly and join the battle. He ordered them to face east towards the timber, in case Mournhold's company was trying to circle around through the woods. They never came out, but many men, facing west, missed the battle entirely. Miramor kept his eyes on the bluff.\nA tall Dunmer he supposed must have been Vivec gave a signal, and the battlemages cast their spells at something to the west. From what transpired, Miramor deduced it was a dam. A great torrent of water spilled out, washing Naghea's left flank into the remains of the vanguard and the two together down river to the east.\nThe Emperor paused, as if waiting for his vanquished army to return, and then called a retreat. Miramor hid in the rushes until they had passed by and then waded as quietly as he could to the bluff.\nThe Morrowind army was retiring as well back to their camp. He could hear them celebrating above him as he padded along the shore. To the east, he saw the Imperial Army. They had been washed into a net of spears strung across the river, Naghea's left flank on Storig's vanguard on Ulaqth's right flank, bodies of hundreds of soldiers strung together like beads.\nMiramor took whatever valuables he could carry from the corpses and then ran down the river. He had to go many miles before the water was clear again, unpolluted by blood."}

Sotha Sil emerged, his face smeared with ash, weary. He felt he had been away for months, years, but only a few days had transpired.

There are things moving in the dark, but when you shine the light, there's nothing there. I won't go down by the lake anymore.

I've tried every variety of intoxicant, &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ale&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; swill this world has to offer. I've sampled &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, licked an Argonian &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; Tree, and hunted \"magical\" toads with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nNone of that compares to &lt;a href=\"Nord%20Mead\"&gt;Nord Mead&lt;/a&gt;. There's nothing like it.\nThe purest stuff is made in &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; villages, but we're at war with the Nords, and a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; has no guarantee of surviving a trip like that. Leave that sort of thing to the professionals. There is still hope, however. If you're ever at a tavern, and there's a cask of Nord mead, you'd be a fool to pass it up.\nMead is made by fermenting honey and water (though a few recipes call for molasses). Sometimes, you add grain mash and strain it, but that isn't necessary. Some of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; call it \"honey wine,\" but mead needs more than good honey. Every meadery has its own recipes. After you drink enough mead, you learn the names of the brewmasters who create them. A drunk Nord will gladly punch another in the face over the honor of a good brewmaster. Then again, a drunk Nord will punch anyone for just about anything.\nEvery brewmaster has a distinct blend of spices, fruit, and sometimes hops (which makes a mead bitter, which makes some Nords bitter, too.) I've even heard tales of mead mixed with the blood of heroes, allegedly granting them the words of a poet or skald. I'd like a mead named after me, but I'm not going to bleed for it.\nAn Altmer once told me that brewing is the basis of all culture. It's why our ancestors started farming and forming cities. It's what we do when we've got too much wheat and barley and hops and we're sick of farming. The culture of drinking seems to be what keeps Nords together.\nNords must be really sick of farming, because they brew and drink prodigious amounts of mead. Whenever a cask of really good mead is opened, Nords gather round because they know that cask won't last long. But if you don't know how to behave in the Nord drinking culture, you'll end up broke, broken, hungover, and helpless. I found out the hard way.\nNords love to drink. But more than that. Nords respect those who can endure adversity. I know that sounds flowery for explaining why two drunk Nords would have a \"hit-me-hard-in-the-face\" contest, but really, that's why their culture celebrates getting drunk.\nA Nord can gain respect by consuming more mead than anyone else, just as he's respected for surviving a blizzard or killing a bear with a sharp stick. \"Nord honor\" is something they talk about endlessly when they're drunk, and even more when they're sober. So the first thing you learn about Nords is if you want their respect, never turn down a drink. It's a test. If you can't handle that next drink, leave. Otherwise you'll wake up somewhere they find hilarious, but you won't be laughing.\nNords also love their skalds. Songs and stories go over well with a drunk audience, once they've had enough of brawling, boasting, and throwing axes at each other. Their songs are all about how they're better than everyone else at everything. They've all heard these over and over again, so bring some of your own. They're desperate to hear something new.\nAnywhere you go, drinking is also a good way to redress a mistake or make an apology, and it's the same with Nords. If you lose a contest, you need to buy a drink. If you make a mistake or offend someone, you need to buy a drink. If you're insulted, stand there and take it, then you need to buy a drink.\nYou don't have to be the best brawler around to survive a room full of drunken Nords. You can also impress them by being clever or by being talented, but you better be really good. When it's time to take a punch in the face, you better be ready for a punch in the face. If you don't like getting punched, there are some things you should never talk about, like politics, who's the best brewmaster, and who punches the hardest. And never demand to know why someone just punched you in the face.\nIf you want to hear more, buy me a drink the next time I'm in Daggerfall. I'll tell you a story."}

He made a pact with the few remaining dragons, swearing to protect them if they would serve him. Despite his promise, dragons were still hunted and slain. It's not clear if the last ones fled Tamriel or if they were exterminated.\nThere is no credible story of how dragons came to be. According to &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dremora&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; have \"questioned,\" they just were, and are. Eternal, immortal, unchanging, and unyielding. They are not born or hatched. They do not mate or breed. There are no known examples of dragon eggs or &lt;a href=\"dragonling\"&gt;dragonling&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; area has stories of such things, but so far all have proven false. The eggs turned out to be eggs of other reptiles. The small dragons were merely oversized lizards and no relation to true dragons.\nAlthough they are not born, dragons can die. During the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, their numbers were decimated. The &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaders of the late &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; are said to have hunted and killed scores of them, before and after their defeat by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;. Some sources say the Akaviri brought over dragon-killing spells. Others claim they built cunning traps. One tale even speaks of a rare poison.\nIt is well accepted that a dragon's most fearsome weapon is its &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fiery breath&lt;/a&gt;. Because they could fly overhead and rain down flaming death, archers and wizards were necessary when hunting them. It is less well known that some dragons could &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;breathe a freezing spray of frost&lt;/a&gt;. The reports indicate that a dragon might do one of the other, but not both.\nMost people think of dragons as mere beasts. However, logically they must have had &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; in order for Tiber Septim to have negotiated with them. Indeed, the historical record is quite clear that dragons were highly intelligent. They had their own language, but could also speak the languages of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe records of Reman's hunts contain reports of dragons that breathe or spit fire. Recently some were unearthed that described dragons blowing freezing blasts of cold. The more fanciful tales have them &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Call\"&gt;summoning storms&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;stopping time&lt;/a&gt;. These should be discounted as myths and &lt;a href=\"fey\"&gt;faery&lt;/a&gt; tales. Even without this most fearsome weapon, their nearly impenetrable &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Scales%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt; and granite-like teeth and claws made them terrifying opponents.\nThere is some confusion over when the last dragon was killed. It seems the last few vanished all at once. Some tales speak of a dragon king who devoured all of them rather than let mankind kill them. One of the more far-fetched stories has Tiber Septim absorbing their &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;essences&lt;/a&gt; when he &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;ascended to godhood&lt;/a&gt;. Although the exact cause is unknown, they are all gone. No dragon has been seen for centuries. There are a few known examples of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon bones&lt;/a&gt; fused with the stone and rocks of cliffs and cave. Just enough proof to make the stories undeniable."}

Its denizens have had ample need for a place to bury their dead. For the most respected, the rich, the powerful, that final resting place has often been the crypt known as &lt;a href=\"Thibaut%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Thibaut's Cairn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated southwest of the village now called &lt;a href=\"Greenhill\"&gt;Greenhill&lt;/a&gt;, the old &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; crypt and the nearby village once shared a name. But \u2026 we're getting ahead of ourselves.\nThe Cairn is named for its most noted \"guest,\" the famed &lt;a href=\"Thibault\"&gt;Thibault&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Thibault was a general of Colovia, and in his time some hundreds of years ago he was one of the anchor points for the Hastrel Cohort.\nThose brave souls rode forth at the vanguard south, beside their comrades in the Linchal and Ontus cohorts. The purpose of their ride has been forgotten, just one of the numerous sorties into the March the Colovian kingdoms have attempted over the years.\nTheir ride would have been lost forever to the mists of time, if not for the unique relationship Thibault had with his cohort. Riding at his side south from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Kingdom of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; was his wife Tertcia. Below Thibault in the command structure of his cohort were his children, though the number he had in place has now been lost to time. The members of his cohort owed him personal allegiance to a degree not often seen in modern Colovian cohorts. It's said when Thibault rode, even the nightsoil men of his township rode with him.\nThe details of Thibault's death, too, have been lost to us ... but the impact of his death is still easy to see if you travel south of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; in the Northern Woods. While the Linchal and Ontus cohorts rode back north, returning to home soil, the men and women of Hastrel cohort stayed and put down roots.\nTertcia's need to see her husband's legacy built was the motive for staying. The tales of her manipulations can be found in numerous other tomes, no doubt. Suffice it to say that she played the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and the Khajiit against the Wood Elves in a masterful dance. The result? A complex of crypts and an entire village, once known simply as \"&lt;a href=\"Thibaut%27s%20Cairn\"&gt;Thibault's Rest&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNow, the history of that little town is an interesting tale as well ..."}

These credits may be bought in packs, as follows:\nBundles.\nThe following items may become unavailable in the store at any time.\nControversy.\nBethesda and partnered in 2015 to make &lt;a href=\"w%3Ac%3Ates-mods%3APaid%20Mods\"&gt;paid mods&lt;/a&gt; to \"Skyrim\" available to players on the Workshop, but pulled back the feature after backlash from the community. Bethesda later posted a blog responding to the controversy, at one point stating the following on the issue:\n\"After discussion with Valve, and listening to our community, paid mods are being removed from Steam Workshop. Even though we had the best intentions, the feedback has been clear \u2013 this is not a feature you want. Your support means everything to us, and we hear you.\"\nThe introduction of the Creation Club for \"Skyrim Special Edition\" in 2017 was therefore surprising to many fans, who were under the impression that a similar platform would not be attempted again. However, Bethesda addressed the issue with a note regarding comparisons between the Creation Club and \"paid mods\" on their website:\n\"Is Creation Club paid mods? No. Mods will remain a free and open system where anyone can create and share what they\u2019d like. Also, we won\u2019t allow any existing mods to be retrofitted into Creation Club, it must all be original content. Most of the Creation Club content is created internally, some with external partners who have worked on our games, and some by external Creators. All the content is approved, curated, and taken through the full internal dev cycle; including localization, polishing, and testing. This also guarantees that all content works together. We\u2019ve looked at many ways to do \u201cpaid mods\u201d, and the problems outweigh the benefits. We\u2019ve encountered many of those issues before. But, there\u2019s a constant demand from our fans to add more official high quality content to our games, and while we are able to create a lot of it, we think many in our community have the talent to work directly with us and create some amazing new things.\""}
{"id": "7193", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7193", "title": "Creation Engine", "text": "The Creation Engine is the engine used to power .\nHere is a sample of what the Creation Engine is capable of, courtesy of G4TV.com:\n\"If you're easily impressed by snow falling on rocks then you're going to be amazed with the updated artificial intelligence. The Radiant AI technology you saw used in has been improved; villagers won't walk aimlessly unaware of your actions. Mills, farms, and mines have also been added to give the Characters something to do. People dwelling in the forest spend their time chopping wood, running logs through mills and then carrying their items around. That's NPC synergy, folks. Not only do the NPCs have new tasks they are also capable of developing feelings about you based of off your actions towards them. If you befriend a NPC and then enter his house at night he will offer you a place to stay for the night. But if you're mean to an NPC, maybe kill his horse, he will be hostile towards you.\"\nThis from Shacknews.com:\n\"\"Game Informer reports that the new engine, dubbed the \"Creation Engine and &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Kit\"&gt;Kit&lt;/a&gt;,\" seems custom built to deal with complaints from the studio's previous games. The redesigned engine is built around the needs of &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;'s style of open world games. The team tweaked its lighting and shadows to render draw distance more realistically, created tools to make their own foliage found in the wild, and developed a program to accurately imitate snowfall accumulation.\"\"\n\"The AI is getting an overhaul as well. Skyrim promises characters with more defined personalities, who will each inhabit their environment more naturally. In a village, for example, citizens would chop wood, run a logging mill, and perform other day-to-day tasks. The AI is more aware of relationships, and friends won't mind the occasional pilfering like a stranger would.\"\nAnimation.\nCharacter animation will be set by Havok's Behavior technology, which allows Bethesda to create and blend animations with greater ease. This is being used both to create more realistic reactions from NPCs, and to balance the combat more effectively when the player is in third-person mode. It also allows the team to talk with NPCs while walking and exploring, instead of facing straight towards a character during conversation. Finally, the animation engine gives new life to the creatures in the game; however, Bethesda studio head Todd Howard played coy on the subject of mounts.\nThe new engine adds an element of randomness to the story proceedings. Story quests will still have their paths set by the designers, but the side quests will be tailored to your character. An assassination quest, for example, might shift based on who you've met and their relationships with the other NPCs. It recognizes your actions, so you'll see consequences and references from characters based on where you've been.\u201d\nThis game engine is referenced partially, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//au.pc.ign.com/articles/115/1158651p1.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;"}

He also stated he had hoped to have it released on opening day. Bethesda has released many video tutorials of the creation kit, which are available in &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/BethesdaGameStudios%23p/a\"&gt;Bethesda's official YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. A wiki operated by &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates how to use the Creation Kit. It can be found at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.creationkit.com/\"&gt;Creation Kit Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelease.\nIn a statement made on the Bethesda forums, the Creation Kit was supposed to be released alongside the v1.4 &lt;a href=\"Patches%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;. A post made on January 27th, 2012 stated that Bethesda anticipated the release of the patch to be \"next week,\" with the Creation Kit not far behind. However, the kit was scheduled for release on February 7th, 2012 as stated by Pete Hines, one of the game's developers. Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 will not have the Creation Kit.\nOn February 7th, the Creation Kit was released, along with a &lt;a href=\"High%20Resolution%20Texture%20Pack\"&gt;High Resolution Texture Pack&lt;/a&gt;. In the meanwhile the Creation Kit has been patched several times, reaching its current version number 1.8.151.0.\nSteam Workshop.\nIt was confirmed on December 1, 2011 that 's construction kit would be released alongside support for the Steam Workshop.\n\"\"We're excited to share news that we've been working closely with Valve to integrate &lt;a href=\"http%3A//steamcommunity.com/workshop/skyrim\"&gt;Steam Workshop&lt;/a&gt; into the Creation Kit.

The Creation Kit will bundle your mod and upload it to the Workshop, where everyone can browse, rate, and flag mods for download. You'll be able to do this from any web device, including your smartphone. Like a live Netflix queue when you fire up , mods you flagged will be automatically downloaded and installed.

You will be presented with three options. Yes, No, and Yes to all. To get past the pop-up, simply press the \"Yes to all\" button. The Creation Kit should become unresponsive for a couple of seconds, but then should work normally. If you see the error again during your session, simply press \"Yes to all\" again.\nImportant information.\nUnlike previous games, the character's list is no longer listed under \"NPC.\" Instead, they are now grouped under \"Actors,\" as are other items, such as clothing.\nErrors.\nInstalling any patch after installing the Creation Kit, can cause the Kit not to respond. This can be solved by reinstalling the Creation Kit, which will not overwrite the patch.

They are dangerous foes, highly intelligent, completely chaotic in nature, and powerful in the ways of magic. Often they have high fire resistance, and are subject to attack only by special weapons. They are very dangerous to face. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daemon\"&gt;Fire Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s also have the ability to see invisible creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoblins are vile, nasty creatures, short in stature and almost rodent-like in their frenzy to feed. Rather unintelligent, but dangerous to the inexperienced.\nGolems.\nGolems are creatures created by those practicing in the arcane arts. They are fashioned from a material to resemble a human form, then animated and set to particular tasks, whether that be questing for an object, or guarding a tomb. There are three varieties known to exist in the land; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem\"&gt;Ice Golem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;. Any of these are dangerous, each with its own special abilities, immunities, and spell casting powers. Defeating one is a feat well worth praise, for they are very formidable opponents.\n&lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese canines are actually from the nether planes, usually summoned by some powerful being to perform a service. They attack with their powerful jaws, or with a fire breath that burns their intended victims. They are resistant to fire based &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Homonculus\"&gt;Homonculus&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Homonculus is a strange being usually created by a higher level Wizard, who has somehow combined the properties of certain spells with parts of various demons. These creatures are often set to guard areas, using their ability to fly to patrol corridors. They have the ability to cast spells, using these effectively with their normal attacks to ward whatever areas they have been set to guard.\n&lt;a href=\"Lizard%20Man\"&gt;Lizard Men&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce thought to be distant cousins of the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, it was soon evident that these Lizard Men had little to nothing related to them whatsoever. They are a race of carnivorous reptiles, whose use of language stretches only far enough to communicate the location of their prey to the rest of their hunting party, which then move to attack and feed.\n&lt;a href=\"Medusa%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Medusa&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Medusa is a creature with the upper body of a woman and the lower torso of a snake. It writhes along using its hands and body to wind its way through its lair. Medusae are very strong and intelligent, and armed with a fearsome weapon. Their stare has the ability to paralyze an opponent. Because of their magical nature, they are immune to weapons below a certain quality.\n&lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;.\nMinotaurs are a combination of both man and bull, having the body of a man and the head of a bull, and are cruel man-eaters. They are not particularly intelligent, but can track a man by their scent alone. They are very strong and slightly resistant to magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcs are a superior version of goblins. Indeed, scholars have often speculated that these two creatures are somehow related. Nevertheless, they are stronger than their cousins, and are very dangerous, often equipping themselves with weapons found on their opponents. They are not overly intelligent, but are cunning enough to stalk their prey and set up ambushes.\n&lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Rats&lt;/a&gt;.\nRats: Scavengers, these disease-ridden vermin crawl through many of the cities sewers, or make their home in places where they can use their numbers to attack and bring down large prey.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Spiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese arachnids are of the giant variety, very poisonous, and extremely fast. They often inhabit places underground, where the moist depth can keep their chitinous skin pliable. They are able to reproduce quickly enough to take control of and inhabit any location they find in only a matter of days.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrolls are shaggy, green-skinned creatures, which often are set to guard areas by high-level mages. They are generally unintelligent, but regenerate any damage done to them quickly. Killing a troll is almost impossible, for doing so would require that the damage be done in such a way as to destroy the flesh, rather than just sever it. It is for this reason that they make such formidable adversaries.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolves are cunning, dangerous hunters who mostly live in forests and glens. They use their highly developed sense of smell to track their prey. They hunt in well-organized packs, and are known for their ferocity in battle. It is rumored that far to the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;North&lt;/a&gt;, is a large and more dangerous version of the normal wolf. These &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Snow Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are said to be able to freeze their prey using some sort of magic.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; Creatures.\nThese are creatures that dwell in the dark and remain in our realm, although they were sentenced to a separate realm after their earlier demise.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese spirits were once human, but are now trapped between here and the ethereal plane. They exist as spirits only, but have a chilling effect upon those they attack. Ghosts have the ability to drain a wizards spell points at range. Ghosts are difficult to hit, and often hide themselves in the shadows, where they are effectively invisible.\nGhosts also have the ability to see invisible creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghoul\"&gt;Ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGhouls are a type of undead are the carrion eaters of dungeons, crypts, and other burial places. They feast on human corpses and rotting flesh. Although they are not very intelligent, they have a natural cunning that aids them in finding food. Because of their vile habits, ghouls have a chance of transmitting a disease to those they bite.\n&lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Liches&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiches are Wizards who have attempted to cheat death by prolonging their life through the use of spells and such, eventually turning themselves into a form of the undead. Few have ever faced such a creature and lived to tell the tale. It is known that they are very powerful, able to defeat high level characters easily, and able see the invisible. They are known to have immunity to most forms of weapons, regeneration capabilities, and any other powers that would be associated with higher level mages. Be cautioned, these creatures are beings of such power that it would be unwise to face one without properly preparing yourself with powerful equipment or artifacts.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkeletons are undead creatures, once human, now animated by some forces either magical or supernatural. They usually are set to guard certain places, such as burial crypts or vaults. They have a single-minded purpose, and will track their foes until the hapless victim is found and destroyed. Skeletons are resistant to edged weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the exception of a Lich, vampires are perhaps the most feared of all the creatures, which prowl the land. Vampires are exceptionally intelligent, very strong, and very fast. They are immune to most normal weapons, and regenerate lost health points. Silver weapons do double damage towards them, however. Because of their reclusive nature, not much else is known about these powerful undead Lords. They are believed to have spell casting ability, the ability to see invisible creatures and the ability to command other creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;.\nWraiths are the spirits of long dead mages, trapped into this state either by the circumstances surrounding their death, or by being called up from the dead by a more powerful Wizard. They often are set to guard things, or to patrol different areas. It is known that Wraiths can cast spells, and will do so in order to destroy any who trespass into their domain. Wraiths also have the ability to see invisible creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese undead are dangerous indeed, for they carry with them the curse of their deaths. Those who are struck by a zombie have a chance of getting a rotting disease, which will slowly but surely eat away at their health, eventually turning the victim into a zombie."}

{"id": "2558", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2558", "title": "Creatures (Oblivion)", "text": "The following is a list and description of creatures found in the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Clannfear, with its terrifying speed and razor sharp claws, is one of the most dangerous Daedric beasts. Its heavy strike and damage reflection make it especially dangerous to melee fighters. Fight it from a distance if possible, or use magic to bypass its damage reflection. Xivilai often summon them to take care of minor opponents while they fight more testable opponents themselves. They resemble bipedal triceratops.\n&lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Clannfear Runt&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Clannfear Runt is a smaller, weaker version of the normal Clannfear. Unlike the normal Clannfear, however, they do not drop &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20Claws\"&gt;Clannfear Claws&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mighty Daedroth can breathe fire and do terrible damage with its teeth and claws. Its &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20Teeth\"&gt;teeth&lt;/a&gt; are highly prized by alchemists, but they remain very rare for a good reason. When fighting one, it is recommended to use enchanted weapons to damage their huge amount of health. (They have a similar appearance to that of a lizard-like alligator-type monster that stands on two hind legs)\n&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Churl%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Churl&lt;/a&gt;.\nDremora are a class of intelligent, powerful war spirits in the service of the Daedric lord &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Churls are among the lowest echelon of the Dremora caste, obsequious to their superiors, cruel to humans and even negligent of other daedra. Like all Dremora, they wield both weapons and magic. Dremora mages may summon lesser daedra to assist them in battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Caitiff%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Caitiff&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaitiffs are the second rank of Dremora. Although still a low rank, they are utilized by Mehrunes Dagon as berserkers. As such, they favor a heavy mace and shield in melee combat, and may use magic as well. The Mage variant uses a multitude of different staves, such as the \"Staff of Burden\", or the \"Staff of Frost\". They often carry potions and scrolls to fortify themselves in battle. Like all other Dremora, they should drop a heart upon death, along with the aforementioned potions, scroll, and weapons;\u00a0they do drop their shield.\n&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Kynval%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Kynval&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe third rank of the Dremora caste, or society, is the Kynval. They are the most powerful of the ranks used in Mehrunes Dagon's main miitary forces, and are the equivalent of knights. They wear Dremora Kynval Armor, and may wear helmets (a sign of their superiority); They wield longswords and will not hesitate to use magic or potions to gain an advantage in combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Kynreeve%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Kynreeve&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dremora Kynreeve is the lowest rank of officer in the Mehrunes Dagon's army. They make up for the bottom tier of units and are much an equivalent to the kynvall when it comes to choice of weapons, and serve as an administration unit, charged with guarding the various planes of Mehrunes' Wastes. They carry Longswords, Maces, and Shields, unless otherwise the Mage variant.\n&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Kynmarcher%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Kynmarcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next tier of officer in the Dremora rank is the Kynmarcher. They are equivalent to a lord, and are high officers responsible for strict enrollment of guard at the citadel, outpost, or the gate. They serve as a commander of the clan battle unit, which is much tasked with the overlay of the Towers in the Wastes. These dangerous warriors wield heavy claymores, which are often enchanted, as well as an array of potions and spells. Aside from this, they make for higher powered mages, using more deadly staves in battle, or drain spells.\n&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Markynaz%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Markynaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Markynaz, or grand dukes, rule of the lesser variants of the army, as well as the Daedra that preside over their controlled regions of society. They serve Mehrunes Dagon on the Council of Lords, also known as the Markyn. The Markynaz make for good archers, equal to the lesserly ranked officers and soldiers, the Kynreeve. They pack further damage with Claymores than most other units below them.\n&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Valkynaz%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Valkynaz&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Valkynaz are at the highest echelon of Mehrunes Dagon's elite personal guard. They reside at the upper pinnacle of the Dremora society. They serve as Princes and Commanders, and possess unique membership in the personal guard of Dagon, the Valkyn. They are the most dangerous foes encountered in Dagon's realm, wielding any form of weapon available, and possess superior ability in comparison to the lesser ranks of all other Dremora. They have far superior and authoritarian mages, using the spells of a Master wizard, and wield the deadliest of staves. They appear around player level 22 or higher.\n&lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Flame Atronach is a powerful Daedric summoning associated with the element fire. Crystalline elemental fire compounds called &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Salts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Salts&lt;/a&gt; may be salvaged from the remains of Flame Atronachs. They prefer to stand off and blast their enemies with fireballs, but they are equally dangerous in melee. Use frost magic to bring them down quickly. They are the only Atronach to have a female appearance. But do not be fooled: These Atronachs are not small and weak as they seem to be; they can deal a great damage, and even set fire to their enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\n The ponderous Frost Atronach makes up in hitting power what it lacks in speed, so stay out of reach of its huge fists. It makes for the lesser guards in the Fortresses of Dagon, so when near gate levers, beware of their presence. In comparison to the Flame Atronach, the Frost Atronach maintains its hostility to enemies, so running is not an option. Its freezing grip can do lasting frost damage, and it can hurl icy chunks of its body great distances.\n&lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scamp is a weak, cowardly servant of Mehrunes Dagon. Scamps may be summoned by Conjurers and their &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20Skin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; is sought by alchemists for its magical properties.\n&lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bizarre Spider Daedra can spit poison great distances, along with shock spells. But, even more deadly is its ability to summon a tiny spiderling that has a paralyzing bite. It is best to avoid close combat with these foes.\n&lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese Atronachs are associated with elemental shock, and are the most powerful of the three encountered in Oblivion. They appear as a cluster of rocks around an unknown variable of mass and power. The main attack is a greatly damaging bolt of lightning emitting from the 'clap' of the atronach, as it make the point of doing. It can attack with its fists, which happen to be bare rock, so take caution to eliminate this Greater Daedra from afar, such as with a bow, or high powered spell.\n&lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Stunted Scamp&lt;/a&gt;.\nA smaller and weaker cousin of the Scamp. They shoot Fireballs at any who venture towards their domain.\n&lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Xivilai is quite possibly the most fearsome of all Daedra. Standing in at seven feet or taller, they are monstrous. Human in appearance, the Xivilai is blue-skinned, with red markings across its arms and legs. Their eyes are aglow, and they have mane-like hair. If a Xivilai is confronted, watch out for their fire and shock damage spells. Also note that in battle, they will summon Clannfear almost immediately, so eliminate this target first. They use two-handed weapons in combat as well. \"Summoned\" Xivilai have the further chance of summoning a Clannfear.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Ghost\"&gt;Ancient Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike all non-corporeal undead, the Ancient Ghost can only be harmed by silver or magical weaponry, or &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic. It can turn itself invisible, and strike from an unexpected direction.\n&lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Bear&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe smaller of the two bears native to Cyrodiil, the black bear is still a dangerous opponent. It hits hard but is not particularly fast so it is best dealt with from a distance.\n&lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Brown Bear&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis huge bear can take a tremendous punishment and can\u00a0still stay on its feet. A blow from its paw can stagger even the mightiest warrior, so treat this woodland giant with respect.\n&lt;a href=\"Boar\"&gt;Boar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe woodland boar's tough hide makes it surprisingly dangerous for its compact size. The Boar can do a great deal of damage if it can land a blow, so staying outside of its relatively short reach is advisable. A unique, prized Boar named &lt;a href=\"Porkchop\"&gt;Porkchop&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the arena of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and is a widely known mascot for the blue team.\n&lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Deer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeer are found throughout the woodlands and fields of Cyrodiil. They are skittish and will flee from danger, but hunters prize their meat. The buck is rather more dangerous when forced to fight. When they are killed they may have &lt;a href=\"Venison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Venison&lt;/a&gt; on them.\n&lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dog&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese large, fierce creatures are often employed as guard dogs by &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;marauders&lt;/a&gt; due to their keen sense of smell and excellent eyesight. However, several citizens throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; keep dogs as pets in their &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;houses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shops&lt;/a&gt;, and as travel companions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dread%20Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dread Zombie&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dread Zombie is easily recognizable by the foul cloud of corruption it exudes. This cloud may in some way contribute to the Dread Zombie's ability to slowly repair its damaged flesh, which makes it a very dangerous opponent, particularly when attacking in groups. As with all zombies, fire is the best remedy.\n&lt;a href=\"Faded%20Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Faded Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe faded wraith is the weaker version of the Wraith, but it is deadly enough. Spellcasters need to especially beware of its ability to silence its enemies. Not completely incorporeal like the Ghost, the Wraith is even capable of using weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Gran%20Struthe\"&gt;Gran Struthe&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe body of Gran Struthe can be found in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Scinia\"&gt;Fort Scinia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese restless spirits can only be harmed with silver or enchanted weapons. Beware of their ability to curse fatigue.\n&lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gloom Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe strongest version of the Wraith, the Gloom Wraith adds a burden/absorb health curse to the usual deadly combination of weapon, claw, silence, and ranged frost attacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe common goblin is dangerous only in packs. They rarely venture from their underground lairs. Typically armed with iron weapons, they may also carry lockpicks. They are no real threat to a well-armed adventurer. One can often find them roaming the wilds, or deep within caves and sewers.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Skirmisher\"&gt;Goblin Skirmisher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Goblin Skirmisher is stronger than the common Goblin and is often armed with a bow.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Berserker\"&gt;Goblin Berserker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Berserker carries the best weapon of any Goblin and may also carry a shield. Their high agility makes them formidable melee opponents.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shaman\"&gt;Goblin Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Goblin Shaman is a dangerous spellcasting opponent. Be particularly wary of its ability to paralyze within melee range. The shaman may carry a staff (what's sinister is the fact that the staff usually has the appearance of a totem pole with a disfigured goblin head mounted on top), but even without it has a range of spells to call on in combat, including summoning a headless zombie.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Warlord\"&gt;Goblin Warlord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Goblin Warlord is the most powerful Goblin, wielding a variety of weapons and a shield.\n&lt;a href=\"Headless%20Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Headless Zombie&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeadless Zombies are even fiercer than their cranially-advantaged fellows, perhaps due to their futile longing to regain their brain. As with all Zombies, fire is the preferred method of laying them to rest.\n&lt;a href=\"Bay%20Horse\"&gt;Bay Horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nMore expensive than the Paint Horse, the Bay Horse is faster, but with lower health.\n&lt;a href=\"Chestnut%20Horse\"&gt;Chestnut Horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Chestnut Horse is faster than the Bay and Paint Horses but has the lowest health of all horses.\n&lt;a href=\"Paint%20Horse\"&gt;Paint Horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hardy Paint Horse is a good choice for anyone needing a reliable mount for a reasonable price.\n&lt;a href=\"White%20Horse\"&gt;White Horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe White Horse is as fast as the Chestnut Horse, but far sturdier. Only the Black Horse is faster (as well as &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Black%20Horse\"&gt;Black Horse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Black Horse is the most expensive in addition to being the fastest. With only slightly lower health than the White Horse, it also has the best combat skill of any of the horses.\n&lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;.\nImps are equally at home in the forests and caves of Cyrodiil. Usually solitary, they possess a mean intelligence that can make them dangerous opponents. Many an unwary traveler has been surprised by a blast of magic from a distant Imp. They generally use fire, frost and shock spells in combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Land%20Dreugh%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Land Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Land Dreugh is one of the odder creatures to infest the wilds of Cyrodiil. Its thick shell is highly resistant to both magical and normal damage, and it has the ability to direct electricity into its opponent through its claws. Thankfully it is rather slow moving, so keeping out of its way is the best way to deal with it.\n&lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lich is the pinnacle of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancer's&lt;/a&gt; art. Particularly dangerous to spellcasters, the lich is difficult to harm with magic and has a wide variety of high level spells to draw upon.\n&lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;.\nA fierce fighter with either fists or a warhammer. Watch out for the Minotaur's head-butt, which will not only severely injure its foe, but will also heavily damage their armor. A determined foe, Minotaurs will often follow their prey over field and forest, finally surprising the traveler when they think they have reached safety.\n&lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20Lord\"&gt;Minotaur Lord&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Minotaur Lord adds magic resistance to the already dangerous capabilities of the normal Minotaur.\n&lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Lion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mountain Lion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mountain Lion's high agility and heavy strike make it a very dangerous melee opponent.\n&lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;.\nA dangerous nuisance near any body of water, Mudcrabs are interesting only as a source of succulent crabmeat.\n&lt;a href=\"Nether%20Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nether Lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nA weaker version of the Lich, the Nether Lich is still a formidable opponent, with almost all of the same dangerous magic abilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe huge Ogre deals tremendous damage with its fists, if it can get close enough. Despite their great size, Ogres are surprisingly susceptible to poisons of all kinds.\n&lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Rat&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rat is a hardy, abundant hunter and scavenger, found both above and below ground. A favorite food source for Goblins, although most civilized folk would prefer other fare. Dangerous only in large numbers. These are the first creatures that are not humanoid to be encountered in .\n&lt;a href=\"Sheep%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sheep&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe common domesticated sheep is placid and non-aggressive.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skeleton is a revenant that can be found wherever the restless dead are buried. Often the creation of Necromancers pursuing their dark researches, they are capable of using all manner of melee weapons, although the most common Skeleton is usually armed with a war axe.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skeleton Guardian dimly remembers its former life as a warrior and wields mace, shield, and bow with deadly skill.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skeleton Hero is a dangerous opponent in melee combat, as it can use a full repertoire of advanced combat moves and is equally adept at blocking.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Skeleton Champion is a dangerous opponent in melee combat and will often carry a weapon as good as an Emperor's.\n&lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe slaughterfish is an aggressive predator found in both open waters and subterranean pools, its scales are also hunted for alchemy.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Timber Wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nA larger and fiercer cousin of the Wolf, Timber Wolves can bring down the largest prey when a pack has assembled.\n&lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpriggans are guardian nature spirits, found both above and below ground. When in combat, Spriggans will summon a black bear to help take down its enemies. It also has the ability to heal itself completely three times, so it can be a very difficult opponent to kill, unless defeated quickly.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Troll's uncanny ability to regenerate itself makes it a very dangerous opponent. Fire, magical or otherwise, is one of the quickest ways to put an end to a Troll. To the common civilians in Cyrodiil, it is a perfectly acceptable to run if said trolls are seen.\n&lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Will-o-the-Wisp&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Will-o-the-Wisp is unlike any other creature that can be encountered in Cyrodiil. It is difficult to hit with magic and ranged weapons. Its best to charge in head first as they lack a melee attack. They are treated as ghost and cannot be killed with normal weapons, only Silver, Daedric or enchanted weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wraith can attack with claw, weapon, or magic. Beware of its silence spell, and make sure to bring a magic or silver weapon, because it is immune to normal weapon damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nA common predator throughout Cyrodiil, wolves can be found both outdoors and in the caves where they make their lairs. Vampires often keep them as guards and companions."}

{"id": "148117", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=148117", "title": "Creatures (Shivering Isles)", "text": "The following is a list and description of creatures found in .\n&lt;a href=\"Baliwog%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Baliwog&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Baliwog is a predatory, amphibious creature that dwells in the lakes, rivers, and bogs of the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;; they are most prevalent between &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth\"&gt;New Sheoth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Madness%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gates of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Elytra%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Elytra are large insect-like creatures indigenous to much of the Isles.\n&lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Flesh Atronach appears as a sewn-together conglomeration of skin and muscle adorned with mystical symbols and wearing an iron collar. A prime example of this is the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, an enormous Flesh Atronach.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnarls are large Ent-like creatures that use &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; and physical force as their primary attack.\n&lt;a href=\"Grummite%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Grummite&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrummites are one of the most common enemies in the Shivering Isles, akin to &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps Baliwogs in the Shivering Isles. Despite the fact that Grummites are common, the citizens of the Shivering Isles know very little about them.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf any creature represents the darker side of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, it's the Hunger. These are pure-born Daedric creatures placed on the Isles as servitors and guards. The Hunger is not to be trifled with; it boasts superior speed and lightning reflexes along with its primary ability of draining its victim's fatigue.\n&lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Order%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Knight of Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnights of Order are &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; who serve the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Scalon\"&gt;Scalon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother aquatic native of the Shivering Isles, is the Scalon. Looking strikingly similar to an upright Baliwog, the Scalon features large fin-laden appendages and dorsal spines. These creatures are usually quite fearsome, lumbering slowly after its prey.\n&lt;a href=\"Shambles\"&gt;Shambles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shambles appears to be some sort of an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; construct made of bone and lashed together with wire or bits of cloth. Oddly, the bones used in their makeup appear to have no correlation to one another. They might have skulls for kneecaps or leg bones for arms, to cite a few examples. The Shambles may be undead, but they pursue any victim as if they were a predator chasing down its prey.\n&lt;a href=\"Skinned%20Hound%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Skinned Hound&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese undead creatures are generally encountered inside and around the ruins that are found throughout the Shivering Isles. The Skinned Hound is extremely fast and agile. Like the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, it appears to be composed of skin and muscle that is roughly sewn together, but it is uncertain whether they are summoned like &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; or merely constructed."}

For humanoid enemies, see &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnimals.\nDomesticated animals.\nDomesticated animals are usually found in camps, villages, cities or occasionally wandering about alone. If these animals are harmed or stolen (in the case of horses), the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will earn a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; in that &lt;a href=\"hold\"&gt;hold&lt;/a&gt; or city. Note that the player can ride the horse.\nWild predators.\nWild predators are usually hostile (or neutral at a certain distance).\nWild prey.\nWild prey are usually not hostile unless attacked or if one gets to close.\nInsects.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Some can be eaten; others are useful &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nFish are useful as food or alchemy ingredients. The only hostile fish is the Slaughterfish.\nChaurus.\nChaurus are worm-like insectoid creatures that typically live underground in caves and even in &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20ruins\"&gt;Dwemer ruins&lt;/a&gt;. They are deadly creatures, possessing the ability to spit out poisonous venom from their mouths, but they also use bite attacks during combat. Chaurus are almost always seen with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; in the underground cave networks and Dwemer ruins of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The Chaurus appear to be used by the Falmer as pets and as fighters in combat, as well as torturers of people when their Falmer masters attack and capture &lt;a href=\"bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, traveling caravans and other people.\nDaedra.\nThe Daedra are creatures that roam the &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and are usually summoned by powerful mages, usually of the &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; school. A Dremora is a devilish humanoid being wearing &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt; and wielding burning\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, but can also be extremely adept at using magic and casting spells. &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s are humanoid beings (except the Storm Atronach) that\u00a0are formed out of their own element of power: Flame, Frost, or Storm.\nDragons.\nDragons are giant, legendary, reptilian creatures with the abilities to fly, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; and breathe &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraugr.\nDraugr are the reanimated bodies of deceased &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, that are usually found in old dungeons and ancient Nordic ruins.\nNamed Draugr.\nThese bosses are\u00a0legendary\u00a0figures of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic history that have been reanimated and\u00a0are a few out of many enemies that the Dragonborn will encounter in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Automatons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Automatons are not entirely creatures, Dwarven Automatons range in size from smaller than a human to larger than a giant. They are golden colored, strong robotic creations made by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. They are also extremely resistant to frost damage. They are very strong at lower levels but get easier.\nFalmer.\nThe Falmer are a race of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; who have devolved into primitive creatures inhabiting the dark underground and remote areas of Skyrim. They were once the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0until they lost a war with the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0forcing them to live underground with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, who blinded and enslaved them.\nFrostbite Spiders.\nFrostbite Spiders are giant spiders found in caves and ruins all over Skyrim. They shoot balls of poisonous web, and can range in size from smaller than the Dragonborn to bigger.\nGiants.\nGiants are, as their name states, giant humanoid beings who cannot speak, instead yelling at the Dragonborn to move away if they get too close or threaten their mammoths.\nHagravens.\nHagravens are a mix of an old crone and a crow, and are exclusively female. They are often called witches, and many serve the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; as Matriarchs.\nHorses.\nThere are three named horses in Skyrim: Shadowmere, a black horse with red, glowing eyes; Frost, a pale-gray horse that must be stolen to own; and finally, Arvak, an undead horse added in .\nShades.\nShades are the ghostly and corrupted remnants of the deceased, exclusive to Meridia's Temple on Mount Kilkreath.\nSkeletons.\nSkeletons are skeletal, humanoid beings who usually use &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; as their offense. Skeletons are extremely easy to defeat.\nSpriggans.\nSpriggan are tree-like humanoid creatures, always female. Matrons tend to be harder to defeat than the usual Spriggan, with their heavier armor and more powerful magics. They are guardians of nature, and specific groups follow either &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrolls.\nTrolls are large, ape-like creatures with three eyes, and their usual loot is only &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Troll Fat&lt;/a&gt; inside a bowl. Trolls inhabit most of Skyrim, but they are uncommon. Two types of trolls can be found, regular and Frost trolls. Frost trolls, as their name suggests, live in colder regions with snow.\nWisps.\nWisps are glowing, spherical creatures flying around that will attack the Dragonborn. They are usually near their mother, the Wispmother, who is a female, glowing humanoid being that is difficult to defeat. Wispmothers are also resistant to Frost. Shades are creatures different from the creature type shades, as they are ghostly apparitions conjured by a Wispmother."}

Their warchiefs use a plethora of different offensive &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, lower ranking goblins do not rely on the use of magic, apart from a high health &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, instead, they are fierce combatants at close range wielding their custom made weapons. During the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Goblin%20Army\"&gt;The Goblin Army&lt;/a&gt;\" it is revealed that King &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; is secretly raising an army of Goblins in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mournhold\"&gt;Old Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. There are several types of goblins:\n&lt;a href=\"Durzog%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Durzogs&lt;/a&gt;.\nDurzog are creatures often used by Goblins as guards and to protect them. They are powerful reptilian beasts that use quick slashing and biting attacks. Three varieties of the Durzog exist: the regular, wild Durzog, and the powerful, Goblin-trained War Durzog, which can be distinguished by a spiked collar,and the Diseased Durzog. They can mainly be found in Old Mournhold during the quest \"The Goblin Army.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Imperfect%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Imperfects&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Imperfect are large mechanical golems constructed by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, they serve him as bodyguards. They use powerful magic and have high magical resistance. Although two Imperfects can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, only one is functional.\n&lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Liches&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany Liches can be found throughout Old Mournhold, and start appearing as the Nerevarine reaches higher &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level%23Morrowind\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Infected Rats&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plague%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Crimson Plague&lt;/a&gt;,\" an infestation of diseased rats will flood into Mournhold. They are common rats that can inflict their opponents with the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plague%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;crimson plague&lt;/a&gt; that drains &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;endurance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Fabricants&lt;/a&gt;.\nFabricants were created by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, they exhibit both mechanical and organic properties. They are mainly found in Sotha Sil's Clockwork City. Two kinds of Fabricants exist:\nHulking Fabricants.\nHulking Fabricants are one of two types of fabricants that appear during \"&lt;a href=\"An%20Attack%20on%20Mournhold\"&gt;An Attack on Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;\" and are also found in Clockwork City. They are slow and powerful, especially when compared to their counterpart, the \"Verminous Fabricant.\"\nVerminous Fabricants.\nVerminous Fabricants are one of two types of fabricants that also appeared during \"An Attack on Mournhold\" and roam the halls of Clockwork City. They are very fast.\n&lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Dwemer constructs&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mysterious &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; left behind many mechanical creatures, that still patrol the halls of their abandoned &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins\"&gt;Citadels&lt;/a&gt;, one of these ruins is discovered during the quest \"An Attack on Mournhold\" named &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;. They can use &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; weapons, the following creatures are found inside:\n&lt;a href=\"Steam%20Centurion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Steam Centurions&lt;/a&gt;.\nSteam centurions and the Advanced Steam Centurions, which are larger versions, use their mace-like limb as weapon and are relatively slow but deadly.\n&lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Archer\"&gt;Centurion Archer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is a variant of the &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Sphere%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Centurion Sphere&lt;/a&gt;, that uses deadly &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Shock%20Dart\"&gt;projectiles&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Sphere%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Centurion Spheres&lt;/a&gt;.\nA construct that is most commonly found in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;'s Dwemer ruins and uses melee attacks.\n&lt;a href=\"Centurion%20Spider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Centurion Spiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nA small creature with six legs that guards the ruins of Bamz-Amschend.\nPets.\nIn Mournhold's &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bazaar\"&gt;Great Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, a merchant named &lt;a href=\"Rerlas%20Mon\"&gt;Rerlas Mon&lt;/a&gt; can be found selling small pets and pack rats that can carry items for the owner.

For example, attacking any NPC unprovoked is considered an assault by the game; however, not all assaults will result in a bounty. There must be a guard nearby to witness the crime before the Hero will be charged with committing it. Technically speaking, there is a hidden setting on all NPCs called Responsibility that affects their criminal behavior. NPCs with lower values are more likely to commit crimes (for example, all &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fences&lt;/a&gt; have a low Responsibility). Any NPC with the maximum Responsibility of 100, which primarily includes the city guards and the named guard NPCs, can add a bounty to the Hero. Guards within about 140 feet of a witness will respond to an alarm.\nA guard can either see a crime first-hand, or they can be notified about it from other witnesses nearby. Such witnesses will yell out an alarm, such as \"There's a madman on the loose!\" (assault), or \"Stop! Thief!\" (pickpocket), when they want to report crime to the guards. Not all NPCs will raise an alarm. For example, most of the companion characters that can be obtained after completing &lt;a href=\"Side%20Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;side quests&lt;/a&gt; will rarely raise an alarm against the Hero. If one commits a crime out of both sight and hearing range of any guards, or if there is no alarm raised, the Hero will not receive a bounty. The only way to detect that a crime has been committed is by looking at one's &lt;a href=\"journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuards.\nAny guard who witnesses a crime in progress can place a bounty upon the Hero. Guards can also hear alarms raised by other NPCs. Once a guard hears such an alarm, it behaves exactly as if he had seen the crime himself. Once a guard detects the crime, it is \"reported\" to the authorities across all of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; instantly. Even if the guard witnesses all die (such as during a large-scale battle), the crime has already been reported across the province.\nIf the Hero has a bounty, any guard they will encounter will know of it. If a hostile guard is chasing the Hero, any other guards encountered will become hostile as well. Outrunning all pursuers will no longer trigger an automatic arrest around new guards. However, if any guards are spoken to, they will be aware of the crime and ask for the bounty to be paid.\nIt should be noted that any witnesses of a crime may lower their &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; towards the Hero, even if one is not caught by a guard. Generally speaking, if one commits a crime against someone whom the witnesses have a high disposition towards, their disposition towards the Hero will lower. The victim may be either the target of the crime, or the owner of the objects or room that were the target of the crime. A victim's disposition will lower by twice as much as any other witness.\nTheft and pickpocketing.\nBoth theft and pickpocketing involve taking items that do not belong to the Hero. Theft occurs when the Hero takes an object from the world, or from a container, and is punished based on the value of the item. Pickpocketing involves taking items from an NPCs inventory, and is punishable at a fixed amount. Even attempting to pickpocket someone is a crime, if they detect the Hero. In both cases, if one is sneaking when trying to take the item (which is always the case with pickpocketing), the weight and size of the object determines how likely it is to be detected. As a special case, pickpocketed gold, even though it weighs nothing, is very likely to result in being detected when taken. Each item taken is another occurrence of a crime; for pickpocketing, each item taken causes another chance to be detected by the victim.\nStolen items are permanently marked as such in one's inventory, and most merchants will not buy them. Only merchants with a very low responsibility level will even consider buying stolen goods. Primarily, this means &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, but a few other merchants, including the &lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow%20Cove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Dunbarrow Cove&lt;/a&gt; pirates, will also deal with them. Only selling to sanctioned guild fences counts towards one's fenced items total for the Thieves Guild quests.\nNote that picking open a locked chest or container, by itself, is not a crime. An object will need to be removed from the container to count as a theft. It should also be noted that, if a guard's disposition is over 91, they will not arrest the Hero for pickpocketing/theft.\nAssault and murder.\nNot all attacks constitute an assault. If the NPC becomes hostile towards the Hero and attempts to attack them, there is no crime in attacking them in response. It is not a crime to attack a non-NPC creature (except owned farm animals), and certain NPC characters are considered \"evil\" enough that it is not a crime to attack them, regardless of their actions against the Hero.\nOtherwise, any attack on an NPC is a crime. By definition, this includes any attempt to sneak attack someone. Attacking allied NPCs accidentally is also an assault; however, they will not report the Hero to a guard immediately. If one attacks an ally in direct sight of a guard, this will result in a bounty. In some cases, particularly when the guards are following the Hero for a quest, they will ignore the first occurrence of a crime, even if they witness it. Allies will give three warnings to the Hero if they hit them, before turning hostile and calling for guards.\nIf any non-hostile NPC is killed, it is considered murder. Again, this includes potentially hostile NPCs, if they are managed to have been killed before they become hostile. As an example, killing &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; sleeper agents who have not yet become hostile is murder. This can cause problems during battles with multiple allies and guards present. If an ally is accidentally killed with a single attack and a guard is present, all guards immediately become hostile. Even if all witnessing guards are killed, any other guard detects the Hero will attempt an arrest. Unlike assaults, there is never any leeway granted for accidentally murdering an ally. Lastly, one's first murder, detected or not, will always be detected by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, and will trigger a visit the next time the Hero sleeps.\nThere is a glitch in the game that makes murder counter-intuitive. To commit murder, one must be directly responsible dealing the last point of health damage. For example, a spell cast from the Hero that does damage over time will result in murder if the NPC is killed from it. However, if one poisons or enchants a weapon with a \"damage over time\" effect, and the poison or enchantment kills the NPC gradually, then the game will attribute the NPC's death to the poison or enchantment, rather than the person who stuck the NPC, and will only result in a 40 assault bounty. The same thing applies if one feeds an NPC a &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Apple\"&gt;Poisoned Apple&lt;/a&gt; or pushes them off of a cliff or into a pit of lava.\nHowever, this glitch has some downsides. If one's ally is in battle and is killed by friendly fire from the Hero, the Hero will be guilty of murder. If a summoned creature kills or assaults an NPC, the Hero will still be guilty of the crime, even though they were not directly responsible for it.\nTrespassing.\nIf a guard sees the Hero trespassing, they will immediately receive the trespass bounty. Other NPCs, however, will usually be more lenient. Trespassing around \"off-duty\" guards may also not immediately trigger a bounty, although this is a rare occurrence. Non-guard NPCs will warn the Hero a number of times to leave the area before alarming the guards, and will follow them until they leave. If one continues to trespass in their line of sight, the NPC will become increasingly hostile. After a short period of time, the NPC will determine that the Hero is intentionally trespassing, and will become hostile. They will call for guards and will begin to attack. If no guards are nearby, the Hero can flee the area without receiving a bounty. Even if the victim follows and attacks the Hero in a public area, one will still not receive a bounty.\nIt should be noted that picking open a locked door, by itself, is not a crime. However, in most cases, locked doors lead to owned rooms, and entering such a room is trespassing. A crime will be committed as soon as one enters through the door after unlocking it. A guard which sees the Hero go through the door will attempt an arrest. However, it is possible for a door to be locked, but the room beyond be public (the door icon is not red); it is also possible for an unlocked door to still lead to an area that is off limits. In such cases, the room, not the door lock, determines if the law is being broken.\nGuards.\nWhenever one resists arrest or avoids to pay the penalty for crime, guards around &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; will confront or attack the Hero. &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fast traveling&lt;/a&gt; to another city will not stop this from occurring.\nDealing with the bounty.\nPaying the bounty.\nPaying the bounty will remove the amount of gold asked for, as well as all stolen items that are non-quest related.\nJail.\nWhile in jail, the Hero will be able to hide one &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;. All previous attire will be replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Oblivion%29%23Shirts\"&gt;shirt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Oblivion%29%23Pants\"&gt;pants&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Oblivion%29%23Shoes\"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt;. If the Hero successfully escapes from prison, they will have to sneak past or kill the guards in the jail and city, as well as retrieve their items from the Evidence Chest in the prison.\nNote that the locks on the cell door are always \"hard\" or \"very hard,\" meaning that, if one has an &lt;a href=\"Open%20Hard%20Lock\"&gt;Open Hard Lock&lt;/a&gt; spell, the door can be unlocked without using the lockpick.\nOtherwise, the Hero can sleep in the bed in their cell and serve their time in jail. Every 100 in the bounty equates to one day in prison. For each day spent in prison, one of the Hero's &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; will degrade. The skills that are affected are chosen randomly; one could lose a single point from several skills, several points from a single skill, or a combination of the two. There is also a chance that &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; skills may be chosen, and will raise instead. You cannot lose or gain more than 10 skill points in a single jail sentence.\nThere are numerous companion bugs which may bring NPCs that were once part of one's party to the jail entrance; the first the Hero is likely to encounter are the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; NPCs from quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Desolate%20Mine\"&gt;The Desolate Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nResisting arrest.\nUpon choosing to resist arrest, the guard being spoken to, as well as any other guards in the vicinity, will attack immediately. The Hero may either kill all of the guards in the vicinity, yield to one of them (this is usually only possible with the local captain), or run and find a &lt;a href=\"Doyen\"&gt;Doyen&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; to pay off the bounty. This can be difficult, as fast traveling is disabled while being pursued by guards.\nIf the Hero is a member of a &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;, another method is to head to that faction's guildhouse, which will allow the other members to attack the guards. Afterwards, the guards will not attack the Hero, but will attempt to make the Hero pay the fine once spoken to. If the Hero engages any guard in conversation, they will once again give the options of paying the fine, going to jail, or resisting arrest.\nAnother method, if the Hero is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; and has a bounty of less than 1000 , is to create a charming spell, then use it on a guard. Immediately after casting it, talk to the guard. He will tell the Hero that, because they are friends, he will take care of the bounty. However, this is also possible if the Hero has a very high &lt;a href=\"Fame\"&gt;Fame&lt;/a&gt; rating (80\u2013100).\nThieves Guild.\nIf the Hero is a member of the Thieves Guild, they can pay half of the bounty to a Thieves Guild Doyen and clear the fine. This is the only way for the Hero to keep any stolen items without having to resist arrest or ignore the guards.\nNPCs and crimes.\nNPCs follow most of the same rules to crimes, but with one notable exception: they cannot be jailed unless a specific script tells the guard to take them to jail (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Llathasa%27s%20Bust\"&gt;Llathasa's Bust&lt;/a&gt; in the Thieves Guild quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Elven%20Maiden\"&gt;The Elven Maiden&lt;/a&gt;\"). They must either pay their fine or resist arrest. Like the Hero, an NPC can only pay their fine if they have the necessary gold in their inventory. If they cannot pay the fine, they must resist arrest, which usually results in their death. The Hero can choose to give the NPC the necessary gold by bribing them in the persuasion minigame. However, there is a scripting glitch that may prevent an NPC's bounty from being reset to zero automatically. At this point, the only way to keep the NPC alive is to either clear their bounty manually using &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;, or continue bribing them with a supply of gold."}

It covers the numerous crimes the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; can commit and the consequences for doing so.\nBackground.\nCrime in \"The Elder Scrolls Online\" introduces a new mechanic called &lt;a href=\"Heat\"&gt;Heat&lt;/a&gt;. Heat determines how &lt;a href=\"Guards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; react towards the Vestige and how quickly their &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; meter cools off. Heat has three levels: Disreputable, where the guards will only stop the Vestige if they are too close, Notorious where they will actively look for them and accost them on sight, and Fugitive where they will kill them on sight. The Vestige's heat level is determined by the severity of the crime they commit and will only cool off if they manage to hide from the guards or escape into an &lt;a href=\"Outlaw%20Refuge\"&gt;Outlaw Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of crime.\nCrimes are divided into two categories: petty crimes, such as &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;thieving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"pickpocketing\"&gt;pickpocketing&lt;/a&gt;, and major crimes, such as murder and assault. Major crimes will give the Vestige a higher bounty and heat level, while petty crimes will give them a lower bounty and heat level.\nHeat (infamy).\nIf the Vestige is caught committing a crime, the heat meter increases. The meter reaches certain levels based on the crime. The higher the heat, the more aggressive and severe the law will be.\nUpstanding.\nUpstanding is the default heat level. At this level, no bounty is currently in place and the Vestige does not have any potential crimes being held against them.\nDisreputable.\nDisreputable is the level reached when a petty crime has been committed. Guards will only try to arrest the Vestige and use no violent force.\nNotorious.\nNotorious is the level reached when a major crime has been committed. Guards will be on high alert searching for the Vestige, and their social status is in an outcast position as some characters will refuse to exchange dialogue.\nFugitive from Justice.\nFugitive is the level reached when a major crime has been committed and the Vestige has resisted arrest or has a very high bounty. Guards will attempt to kill them on sight.\nArrest.\nIf the Vestige has a bounty on their head and guard catches them, they will place them under arrest and ask them to pay their bounty. They have the option of paying their bounty or resisting arrest and fleeing the guard, which will instantly mark them as kill-on-sight to the guards.\nIf the Vestige does not manage to escape from the guard, they will kill them, take the respective amount of gold off their body and pay their bounty with it. If the Vestige's bounty is higher than their gold balance, all of their gold will be taken and they will be left with no gold at all.\nOutlaw Refuges, Fences and smuggling.\nEach major city has an &lt;a href=\"outlaw%20refuge\"&gt;outlaw refuge&lt;/a&gt; with two entrances: one on the inside and one on the outside. Outlaw Refuges are also a way to enter and exit cities undetected, sell stolen goods, and unmark goods as stolen, allowing the Vestige to keep them and use them without consequence. The Vestige can also pay their bounty at a &lt;a href=\"Fences%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt; without the consequence of losing their stolen goods. This means the Vestige can sell their stolen goods and use them to pay their bounty. However, the Vestige can only sell a certain number of items to a fence per day. This amount can be increased through the &lt;a href=\"Legerdemain\"&gt;Legerdemain&lt;/a&gt; skill line.\nEvery Outlaw Refuge has at least one fence, &lt;a href=\"guild%20store\"&gt;guild store&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Banks%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;. There are also various characters which can be engaged with in conversation. The Refuges are also a place for other criminal players to socialize and plot heists and other such types of organized crime.\nAll stolen goods have a set price based on their rarity:\nLegerdemain.\nA skill line dedicated to criminal activities has been introduced: Legerdemain. It contains skills beneficial to sneaking, smuggling and trespassing and is composed entirely of passives."}

He's hiding somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Barrows\"&gt;Sanguine Barrows&lt;/a&gt; and I've agreed to find him and bring him out.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Vestige can find Marisette southwest of &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Barrows\"&gt;Sanguine Barrows&lt;/a&gt;. Once she is spoken to, she will begin to explain her situation and ask the Vestige for help, saying:\n\"\"I know you. &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. That mad plan to take on &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. Crazy. Let me ask you, though. If someone committed a heinous crime\u2014slaughtering innocent people and such\u2014 could they ever be forgiven, or should they suffer for the rest of their lives?\"\"\nSo he was acting on King Ranser's orders? \"Of course, but that makes him no less guilty. The dog that bites cannot blame his master for letting him off the chain. Althen willfully organized the slaughter of innocent people, and he will pay for that crime no matter how long it takes.\"\nAfterwards, the Vestige will then need to seek out the first hidden clue. This clue, a &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Althen\"&gt;Letter from Althen&lt;/a&gt;, will be found beside a corpse being eating by a Troll. This letter will reveal that Althen is in the Sanguine Barrows Crypt. Once the door is knocked upon, Gerard Althen, will speak out from behind the door, and will say:\n\"Who's out there? Turenn? Tell me that's you.\"\nAfter this, the Vestige will need to go to an altar north of the crypt to find his letter. Along the way, there will be multiple &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeevers&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;. Once the letter from his pack is read, the Vestige must then return to him in order know how to release him. Once he is spoken to, he will give the Vestige the needed instructions:\n\"You're back? Thank the gods! The walls of this crypt are closing in on me now. Ever since I realized I might die in here. Funny how the mind does that. Did you find my pack though? Did you find the letter?\"\nIn order to activate the levers to open the door, the Vestige will need to retrieve their corresponding keys. The &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt; key can be found in a crypt southwest of the Sanguine Barrow, while the &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;House Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; key can be found in a crypt directly east. Within both crypts are multiple Skeevers and a Troll. The general location of the keys within the crypts are almost identical, except that the House Dorell key will need to be dug out from a dirt pile in the left corner of the room, while the House Tamrith key will need to be dug out of a dirt pile in the right corner of the room.\nAfter both of the keys are retrieved, the Vestige will then need to activate the south and north levers. The north lever is located on a hill directly in front of the entrance of the House Dorell crypt. It will be behind a boulder that is guarded by another troll.\nBehind the entrance of Tamrith crypt to the left is a chest, as well as &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orichalcum Ore&lt;/a&gt;. There will also be two trolls, which will be found near a hole containing a skeleton and the &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Modern%20Heretics\"&gt;Modern Heretics&lt;/a&gt;.\" The south lever can be found behind a boulder on a hill directly in front of the entrance.\nOnce this is done, the Vestige can then be able to enter the Sanguine Barrows Crypt to speak with Althen. He will speak to the Vestige with a somber and humble tone, saying:\n\"So here we are. The moment of truth. I can now look upon the face of the one who will be my judge. I hope you understand that I am in no way trying to deny my past wrongdoings, nor would I argue that those acts should be forgiven.\"\nDo you really think you've made amends? \"\"I know that one can never truly wipe the past clean, and certainly not in my case, but I've done what I can. I've sent gold and gifts to the orphanage in &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and I've spent years years tracking down the ancient tomes of Orc history for their library.\"\nAfter exiting the barrows, the Vestige has two choices to choose from. One can either take Althen to the Ring of Daggers, or decide to let him go. There will be a corresponding marker for each choice. The location marker to take him to the Ring of Daggers will be located north-west, while the location marker to free Althen will be south-east.\nIf one decides to take him to the Ring of Daggers, the Vestige must travel to Hroarfrost Downs and speak to Marisette. She will appear to be very pleased, saying:\n\"You followed through? Excellent. I worried he'd convince you to set him free, then we'd have to track down both of you. That would have been unpleasant. Forget that, though. Can't tell you how glad I am to finally have this bastard in custody.\"\nShe will then give the Vestige the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Hammer\"&gt;Barrow Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; amount of , completing the quest. Marisette will show disdain towards Althen, sneering at his attempts to make amends. She will tell him that he deserves a slow an painful death; at this, he will then double over in pain. Annoyed, Marisette will kick him to get up, and they will both walk away.\nAlternatively, if he is taken to be freed, he will be very grateful, responding with:\n\"I don't see anyone from the Ring of Daggers. Does that mean...you've chosen to let me go free?\"\nHe will then reward the Vestige the Barrow Hammer and a leveled amount of , completing the quest. After this, a woman, named &lt;a href=\"Gabria\"&gt;Gabria&lt;/a&gt;, will materialize behind him. He will appear shocked, thanking her for coming and asking for her help. She will respond by saying that Turenn had already planned everything, having Althen to be disguised as a merchant in Orsinium.

The Nerevarine must deliver another potion to &lt;a href=\"Athelyn%20Malas\"&gt;Athelyn Malas&lt;/a&gt;, who is waiting outside the main entrance of the temple. After this, Nerile has discovered the origins of the plague, she sends the Nerevarine to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Sewers\"&gt;Temple Sewers&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinding the plague's origin.\nAs the Hero goes down to the temple's basement, &lt;a href=\"Shunari%20Eye-Fly\"&gt;Shunari Eye-Fly&lt;/a&gt; is found in panic, standing over an unconscious &lt;a href=\"High%20Ordinator\"&gt;High Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;, near the trapdoor that leads to the sewers. She explains how she followed the Nerevarine when they were breaking in the Gedna's tomb, hoping to find treasures, but she got sick. She tells the Hero she may be able to help more if they cure her, adding that Nerile knows about her and will provide what she requires. After healing Shunari with a &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt; of cure common disease, that Nerile gave them, Shunari will follow the Nerevarine into the sewers, inside , where she will reveal that, when she was inside &lt;a href=\"Gedna%20Relvel%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Gedna Relvel's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; told her, they were there to spread a deadly disease over Mournhold. She then indicates a secret entrance to the tomb. As Shunari said, further in, two blocks of walls can be found, behind which rats are heard scurrying, and in front of it, a dark stone is protruding from the ground. The Nerevarine may stand on the stone which will lower and open the two blocks. Inside the tomb, many infected rats and Gedna Revel, a very powerful &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, will be roaming.

It was created and led by &lt;a href=\"Greywyn%20Blenwyth\"&gt;Greywyn Blenwyth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful vampire assassin. The Scars originally split from the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and were founded in order to destroy and replace them as the foremost assassins guild in Tamriel. The Scars were ambushed by the Dark Brotherhood who had gotten word of the rebellion, and the Scars were dispersed. The remaining Scars fled with Greywyn and secluded themselves in &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; and the town of &lt;a href=\"Weye%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weye&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCreation and fall.\nSeveral years after contracting vampirism, Greywyn started to receive visions from &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. He thought these visions were Sithis telling him to claim the Dark Brotherhood for the vampires and the vampires alone. He secured the help of many of his kin, fellow vampires, and had them spread throughout the ranks of the Dark Brotherhood. Several months later, one of the members of the Crimson Scars, but loyal to the Dark Brotherhood, &lt;a href=\"Silarian\"&gt;Silarian&lt;/a&gt;, made known the members of the Crimson Scars and their plans, to the Black Hand. The Brotherhood struck as they slept, not even giving the Scars a chance to fight back. Using their silver weapons, the Brotherhood managed to pierce the hearts of many of Greywyn's kin. They screamed as they fell and turned into dust. Greywyn himself was able to kill two members of the Brotherhood before being forced to flee.\nGreywyn secretly retreated to &lt;a href=\"Deepscorn%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%20Location%29\"&gt;Deepscorn Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, his old retreat and home when he was younger. After nearly a month none of his kin had returned to the fold. Greywyn was also disturbed because since the fateful night of the ambush and the slaughter of his vampiric brethren, Sithis had not sent him any more visions. While waiting for more of his kin to arrive, he hunted and killed more members of the Brotherhood, spilling their blood on the Deepscorn Hollow Shrine's altar to Sithis.\nSeveral days later, Greywyn found &lt;a href=\"Rowley%20Eardwulf\"&gt;Rowley Eardwulf&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow member of the Crimson Scars, at the &lt;a href=\"Wawnet%20Inn\"&gt;Wawnet Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Deepscorn Hollow was by then fit to be the new base of the Crimson Scars. Rowley went about his dark work acquiring new furniture, resources, and contracts for the seemingly resurgent Scars. At this time Greywyn received a vision that disturbed him. It convinced him that Sithis did not want the Dark Brotherhood to be claimed by vampires. Seeing this, Greywyn found the &lt;a href=\"Purgeblood%20Salts\"&gt;Purgeblood Salts&lt;/a&gt;, and attempted to cleanse himself and the remaining members of the Scars of vampirism.\nBases.\nDeepscorn Hollow.\n&lt;a href=\"Deepscorn%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%20Location%29\"&gt;Deepscorn Hollow&lt;/a&gt; is the main base of the Crimson Scars, and is located in a cave. It has two entrances and consists of four sections.\nHollow.\nThe main entrance leads to the first section known as Deepscorn Hollow and is made up of three rooms. The middle room serves as a garden, which includes the deadly &lt;a href=\"chokeberry\"&gt;chokeberry&lt;/a&gt; vines of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The room to the east of the entrance contains the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Minion\"&gt;Dark Minion&lt;/a&gt;'s Victim Loot Chest. The room also houses the Dark Minion when he is not out fulfilling a contract. When he returns from his contract he will deposit the loot of the victims in the chest. The last room, to the west of the entrance, contains chests, crates, and barrels for storage. There is also a poison supply chest in the storage room. The chest contains a mix of both strong and weak poisons.\nCloister.\nThe second section of Deepscorn Hollow contains three rooms once again, as well as the secondary entrance to Deepscorn Hollow. The first room is less of a room and more of an antechamber but contains two shelves and two benches. The second room to the south is the &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Font of Renewal&lt;/a&gt;, containing an obelisk in the middle beset by water, and in the northeast corner of the room several veins of Purgeblood Salts. The last room, to the west, is a small cave structure that serves as the cattle cell.\u00a0\nBastion.\nThe Bastion consists of a library, bedroom, and dining room. The library houses over a dozen books, including three or four skill books. The bedroom contains a coffin, for sleeping in, a jewelry box, a desk, and a shelf. The desk has a respawning sprig of nirnroot. The Armorie is located in the bedroom as well.\nShrine.\nThe pinnacle of Deepscorn Hollow, the last section contains only the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. The shrine is activated by filling the basin at the base of the shrine with the &lt;a href=\"Ichor%20of%20Sithis\"&gt;Ichor of Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. Those whose nature is dark and infamous can pray at the shrine and be blessed by Sithis."}

Sara Benele is examining the object, which she calls the \"Mage's Staff.\" She believes the staff is unstable and needs my help to fix it. Sara needs the staff's magicka to power a spell to gain access to its core. We should gather three types of infusions from the staff shards scattered in the Spellscar.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Vestige will be approached by Sara immediately after discovering Spellscar, afterwhich she will explain to them that near her, there is a large staff sticking out of the ground that emits magical energy at unprecedented levels. If it isn't stopped, it will explode.\nShe will task the Vestige with recovering several forms of elemental infusions from spellshards, pieces that broke from the staff when it hit. In order to do this, they must use the focusing crystals Sara has provided them with. She will warn the Vestige about the presence of &lt;a href=\"spellfiend\"&gt;spellfiend&lt;/a&gt;s near the shards, as they are drawn to them.\nTo harvest the elemental infusions, the Vestige will have to clear the shards of spellfiends, who are often accompanied by either &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Storm Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frost Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;. From these elemental shards, they will have to harvest Storm, Fire and Frost infusions, and bring them to Sara. The shards are colored to represent the elemental fusion they hold. The shard containing the elemental infusions of Fire, for example, will be colored orange. The first of the three shards, Fire, is located in south of Spellscar. The Storm shard can be found southeast of Spellscar, and the Frost shard to the west. The Vestige will have to slay all the creatures here, active the spellshard in order to receive the elemental infusion, and return to Sara with all three of the infusions.\nAfter the Vestige has brought all three infusions to Sara, they will have to activate three focus crystals, one for each infusion. After all the focus crystals have been activated, Sara will cast a spell on the staff and open a portal to its core.\nAfter going through the portal, the Vestige will find themselves in a magical vortex populated by floating staff shards. Sara will explain to them that they must reach the core of the staff in order to stop it from overloading. The Vestige will have to fight their way through several groups of spellfiends, accompanied by Storm Atronachs and Frost Atronachs to reach the core of the staff. Once the Vestige has gotten close to the core, Sara will start the process of disabling it. The Vestige will have to protect her by fighting the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magdra%20Tigun\"&gt;Magdra Tigun&lt;/a&gt;, the Storm Atronach &lt;a href=\"Zymel%20Ozata\"&gt;Zymel Ozata&lt;/a&gt; and the Frost Atronach &lt;a href=\"Nomeg%20Nulu\"&gt;Nomeg Nulu&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to note that these three bossess will have to be defeated in one sequence. If the Vestige dies while fighting one of the two final bosses, they will have to start over from the first battle.\nAfter Sara has successfully disabled the core of the staff, the Vestige must take the portal created by Sara to return to Spellscar. The quest will be completed after the Vestige has spoken to Sara and received their reward."}

There are two exits from the first room. One is obvious, to the south-southwest, and is covered in spider webs (leading to the spider room). The other is on the opposite (north) side of the room and is activated by a brown button in a square frame near the fake rock door. Another one can be found on the other side. This door leads to the cottage room.\nJust behind the door is a floor tile fire &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;. The cottage room itself is a circular room with a cottage in the northwest part of the room on a ledge. There are three leveled &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; guarding the cottage. In the lower part of the room is the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by candles, and another corpse of a vampire.\nInside the cottage, several of the vampires may be sleeping. There is the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; on a table, an &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29%23Apothecary%27s%20Satchel\"&gt;apothecary's satchel&lt;/a&gt; on a barrel near the table, a chest next to one of the beds, and various poisons around the room. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Locked%20Room\"&gt;The Locked Room&lt;/a&gt;\" on another table.\nBehind (west of) the cottage there are an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, and an adept-locked chest.\nThe other exit from the first room leads to a room with eight spiders, and a long spiral plunge into the earth. Near the next hallway that leads east to Cronvangr Broodlair, there is a pool of water. A small chest is at the bottom on the southeastern side of the pool.\nSublocation.\nCronvangr Broodlair.\nThis lair is a sub-location for the cave. The path starts to the north, then turns right (east), where two spiders are patrolling the path. The path turns south, where a chest can be found behind a dense web. The path continues up to the west, then north, then west again, where it opens into a large room containing the spider nest. There is a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;giant frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt; guarding a chest in the nesting room, along with three normal spiders. On the left side of the chest is a &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;moonstone ore&lt;/a&gt; vein. Another exit from the room leads north, then turns west, and leads back to the cave (actually leads to a ledge above the first room of the cave)."}

All crossbows have 50% stagger chance, 75% if power shot is unlocked. Crossbows also make much more sound than bows when firing. For this reason, the crossbow is not suited to be used in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;. With Legendary improvements and the correct enchantments, &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; can be killed with a few shots.

If Durak is not conversed with, then at the end of the quest, Isran will reward the Dragonborn with a normal crossbow and 45 steel bolts. If both characters are conversed with, then two crossbows and 90 steel bolts can be acquired if the player removes the crossbow Durak gave them from their inventory before speaking to Isran. If the Dragonborn chooses the vampire pathway, a crossbow will be lootable from one of the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;.

Unfortunately, his rule involved him imposing strict curfews, unreasonably high taxes, and harsh punishments on the residents, and he would spend the tax money on construction of a wooden castle for himself. In addition, his rule led to the people suffering from disease and famine, and Riften sank into squalor. Finally, in 4E 129, the residents had enough, and rioted. Hosgunn's castle was set on fire, but it created a conflagration that quickly engulfed the entire city in flames. Although Hosgunn's rein had ended, several residents perished in the fire and Riften itself was left in ruins."}

Speak with him and he will tell you that the way through the chasm is blocked by focus crystals. The crystals are protected by hordes of dremora, so the army cannot handle it. Cadwell asks you to destroy these stones. \nHead through the gates and north into the chasm. After heading about halfway across the bridge, head back and speak with &lt;a href=\"Gathwen\"&gt;Gathwen&lt;/a&gt;, one of your scouts, for information about the chasm. She will tell you that destroying the focus crystals will allow the army to progress to the upper level of the chasm, which is protected by Molag Bal's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Grunda%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Grunda&lt;/a&gt;. Head out and destroy the crystals. The first one is immediately to your right after crossing the bridge, the second immediately to your left. From there, head west across the bridge to find the third crystal. Head south from there to find the fourth and last crystal. \nAfter you have destroyed the last crystal, a portal will open to the upper levels on the altar near you. Cadwell will be standing next to it; you should speak with him. He will warn you that Molag Grunda is supponing reinforcements faster than your armies can take them down, so your help is needed. \nHead through the portal to the next level. Your task here is to help close the portals through which the Daedra are getting their reinforcements. There are two of these portals, one is a little to the north of your current location, the other is along the road to the west. each portal will spawn multiple waves of Daedra before you can close it, so take care not to be overwhelmed. Also, make sure to collect the skyshard in the room with the western portal. After both the portals are closed, head to the gatehouse atop the stairs in the northern part of the area and speak with Cadwell there. He will tell you that Molag Grunda awaits in the gatehouse\nHead through the door and across the bridge. Cadwell will follow you and give some useful insights on how this place operates. He will tell you that you need to use two flywheels in each of the side antechambers to open the path to the gatehouse proper. The north antechamber will be guarded by a dremora named &lt;a href=\"Xxthauaa\"&gt;Xxthauaa&lt;/a&gt; and the southern one will be guarded by a dremora named &lt;a href=\"Xznotell\"&gt;Xznotell&lt;/a&gt;. When both are active, you can activate the mechanism to open the main door. Head through and confront Molag Grunda. She will first send the flesh atronach named &lt;a href=\"Tiny\"&gt;Tiny&lt;/a&gt; after you, then once it is dead she will come after you herself. She is a stronger version of the regular &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight\"&gt;Winged Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, so deal with her as you would deal with them. After she is dead, head up the stairs and out of the gatehouse and speak with &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; to finish the quest and start the next one, &lt;a href=\"The%20Citadel%20Must%20Fall\"&gt;The Citadel Must Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Grunda%27s%20Girdle\"&gt;Molag Grunda's Girdle&lt;/a&gt;"}

Crosswych is a trading town that makes money from passersby and the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore\"&gt;Iron Ore&lt;/a&gt; mined from the local mine.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nCrosswych, as mentioned before, is located on the edge of the two most populous region in High Rock. The town was built near a large &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore\"&gt;Iron Ore&lt;/a&gt; deposit located just north of town by a man known as &lt;a href=\"Pinifred%20Lode-Finger\"&gt;Pinifred Lode-Finger&lt;/a&gt;. Crosswych is built in a small valley with a small basin going through the town. The local manor is built on a hill overlooking Crosswych and the road leading to &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Village\"&gt;Koeglin Village&lt;/a&gt; and the Fiefdom of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;. The mine is equal in size to the town and was dug well deep into the ground. The closest settlement to Crosswych is Koeglin and the distant city of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town of Crosswych was founded in the 24th year of the First Era by a man named Pinifred Lode-Finger. The settlement itself was founded after the mine was making commercial success in &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt;. Many followed Lode-Finger in his pursuit to sell the large amounts of Iron Ore in the mountains.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of Glenumbra to destroy and corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to their bidding. The war had officially ended when the leader of the Cult, &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt; was killed deep within in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst the war, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rooks\"&gt;Red Rooks&lt;/a&gt; led attacks on several Glenumbran settlements such as a group of estates just south of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mines%20of%20Khuras\"&gt;Mines of Khuras&lt;/a&gt; nearby. One of these towns was Crosswych which was under the heavy control of the Red Rooks. The townsfolk of Crosswych organized a resistance against the Red Rooks. The ine was used as a prison by the Red Rooks to force the miners into slavery. The leader of the resistance was &lt;a href=\"Tamien%20Sellan\"&gt;Tamien Sellan&lt;/a&gt;, a Breton from &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Brook\"&gt;Eagle's Brook&lt;/a&gt;. Sellan and a mysterious traveler called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; defeated the leader of the Red Rooks, &lt;a href=\"Sternis%20Gelves\"&gt;Sternis Gelves&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Crosswych existed in the &lt;a href=\"Urvaius\"&gt;County of Urvaius&lt;/a&gt;, one of the southernmost regions located in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The regional deity worshiped in Urvaius was &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; and this is evident in the town of Crosswych had a temple dedicated to &lt;a href=\"the%20Divine\"&gt;the Divine&lt;/a&gt;."}

The town is mostly populated by miners.\nSometime in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, a rich iron vein was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Pinifred%20Lode-Finger\"&gt;Pinifred Lode-Finger&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby mountains and a mine was created. The town was founded for the miners.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the town was managed by a beloved mayor, &lt;a href=\"Heseph\"&gt;Heseph&lt;/a&gt;. However, a group of bandits by the name of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rooks\"&gt;Red Rooks&lt;/a&gt; used the chaos caused by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faolchu\"&gt;Faolchu&lt;/a&gt; to seize control of the isolated and unprotected Crosswych. The Red Rooks murdered the previous mayor and took over the mining operations, using the mine as a prison, and prisoners as slave labor. The Rooks' leader, &lt;a href=\"Sternis%20Gelves\"&gt;Sternis Gelves&lt;/a&gt;, had hoped to keep the town open to travelers in the hopes of more income and taxation.\nA local resistance organized by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tamien%20Sellan\"&gt;Tamien Sellan&lt;/a&gt; succeed in restoring order and chasing the Red Rooks out of the town. After the uprising, a previous councilor and a member of the resistance, &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Lia\"&gt;Lia&lt;/a&gt;, steps up and offers herself as a candidate for mayor. For the future security of the town, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; both establish a local presence.

It is also the largest building in the town. The inn is owned by the innkeeper, &lt;a href=\"Len%20Belland\"&gt;Len Belland&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife &lt;a href=\"Aleen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aleen&lt;/a&gt;. Chef &lt;a href=\"Smauk%20the%20Stewmaster\"&gt;Smauk the Stewmaster&lt;/a&gt; and brewer &lt;a href=\"Hisolda\"&gt;Hisolda&lt;/a&gt; offer their services here.\nCrosswych Inn was still open and maintained by Aleen during the Red Rook occupation and the imprisonment of Len Belland. It was used as a staging ground for the local resistance led by Tamien Sellan.\nAfter the villagers retake the town, Len opens up a store and &lt;a href=\"Barun%20the%20Bard\"&gt;Barun the Bard&lt;/a&gt; can be seen entertaining guests here. Some old acquaintances like &lt;a href=\"Alexia%20Dencent\"&gt;Alexia Dencent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alinon%20the%20Alchemist\"&gt;Alinon the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt; can be met and talked to in the inn.\n&lt;a href=\"Crosswych%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Red Rooks are chased out of the town, the Fighters Guild sets up a small camp and training grounds east of the Iron Mine Arms &amp; Armor. The local branch is lead by the hall steward &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Magarakh\"&gt;Sergeant Magarakh&lt;/a&gt;. Armsman &lt;a href=\"Kalad\"&gt;Kalad&lt;/a&gt; is offering his services here.\nAfter the occupation some of the villagers consider the presence of the Fighters Guild a guarantee for the future safety of Crosswych. Some have even taken up the idea of joining the faction themselves.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Mine%20Arms%20%26amp%3B%20Armor\"&gt;Iron Mine Arms &amp; Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIron Mine Arms &amp; Armor is a local forge situated just south of the Crosswych Mine. It was reopened to the public after the Red Rooks had been chased out of the town. &lt;a href=\"Suriel%20the%20Smith\"&gt;Suriel the Smith&lt;/a&gt; can be seen working the forge. Blacksmith &lt;a href=\"Celiane%20Laelippe\"&gt;Celiane Laelippe&lt;/a&gt;, clothier &lt;a href=\"Evinn%20Chrirnis\"&gt;Evinn Chrirnis&lt;/a&gt; and carpenter &lt;a href=\"Nilenir%20Tree-Killer\"&gt;Nilenir Tree-Killer&lt;/a&gt; offer their services here.\n&lt;a href=\"Gestor%27s%20Fine%20Goods\"&gt;Gestor's Fine Goods&lt;/a&gt;.\nGestor's Fine Goods is a general store run by the Gestor family - the merchants &lt;a href=\"Vincein%20Gestor\"&gt;Vincein Gestor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Emabeth%20Gestor\"&gt;Emabeth Gestor&lt;/a&gt;. The store kept its doors open despite the occupation of Red Rooks. &lt;a href=\"Idaron%20Virane\"&gt;Idaron Virane&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the cellar, hiding from the occupants of the town.\n&lt;a href=\"Menoit%27s%20Emporium\"&gt;Menoit's Emporium&lt;/a&gt;.\nMenoit's Emporium is a store run by the Menoit family - the enchanter &lt;a href=\"Fabrice%20Menoit\"&gt;Fabrice Menoit&lt;/a&gt; and alchemist &lt;a href=\"Petrille%20Menoit\"&gt;Petrille Menoit&lt;/a&gt;. A mystic, &lt;a href=\"Plays-With-Fire%20%28Glenumbra%29\"&gt;Plays-With-Fire&lt;/a&gt;, can also be seen offering his services here. Magister &lt;a href=\"Janona%20Alielle\"&gt;Janona Alielle&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; can be met just outside the store.\n&lt;a href=\"Saddle%20and%20Stirrup\"&gt;Saddle and Stirrup&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaddle and Stirrup is a stable run by the stablemaster &lt;a href=\"Leana%20Cantillon\"&gt;Leana Cantillon&lt;/a&gt;. She hid during the Red Rook occupation. A stable worker &lt;a href=\"Lahzga\"&gt;Lahzga&lt;/a&gt; used to help with maintaining the stable, but has changed her mind after chasing out the Red Rooks.\nUnmarked Locations.\nCrosswych Mine.\nCrosswych Mine is an iron mine situated in the north of the town of Crosswych. Miners working the mine founded the town around it, making the mine oldest structure here.\nBefore the Red Rook occupation, the mine was run by the &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Theodore\"&gt;Councilor Theodore&lt;/a&gt;. After the take-over, the Red Rooks used the mine as a prison, enslaving anyone who resisted their rule and making prisoners work themselves to death in the mines. The mining operation was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Blaise\"&gt;Foreman Blaise&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the order in Crosswych had been restored a couple of Red Rooks hid and remained in the mine.\nDonella's House.\nDonella's House is situated south of the &lt;a href=\"%23Menoit%27s%20Emporium\"&gt;Menoit's Emporium&lt;/a&gt;. It is the home of &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Donella\"&gt;Councilor Donella&lt;/a&gt;.\nMayor's House.\nThe Mayor's House is a large house in the north east separated from the rest of the town by a bridge. It was former home of the deceased mayor Heseph. During the Red Rook occupation, the house was taken over by &lt;a href=\"Sternis%20Gelves\"&gt;Sternis Gelves&lt;/a&gt; and his bodyguards.\nTheodore's House.\nTheodore's House is a house situated west of the &lt;a href=\"%23Crosswych%20Inn\"&gt;Crosswych Inn&lt;/a&gt;.

It is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Virgile\"&gt;Councilor Virgile&lt;/a&gt;.\nWatchtowers.\nThe town of Crosswych has two unlocked watchtowers. One is by the bridge to the &lt;a href=\"%23Mayor%27s%20House\"&gt;Mayor's House&lt;/a&gt; and another is located at the very south of the town. While nothing of note can be found in them, some of the citizens used these as a hideout during the Red Rook occupation."}
