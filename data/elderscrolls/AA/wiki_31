The sun was just peeking over the western mountains. They were nearing a glittering tower, fire flashing from every facet. The dragon veered to fly nearer and shot a long blast of flame. A light flashed several times from the tower's top as they dropped suddenly. Edward's stomach felt very peculiar. He sighed and stirred and felt &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; shift so that his right arm now held Edward. He stretched and yawned.\n\"Not much longer now. It's several days by horse from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; to Firsthold but I judge that &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; will have us there within the hour.\"\n\"We're not stopping at the Tower? I'ric...\"\n\"Do not use that name so lightly, not even to me. The &lt;a href=\"Archmagister\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt; will not return for days yet. &lt;a href=\"Unicorn\"&gt;Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;s are brothers to the wind and travel as fast, even burdened, but not as fast as dragons fly. You see the Elven homeland at dawn from the back of a dragon. Count yourself fortunate among men.\"\nEdward's gaze roamed the deep green woods and rugged hills. There was no sign of habitation. \"It's lovely,\" he said politely, \"but not so beautiful as &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;,\" he added out of loyalty and truth. \"Are there no towns or villages or farms?\"\n\"The Firstborn live nestled deep in the trees. And they do not tear up the earth and plant anew, but take gladly what &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt; offers, and make return. Ahhh, the green smell of growing things.\"\nIndeed, the air was as heady as the wine Edward used to sip from his father's cup, before... \"I'm hungry.\"\n\"I expect so.\" A bit of shifting and Moraelyn's left hand produced a small leaf-wrapped package. The dusky hand was large and strong and looked neither human nor animal. Edward stared at it with revulsion, then took the package gingerly so as not to touch the hand. He felt Moraelyn stiffen and the hand that held Edward relaxed its grasp a bit. Edward felt ashamed of his reaction. It was neither kind nor wise to give offense in the circumstances. Moraelyn could quite easily drop him overboard. \"I need to bathe, but so do you,\" he said stiffly. Moraelyn was deliberately misinterpreting the reaction, Edward knew. \"Yes, I'm very dirty,\" Edward bit into the cake which proved much better than it looked. \"My lady mother's used to seeing me like this, at least she used to be. But perhaps I should bathe first?\"\n\"I think you will not be offered that choice. Ah, at last!\" The dragon spread his wings, sent a huge gout of flame soaring skyward and dropped to earth in a large clearing. The landing was abrupt and jarring. Elves appeared quite suddenly and arms reached up to take him and Shag, who woke at last, ran frantically in circles, and then sat panting at Edward's feet.\nA tall elf with fiery hair like copper greeted them formally. \"Greetings, my lord King. Your lady wife awaits you. Prince Edward, I welcome you to the land of the Firstborn on behalf of all its people. May your stay here prove pleasant and productive.\"\nMoraelyn nodded deferentially. \"Thank you, my host. My Queen has waited long enough; we will go to her now.\" Moraelyn's hand on his shoulder steered Edward toward the largest tree he'd ever seen. The trunk was hollow; steps inside led up; openings gave out onto more steps and bridges along and among the mighty branches. They proceeded along these until they reached a large canopied platform, furnished with seats and chests as if it were a room. A golden skinned woman smiled at them and waved them in, then left. A tall slender, pale-skinned, dark-haired human woman paced toward them, her eyes on Edward. Only Edward.\n\"Why did you leave us!\" The cry came from deep inside, ringing through him. It stopped her several paces from him. Now her eyes lifted to Moraelyn, who said in a harsher tone than Edward had yet heard from him. \"Thou wilt address thy Mother with respect, cub!\" A glancing blow made his eyes water.\n&lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt; crossed quickly to Moraelyn and placed her hands on his chest. \"Greeting, my husband. All praise to Notorgo for bringing you and my son safely to me.\"\n\"Thank also the Lord of the Dragons and the Bandit, who could not have lifted the boy more neatly himself. The Archmagister had somewhat to do with it as well.\" Moraelyn's dusky hands came up to hold her bare arms lightly and tenderly. He laughed, looking relaxed and happy. But the hands against his chest formed a barrier as much as a caress.\n\"I am blessed indeed. But it has been long since my son and I have spoken. We may find words more easily if we seek them alone together.\"\nMoraelyn's smile vanished instantly. \"Are words then a thing which two can find more easily than three? Well. Perhaps. At times. Wife.\" He turned on his heel and left. The bridge swung and creaked, but his feet made no sound at all.\nAliera watched after him, but he did not look back. Edward felt again the curious mix of satisfaction and regret that came with giving pain to his enemy. \"Edward, my son, come and sit by me.\"\nEdward stood where he was, \"Madam mother, I have waited many years and travelled many leagues to have an answer. I will wait no longer, nor go one step further.\"\n\"What have you been told?\"\n\"That you were most treacherously kidnapped by night with the aid of magic, while my father slept, trusting in the honor of his guest.\"\n\"Your father told you that. And Moraelyn?\"\n\"Said that you came full willing. I would hear what you say.\"\n\"Would you hear why I left your father or why I did not take you with me, having chosen to go.\"\nEdward paused, thinking, \"Madam, I would hear the truth, therefore I must give the truth. I would hear why you left me behind. The other, I think I know, as much as I can or would know, unless you wish to tell me more or other.\"\n\"The truth? Truth is not a single thing existing apart from those who apprehend it. But I will tell you my truth and perhaps then you may arrive at your truth.\nAliera walked back to a softly pillowed chair and composed herself. Nearby a small ruby colored bird settled on a branch and trilled an accompaniment to her soft voice.\n\"My parents arranged my marriage as is the custom of our homeland. I did not love Corcyr, but in the beginning I respected him and tried to be a good wife. He did not care for me, nor did he take care. And so he lost my respect and I died a little each day, withering like an untended plant. I was happy only with you, but Corcyr thought I was making you too soft. \"Womanish,\" he said, and so, after your third birthday I was allowed to spend only an hour each day with you. I listened to your cries and sat weeping, without heart for anything. Finally, you ceased crying and asking for me, and my heart was left empty. I formed the habit of walking and riding much of the time, alone save for a guard or two. Then Moraelyn came. He wanted to mine for ebony in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The land he wanted to use was part of my dowry. He was willing to train our people in the arts of its use and even to give them weapons of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; making. In return our people were to aid him in keeping the goblins away, and allow him to form a colony of his people in High Rock. Corcyr had no use for the land and he wanted the weapons very much indeed -- there are none better -- so he favored the proposal. There were many details to be discussed and arranged and it fell to me to conduct these negotiations. Corcyr despises Dark Elves and he was jealous of Moraelyn, who was already famed as the finest fighter in all &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"But Moraelyn is more than a skilled fighter; he's well-read and interested in everything under the sun. He sang and played as if taught by Jeh Free and Jhim Sei both. He was a companion such as I'd only dreamed of...that and no more, I swear. We both love to be outside, so our discussions took place while riding and walking, but always accompanied by his men and Corcyr's. When all was arranged, Corcyr gave a great feast to celebrate the treaty. All of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; nobility came and many from other provinces. At the end Corcyr was deep in his cups and let fall an insult that could only be washed out in blood. I had long since retired with the other ladies so I know not what it was, but I'd heard enough in private to know that Corcyr had a store of such to choose from. Moraelyn gave the challenge and gave Corcyr until noon, that he might recover such wits as he had.\n\"Then Moraelyn came to me, alone in my chamber, and told me what had befallen. 'Milady, I think he will choose your brother as his champion; in any case there will be a river of blood between us that may not be crossed in this life or any other. I can live without your love, but I would not have your enmity. Come with me now, as wife or honored guest, as you choose. And you shall serve as blood price in stead of your kith or kin.'\n\"And there, in the moonlight, in my terror, with my ladies sleeping about me, I knew I loved him. Doubted that I could live without him. And yet, I loved you more! 'My son,' I whispered. 'I can't'. 'Milady, you must choose. I am sorry.' You see, don't you, Edward? If I stayed, it meant my brother's death his innocent young blood. Or your father's! Or possibly that of the man I loved, though I counted that most unlikely. Moraelyn's fighting skills alone were supreme, and in an affair of this sort he would be entitled to call on magic aid as well. 'We could take him with us.' But Moraelyn shook his head sadly, 'That I will not do. It would go against my honor to part father and son.'\"\n\"Leaving love alone, I am trained to duty\", Aliera said proudly. \"Should I have robbed you of your father or your loving uncle? And I thought it likely that Corcyr, should he survive, would somehow blame me for the affair and use it as an excuse to put me away. I thought that Corcyr would be pleased to have me gone. I knew he wanted the weapons very much. I could trade them for time with you, I thought.\" All this passed through my mind while Moraelyn stood waiting, not looking at me.\n\"Lady &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, help me to choose wisely, I prayed. 'You truly want me as wife? I could bring you nothing but trouble.'\"\n\"'Aliera, I would have you to wife. And I want nothing but yourself.' He shed his cloak and wrapped it round my body, pulling the bedclothes away.\"\n\"'Moraelyn, wait, is this right, what I do?'\"\n\"'Milady, if I thought this wrong, I should not be standing here! Of the choices you are given, this one seems to me most right.' He swung me up in his arms and carried me to his horse. And so I left your father's house, clad only in his cloak and riding before him. And wild joy mixed with my sorrow, so that I scarce knew how I felt. That is my truth.\"\nEdward said quietly, \"But he has parted my father and me in the end.\"\n\"With great reluctance. And only because the dragon says that you and your father were in truth already parted in heart. It is only a matter of more leagues. Which provide a measure of safety for you. Moraelyn insisted that you should freely consent to come. You are as free to return any time you wish.\"\n\"Moraelyn would have just taken me! It was I'r...I mean, the Archmagister, who insisted that I must consent.\"\n\"He's not a patient man by nature. And he is anxious to do Corcyr no harm. Doubtless he felt the discussion could be carried on as well elsewhere.\"\n\"He called him King of the Small Cock. And laughed. Why? Are Daggerfall cockerels smaller than Ebonheart birds? And what does it matter, anyway? My father was very angry; I think he would have liked to fight. But it's true he hates me. I knew that, but I didn't want to know, so I pretended not to. I don't suppose Moraelyn would do that.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"He'd lie, though. He thought about telling me he was my father. I could see it.\"\nAliera threw back her head and laughed her pretty rippling laugh; he remembered it from long ago, and it sent shivers down his back. \"He must have wanted to claim it very badly indeed if he let you see it; he's usually quicker than that. And he does not lie under oath, or to hurt those he loves.\"\n\"He doesn't love me; he doesn't even like me.\"\n\"But I do, my dear son. You...\" Edward thought she was going to say he'd grown; adults always remarked on his growth, even if he'd just seen them a week ago. Very strange, since he was small for his age. Instead she said, \"You're just as I thought you'd be,\" with deep maternal satisfaction.\n\"And he loves you. But he said he was no one's errand boy. Yet you dismissed him as if he were.\"\nAliera's face and neck burned a deep crimson.\n\"Nay, though I am reduced to serving man, it seems.\" Moraelyn had entered silently, bearing a huge tray piled high with food. \"Get me a stool, boy, you can play page if I can play server. You must be famished and I thought I'd best return before my wife gets round to the rest of my faults. Could take her most of the day listing them.\" He'd shed the mail and bathed and dressed in fresh black jerkin and hose with a silvery sash tied round his narrow waist. But the black sword still swung by his side.\n\"Mara help us, you've enough food for a small army. And I've broken my fast.\" Aliera's small hand reached for the elf's arm, slid down it caressingly, then clasped his hand and squeezed it, lifting it to her still hot cheek, brushing it with her lips. Edward looked away quickly, discomforted by the sight of his dusky skin against her fairness.\n\"This's for me, and a bit for the boy. But pray join us, my dear. You've grown thin. Pining for me, no doubt.\" He wrapped a lock of her dark curly hair around a finger and tugged at it, grinning, then fell on the food like a starving wolf, attacking it with small silvery weapons instead of eating with his fingers as humans did. The food was wonderful. Edward ate until he could eat no more.\n\"Eavesdropping,\" he murmured thoughtfully. He'd been mulling over a list of Moraelyn's faults while he ate, and realized too late that he'd spoken aloud.\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, boy, if you humans will shout your privy conversation all over the tree, d'ye expect me to shut my ears with wool?\" He tapped one of his large pointed ears. Edward hurriedly tried to remember what they'd said. What he'd said. Lying. Oh dear. Maybe he hadn't heard.\n\"So I'm a liar, am I, boy?\" Vir Gil help him, Edward felt he was drowning. Could the Elf read minds? He hoped that wasn't the insult his father had used! \"I...I meant I thought that you were thinking about it. You did hesitate,\" Edward gulped. He was making matters worse.\n\"Possibly, I was trying to remember.\" the sardonic tone was back.\n\"You don't even like me!\" Edward burst out.\n\"That doesn't seem to have stopped your true father from claiming you.\"\n\"Moraelyn! Don't!\" Aliera interrupted, but the Elf held up his hand to quiet her.\n\"I'm not so sure.\" Edward flashed.\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\"I don't know...Roane says...things...and I'm not at all like him. Everyone remarks on it. And then stops talking.\"\n\"What things? Speak, boy!\"\n\"About how fond Mother was of her brother when they were young. How sad and angry he was when she was carried off. More like a lover, she said, than a brother. She says it very sweetly, but like she means something by it. Something too dirty to say. Other times she talks about how elfin I look. And how quickly after marriage I came. Not as quickly as her first son, though.\"\nMoraelyn leaped up. \"By the Avenger, I will go back and wring the vixen's neck! The human\", he bit off the insult, but his red eyes flamed rage; his muscles swelled and his hair stood on end. \"You do not look half-elven. I never met your mother until four years after your conception. Roane, it seems, cannot decide which lie she wishes to use. But incest! May Kel strike her down if I may not.\" The tall elf paced furiously about the room, lithe as a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, hand fondling his sword hilt. The platform swayed and dipped.\n\"She's ambitious for her sons, at Edward's expense. The question is, how many will believe her. Not enough if she was planning to have him killed instead.\" Aliera's smooth brow wrinkled a bit.\n\"I never disliked her, you know. Nor she me. She wanted my place and I was glad enough to let her have it save for Edward.\"\n\"You want me to be king so I'll let you have the ebon mines.\" Edward had just worked out the puzzle.\n\"Oh, devil take the ebon, which he probably will. I've a better chance of getting co-operation from Roane's boys once your father's dead. They'd have reason for gratitude and the bargain's a good one. Although the chances they could keep a civil tongue long enough to sign a contract seem poor, given their parentage.\"\n\"Then why? You don't even like me.\"\n\"Mara, help me! 'Liking' a person is a human concept. One day they like you, the next day they don't. On Tirdas they're back to liking you again. My own wife does this to me, but claims to love me even when she doesn't like me. Except of course on the days when she doesn't do either, and talks about joining the Order of Riana. Fortunately that only happens once a year or so. I go hunting until she comes to her senses.\"\n\"You exaggerate; that only happened once, and well you know it.\"\n\"I remember enjoying the recovery period. Maybe it should happen more often.\" They grinned at each other.\n\"But why do you want me to be King?\" Edward persisted.\n\"I told you; it's Akatosh's notion. And the Archmagister's. I just came along for the ride. Ask them.\"\n\"I shall ask the Archmagister when I see him.\"\n\"An excellent plan. You'll spend a few weeks at the Tower before heading north with us.\"\n\"Only that?\"\n\"Does the prospect of spending the winter with your mother and me displease you so much?\"\n\"No...no, sir. But I agreed to go with I'ric.\" Not you. The words hung unsaid between them.\n\"You will, in time. A few weeks there now will fit you to begin your training in magic; I can teach you spells. But you need hardening; your body must catch up to your mind. It is the Archmagister's will.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Fighting magic&lt;/a&gt;? I want to learn other things. How to &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;call beasts&lt;/a&gt;. How to &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;heal&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;float&lt;/a&gt;...\"\n\"You'll learn that, I doubt not. And d'ye think a fighter can't Heal? It's the first spell you'll learn. But a King must know how to fight.\"\n\"I'm not good at it.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt; Teeth, boy! Exactly why you must learn!\"\n\"If I cannot?\"\n\"You've courage and a clear head and the potential to learn magic; that's more than most people ever have. I can teach you the rest.\"\nEdward's head whirled with the unaccustomed praise. \"I do? I have? You can?\"\n\"D'ye think any of your father's fool court would stand naked before a dragon, a unicorn, the Archmagister, and the Champion of Tamriel and demand justice of them? Justice! Faced with such, they might have managed to beg for mercy, if they could speak at all, which is doubtful.\"\n\"I did that? I did, didn't I?\" Edward was astonished; he wanted to add that he hadn't known, hadn't thought about it.\n\"Aye, you did. And it's a deed that shall be sung from here to Morrowind; I'll compose the ballad myself--as soon as I have a nap. I don't sleep as sound as some on dragon's backs.\"\n\"You enchanted me and Shag asleep!\"\n\"And the rest of the castle, with the help of my friends.\"\n\"Ooooohhhh. Can you &lt;a href=\"levitate\"&gt;levitate&lt;/a&gt;? Will you show me?\"\n\"Not so fast. I kept a holding spell on us all night to keep us on the dragon's back. Until I'm rested I couldn't light a candle with the aid of a match.\"\n\"Oh. Well, I'd still rather be like the Archmagister than be a fighter.\"\n\"Hah! It'll be news to the Archmagister that he cannot fight! I hope he'll find time to show you how to wield a &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;. No better weapon for early training. And no better trainer. Now, of the four you saw before you, which would you say could best the others?\"\nEdward thought carefully for several minutes. \"Sir, my judgement is poor indeed, but if you would still have my answer, it would seem that the one who claims the title &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; must be the best. Yet must not the Archmagister be your master in magic? And trained to arms as well, it seems. So which should prevail? Could any mortal stand against the dragon's fire and claws and teeth? And I know naught of the unicorn, save that it is fleet and has a very sharp horn, and hooves as well. So I will guess the unicorn; it had the mildest manner. And since you asked the question it seems the unlikely answer may be correct.\"\n\"Well answered, youngling! The &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; would win easily in any single close combat. No mortal or even dragon can move quickly enough to land a blow and it cannot be burned or touched by any magic or elemental power. It's hooves are deadly and a single touch of its horn will kill any enemy, although the horn itself will burn away. The most powerful can regenerate it within moments, however.\"\n\"And of the four the Champion of Tamriel would probably be the loser against any of the others, although the title is no idle boast!\" Moraelyn is not accustomed to being so outclassed. \"My manners may have suffered in consequence.\"\n\"Milord King, I am most deeply in your debt. You have done me great honor and service. If ever I can repay you, I will. Forgive my brash words and ill manners. I have dwelt among the rude and boorish. And it seems I have no father, unless I may call you so?\" The elf held his hands out to the boy, who placed his own in them. Edward's feeling of distaste was quite gone as if by magic the thought drifted through his mind and then he released his hands and clasped Moraelyn about his waist. The elf's hands stroked the dark hair and clasped the thin shoulders.\n\"I thank you, my wife. After only five years of marriage, you have presented me with a fine son, nine years of age. Remarkable. In fact...magical.\""}

Edward spent most of his time in the company of his parents. He saw few other children. None at all lived in 'their' tree, only their wood elf host and Moraelyn's six Companions, an oddly assorted, cheerful lot. Disrespectful, Edward thought. None of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; court or servants would dared have addressed his father as these did &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt; with their constant raillery. But these weren't servants or courtiers. Just Companions. Only one was a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt;. There were a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; woman, two &lt;a href=\"wood%20elves\"&gt;wood elves&lt;/a&gt;, brother and sister, a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic man, even bigger than Moraelyn and a strange looking lizardlike man, who spoke with such a hissing accent that Edward couldn't understand him at all. The Nord man was called \"Slave of Moraelyn\" or just \"Slave\" for short, although Moraelyn usually called him \"&lt;a href=\"Mats\"&gt;Mats&lt;/a&gt;\" of \"My-slave.\" Mats tended the group's weapons and gathered wood for the evening fires. But it wasn't unusual for the others to bring wood; Moraelyn himself often borrowed Mats' axe and fetched and split wood if there was need, or if he just felt like it.\nThey spent much of their time roaming the woods and fields, hunting and gathering produce, in twos and threes. Usually Moraelyn, Aliera and Edward and &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt; went off together. They carried bows for hunting. When Edward asked Moraelyn to teach him to shoot better, he was told to ask his mother, as she was the better shot. And it was Aliera's arrow that brought down a handsome buck, although both arrows had struck, and they quarrelled over who's arrow had killed as they ran toward the buck.\n\"Bah!\" Moraelyn exclaimed as he pulled his &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Arrow%2C%20Book%20I\"&gt;black fletched arrow&lt;/a&gt; from the hindquarters. \"I don't know how I managed to feed myself before I married you.\"\n\"You had the Companions.\"\n\"Aye. Mats, &lt;a href=\"Mith\"&gt;Mith&lt;/a&gt; and I starved together, before we met &lt;a href=\"Beech%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Beech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willow\"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt;.\" Moraelyn pulled out his black dagger, Tooth, and began to skin the animal's body, calling Edward to come and watch. \"You want to learn about animals, don't you?\"\n\"Live ones.\" Edward said with distaste. His dainty mother was ripping the skin away with enthusiasm.\n\"Such make tough eating,\" the dark elf said. \"Give me your cloak; I'll make a package for you to carry.\"\n\"I am a Prince, not a pack horse!\"\n\"You'll carry your share or you'll be a hungry prince this night.\" The elf had lost his good humor.\n\"I won't. I don't want any. You can't make me.\"\nMoraelyn stood erect and appeared to think this over. \"Can't I?\" he taunted.\n\"Edward, please...\" Aliera appealed to him.\n\"Tell me, Lord Prince, how then does one get the meat to one's table if one may not carry it. If Princes may not carry meat then certainly Kings and Queens may not, or do Princes grow out of the incapacity when they become Kings?\"\n\"They have servants!\"\n\"Serve ants? What a clever idea. Only a human could think of that! Ants are excellent at carrying, I have noted, although I have not the trick of commanding them. Perhaps you can teach me.\"\n\"Servants! Like Mats here,\" Edward shouted. He hated being teased. Mats and the other companions had come up, having heard their shouts over the kill.\n\"Mats? You think I cannot make you carry deer meat, yet I could command Mats to do so?\" Moraelyn stared up at the blond giant. \"Well, one never knows until one tries. Mats, carry the deer.\"\nThe blond scratched his head and jaw thoughtfully. \"Highness, nothing would please me more but it is a large deer and my old wound is troubling my back, perhaps if you kill a smaller one.\"\n\"Well, Prince, what now?\"\n\"You beat him.\"\n\"At what? I can outrun him. Mats, if I reach that oak first, will you carry the deer.\" Mats shook his head slowly.\n\"You beat him with a stick!\" Edward yelled.\n\"What promise you show as a &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;, my Prince. You will forgive me if I refrain from consulting you until you have further training. It is my judgement that beating with a stick will not improve Mats' back. Of course, I may be in error.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Silk\"&gt;Silk&lt;/a&gt;, you carry the deer.\"\n\"Me, milord? I am sorry, but I have just remembered that I am fourth cousin to the fifth house of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, Queen of Heaven. My dignity forbids that I carry anything at all.\"\nWillow and Beech claimed that a mage had forbidden either of them from carrying any part of an animal while the moon &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; was risen.\n\"Prince, are you truly certain about this rule? It seems to make life most inconvenient. We could bring the wood to the deer, which will take many hours and leave us benighted here. We could consume the meat raw on the spot, but I own my belly is not yet empty enough to make that option attractive. Aliera, can you help us? How do the High Rock folk get meat to table?\"\n\"Milord, when I lived there it was my firm belief that it appeared by magic. There were servants, but they were an irritating, lazy lot, more trouble than they were worth. Edward, my son, is it possible that this rule applies only in High Rock?\"\n\"I suppose so...\"\nEdward carried a share of meat that bent his back, but he did not complain. And so it was settled, and the meal that night was a merry one. But for several days after, if the Companions caught him carrying anything at all they would inquire anxiously as to whether a High Rock Prince might do so.\n\"If Mats is not a servant, then why do they call him 'Moraelyn's Slave'?\" Edward asked one drowsy afternoon.\n\"Well, he is my slave. I paid gold for him, all that Mith and I had. We came on a man beating him near &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Parkeep\"&gt;Reich Parthkeep&lt;/a&gt;. He looked near death; when Mith and I tried to stop the beating, the man said Mats was a runaway slave, and he'd do as he liked with him. So I threw down the gold and told him he could take it and leave, else I would kill him out of hand. He chose the latter, so I told Mats to take the gold as his master's heir and go where he would. He chose to come with us, so we buried the gold with his master and Mats has been with us since.\"\n\"Could he leave if he wanted to?\"\n\"Of course.\"\n\"May I go pick some of those berries over there?\" Edward asked, and Moraelyn nodded.\nAliera was sleeping curled on her side. Moraelyn sat next to her, leaning back against a tree, his hand playing with her long dark curls. His eyes and skin were sensitive to the bright sun. Shade slept stretched in the sun nearby, his dark fur glinting with silver in the light. Edward wandered over to the bushes and picked the bright glowberries, so called because they glowed at night, although right now they were a rather dull gray. But they tasted very good. If he ate enough, would he glow at night, he wondered. Or if he smashed them and collected the juice, the bushes caught at him, then he found a sort of tunnel through them and trotted along it, wondering where it led.\nIt ended in a small clearing before a pile of rocks. There was a hole and something in it. Edward stepped back, making a small noise in his throat. The something heaved and presented a tusky snarling face and hooves that pawed at the earth.\nThe boy backed away slowly. The beast's head went down, the shoulders heaved and the immense bulk lumbered into a charge. Edward tried to throw himself into the bushes - there was no room - and then, incredibly, Moraelyn was in front of him, between him and the beast. There was a flash and a crash, and the elf seemed to leap backwards for several feet, landing crouched just in front of Edward's face. The air whistled as his blade seemed to jump out of the sheath of its own accord. There was a sparkle in the air around him, and a burnt smell. Silence.\n\"Get out of here, boy! Now!\"\nEdward fled, yelling for his mother, who was running toward the bushes and calling him. She clasped him to her, and began shouting for Moraelyn instead. There was no answer, then, somehow the elf was there, unharmed, his blade sheathed again. But he was breathing hard.\n\"Did you kill it? Are you hurt?\"\n\"No and no. I was shielded. Barely. You disturbed a sow in her den with her litter. Fortunately, she thought she'd had enough after the first impact. I daresay she's unaccustomed to finding her enemies still standing afterwards.\"\n\"Why didn't you kill her?\" Edward demanded, feeling bloodthirsty after his fright.\n\"A &lt;a href=\"katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt;, even the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;, is not the weapon I'd choose against a mother sow. A spear, maybe. The longer the better. Besides, if we leave her be, there'll be six pigs here next year, with luck.\"\n\"You made a magic shield,\" Edward said, wide-eyed.\n\"Aye, barring the shield, she'd have left a few marks even on a tough old dark elf.\"\n\"Edward, it would be gracious to thank your rescuer.\" His mother prompted.\n\"Thank you,\" Edward said automatically, his mind busy with more questions. How had the elf known of his danger? How did he get there so quickly?\n\"There is scarcely need to thank me for saving my son's life. Thank Shade,\" Moraelyn said. \"The cat told me there was trouble.\"\nEdward knelt and hugged the smug purring cat. \"Good old Shade. I can always count on him.\"\n\"My son\". \"Our son\". The words rang proudly out at the least excuse. Edward puzzled over this for awhile; it wanted an explanation. The one he favored was that Moraelyn simply didn't know him very well yet, and was prone to give the benefit of the doubt to strangers. Eventually, but in the meantime he might as well enjoy it. It was nice. Having a father that was proud of you, that liked being with you, took you places, talked to you, listened to you. And most remarkably of all, let you alone when you needed to be. Moraelyn only really liked being alone when he was composing a ballad.\nEdward told Beech and Willow about the mother pig. \"I ran when he told me to. Would you? Because he said to. I couldn't think of any way to help, but...\" Willow and Beech listened carefully, exchanged glances, and said they'd think about the problem.\nAfter supper around the evening fire, Willow took up her small harp and began to sing about the joys of an autumn afternoon and berries...except that Moraelyn sent the boy off to pick berries. They'd got that part wrong. Moraelyn sat up sharply and looked around, but the others had slipped away into the darkness and Willow wasn't looking at him.\nMith strolled into the firelight, taking mincing steps, picking pantomime berries and eating them noisily. Moraelyn put his head down and groaned. Mith pantomimed finding something then skipped along in delight. Mats' head and shoulders lurched into the firelight. Mith reached a hand to pat him, then leapt back with a squeal as Mats tried to rip him with a tusk. Huge tusks and a pig nose adorned his face. Mith crouched, hands to his face in exaggerated horror. And Silk, clad in black, leaped between Mith and Mats with a shower of sparks, jerkin backwards, hose about its knees, shoeless. It reached for its sword, but Mats charged and knocked it flying; it spun out of sight. Mats, scrambling on all fours, missed Mith, but tore his hose. Mith scampered around the fire with Mats after him. Silk, sword in one hand, the other tugging at the hose chased after Mats, beating him with the sword.\nAnother figure appeared, clad in Aliera's blue gown with Beech's head sticking out above wearing a long dark wig. Mith cowered behind her skirts. She glared at Mats and he froze. Silk tripped and sprawled behind him. Beech tossed his hair back, patted Mith reassuringly on the head, wet one finger and smoothed an eyebrow, then leisurely picked up his bow, aimed and twanged.\nMats leaped backwards, collapsing on top of Silk with a very realistic death rattle. Beech and Mith embraced, ignoring Silk, still flat beneath Mats.\nMoraelyn had begun laughing when Silk first leaped out. Aliera had waited for Beech's appearance. Now tears were running down her cheeks. Moraelyn was doubled over, pounding his fist against a tree. Ripples and giggles of silvery laughter sounded all around and showers of gold coins fell into the circle. The Companions gathered themselves together and bowed, as humans did.\n\"Again, do it again!\"\n\"Nooooo!\" Moraelyn gasped, still laughing. \"Ah, you came nearer killing me than the sow did! I beg mercy!\"\n\"Another night, gentle persons...our king has had a very long day. We thank you all.\"\n\"Gods, had the entire town seen?\" Edward stared behind him, but they were all melting away into the dark. \"That's not what happened.\" he yelled. \"You were a hero. They made fun of you.\"\n\"Yes, yes and yes. Especially the last. By &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt; himself, that was funny!\"\n\"They all saw that! And you're going to let them do it again?\" Edward was scandalized. They had all looked ridiculous.\n\"Let them? It'll be done all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; for centuries to come, I doubt not. But never again so well.\"\n\"But it didn't happen like that at all.\"\n\"It would have if Mats...I mean the sow had charged again. Ariana's bow would have been far more effective than my poor blade. And she'd have seen Moraelyn leap like a khajiit!\" His finger smoothed an eyebrow in a gesture typical of Aliera and he went off again into a long laugh. \"Aye, she'd have slain the beast with a look, if she couldn't find an arrow. Mats, you were more like the sow than she like herself. Bigger, too, I swear! Mith, you old rogue, only you could look so innocent.\"\n\"Buuut, it's not true!\" Edward protested.\n\"Boy, you think there's only one truth? Was what you saw today truth? Did you see all the truth? Even of what did happen? What you saw here tonight will light up truths unseen, if you allow it, you could spend a lifetime reflecting on it and yet not see it whole, for it goes ever further and deeper, spreading like ripples in a pool, beyond us all and out into the deep stillness of forever. What happens is only a tiny part of truth...maybe the least part. And what you see is smaller yet.\"\nEdward still thought that a king really ought to have more dignity. But he didn't say so."}

I can stay here by myself. I don't need Mith.\" There was a dangerous glint in &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes. &lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt;'s lips thinned. \"You will mind him, Edward.\"\n\"Yes, madam,\" Edward said sulkily.\n\"Come on, wife. &lt;a href=\"Mith\"&gt;Mith&lt;/a&gt; knows how to deal with princes who don't want his company.\" The three adults laughed a bit in their irritating way at a joke he didn't understand.\nThe weather was drizzly and Edward had the sniffles. His mother had decided that he shouldn't go out, even though they were only going visiting. Moraelyn had taken his side, but threw out his hands and raised his brows at Edward in a helpless gesture when Aliera insisted that he stay behind. Mith, whom Edward liked the least of the Companions, had volunteered to stay with him. Even &lt;a href=\"Ssa%27ass\"&gt;Ssa'ass&lt;/a&gt; would have been better. Mith was scruffy looking. Like a stableboy. And cheeky, even for a Companion. Edward sulked silently for awhile longer. Mith had fetched a broom and was sweeping the house out, brushing dirt from the room above into the room Edward was in. What on earth was the use of staying in when there wasn't really any 'in' to stay in? Edward got tired of sulking, fetched a broom and went up to help sweep.\n\"Mith\", Edward said. \"have you ever been to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"I have. It's an unchancy place at first, but you'll grow used to it.\" Mith was applying his broom with energy and whistling. \"Sweeping was kind of fun there. There weren't any sides to the platforms so all you had to do was brush the dirt and leaves over the side. You started at the top and worked your way down.\"\n\"You're quick with the broom, Mith. I haven't half finished my side yet. Will there be others there like me?\"\n\"Oh, some children, I'd think. Most'll be somewhat older. I should be quick with a broom. My father had me sweeping out the king's stables when I was your age. I used to dream and talk too much like you; he beat me for it. So I learned to be quick.\"\nEdward swept faster, stirring up dust. \"Not like that, boy. Watch me. Anyway, there's no hurry; it's just habit with me. Moraelyn'd serve me my head on a platter if I touched you. My father, heh, he was always...well, he was a hard man to please. He was a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Your father?\" Edward stared at Mith, but Mith looked much like the other Dark Elves he'd seen. Not many. Dark elves didn't come to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;; Gerald had banned them. But he'd seen some on his rare trips to other courts. And there were some in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; besides Moraelyn and Mith. \"Did he have red hair?\" Mith's hair was a dark red. Gerald had red hair. \"He tended the stables for Moraelyn?\" No wonder Mith looked like a stableboy. But Edward kept his tone polite. Mith had a sharp tongue...and Edward knew that neither of his parents would be sympathetic if he complained that Mith had been impertinent.\n\"He did have red hair. Maybe I got mine from him...but mostly mixed elf and human children come out dark elf. No, Moraelyn wasn't a king then or expecting to be...'sides this was in &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, where I was born. Moraelyn's brother was king in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; in those days. He came up to visit our King and brought Moraelyn along. To keep him out of trouble, he said.\" Mith grinned. \"I grinned when I heard him say that, and I saw the boy looking at me out of the tail of his eye, but he wouldn't take notice. Like I was the dirt or something worse. His brother tossed him a pouch and told him to go into town and get his knife mended. Jerked his thumb at me and told me to show him the way.\"\n\"Moraelyn said he didn't need an escort to find a store and stalked off like princes do.\" Mith grinned knowingly at Edward. But the grin wasn't unfriendly. Edward smiled back a bit, and Mith went on. \"Our king eyeballed me, so I took off after him. Moraelyn didn't spare me so much as a glance. Went four blocks out of his way, down by the wharfs, and when I tried to tell him where the store was he shoved me right off the pier. I could &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but he caught me by surprise and I went in with a big splash, and everyone laughing like jackasses. I got myself out and went straight to the store and waited for him - but not so he could see me - and when he finally showed up, I lifted the pouch right off him. He didn't even know it was gone. So in he goes and tosses the knife on the counter and tells the smith to fix it right off. Which he does. Only then Moraelyn can't pay him, tells the smith he's the King of Ebonheart's brother, the smith just laughs and says, 'And I'm the Archmagister.' Then the smith calls the guard and three of them show up. Well, Moraelyn wasn't what he is now - three guards wouldn't even warm him up nowadays - but he was even faster then. He was out of there so fast he nearly knocked me over at the door. He lost the guards pretty quick; all that armor slows 'em down. I found him crouching in one of those hedge mazes in the park. He was doubled over out of breath but still I stood a good ways off while I asked him real nasty if he needed an escort back to the Palace. Not that I was planning to go back! I was gonna take the money and run and never look back, I tell you! But I had to have the last word. I wasn't born high but I was born proud.\"\n\"He glared at me for a minute or so, catching his breath, then he just rolled over and started to laugh that laugh of his. Prince or no, I started to like him then. When we'd finished laughing, more or less, we started talking. I told him I didn't want to go back. Nor dared to. 'Princes don't get blamed, Prince,' I said, 'Stableboys do.' He said that wasn't entirely the case, but he saw my point. Then he said that as I was his escort then he must obey his brother and come with me. And that his name was Moraelyn, not Prince. We've been together ever since...more or less.\"\nEdward smiled politely. He could see why Mith had run away, but not why Moraelyn had gone with him. Unless he was afraid to face his brother about the stolen money. Edward tried to imagine Moraelyn being afraid to face anyone and failed. \"I wish I was brave. Like you and Moraelyn.\"\n\"Why, you are brave. And your courage will grow with the rest of you.\"\n\"Are there only High Elf boys at the Tower?\"\n\"There'll be other sorts, too, most likely. A few Dark Elves, for sure. D'ye miss your own kind?\"\nEdward shook his head. \"Human boys don't like me much anyway. Nor &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; boys...\" His eyes filled suddenly and he turned his head away. But Mith's voice was unexpectedly gentle. \"I thought you wanted to go to the Tower.\"\n\"I do. But...\"\n\"You'll be lonely.\"\nEdward nodded.\n\"That's a hard thing to face.\"\n\"Did you go there alone, Mith?\"\n\"No. Moraelyn did, but he was older than you, by a good bit. A grown man, in fact. They didn't take any but High Elf students in those days, you know. But Moraelyn heard of them and said he wanted to go there. We were together already, the seven of us, save for Aliera, and a handy bunch in a fight. Moraelyn had already gotten that Dragon's Blade he wears, and the Dragon's Tooth to go with it - remind me to tell you about that sometime - and he was a famous fighter already. And the rest of us aren't slackers. But he thought we could be better at the spellcasting and the Tower was the place to learn that. Well, no one goes near the Tower without an invitation. No one! No one would even tell you where it was. But they'd tell you where NOT to go. So he went there. Alone. One morning he was gone and there a note saying for us to wait for him. So we did, here in &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. He was gone two weeks, then he came back one night, rowing across with the tide. He just said they'd accepted him, but he couldn't say anything more about it. But he asked me to come back with him.\"\n\"'They want me?' 'Well, they've accepted one Dark Elf,' he said. 'One more shouldn't bother them too much.' So we go there, and bless me if the Archmagister himself didn't meet us at the door and demand to know the meaning of this. I wanted to turn myself into a rock! I was wishing hard that I was stable dung! And figured I was like to get my wish soon. But Moraelyn speaks up real polite that this is the friend he'd mentioned and the Archmagister had expressed an interest in his abilities, and naturally he'd want to see for himself.\"\n\"But the Archmagister was real interested. See, they don't wear armor or carry anything but a staff and a dagger. They think it interferes with their spellcasting, all that metal. But Moraelyn could cast pretty well even with chain and with any one-hand weapon at all. And I could cast wearing &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; and as much as a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;saber&lt;/a&gt;, though it's an unwieldy weapon; I like my &lt;a href=\"Weapons\"&gt;short sword&lt;/a&gt; better. Truth, they didn't think that much of me, but Moraelyn...he'd camped outside their door. And when they tried to move him he just sat there! They threw all the spells they had at him, the troll guards, everything. Nothing. He laid the &lt;a href=\"trolls\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; out flat and left 'em to regenerate. If they tried to beat him with their staffs he'd ward them off with his blade and the spells didn't turn him a hair.\"\nEdward's mouth gaped open. \"How'd he do that!?!\" He said.\n\"Well, it was a trick, in a way. He'd picked up something that came natural to Willow. See, Willow is different.\"\n\"I didn't know Willow could cast!\"\n\"Well, she doesn't have any mana, ordinarily...but she can &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt; it if you cast a spell at her, see. O'course it wasn't much use to her, since she'd never been able to learn what t'do with it once she got it. Couldn't get it back once it was gone, so she couldn't practice. Until Morelyn got hold of her and trained her. Well, Moraelyn had figured out pretty much how Willow did what she did...though it cost Moraelyn mana to do what came natural to Willow. So Moraelyn sat there absorbing everything they threw at him and burning it off into a big shield. Drove 'em wild.\"\n\"He said the Archmagister could best him, though.\" Edward suspected that Mith was making up the whole story.\n\"Well, so he did, when he finally came. But all the rest of 'em together couldn't do it. And all Moraelyn wanted was to study with them. We were a sight, the two of us dark elves in our battle gear among all that white and gold. I felt like a fish out of water, but Moraelyn was interested in what they had to say...and you can bet they hung on every word he said. Not too many words at first. After a fortnight or so, he told me one night to tell the Archmagister that he'd be back in a couple of days. And he shows up with Silk! 'Course he'd been telling 'em about the Khajiits...and they'd been asking questions.\"\n\"The Archmagister's no fool. He just stared at Silk, and she purred real loud and rubbed up against him and asked 'How ya doin', Archmagister, baby?' The Archmagister kinda pushes Silk away and says in a whisper, 'How many more?'\"\n\"'Just two, sir.'\"\n\"'What are they?'\"\n\"'Wood elves, sir.'\"\n\"'Just wood elves. Plain ordinary wood elves. No horns, hooves or tails.'\"\n\"'Yes sir. Ah, one of them has an extraordinary &lt;a href=\"Absorb\"&gt;Absorb ability&lt;/a&gt; with some very unusual features. The other's just a &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;.'\"\n\"'Very well. You may bring the one with the Absorb. We don't want a Bard! They are not true mages.'\"\n\"'Well, that's most generous of you, sir, but the Bard's her brother, sir and I swore to their parents that I wouldn't separate them. So it'll just be the three of us.'\"\n\"'Her brother.'\"\n\"'Aye, a pair of twins.'\"\n\"'You may bring them both.'\"\n\"So three days later he's back with the twins AND Ssa'ass AND Slave. The Archmagister looks at them and sort of bobs up and down, but he speaks real quiet. 'Dark Elf, by pair of twins, did you mean TWO SETS of twins? Are you going to tell me that these...these are twins???' Well, I could see that Moraelyn was kinda sorry he hadn't thought of trying that, but he said, 'No sir, the twins are Beech and Willow. The Argonian and the Nord are not prospective initiates. They are specimens. For your collection. You don't have any like them so I thought...'\"\n\"'You thought. I do not have a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; either! Are you going to think to bring me that next?'\"\n\"'Oh, aye, I could. Would you like one?'\"\n\"'Tell me you are not serious.'\"\n\"'Well, I couldn't promise. And it would take quite a long time, a year maybe, but...'\"\n\"The Archmagister's eyes rolled up toward heaven. 'Thank you, All-Mother, I have at least a year to prepare.' he whispered.\"\n\"I don't think Mats and Ssa'ass should have been made specimens. They're people. Even if they aren't elves.\"\n\"Oh, they made Ssa'ass an initiate when they found out that he had some interesting &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; spells.\"\n\"But Mats?\"\n\"Mats never minds anything. He hasn't a bit of magic; he couldn't be an initiate. Anyway he'd have hated it. He spent his time gaming with the guards. When he wasn't being studied. Seems he has some interesting magic resistances. Anyway, since then, the initiates aren't just High Elves. And they don't all follow the Mage way.\"\n\"I shall. I shall be just like the Archmagister.\"\n\"Oh, aye, exactly,\" Moraelyn's voice sounded lightly behind him. \"I'll cut the ears off a donkey for thee and dye thy skin with saffron. Bleach thy hair white and stretch thee a foot\" Moraelyn swung him high. \"Art well, son? I told thee so, Aliera. He's not ill at all. Good, because the Archmagister's returned. We go to the Tower tomorrow.\"\n'We' was just Moraelyn and Edward. Aliera had caught Edward's cold and they took some pleasure in insisting she remain in bed. Moraelyn rowed them across the river in a small boat and they walked for most of the day, resting a little at midday. It was evening when they reached the tower and the setting sun was glinting off it. Even the sea far below looked red. There was a hush over the countryside.\n\"It's tall, isn't it?\" Edward paused to look.\n\"Towers generally are.\"\n\"Did you really...\" Edward broke off. Questions starting in that fashion did not draw satisfactory answers from the elf.\n\"Has Mith been telling thee tales? He's had ten years to polish that one. I doubt not it glistens like the Tower.\"\n\"He told me how you met, too.\"\n\"I thought he would.\"\n\"I didn't understand why you went off with him? He was a thief and a stableboy and you were a prince.\"\n\"You have just named three excellent reasons, Prince.\"\n\"You never give me serious answers.\"\n\"A serious charge. Very well, then. I saw myself through Mith's eyes and misliked what I saw: a callous bully and a coward, fit to be neither boy nor man nor prince. Why did you run off, Prince?\"\nEdward hung his head mutely. \"Nay, I do not require answers. Come, it grows late.\" Moraelyn reached his hand for Edward's, but Edward shook him off. If Moraelyn was a coward what did that make Edward? He looked at the Tower door where Moraelyn had demanded and won entrance, though all would shut him out. Edward could never do anything like that, but at least he could walk in on his own as an invited guest."}

He was sitting away from the fire, so it was dark for human eyes, but Moraelyn was the only one of the group who would allow Edward to see his hand. The other players, &lt;a href=\"Beech%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Beech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mith\"&gt;Mith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mats\"&gt;Mats&lt;/a&gt; said Edward brought them bad luck. Moraelyn said that it was not really a question of &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;luck&lt;/a&gt;, but that their hands were reflected in Edward's face for those that had the eyes to see such images. It was too dark for Beech and Mats to see Edward now, and Moraelyn blocked him from Mith's view. And yet, the pile of coins in front of Moraelyn had grown smaller since Edward had taken a place behind him. But this time he had been dealt a good hand. Edward could see that. It was Mats' turn. He was cogitating.\n\"You're shivering, son,\" Moraelyn said, \"Have you no warmer clothing? We must find something for you. Here, come share my cloak, then. You can hold the cards if you like.\" The wind was chill; there was a bite to it now that they were farther north and the year had grown older. Edward accepted the shelter of Moraelyn's arm and warm fur cloak and sat close against his side.\n\"I think I'll just play the cards I hold,\" Mats said at last, and pushed a pile of coins into the pot, then with sudden resolve, added a few more. \"There.\"\n\"Throw the hand down, Edward, we're through.\"\n\"But there aren't many better hands than what we've got!\" Edward protested.\n\"Edward!\" Moraelyn growled.\n\"Well, how'm I s'posed to learn?\" Mats didn't have to show his cards unless they matched his bet.\n\"By watching. Silently. Oh, very well. No one ever told me that fatherhood came cheaply.\" He shoved most of his coins into the pot to match Mats' bet and Edward laid the hand down.\n\"Ah,\" Mats said, \"you needn't do that, my friend. I'll show the boy my cards for free.\"\n\"You filthy &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;,\" Moraelyn said in disgust, \"put down your cards and take my gold, if you can beat my hand. Let's see if I'm the one who needs educating on how to play this game.\"\n\"You don't,\" Mats grinned. \"Except that you could have accepted my generous offer instead of throwing an insult at me.\" Mats laid down the perfect hand called The Ladies.\n\"A taunt like that rates an insult. Mats, that hand is almost worth the viewing price. Five beautiful Ladies! You don't see them together every day; they're not that fond of one another's company.\"\n\"How'd you know?\" Edward demanded.\n\"Ah, that'd be telling,\" Moraelyn grinned. \"Some things you're supposed to learn for yourself. That's part of the game. But remember that a good hand's worthless if someone else holds a better.\"\n\"I'm sorry.\" Edward looked ruefully at the few remaining coins.\n\"No matter. It's foolish to play with Mats on those nights when the God of Luck himself stands at his shoulder and all I have at mine is a runaway &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; prince who should be in his bed. He'd have had that money off me i' the end. This way we'll get a bit of sleep.\"\n\"Spoilsport,\" Mats grumped. \"It's not every night Sai visits me and I do enjoy his presence.\"\n\"He can leave as quickly as he comes. Sai's not someone you want to get overfond of, Mats.\"\n\"Who should know that better than I? Nay, do not apologize. I appreciate your concern for me, my friend. It's not altogether unwarranted, but I am mindful of the temptation. I know how undependable Sai's favor is, and how capricious. I play only among my friends, whom I do trust.\"\n\"Goodnight, then.\" Moraelyn and Mith went off to join those who were already asleep, leaving Mats and Beech and Edward by the fire. The dark elves' natural sleep pattern was a period of five or six hours during the day, and a short nap of two or three hours after midnight. Now that they were travelling, they were sleeping only at night, which was a difficult adjustment for Mith and Moraelyn, who had to use spells to cope with it. Edward had slept a bit as soon as they had stopped for the night, while the others prepared supper. In consequence he was now wide awake. Beech was yawning. Mats seemed to require less sleep than the rest.\n\"Tell me about Sai, Mats. I've never heard of him before. I didn't know there was a god of luck. I thought luck just happened.\"\n\"Being as you're Breton, I can understand that. Bretons like things explained, clear and reasonable, in sequence, so one thing follows from another, and you know where you are. Most gods are like that. They lay down rules and if you obey them and pay homage to the god, why then he or she grants you favor. And the better you keep the rules and the more you worship the god, the higher you rise in his favor. Those rules aren't always easy to keep, and one god's rules may require you to violate another's but you know where you are. Well, Sai's not like that. He's not a daedra, but he's got a daedric side to him, for sure. One thing, if you worship him too much, he'll abandon you altogether. They call it '&lt;a href=\"Sai%27s%20Affliction\"&gt;Sai's Affliction&lt;/a&gt;'. It's an overwhelming desire for the god's constant presence. My father suffered from it, poor man. The disease is more than just a desire for the god's presence. The sufferers require continual proof of the god's favor. So they gamble incessantly. Not to win, for all they do with winnings is keep on gambling until they lose. Then they do what they must to raise a stake so they can gamble again.\n\"Oh, it's a terrible thing. Terrible. My father sold me as a slave because of it. Later he sold my oldest sister. Then, when he was in debt yet again, he killed himself in one of his rare lucid moments when he could see what was happening to him. What he was doing to his family, himself. 'Course I was just a kid when I was sold. I didn't understand. I thought it was because of some fault of mine that I'd been sent away, laziness or stupidity or disobedience, and that if I'd only been a better son it wouldn't a happened. That's &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;'s way. It's intended that children should respect their parents and learn from them, but some parents aren't deserving of respect. Well, it was a sickness in him, so my mother says. I don't know that he should be blamed for it, any more than if he had red plague or leprosy. I believe her, yet sometimes I still feel it was my fault. Well, that was bad luck you might say. But Sai sent me Moraelyn and that was a lucky day indeed.\n\"What other god would put it into his head to stop one human from beating on another? Any other elf in Tamriel would have turned away in disgust or stopped to watch and laugh at the stupid humans. Two dark elf kids against four grown Nords, and for all they knew I deserved what I was getting. I could have been a thief or murderer. I suppose I was a thief. I'd stolen myself, so to speak.\"\n\"Moraelyn can't say himself why he did it. He says he was spoiling for a fight that day and seeing slavecatchers on &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; soil did nothing to ease his temper. That's why I say: it was Sai. But it was Moraelyn that listened to the god.\n\"There's no doubt it's a grand thing to feel Sai's hand on your shoulder. It's like riding the finest horse, like love itself. You're one with the world, and everything goes your way, everything's on your side, instead of being the constant struggle that life really is. You don't have to be smart or handsome or kind or witty. Things just go your way. If you do something dumb it doesn't matter. It'll turn out to be the right thing to have done. Lucky. Some folks do seem to be born lucky, others unlucky. I don't know why. Most everyone feels Sai's presence sometimes, I guess. You have, haven't you?\"\nEdward shook his head. He'd no idea what Mats was talking about.\n\"Well, it's a kind of greed, I guess, this Sai's Affliction. You see, there's only so much luck to spread around, and if a few folks got it all, there'd be none left for the rest. Like tonight, I won that last pot, but the others had to lose it. Everyone can't win with Sai. That's not true with other gods, not necessarily. You still don't understand, do you? Would you like to hear a story about Sai?\"\nEdward nodded. Mats was a good-natured fellow, but usually quite silent. Edward had thought him rather stupid. Mats' luck at cards seemed to have loosened his tongue, and now Edward saw that he thought a lot more than he talked.\nLong, long ago, when people were fewer and wolves more numerous than now a young widow named Josea lived smack in the middle of what is now the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. She was an ordinary sort of woman, neither plain nor pretty. She had smooth brown hair, warm brown eyes, a short nose, a full round face, and body to match. She'd been born the only child of peasant farmers. Her parents had been carried off by typhoid when she was seventeen. Shortly afterwards she had married Tom, a strong young woodcutter with a cheerful disposition and a roving eye. He'd gotten her pregnant quickly, then turned his attentions elsewhere. Shortly before the babe was due he'd been killed by the local goldsmith who'd come home unexpectedly, found the handsome woodcutter in bed with his wife, and stuck a knife in his back.\nTom's death had occurred on &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Day\"&gt;Heart's Day&lt;/a&gt;. The babe, a boy, was born four months later during &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;. Two neighbor women came to help her birth him and one stayed a few days. After that she was left to cope with caring for child and smallholding as best she could.\nOne evening in the next &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star\"&gt;Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;, Josea went out to the small barn to do the evening chores, leaving the babe asleep in his crib. The wind was howling. She had to clutch her cloak tightly around her. She milked and fed the cow, fed the pigs and chickens. When she left the barn she walked out into a fierce blizzard. The wind had risen so that the barn door was wrenched from her hand and slammed back against the side of the barn. She couldn't even see the house, which was near the road, and some little distance from the barn, but she set off toward it with confidence.\nShe'd lived here all her life and knew every inch of ground, although she'd never seen a storm quite this fierce and sudden. Already there were two inches of snow beneath her feet. She struggled against the wind for some time, until at last she realized that she must somehow have gone past the house. She turned back and tried to follow her own footprints, reasoning that at least she'd warm herself in the barn before setting out again. But the snow was falling so thickly that her footprints vanished before her eyes, and she was quite lost, and cold.\nJosea struggled on, hoping to come across something recognizable, a boulder or a tree or the road if not house or barn. Her hands and feet were wet and numb. She hadn't dressed heavily and was now chilled to the bone, with ice forming on her eyebrows and lashes.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Timmy\"&gt;Timmy&lt;/a&gt;! Tiimmmeee!\" She cried her child's name, hoping against hope that the babe would wake and cry and that she might follow the sound to him. She stood and listened, gasping the cold air into her lungs, but there was only the howling of the wind. The wind, or something more? A grey shape took form in front of her, staring at her with slitted yellow eyes. A great grey wolf.\nHer heart seemed to stop. Her eyes filled with tears as she thought of her child lying helpless in the house alone, and his mother dead outside. How unlucky, to die so close to shelter! Unlucky. But she had always been unlucky, the unluckiest woman she knew. It might be days before any thought to visit her. She sank down to her knees, exhausted. The &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; sat before her, threw back its head and voiced its dreadful howl.\nHer frozen hands scrabbled in the snow, looking for stone or stick, anything with which to defend herself against the pack. Another dark shadow appeared from the whirling white snow. She scrambled backwards in a panic. This one was also gray, but tall and two-legged, gray cloaked and hooded. Its gloved hand reached for the wolf's head and patted it. Her scream died in her throat.\n\"No need to fear, lass. We'll not bring you harm, nay quite otherwise. Be you the mother of yon child?\"\nShe nodded dumbly. His voice was deep and kind, clear in the high whistling of the wind,\nbut her eyes went to his dread companion.\n\"No need to fear,\" he repeated. \"My friend Grellan here will lead us back to safety. Unless you indeed do wish to spend the night here.\" His hands reached for hers and pulled her up, and she leaned on his arm and hobbled alongside him.\nWhen at last they reached her door, he said, \"I stopped here hoping for shelter from the storm. I hope you don't mind?\"\nHow could she refuse? Men too could be wolves, but if he were it wasn't likely he'd take no for an answer anyway. \"P-p-please come in. I l-left the k-kettle on the boil but I expect it's empty by now,\" she said inanely.\n\"I did go in, when there was no response to my knock, and found the babe asleep and alone, and the kettle boiling away. I took the kettle from the fire, but left the babe be. I knew his mother would not be far, and sent Grellan to find you. Lucky for you, but then I have always brought luck to those around me.\"\nHe threw back his hood and she saw that he was tall and pale, with silver hair and eyes, but a young face. His countenance was grim, but the silver eyes were kind and his mouth gentle. \"My horse too will want shelter on this night. Have you a shed to offer him?\"\nWhile he stabled his horse she changed out of her wet clothing and fixed a bit of supper for them: soup and bread and cheese, and elmroot tea. As she dished it up she apologized meekly for the meager fare.\n\"Why, 'tis a feast compared to my efforts!\" He smiled, and fell to, hungrily. Grellan lay by the fire, his eyes fixed on his master, who occasionally flung him a morsel. \"He ate well yesterday, luckily for your chickens, else I'd have to buy one from you.\"\n\"Nay, nay,\" she protested. \"I'm deep in your debt and glad to share anything I have with you.\" The babe stirred and cried then, and she picked him up, changed his wet diaper, and put him to her breast.\n\"Where's your husband, lady?\"\nShe hesitated a moment - the thought flashed that she should not tell this stranger how alone and unprotected she was - then told him the truth.\n\"A sad tale, truly,\" he said, \"but he's left you a handsome child, and you seem quite comfortable here.\" His eyes went round the humble one room cottage, crib and feather bed at one end, covered with a quilt of her mother's making, and stone hearth at the other, table and chairs made by her father in the middle. A ladder led to the loft where she'd slept as a child. Suddenly the simple room seemed a palace to her. They were warm and dry and well fed, and indeed what could be better?\n\"Why, you're right, stranger. I am lucky after all. Now, will you tell me something of yourself?\"\n\"I am less fortunate than you in some ways. I am a wanderer, and born to wanderers, a tinker by trade, though I can turn my hand to most things. I have never been married and have no children, nor have I ever had a home other than the wagon my horse pulls. I've never stayed long in one place. My parents named me Sai, but most folks call me Lucky.\"\n\"Lucky is what I will call you then, for you have indeed been lucky for me.\"\nHe stood and stretched, and began clearing the remnants of their meal from the table. He poured water from the copper kettle into the basin and washed and dried the dishes, something she had never seen a man do before. After the babe was fed they played with him on the hearthrug while he told her of some of the odd and wonderful places and peoples he had met with on his journeys, and once again her life seemed very narrow and dull. After an hour or two the babe grew tired and cranky, and she took him on her lap and sang to him until he fell asleep. She laid him in his crib and wrapped him warmly in a rabbit fur bunting.\nWhen she went back to the fire, Lucky reached for her hand and held it for a moment, without a word, then they were in one another's arms and kissing hungrily. They shed their clothing and lay together shamelessly, enjoying each bodies in the flickering rosy firelight. He loved the roundness of her breasts and thighs, belly and buttocks, and said she was as juicy as an apple. His bleached lean muscular body and silken hair fascinated her as much. She had loved Tom and known pleasant moments with him, but nothing like she felt with this stranger.\nShe woke in bed in the morning, to the baby's crying as usual. Lucky wasn't there and she thought he must have been a vivid dream. Then the door opened and shut, and he was striding toward her, fully dressed, and motioning her to stay where she was. He kissed her lips, then brought the babe to her and stood watching as he suckled. \"What a pity that we remember not the pleasure we once knew.\"\n\"Yet we have pleasures still that we will remember,\" she said, and felt her cheeks redden at her boldness. What a wanton he must think her!\n\"Indeed,\" he said, and laid his cold hand against her hot cheek.\nThe storm had stopped during the night, but the snow was deep on the road, and it was clear that it would be days before the horse could pull Lucky's small wagon along the road. That wagon was brightly painted with leaves and vines and flowers in red and blue and green and yellow. The wheels were red with yellow spokes. It had a canvas top, also painted, blue with white fleecy clouds. Josea loved the wagon but it sorted oddly with Lucky's quiet greyness.\nLucky did small jobs for her, mending tools, hinges, and utensils. He cut more wood for her, saying that if she did not need it this year, there would be another. He stayed a week and a thaw came and then a freeze, and the road was rutted but fit for travel. They looked at one another in the morning light, and he said that it couldn't hurt to stay another day, or maybe two, if she was not yet tired of him. She wasn't.\nAfter another week, Lucky asked her if she would come with him. Her heart leaped at the question, but she looked around the little house where she'd spent all her life, thought of her land and village and her babe, and said, \"I can't go. I've no desire to travel, and I don't want to bring my babe up as a homeless waif.\"\nPain flashed across Lucky's pale face, but he only nodded, harnessed up his horse, and kissed her goodbye. Tears clouded her eyes and blurred the gay wagon colors.\n&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt; passed very slowly, with rain and sleet and snow, but nothing like the storm that had brought Lucky to her. Occasionally there was a knock at her door, which started her heart pounding, but always it was just a villager, come to buy the dried herbs she sold. Then, on the first night of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;, she heard the creak of a wagon and knew. She flew to the door, her face alight and flung herself into his arms.\n\"I can't stay,\" he said. \"I'm just passing through...\" and that was all the talking they did for quite awhile.\nSpring came and crocuses poked their noses up through the snow. Lucky spaded up her garden. Curious neighbors came to call, but found out no more about him than she knew. She sold them eggs - her chickens were laying very well - and dried herbs and an elixir she made from her grandmother's recipe, which was sovereign for headache and rheumatism. They hired Lucky for odd jobs, despite their suspicion of him.\nLucky continued to come and go, never saying where or when he'd be back, but he seldom stayed away more than a few days. He spoke no words of love, but loved her fiercely all the same. Josea's round belly grew rounder, and she weaned Timmy to cow's milk. Lucky's trips became shorter and less frequent. All around the land prospered. Even the oldest could not recall a better harvest. In &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Hearthfire&lt;/a&gt; Josea birthed a beautiful baby girl with silver hair, but eyes of cornflower blue. Lucky held his child and joy radiated from him, so that he seemed to burn with a white fire."}

Floors, walls, ceiling, all were white and radiated light. Their footsteps made soft crunching noises on the rough floor surface. Except for that, it was very still, with occasional soft, unrecognizable far-off sounds. Moraelyn moved confidently through winding halls and long rooms. He seemed very black in all that white. They passed long pools of water with fountains that sparkled in the light.\n\"Where is everyone?\" &lt;a href=\"Edward\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt; whispered.\n\"At table, I hope. I'm hungry. Aren't you?\"\n\"No.\" Abruptly a big, broad ugly shape appeared in front of them and roared a challenge. Edward grabbed for &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;'s arm with both hands. Moraelyn shook him off irritably. \"Gods, boy, don't grab my sword arm if ever you do spot a monster. Stay clear!\" But Moraelyn didn't reach for his blade. He stood still while the monster wrapped its long arms around him and pounded on his back, still roaring. Moraelyn roared back and pounded on the monster's chest. Then he introduced Edward to the Captain of the Archmagister's guard.\n\"Don't hug him,\" Moraelyn warned the &lt;a href=\"Trolls\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, who grinned at Edward showing pointy teeth. \"He'll break.\"\n\"I thought trolls were dangerous!\" Edward gasped as they ascended a long winding stairway.\n\"They are. I'll have bruises for a fortnight. I'd have shielded, but I didn't like to hurt his feelings.\"\n\"He likes you?!\"\n\"Oh, aye, it can be done, you see.\"\n\"Why does the Archmagister keep troll guards?\"\n\"They keep the &lt;a href=\"rat\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;s down.\"\nMore trolls, but these paid them little heed. Another long stairway. More corridors. A sort of guardroom where three trolls appeared to be gaming with bones. One of them shambled to his feet and led them down a shadowy passage. A row of cages with huge rats, then some with small odd creatures that looked rather like elves seen in a badly distorted mirror (though Edward kept this observation to himself). They gobbled and squeaked as the elf and boy paced quickly by.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s,\" Moraelyn said with distaste. They turned a corner and went past two cages that held only large stone statues. There seemed to be more cages off down other hallways. The troll unlocked a huge black metal door. It clanged shut behind them. A very large green and yellow hooved creature sat man-like in one corner. Its unwinking eyes didn't flicker as they passed quickly and climbed still another stair. More white halls. These were patrolled by huge black dogs that sniffed at them as they passed. Edward stretched a hand to pet one, but it snarled at him.\n\"I wouldn't.\" Moraelyn said.\n\"Yes Sir.\"\nThey came to another massive black metal door. A voice sounded. \"What is black and white, has one body, two heads, four arms, four legs, two red eyes and two brown?\"\n\"That's disgusting!\" Moraelyn yelled at the door, hands on hips.\n\"You are correct, mortal. You may pass.\" The door swung slowly open, creaking. There was no one behind it, just a narrow stairway that wound sharply. It seemed dark above. Moraelyn raced up the stairs, leaving Edward clinging to the bottom rail, shaking. There was not a thing to do but follow.\n\"Welcome, Edward.\" The Archmagister stood white and gold in the center of a large dim room. Huge windows looked out on the purple twilit sea below. \"Come here, child. Give me your hands.\"\nEdward put his hands in the Archmagister's who smiled down at him. Edward's fatigue and fear vanished instantly. He smiled back at the Archmagister, who said softly. \"It is well. You may go,\" to the furious dark elf who stood glowering to one side. Edward was barely aware of him, his whole attention occupied by the Archmagister.\n\"Goodbye, Edward.\"\n\"Bye.\" Edward didn't take his eyes off the Archmagister. From far away he heard the dark elf go down the stairs.\n\"He calls you son,\" the Archmagister said.\n\"Yes sir. I asked him if I might call him father.\"\n\"But you are not entirely comfortable about it.\"\nEdward sighed. \"No sir.\"\n\"That may be as well. You will return to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; one day. And then you must be &lt;a href=\"Corcyr\"&gt;Corcyr&lt;/a&gt;'s son. So let the claim be on Moraelyn's side.\" The &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt; moved companionably to the windows with him. The dusk was fast gathering as Edward stared out over the hill through which they'd journeyed. A dark figure appeared below and strode swiftly off into the night.\n\"That's Moraelyn! I thought he was going to stay the night. It's dangerous out there alone in the dark. There are evil things out there. Can't you...\"\n\"Dangerous for any evil that meets Moraelyn in his present mood. He will go safely, I promise you.\"\n\"Oh. But I haven't thanked him. He's been very kind, really. Why was he so angry about the door? It was just a silly question. The answer was him and my mother, when they're asleep and I'm not there. How do you make a door talk? Is it an illusion?\"\n\"That's three questions. Which of them do you want answered? Aren't you hungry? Would you like a bowl of stew?\"\n\"Yes, please. I'd like to hear about the door, please.\"\n\"Ah. You think the talking door may prove more comprehensible than a surly dark elf? More interesting? Or safer?\" The Archmagister's large golden eyes regarded the boy thoughtfully.\n\"I don't know if I, uh, like him. Sometimes I think I...and then other times I...do you understand about liking? He said he didn't.\"\n\"You would be more comfortable if you felt the same way about him at all times, yet you do not.\"\n\"Yes, that's it, exactly. You do understand.\"\n\"Moraelyn is not a comfortable man.\"\n\"Well, I don't mean that exactly. Sometimes he is. Like when we rode the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe Archmagister laughed aloud. His laughter reminded Edward of chimes. \"Yes, yes. I find comfort myself in having Moraelyn near at hand when dragons are about.\"\nA young &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; brought in a bowl of stew and set it down on the table. Edward felt a bit disappointed that the stew had come in such an ordinary way. Until he remembered that the Archmagister hadn't sent for the stew.\n\"The priest at home in Daggerfall said it was a mark of evil things, that they cannot bear the light,\" Edward said between mouthfuls. \"Moraelyn doesn't like sunlight. And he's black.\"\n\"I see. Do you know what evil is?\"\n\"Um, well, if you do bad things, then you're evil?\"\n\"I see. If the cook had burnt the stew, would he then be evil?\"\nEdward grinned. \"No, just a bad cook. But if he did it on purpose, then I guess he'd have done an evil thing...but maybe he wouldn't be altogether evil. Maybe he was just angry about something.\"\n\"Or perhaps the sort of person who is pleased by spoiling others' pleasure?\"\n\"I guess that'd make my little brothers evil. They sure like to spoil my fun.\"\n\"And you?\"\nEdward felt his face redden. \"I don't take any notice of them,\" he said quickly. The Archmagister's large golden eyes regarded him steadily. To his own dismay, Edward began to cry. He bawled like a baby. \"I don't know what's wrong with me,\" he gasped. \"I never cry, really, I don't...hardly ever...\"\n\"Why ever not?\" Edward looked up. His tears had blurred his sight, but there seemed to be tears on the Archmagister's face. His hand reached up to feel the wetness. \"You have been very alone, have you not?\" the Archmagister said.\n\"Yes. Until you brought the &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; for me, I was all alone. They endure no evil,\" Edward sighed with satisfaction, feeling relaxed and comfortable. The Archmagister was wonderful.\n\"We summoned the unicorn, Moraelyn and the dragon and I and others. It's a great magic and one no single man or woman may command. But don't trouble yourself overmuch with judging good and evil. That's a human notion. Life is complex; I know of nothing that is wholly good or wholly evil. Not even the unicorn.\"\nEdward's time in the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; passed quickly. There were few other novices and the youngest of these was several years older than Edward. The boy spent several hours each day with the Archmagister. He learned to cast a few spells and to open his mind so that he could &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20Regen\"&gt;renew his magicka&lt;/a&gt; quickly while he slept. But often they just talked. Sometimes Edward was given a book to read. Other times he was allowed to choose one from the thousands in the library. He usually tired of them quickly. He didn't read Elvish script easily; his tutor had taught him the letters, but their few books were in Bretic.\nSpellcasting was more fun. &lt;a href=\"Fire\"&gt;Fire spells&lt;/a&gt; came easily to him and he learned to &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Spell%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; himself readily, but to his chagrin, he couldn't &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; at all. He invariably made things worse for the unlucky rats he was allowed to practice on.\n\"I don't know what I'm doing wrong!\" Edward cried out in frustration. He sent a dart of fire at the writhing rat and it turned into a charred corpse.\n\"Edward, it will be well if you let the Heal spells wait awhile yet.\"\n\"Moraelyn said &lt;a href=\"Light%20Heal\"&gt;Light Heal&lt;/a&gt; is the first spell anybody learns,\" Edward said sulkily.\n\"Did he? Well, he is a practitioner of magic, not a theorist. Even I would hesitate to say what a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; might or might not learn, and when he might learn it. You are the first of your people with whom I have worked. Certainly Moraelyn has had no experience with your race, except for your mother, of course.\"\n\"My mother can't do magic.\"\n\"No, but we think the ability lies within her. She has not been able to learn to master it, possibly because she was too old when she first tried. If you want my opinion it is your thoughts and not your hands which are causing your difficulty. Weeping might help.\"\n\"I don't feel like crying,\" Edward said rather sullenly. He felt more like kicking something, although incinerating the rat had helped relieve some of that.\n\"Meditation might help, then.\""}

He fingered the sash lovingly. His mother had purchased the shirt and pants, saying they looked sturdy and maybe wouldn't show the dirt from the journey. Moraelyn had given him the silk sash with its embroidery of twined leaves and flowers, birds and butterflies in mithril, dwarven and elven metallic threads. But he'd waited until they were across the channel. &lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt; had said it cost too dear; she'd suggested cutting down one of Moraelyn's old ones to fit, but the elf had adamantly refused to let her have any of them. Edward smiled, remembering, and wrapped the sash twice round his waist then knotted the ends carefully. He took the &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; and ran down to meet his parents.\nHe'd meant to fling himself at them, but Moraelyn was alone and Edward stopped still. \"Where's my mother? Is she...?\"\n\"She wanted to stay and choose a horse for you. Didn't trust it to Beech.\"\n\"A horse? For me! Really?\"\n\"Of course. You can't walk all the way to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"I thought I'd have to ride behind...someone. Look, the Archmagister gave me...my staff! Isn't it beautiful?\"\nThe elf took it and hefted it, trying a few swings and feints. \"Good balance and weight for thee, I think. Light for me. Show me how you use it. Suppose I attack you.\" He used his bare hands and Edward fell into a defensive position, blocked him, then thrust the staff toward Moraelyn's ribs. He danced easily aside, but praised the boy.\n\"A mage should have a dagger, too. I thought you might like to have &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Tooth\"&gt;Tooth&lt;/a&gt; here.\" Edward's eye popped. Tooth had an ebony blade and a hilt made from a real dragon's tooth. The elf slid it from its sheath and handed it to Edward who took it carefully. The blade had a wicked point and the edge was sharp enough to shave with. Mats borrowed it sometimes. He'd carved the hilt, too.\n\"Are you sure Mats doesn't mind?\"\n\"Quite sure.\" Moraelyn unbuckled his belt and slid the sheath off it. There was a new belt for\nEdward of snakeskin, soft and pliable and a buckle with the black rose of Morrowind on it, just like Moraelyn's. \"It's from the Companions.\" He knelt to fit the belt and dagger and the sash over it properly, and Edward threw his arms about his neck. \"It's wonderful. I do thank thee and them, too! And oh, I've missed all of thee so much.\"\n\"We missed you, too, son. Let's go or we'll miss our tide.\"\n\"I wouldn't want to worry mother,\" he said, trying to sound casual about having a mother that would worry about him.\n\"No fear; I told her not to look for us until tomorrow night...just in case. But we'll surprise her.\"\n\"Good thinking.\"\nThey made good speed and reached the inlet before the tide was full.\n\"Shall I show you how to use Tooth, or would you rather rest?\"\n\"Tooth! I can rest in the boat while you work.\"\nMoraelyn shielded himself and Edward too, saying that Tooth's bite was no joke. \"I could have shielded myself,\" Edward said proudly. \"I'm good at that. But my Heals go all wrong.\"\n\"It'll come. Give it time.\"\nEvidently Tooth wanted time too. Try as he might, he couldn't get near the elf with the blade, even though Moraelyn kept his feet planted and simply swerved his body, ducking and weaving...and laughing. Frustrated, Edward sheathed Tooth and picked up the staff and whacked at him, swinging it with both hands. It wasn't doing any harm, but it made satisfying sounds as it thwacked against the spell shield. Moraelyn let him hit, but stopped the staff easily when the spell had been used up. Edward threw it on the ground and turned away; the elf reached for him in consolation. Edward snatched Tooth from the sheath and thrust it straight at the elf's heart. The blade was knocked spinning from his hand. Edward had braced to stop the thrust and hold it and he felt the shock even through his shield. Then Moraelyn was kneeling before him, nursing his left hand across his right knee, his face grey with shock and disbelief. Blood was gushing from his wrist like a fountain. \"Give me thy sash!\"\n\"I...I didn't...\" Edward's teeth were rattling in his head. He felt sick and dizzy. Bile washed up in his mouth. \"D-d-didn't--m-m-mean.\" So much blood.\n\"Boy, don't faint now. I need thy aid. The sash. Now, Edward! Pack it into the wound. Gods, what a mess!\" The hand was half severed at the wrist. Edward sat down abruptly, shaking all over, but his hands packed the sash into the open wound, then he wrapped the rest round the hand and wrist.\n\"Take my sash and make a sling.\" Moraelyn eased the injured limb into the sling and then released his other hand. He took the water bottle from his belt and drank it down. \"I need more water. Where's thy staff? There's a well two miles back. Where's Tooth? Go find it and don't cut yourself on it.\"\n\"I don't want it.\"\n\"Not many blades have bathed in Moraelyn's blood. 'Twill bring you luck. Do as I say.\"\n\"The tide's in.\"\n\"Aye and &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; could be on &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; for all the good it does us. I can't row one handed.\"\n\"I could...\"\n\"No, you cannot. You haven't the strength. The current's swift here. I prefer to die on land. Edward, we cannot stay here. The blood smell will draw beasts. If I faint, get well away and climb a tree. And pray.\" He climbed to his feet and leaned on the staff, breathing hard. \"Stay close, but don't grab at me, no matter what happens.\" He took a small step, then another.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Doubtless. You picked a poor time and place to turn assassin. A good assassin always has an escape planned.\"\n\"Yessir.\" Edward sniffed back his tears. \"Sir, I cannot Heal you, but I can restore some vigor.\"\n\"Can you? 'T'would be of great help.\" The spell Edward cast shook the elf; he gasped, but stood straighter and firmer after the shock wore off. \"I can do it again,\" Edward offered eagerly.\n\"Nay. You have plenty of power but want finesse. But 'tis much better, now.\"\nMoraelyn was walking better; he sounded better too. Edward tried to blot the picture of the injury out of his mind. They moved slowly, Moraelyn leaning against a tree from time to time to rest. Nothing molested them. After an interminable time of silent travelling they reached the old well. Moraelyn drained the first bottle and Edward refilled it, drank himself, then filled it yet again.\n\"We'll spend the night in there.\" 'There' was a large ramshackle building, apparently deserted. The elf kicked the locked door open. Inside it was pitch dark. \"&lt;a href=\"Light%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;?\" Edward offered.\n\"Nay. I can see. Save your power and stay by me.\" There was a skittering noise. &lt;a href=\"Rat\"&gt;Rat&lt;/a&gt;s! Edward shielded them both without thinking, pulled Tooth out, and placed his back to the elf's. A rat leaped and drove itself onto the blade. Moraelyn swung the staff and laid out two more. Others scurried off.\n\"Well done, lad!\" They found a small windowless room and shut the door behind them. There seemed to be some wood about; probably it had been some sort of storage room off the kitchen. Moraelyn sat down against the wall.\n\"So. You can use a knife. Was all that pretense? To put me off my guard?\"\nEdward was appalled. He burst into tears, protesting that he'd never harm Moraelyn willingly. \"I meant it for jest; I thought it'd make you laugh...I was angry, at first, but at myself, my clumsiness, not you...it was a sudden thought...I love you dear!\"\nThe elf reached out with his good arm and pulled Edward down to him. \"That's worth a hand, then, any day.\"\nEdward sobbed against his shoulder while Moraelyn soothed him with pats. \"You are my real father.\"\n\"Edward, I am not...\"\n\"Nay, thou art. Thee puts my well-being ahead of thine and loves me when I least deserve it. Thee's been kind and generous and never asked anything of me save to my own profit. Thee'd give thy very life for mine. That's what real fathers do. And I've given thee naught but pain. He who sired me despises me and my mother because we are unlike him. We are not like you either, and yet you love us well. I will do better by you, dear Father.\"\n\"I gave thee cause enough for offense. I took thy mother from thee.\"\n\"You risked losing her because you would not part me from my father. You did not know me and my father was your bitter enemy. And yet you took thought for us. You could not know how unnatural he is. It isn't in you.\"\n\"Granted. And yet the offense and your anger at it remain.\"\n\"I love you!\" Edward protested. But he heard an angry edge in his voice.\n\"And hate me.\" Moraelyn's voice was so calm and quiet that they might have been discussing the weather.\n\"I can't do both...can I?\"\n\"Can you?\"\n\"I didn't mean to hurt you.\"\n\"I believe you.\"\n\"Am I...am I, evil? I was sorry; I'd give anything if it hadn't happened, but...I..\".\n\"Took some measure of satisfaction in it.\"\nEdward's throat was choked with sobs; he couldn't speak, but nodded into Moraelyn's shoulder. The elf's hand stroked him gently.\n\"Did I'ric tell you of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"The demons? No. Is it a demon makes me do such things? I am evil, then.\"\n\"No, you are not. But the daedra feed on actions such as that. They encourage them. And your anger draws them. But they can't make you do anything. And they or it's not inside you. But it is connected to you.\"\n\"I don't want it. I want it to go away. How can I make it go away?\"\n\"Why don't you want it? You draw power from it. That's what let you shield us both with the rats attacked.\"\n\"Mana? That doesn't come from demons.\"\n\"No, but the ability to use it can. Look, some of your deeds feed the daedra. But you draw power from it at the same time. Then the power's yours, to use as you choose.\"\n\"Do you have a daedra?\"\n\"I do and it's a big one, too, but I think everyone has one or more. Some are stronger than others, that's all. But don't go around asking after them. It's not polite.\"\n\"I want mine to go away!\" Edward wailed.\n\"So you say. But pretending it isn't there will not accomplish that. Having a daedra is a bit like riding a horse. You must keep control. The daedra do not care for you. It would as life feed off your pain or injury or death as any other, and find a new host. They do not think or plan as we can and I do not think they experience time as we do. So acts that feed the daedra take place in the moment and while you are caught up in them, past and future cease to exist for you too. It is an intensely pleasurable experience, but it can also be very dangerous. And very addictive, so that you begin to think only of feeding your daedra. You cease to think of the gods and those you love and even yourself. When you have walked too far along that path, you lose the will to choose another.\"\n\"How terrible! What must I do then?\"\n\"It is terrible, the worst that can befall a person. Remember this night. How you felt. Learn to recognize the daedra's hunger for what it is, and think about what you do. You are young and this is heavy for you, but you are at risk. Ah!\" The elf's body stiffened and he caught his breath. Edward guessed that the wound was paining him.\nMoraelyn said that he must sleep a bit, and could Edward keep watch and wake him in an hour's time. Then he could set a lock on the door and they could both rest.\n\"Aye, sir...and I might do somewhat more. I cannot set a &lt;a href=\"lock\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt;, but...\" The door would not latch, nor would it stay open, but would swing nearly shut. Edward felt about near the wall behind it and found a wedge. He shut the door and drove the wedge home with a chunk of wood. \"I thought so. 'Tis awkward to pass such a door with both arms full of wood. We have such at ho...in &lt;a href=\"Gerald\"&gt;Gerald&lt;/a&gt;'s palace. Now anything trying to come in will rouse you; you can use your power to cast heal instead of lock.\"\n\"Why, well thought of, indeed.\" He freed his blade and laid it on the floor beside him. \"We may as well both sleep then.\"\nThey slept fitfully. There were often scrabblings at the door and in the walls, but nothing entered their small closet. Moraelyn cast Heal several time during the night. By morning he pronounced himself as fit \"as a one-handed man can be.\" He unwrapped the sash-bandage and inspected the wound. The bleeding was stopped; the hand was still warm to the touch; it no longer hurt him nor was it swollen or discolored. But the wound was still open and the hand useless. Nerves and muscles had been severed and some of the small bones broken. Such repair was beyond his skill. Edward, feeling the daedra feed on the sight, turned quickly away.\nMoraelyn grinned. \"You may as well let it feed; it's a harmless sort of feeding. The damage is done.\"\n\"I mean to starve it,\" Edward said firmly.\n\"You can try to do that or you can learn to control it instead, and still walk with the gods. I think we'd best go back to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Arena%20Location%29\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Aye, they'll be able to heal you there, will they not?\"\n\"I know not. At the least they'll be able to attach it more firmly than it is at present. Ah, do not look so downcast. The skill to mend it is somewhere, if not in the Tower. &lt;a href=\"Ssa%27ass\"&gt;Ssa'ass&lt;/a&gt; is good with battle injuries and there are Temples which know more of the healing arts than the Tower mages. Besides, it's only my left hand.\" He held up the wadded sash, stiff with his dried blood. \"The color's more practical than thy mother thought. Let's see if we can wash it out a bit. Never have I come so ill-equipped on a journey. I might have been strolling down the main street in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. Thy mother will kill me.\"\n\"Right after she kills me,\" Edward sighed. \"At least returning to the Tower will delay that.\" They came out into the bright courtyard. The morning sun was already high in the western sky.\n\"Not so. Edward, the Companions are coming now! I hear them. &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, let me think of a real good lie!\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mith\"&gt;Mith&lt;/a&gt; trotted into the courtyard. \"Here they are!\" he called back to the others. \"By &lt;a href=\"Torgo\"&gt;Torgo&lt;/a&gt;, you ARE injured. Let me see that. We thought to row across to meet you; we saw the blood on the shore and tracked you here. What attacked you?\"\n\"A demon.\"\n\"A demon! What!? In the open like that in daylight? Gods, what was it carrying, an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Dai-katana\"&gt;ebony dai-katana&lt;/a&gt;?\" Mith whistled as he inspected the injury. Aliera and the others ran up. She hugged Edward, \"Are you all right, darling? I was worried.\" then paled as she saw her husband's hand.\n\"You must be slowing down. How'd you let a demon do that to you?\" Mith demanded.\n\"It was the boy...he grabbed at my arm in fright and my &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; spell failed. It wasn't his fault; it was an accident. Ali, don't look at it. Edward, why don't you take thy mother to see the rat you killed?\"\n\"I want to watch Ssa'ass,\" Edward objected, then remembered that it would feed his daedra. But he might learn something about healing if he watched, which would be a good thing. This was going to be more complicated than he'd thought.\n\"Oh, Edward,\" Aliera said. \"You must keep clear in a fight.\"\n\"He killed a rat in the old inn there, after. Did right well. Kept his head, put his back to mine, shielded us both. Anyone's apt to panic in his first fight. Especially if he isn't expecting it.\"\nSsa'ass came up last, as usual, elbowed the others aside and inspected the injury, hissing. \"I cann fixxxx thissss. It'ss cleann.\" He looked it over carefully, bending the hand back to open the wound. Then he brought the hand forward, so that the edges of the tissue met. He was very particular about getting it aligned just so. Then he had &lt;a href=\"Mats\"&gt;Mats&lt;/a&gt; hold it in place while he cast spells over it. All outer traces of the injury vanished, leaving not even a scar. Moraelyn swung it with satisfaction, twitching his fingers. \"Thanks, Ssa'ass. It's stiff, but...\"\n\"Tomorrow, I ffinissshhh.\"\n\"My poor baby,\" Aliera fussed over Edward. \"You must have been so frightened. And you spent the whole night in that awful house?\"\n\"I'm not a baby. I wasn't afraid; my father was there.\""}

And killed a rat with its tooth? That's a fine &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Dagger%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;ebony dagger&lt;/a&gt;, Tooth is. They're rare so you want to take real good care of it,\" Mith said. \"I can't tell you about the blade except it came from Moraelyn's father. It's the one his brother sent him to repair just before we ran away. Would you like to hear about how they got the dragon's tooth that &lt;a href=\"Mats\"&gt;Mats&lt;/a&gt; carved the hilt from?\"\nEdward nodded, caressing the curved hilt with its lightly carved intertwined roses, thorns and leaves. It was well after supper and everyone but him and Mith had left the fire for one reason or another. &lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt; and Moraelyn had gone for a walk hand in hand, Aliera holding Moraelyn's newly healed left hand in both of hers. They'd laughed and shaken their heads when he'd offered to come along, \"Not tonight,\" Aliera had said. \"Go to sleep soon. We'll be leaving before dawn.\" &lt;a href=\"Willow\"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt; had gone to visit a High Elf friend. Beech, Ssa'ass, Mats and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; woman, Silk, had also gone off together, laughing. They'd invited Mith to come along, but Mith had declined.\n\"Khajiits! They're all turning into a bunch of shameless Khajiits,\" Mith said. The short Dark Elf sat close to the glowing embers, knees to chest. His hair and eyes glowed in the dim light. \"If you're going to pair, you should pair, not turn it into an tourney. They'll be selling tickets next. But each to his own. Khajiits think we're weird because we like eating as a group. Silk says it put her right off her food at first, listening to everybody chew. Well, having a bunch of watchers puts me off. I s'pose you're too young for this kind of talk.\"\nEdward shrugged. It was a beautiful night, crisply cool, no moon, but the stars were very large and bright.\n\"Anyway, it was just a few months after Mats had joined up with us. We were up in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, travelling from town to town. Just three kids seeing the country a bit, picking up odd jobs where we could. Moraelyn entered tournaments if we heard about them, but he wasn't winning that much...just about enough to cover healing him up afterwards. You can get beat up pretty bad fighting Skyrim style - that's without shielding spells, or any other spells for that matter, no magic allowed - even if it isn't to the death. And he drew a few types that didn't mind seeing a little dark elf blood spilled in the sand. Or a lot. And the crowds were against him at first. It can get pretty lonely in the arena, especially if you're beating the home town favorite. And it's even worse if he's beating you.\n\"Mats and me 'ud be the only ones for him, and sometimes we didn't dare cheer too loud. They'd look real funny at a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; boy cheering a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; back then. 'Course Mats was so big, not many wanted to start anything with him. That was a long time ago. &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;'s the favorite now if things get tough. 'Course the crowds will cheer for a good match, but hardly anyone really wants to see him lose now. They like seeing the best, even if it comes wrapped in a dark elf hide. And when he walks into an arena you know you're seeing the best. Not but what they'd like seeing a Nord that's better. And Mats may get there soon. He doesn't fight his best against Moraelyn, though. Maybe he doesn't want to, or maybe Moraelyn just knows him too well. Oh, well, you want to hear about the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;...\"\n\"So Moraelyn was gambling with this Nord in a &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt; one night, trying to pick up a little easy gold. The pot's pretty big, and the man can't match his bet, so he says he'll put this map on the pile and tap Moraelyn. Says it's a map to the hiding place of the best blade ever made. Says there's a spell on it so that if you hit your opponent, you get as much heal as he gets hurt. That some Mage hid it just before he died so's only someone worthy of it can get to it.\"\n\"'And you think I look worthy?' Moraelyn says, grinning. We were young and dumb, but not all that dumb.\"\n\"The Nord grins back and says 'I saw you fight in &lt;a href=\"Falcreath\"&gt;Falcreath&lt;/a&gt;, kid. You look like you'd take a chance.'\"\n\"'Why not? The story alone is worth the gold. You ought to be a &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;.' So anyway Moraelyn wins the pot and tosses the man enough back to keep his throat wet all evening. Just for laughs we look at the map. It showed the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt; down in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Real wild country. And there's an 'X' and some writing saying '&lt;a href=\"Fang%20Lair\"&gt;Fang Lair&lt;/a&gt;'. Mats gets excited and says he's heard of the place, but he'd never known just where it was.\"\n\"'And you still don't,' I say. 'Any fool can draw a map, just as any fool can look at one. I could do as much myself.'\"\n\"Mats says Fang Lair is an old &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; mine, but there's supposed to be a dragon there now, and the dwarves are gone. Moraelyn looks real interested at the mention of a mine, and asks what they mined there. Mats says mithril and gold.\"\n\"Moraelyn says, 'Hmmmmm.'\"\n\"The mithril had him interested. We couldn't afford really good weapons. And &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Weapons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;mithril's&lt;/a&gt; scarce, but it's light to carry for its worth, and easy to mine and work if you know how; and he did. He didn't believe in the magic blade or the dragon, but he thought the mine might be real. Mining's in his blood, as it is in all the &lt;a href=\"R%27Aathim\"&gt;R'Aathim&lt;/a&gt;, the royal Kin of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"It took us a couple of months to get there. We couldn't afford horses. We never would have found it without the map. It's tricky country, full of canyons and hidden valleys. We sure never expected what we saw when we did get there. You could see the towers from the canyon mouth, way back in there. Dark elves live right in caverns if they mine, but the dwarves had built a hall over the top of their mines. It's a pretty thing on the outside. Narrow towers, and arched bridges between them. Delicate looking; you wouldn't expect work like that from Dwarves. Merged right into the rocks too. And there was a big stone dragon mounted above the gate.\"\n\"'There's your dragon, Mats,' I said. The inside wasn't much to look at, just rock wall. The doorway was enormous, but the doors were gone. There was a balcony running right around a big open pit, probably the start of the mine, turned into a hall. And right in the middle was more treasure than you can imagine piled up almost like a haystack that'd been flattened out. And what had flattened it was a golden dragon curled right over it; we didn't even see him at first, 'cause he blended with the rest of the gold. Well, we just froze in place. We hadn't seen a sign of live dragon outside. The place smelled of brimstone, but most mines do. And there that dragon was, just lying there. And it's gotta be two miles to any kind of shelter.\"\n\"'I told you there was a dragon,' Mats whispers.\"\n\"'Shhhhh,' Moraelyn says. 'Look what's in front of his nose.'\"\n\"I'd been busy looking at his nose, believe you me. But there was a sword lying right there naked, sure enough...and the blade was dark metal that looked just like his dagger.\"\n\"'You two start back,' Moraelyn says, 'I'm going to try for that blade, anyway. If that's not ebony, I'm a wood elf. Maybe the dragon's dead, or asleep for the winter, or maybe it's not alive at all. Just something the dwarves made to guard their treasure. Like the scarecrows the Nord farmers put in their grain fields. At worst, I'll distract him long enough for you to get clear.'\"\n\"I'd a mind to take him up on it, but Mats just shook his head, and I was kinda ashamed to go back alone.\"\n\"'Let's all just clear out,' I said. That thing looked real enough to scare me away. But Moraelyn casts &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and heads on down the stair, not making a sound that even I could hear. I could see Mats hated letting him go down alone, but Mats couldn't sneak past a blind, deaf beggar in a fish market. So we strung our bows and figured we could try to get off a couple of shots and maybe get lucky and take out the eyes if the dragon woke up and went for Moraelyn. Mats and I move around to where we can get onto a tower stair fast if we have to, figuring the dragon can't get in there. Then we scrunch down and peer between the railings. Not that there was anything to see except the dragon lying there. Which really is a lot to see, at that.\"\n\"Then those dragon eyes popped open and my heart gave one big jump and then seemed to quit entirely.\"\n\"'Ahhhhh! Dinner comes to me today,' the dragon says. 'Take a good look at my hoard, dark elf. You will not steal it nor even view it long, but your bones will keep it company...forever.'\"\n\"'I don't want your hoard, dragon, just the sword you guard. I'll trade you mine for it; mine's bigger.' I couldn't see Moraelyn, but his voice was coming from right near where the sword was. Which was practically in the dragon's mouth!\"\n\"'I get a meal and both swords. Why should I settle for just your poor sword?'\"\n\"'Let me pass and I'll get you more gold from below.'\"\n\"'I have gold enough.' The dragon yawned and I thought he was going to swallow Moraelyn right then, but he turned his head away, away from us, too. Mats was looking to get a shot, but it was really dark in there for Nord eyes and he was scared of hitting Moraelyn, since he couldn't locate him that well by sound. 'Course Moraelyn's too smart to get between us and the dragon, but Mats wasn't smart enough then to think that far along. Slavery dulls the wits in some ways, Mats says, and he hadn't been free very long. I could see well enough, and I could tell by sound exactly where Moraelyn was, but the shot was clean out of my range.\"\n\"The dragon goes on, 'But there is something you can do for me, elf, and prolong your life a few more minutes.'\"\n\"'A few more minutes sound pretty good just now, dragon. What would you ask of me?' Moraelyn's voice sounded as calm and easy as if he was asking if there would be rain tomorrow. He can keep his head in a tight spot, I'll give him that.\"\n\"'I have a toothache. It's too far back for me to reach it with my claws. Canst see it, elf?' The dragon gapes his jaws to bare his teeth.\"\n\"Moraelyn's invisiblity spell wore off about then, and I could see him standing there staring up into that cavern of a mouth. 'Lower your head a bit so I can get a good look.' He puts out his hand and pulls the upper lip aside, cool as you please, and examines the inner gum carefully. Damndest thing I ever saw.\"\n\"'It's abcessed. Thy gum wants lancing, and the tooth should come out. I can lance it if you trust me in there with a sword.'\"\n\"'And why should I trust you, dark elf? I hear no good of your kind.'\"\n\"'You must be spending too much time with Nords, then. I wouldn't be able to kill you before you killed me. Why should I even try? Listen, I have some friends up above. Suppose they hunt you up a nice fat deer. I'll lance your gum and you can let me go and eat the deer. Else you can just eat me now, toothache and all.'\"\n\"'Hssssssss. What makes you think your friends will return once they're away?'\"\n\"'They're not very smart. I think for them. They'd be lost without me. Good hunting, guys! Uh, if they can't find a deer, is there anything else you'd like? Pig, maybe? A few rabbits? Nuts? Berries? Hurry up, will you?' But we had hand signals and his hands said to get out of there and stay out!\nI'd a been glad to; I mean I'm fond of Moraelyn but I didn't see my dying alongside would bring him any comfort. I'd a been glad to see him clear if it was me that was on the menu, and I figured he felt the same way. But that thick-skulled Nord wouldn't listen to me! Said if dying beside him was all we could do, then that's what we'd do. Nord nonsense. Sounds good in a song, though.\"\n\"So we took a couple hours getting a deer and headed back with it. I figured Moraelyn was filling the dragon's belly by now, and the dragon would be happy to add a deer, another Dark Elf and a Nord to round out his day's rations. But Moraelyn was still sitting there, chatting with the dragon. He didn't look that pleased to see us, either. Told us to leave the deer and go and he'd lance the abcess once we're away. But Mats says he's been thinking. Oh, brother, I thought. Mats doesn't think too often, and that's a good thing, really. He's decided he can get a chain round that bad tooth, fasten down the end to the floor, and then the dragon can give it a good yank himself.\"\n\"The dragon likes the idea, so Moraelyn lances that abcess to take the swelling down to where the dragon can gulp the deer with some comfort. And then they rig up a chain and get that tooth out. Made a hell of a mess, that. Blood and pus everywhere. And Moraelyn's got us casting Heal spells on this dragon to stop the bleeding and close up the wound.\"\n\"'Ah, hum, good, very good. All right, Moraelyn, you've proven yourself. Take the sword and go.'\"\n\"Moraelyn looks at him. 'You mean this was some kind of test?' he says. 'How long have you had that toothache?'\"\n\"'Long indeed, as you measure time, mortal, yet not very long at all for dragonkind. Hear my story then: a scraggly young mage came along, hoping to steal my gold. I caught him at it; we had increasingly harsh words, and he attempted a spell aimed at me. His pitiful spell affected me little, and I killed him. But ummmm...' The dragon looked away briefly, then resumed his tale. 'The little runt had apparently cast a home-made Curse spell upon himself, and when I crunched him...' The dragon scowled fiercely, remembering, then continued, 'Anyway, the ache only came on bad when someone came along to try for the sword. The sharpest pain went away if I ate the intruder...but I usually didn't, though I've singed a few in self-defense; heh, waft a bit of fire and most of them fled. Deer are plentiful; there is something er, ah, unpleasant about eating someone you've talked to. That greasy mage gave me indigestion for days. Cramps and runny bowels and too much gas, even for a dragon. So that toothache never did completely go away. And the people who've come along haven't been very pleasant either...all in all one of the most unpleasant stretches in my life. I couldn't stay away from the vicinity of the sword for very long of course. Part of the curse.'\"\n\"'We could stay on for awhile, if you like. We're good company. I'm Moraelyn; my red-headed friend is Mith, and the big guy is Mats. I'd still like to look for mithril below and I've never had a dragon friend before.'\"\n\"'I might like that. You have good friends, and even though you have said that you must do the thinking for them. I think that they can do some thinking on their own, and it would appear that they have decided that you are a worthwhile fellow,' The dragon hesitated for a second and actually managed to look shy! 'You can call me &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;.'\"\n\"So we stayed for a couple of weeks. Hunted with the dragon; now that's an experience! Searched the mines...didn't find much down there. But the dragon gave us the jewels from his hoard. Said he only needed the metal; they absorb it into their scales while they lie on it. So we did pretty well out of it after all. Moraelyn tried to give Mats the sword. Claimed that he'd have sure tried to kill that dragon if we hadn't come back, and would have been toasted. But Mats wouldn't take it. Said the dragon gave it to Moraelyn so that was clearly who was supposed to get it. Mats took the tooth, but he made the hilt you've got now and gave Moraelyn that, too. Told me he'd never had anything worth giving before, and it made him feel good. He's real pleased Moraelyn chose to give it to you.\"\n\"I think Mats should have got the sword,\" Edward said. \"He didn't try to steal anything. It was really brave of him to come back, even when he didn't think it'd do any good. Moraelyn tried to steal, got caught and then just tried to talk his way out of it. You could all have been killed because of him.\"\n\"That's just what Moraelyn said. Ah, well, Mats likes that big &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; of his better than a blade anyway.\"\nEdward sighed. \"I wish I was brave like Mats. I guess I'm more like you.\"\n\"Aye,\" Moraelyn's voice sounded behind him, startling the boy. \"Tart tongued, like Mith. No matter. I'll be well pleased if you're as brave as Mith. And if once I'm gone they say no more of me than 'he did what he had to do', my spirit will be at peace.\""}

The weather held fair for the most part, with sunny days and cool nights. Bright leaves of scarlet, crimson, gold and green drifted down to form a carpet beneath their horses' feet. Valenwood was very different from the somber, steep forests of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. When they reached the northern border, Edward, looking back, saw that the trees were mostly bare, shorn of their glory. Before them lay a wide green land of rolling hills with only a few stands of trees. It seemed to spread on forever.\n\"This is &lt;a href=\"Wilderland\"&gt;Wilderland&lt;/a&gt;, Edward,\" Moraelyn said. \"Be on your guard. It seems a pleasant land, but no king's writ runs here. Each man's hand is against every other's and there are worse than men. All the races of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; meet here, and clash, save thine, perhaps.\"\nThey journeyed for some days more with small incident, save one for a band of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; raiders that crept up on their camp by night. These were easily repelled. Silk slew one and the rest ran off yowling. The gentle wood elf girl, Willow, lobbed &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;fireballs&lt;/a&gt; after them. There were no roads, just small paths that criss-crossed one another and seemingly led nowhere.\nAfter two weeks of steady riding they came to a bowl shaped place in the hills where the land was tilled. The fields looked fair and were stacked with harvest, but the folk were dispirited, ragged, and unfriendly. Questions about inns got only shrugs and puzzled looks. Armed bands challenged them at times and demanded to know their business. When &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; said they were bound for &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, they were told to pass through quickly and mind they stole nothing.\n\"Passage is all we wish,\" Moraelyn said quietly.\n\"Someone should teach these folk manners,\" the usually placid &lt;a href=\"Mats\"&gt;Mats&lt;/a&gt; growled.\n\"Thou mayst stay and open a school of &lt;a href=\"etiquette\"&gt;etiquette&lt;/a&gt;, if it pleases thee,\" Moraelyn said, \"I fear my life's too short to teach the lessons these villains require. Still, I like not the look of the sky; it looks even more evil than the folk. I think we'll try our luck in the town.\"\nThe town was surrounded by a palisade of wood and had a stout gate. Guards looked them over and refused them entrance. \"None but humans enter here, elf. Take thy rabble and begone.\"\n\"I see. Ali, Mats, Edward, thou seemst to qualify for the hospitality here. The rest of us will shelter elsewhere.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt; announced that she would see them all blown back to &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; by the storm before she'd step within these gates. So they circled the town, passing a moat with stone walls within and a keep of some sort within that. A track north took them past a small house with a large barn nearby. Both looked in poor repair, but Moraelyn sent Aliera and Edward to knock at the door and ask if they might sleep in the barn. The rest waited in the road.\nAn elderly woman answered their knock; she looked pleased to see them. \"Stay? Aye, I'd be glad of the company. No need to sleep in the barn, though, lady. I've a room to spare. My name's &lt;a href=\"Ora%20Engelsdottir\"&gt;Ora Engelsdottir&lt;/a&gt;.\" Aliera gestured toward the waiting Companions. The woman squinted toward them. \"Thy man's there and some friends? Aye, we'll all squeeze together then. T'will be warmer so. I've a pot of soup on the fire; made it to last me a week but you're welcome to it. I can make more.\"\n\"My husband's an elf.\"\n\"Is he so? He looks to take good care of thee and thy son. Thou's fat as pigs. Bring them in. I wish my grand-daughter had such a one to care for her.\"\nOra refused payment, saying she was not yet at such a pass that her guests must pay for her hospitality. She said tales and song and an evening's merriment would be payment enough. Pots and dishes were set out to catch the worst of the leaks; she knew them all well. They gathered around the hearth and made very merry while the storm raged, banging the shutters and doors and threatening to blow the roof away altogether.\n\"Tell me, my lady,\" Ora whispered apart to Aliera, \"He's truly good to thee? He's so big and so black.\"\n\"Truly good,\" Aliera said keeping her mouth serious while her eyes laughed.\n\"Aye, 'tis well, then. He put me a bit in mind of our baron, who's big and dark...oh, not so dark as thy elf. He took my grand-daughter, &lt;a href=\"Caron\"&gt;Caron&lt;/a&gt;, and he does not treat her well. He...he hurts her, my lady. And she dare not run away. Where would she go?\" Tears gathered in Ora's eyes and followed worn familiar tracks down her cheeks.\nWhen their hostess had gone to sleep in her own room, Aliera repeated what she had been told.\n\"Let's rescue the girl,\" &lt;a href=\"Beech%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Beech&lt;/a&gt; said, \"we grow stale with inaction.\"\n\"Aye!\" said&lt;a href=\"%20Silk\"&gt; Silk&lt;/a&gt; and Willow at once.\nMats growled an agreement. &lt;a href=\"Mith\"&gt;Mith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ssa%27ass\"&gt;Ssa'ass&lt;/a&gt; looked interested.\nMoraelyn looked doubtful. \"We cannot right every wrong in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. This baron offers his folk shelter of a kind. They could leave if they liked it better outside.\"\n\"Aye,\" Mith said, \"he keeps the bandits off so he may rob the folk at leisure.\"\n\"And we pull him down? There'll be another to take his place. Or else the outside will come in and there'll be nothing left at all.\"\n\"Nothing would be better than this filthy something,\" Mats said.\n\"There's that.\" The storm seemed to have moved away. Aliera went to the door and stared up into the sky where clouds raced past the eastern moon. A single large brilliant blue star hung near the moon. \"&lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar hangs&lt;/a&gt; near Tamriel tonight. Moraelyn?\"\n\"I'd thought to mend her roofs tomorrow if it's fair,\" he said as she returned to the fireside. \"We'll do so much at least. As for the rest, Aliera?\"\n\"She asked for my help, in a way and I...I think I hear Zenithar's voice in the wind and feel his hand in the rain on this night.\"\n\"Thy quest, then, wife.\"\nAliera nodded, unsmiling. She curled up with Moraelyn in the chimney corner and they whispered and laughed together for awhile. Edward fell asleep. In the morning he was sent up on the roof to help Beech and Willow place new shingles. Moraelyn wrote a letter which he gave to Mats, telling him to take it to the baron, to arrive at the castle around dinnertime and to go afoot.\n\"You're going to challenge him for the girl!\" Edward grinned. \"But will he fight? And wouldn't he take her back again once we're gone?\"\n\"Mmm. Since he wouldn't let me in his town, thy mother thought to invite him to our house instead.\" Moraelyn stamped the letter with his sealing ring and handed it to Mats.\n\"Oh. It's a long way to your house still, isn't it?\" &lt;a href=\"Edward\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt; felt a bit of disappointment that no rescue seemed imminent, but he supposed it really was not reasonable to expect eight people to take a keep, even if they were Moraelyn's Companions. Probably the songs exaggerated their deeds.\nMoraelyn grinned, ruffled Edward's hair and told him to cease his questions, get up on the roof, and mind his mother. Moraelyn and Mith set off together on foot. Aliera said they were going hunting. They did not return even at suppertime. Aliera told Edward not to worry; they'd meet later.\nIt was well after sundown when she bid their hostess farewell. They took all the horses with them and left them in a grove near the north wall of the keep. Aliera asked Edward if he wanted to wait for them with the horses. Edward asked where they were going.\n\"We have to enter the keep to get Ora's grandchild out. No questions, Edward. If you're coming, then stay with me and do exactly as I say. &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; across the moat: I must swim. Once across we'll scale the wall. Once inside, just follow me and be as silent as you can.\"\nEdward gaped at his mother and the other Companions. How could the six of them possibly storm a keep? Three women, two men and a boy? There would be guards up on the wall and a lot more inside. Mats would be inside too, though, he guessed. But where were Moraelyn and Mith?\nThere were fearsome things in the moat. Edward began a protest, then thought better of it. Ssa'ass slid into the moat first. There was some splashing and hissing, then the water went quiet. Aliera entered the water. The others levitated.\n\"Here's the ropes,\" Beech said, feeling along the wall. There were three ropes. Edward, Beech and Ssa'ass went up first; Aliera, Willow and Silk followed. Moraelyn and Mith were waiting above. Two guards were snoring softly in a heap.\n\"How...\" Edward began, and found his mother's hand clapped over his mouth. A guard from another wall section called out and Edward's heart stopped beating. Mith called something back to him and tramping footsteps moved away.\nThe Companions went silently down the stairs and slipped across the yard like shadows. There was no guard on the door to the keep itself. Inside the passages were eerily quiet. They stopped at an imposing door and flattened themselves against the wall beside it. They could hear voices within. A thin chilling wail sounded and died away. Moraelyn whistled a snatch of song into the silence that followed. The door swung open and they raced inside, falling on the startled guards like furies.\nEdward was last inside, Tooth in his hand; he stabbed the nearest guard in the side, and Beech finished him with a blow to the head. Mats had been inside; it was he who had opened the door. His axe clove the head of one guard, then swung against the inner door. Aliera and Willow had barred the strong outer door. Moraelyn's opponent was a very young man. He'd taken one look at the big dark elf, dropped his sword and fallen to his knees, praying for mercy.\nMoraelyn eyed him with disgust and said, \"Greet Zenithar for me; tell him Moraelyn of Ebonheart commends you to his mercy. I have none for such as you.\" He slashed the young guard's throat. Blood sprayed over Moraelyn's leathers. His victim fell over, gurgling horribly. A burning acid rose in Edward's throat; he swallowed hard and looked away.\nThe guards inside the anteroom had been dispatched, but outside the door shouts and footfalls thundered and there was pounding on the door. Edward followed his mother into the inner chamber, which was empty save for a naked girl tied spreadeagle on the enormous bed, her eyes starting from her head.\nThe Companions cut her free while Aliera caught her shoulders. \"Thy grandmother sent us, child. Where's the baron?\"\nThe girl pointed at a bookcase, then clung to Aliera. She was no bigger than Edward and seemed not much older. Her breasts were just beginning. She was covered with welts and blood and purple-yellow bruises. Aliera flung her own cloak over the girl. Beech picked her up. Mith's fingers were feeling over the bookcase; there was a click and a section slid aside. He went through cautiously. The others followed and the secret door closed after them.\n\"I think it's just a bolt hole,\" Mith said, \"but there'll be traps, no doubt.\"\n\"Go warily, then, friend,\" Aliera said. \"There's no hurry. I think the baron plans to show his departing guests the door, as a good host should.\"\nA narrow passage opened to the left. Mith sent a bolt of light down it. The floor was littered with bones. Human bones. Small skulls stared eyelessly. \"I'm going to enjoy killing him,\" Moraelyn said.\n\"No!\" Aliera protested. \"My quest, my kill!\"\nMoraelyn swung to face her. \"Aliera...\"\n\"I want it sung that he died by Aliera's hand! I claim my right to face him, king.\"\n\"Leave him to me and we'll sing it your way! He's twice your size. D'you want to fight me for the right?\" The elf leaned over her, a full head taller.\n\"If I must.\" Aliera brushed past him, slinging her shield on her arm, and drawing her short sword as she ran. Moraelyn grabbed at her, missed, and ran after her. His size hampered him in the low, narrow passage. Sparks flew from his spell shield as he caroomed recklessly off the walls.\n\"Come on, you two,\" Mith yelled from ahead. \"I'm not promising to save him for you.\"\n\"Moraelyn,\" Edward gasped, running after him. \"You're not going to let her!\"\n\"Let her! How d'ye propose I stop her? I'm open to suggestions, short of actually fighting her myself.\" He seemed half-angry, half-amused.\n\"M-maybe he's gone by now.\"\n\"Nay, he's locked in here with us; we found the exit earlier from the other side and Mith set a lock the baron will not undo.\"\n\"Well, &lt;a href=\"paralyze\"&gt;paralyze&lt;/a&gt; her. You can carry her.\"\n\"She's activated her shield; it reflects spells, among other things. I'd only paralyze myself and I'd be inconvenient to carry. She'll be all right. It's an excellent shield. It casts a very powerful protective spell. I'ric himself devised it.\"\n\"Having a spot of trouble with your locks tonight, baron?\" Mith's voice came clearly from ahead. They emerged into a larger space where the baron had been clawing vainly at switches beside a massive door. \"Shoddy work. You should get another smith.\"\n\"He won't be needing one,\" Aliera snarled. The Companions spread around her in a semi-circle. The baron set his back to the door and set himself in a fighting stance. He was a big man, as big as Mats, and he was holding an axe as big as the one Mats wielded, and wearing a breastplate and helm. He addressed Moraelyn.\n\"Nine against one. I'd expect odds like that from you black devils,\" Moraelyn was at the back of the group, yet the baron had singled him out as the leader. People did, somehow.\n\"You prefer the advantage of weight, do you not? But my wife wants you to herself. She cannot resist your charms it seems. Nor can I; I could not wait for you to respond to my invitation, so I came to you instead.\"\n\"I beat her and the rest of you kill me? Hah! It might be worth it at that,\" he added, staring at Aliera with cold dark eyes.\nAliera smiled a terrible smile. Her dark hair swung free about her shoulders and she seemed to glow. \"You will not beat this woman, baron, but if you do, then you go free. You are mine alone tonight. Swear it all, by Zenithar! If he haps to kill me, my ghost will hound him to his grave and beyond.\" She sounded rather pleased at the prospect. Edward began to shiver.\n\"By Zenithar!\"\nThe baron laughed, \"I don't believe you, but one last female for my collection then. Are you so wearied of her, elf?\"\n\"Are you so afraid of her that you'd rather face me instead?\" Somewhere deep in his mind Edward realized that the elf was right. Despite the baron's bravado, he was afraid of Aliera. Edward hadn't sworn with the others. He clutched his staff tightly but his feet seemed rooted to the floor.\nThe baron laughed again and swung a mighty blow at Aliera in answer, but it deflected harmlessly off her shield. His eyes widened as he realized she was spell shielded. Aliera danced aside and cut his arm. She was nimble, but he managed to land many blows. If her shield went...Edward did not finish the thought.\nBut he was leaving himself somewhat open in the hope of wearing her shield down and she was scoring hits against his limbs. She kept her blows low, trying to cost him the use of his legs and drain him of blood. All the while she taunted him about his manhood, saying she would geld him ere he died. A great blow knocked her back; her shield flashed and was gone.\nThe baron raised his axe high to cleave her skull with a single blow. Her arm drew back and she threw her slender short sword straight into her enemy's eye. He dropped the axe and fell screaming to his knees, hands clawing at his face. Aliera stepped forward and thrust the sword home, piercing deep within the brain. The body fell over, twitching and jerking.\n\"Well fought, wife!\"\n\"I had a master trainer, and a better armorer!\" Aliera laughed, then she threw back her head and shouted wordlessly in triumph, raising her arms, fists clenched.\n\"That you did!\" Moraelyn grabbed Silk in a rough hug and kissed her noisily. \"It's a neat trick you taught her, Silk.\"\n\"I'll thank you to cease flirting with my trainer, husband!\" Aliera said, wiping her slender &lt;a href=\"Adamantium%20Weapons\"&gt;adamantium&lt;/a&gt; blade carefully.\n\"Me flirt? Not while thy blood's up, and thy shield's still charged. I'm just thanking her. I'll kiss I'ric too when next I see him.\"\n\"Is he truly dead?\" Caron had clung to Beech throughout the fight with her eyes closed. Now she regarded Aliera with Awe, Edward thought was the right word. Edward felt something of the same, although it was akin to horror.\n\"Dead enough,\" Aliera said, regarding the still faintly twitching form, with satisfaction. The girl drew closer, then knelt beside him. She picked up a stone and smashed it into the face again and again, sobbing. When she had done, Ssa'ass cast some healing spells on her. Mith unlocked the door. They'd come out quite near to where they had left the horses.\nThey took the girl back to her mother's house and left her there, instructing her to tell anyone that ventured to molest her, that Zenithar's servants would return if she were harmed. The bewildered old woman clasped her granddaughter to her. As she bade them farewell, she whispered to Aliera to look after that man of hers.\n\"Oh, I do,\" Aliera said. \"I do.\"\nWhen they stopped for rest Aliera came over to Edward to talk to him, but he protested that he was very tired and just wanted to sleep. Moraelyn tugged her away, saying that if her son did not need her then she could see to her man, who did. They moved out of the circle of firelight. Edward lay wakeful, listening to their small, stifled sounds. That was not unusual. It had troubled him at first. \"I can't sleep; you're too noisy,\" he'd protested one night. \"What are you doing, anyway?\" That had drawn giggles from the Companions. \"Can't you at least pretend you're sleeping?\" Moraelyn had asked plaintively. \"Now I know why dark elves seldom have more than one child. What I do not understand is how humans manage to get so many.\" Moraelyn and Aliera had come back to lie by him that night, but after that he had pretended to sleep, like the others.\nAnd the noises were too familiar now to keep images of the night's adventures from flashing through his mind, as vivid as if they were happening again in truth. He could feel his &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; feeding and could not stop it. It just wasn't fair, he thought, but now he was beginning to see what Moraelyn meant by feeding his daedra and yet walking with the gods. With Zenithar.\nMoraelyn came back, carrying Aliera. He set her gently down, then stretched himself out between Edward and her.\n\"It must be difficult, being a woman,\" he said softly. \"It was hard, watching her. Just watching.\"\nEdward nodded.\n\"I've asked it often enough, of her,\" Moraelyn continued. \"She told me how hard it is, but I never knew until tonight. I knew she'd win. Zenithar was with her, and all the baron had was his daedra. And still it was very hard to watch. She makes that cast nine tries out of ten, and there were more uses on the shield if she missed, he'd have dropped of exhaustion before he wore it out entirely.\"\n\"I keep thinking about it, too...and the guard you...he asked for mercy?\"\n\"I know. And yet, he listened to that night after night. And still he remained the baron's man.\"\n\"Most men are not as strong as you are. Maybe he couldn't help himself?\" Why was he pleading for a man already dead? His mind kept replaying the night's events as if they might yet come out differently, for better or for worse.\n\"Even to witness evil such as that corrupts the soul. To watch and do nothing, Mats would have stayed my hand had there been anything there worth keeping. And it's worse for the young; I am sorry you had to pass through this night.\"\n\"Is my soul corrupted now?\"\n\"You feel the acid's bite, as do we all, but you'll heal.\"\n\"Can you &lt;a href=\"Heal\"&gt;Heal&lt;/a&gt; me now?\"\n\"Aye.\" Moraelyn gathered the boy in his arms, then rolled over so that Edward lay between his parents. Aliera put her arms around him without really waking. Her strong woman smell mingled with Moraelyn's musky dark spice odor in Edward's nostrils.\n\"She was so angry,\" Edward whispered. He'd wondered if he would ever really feel the same toward her again and yet her arms were still as comforting as before. Maybe Moraelyn too had needed that reassurance and had been wise enough to ask for it.\n\"She's a woman. That sort of injury to another touches her near,\" he said.\nHow near? The boy looked the question he dared not put.\n\"Thy father's not a monster. But she was wed to a man who did not care for her, and she could not leave him. It's common enough among thy race, which makes it none the easier to bear, I think.\"\n\"She has a daedra, too, then?\" Edward asked sadly.\n\"You must speak with her about that.\"\n\"It wasn't really a fair fight, her shielded and not him.\"\n\"Fair fighting's for the arena, boy. Would you fight a &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hell%20hound\"&gt;hell hound&lt;/a&gt; without weapons, spells and armor, though they have none? I would not.\"\n\"What will become of Caron and Ora? And the other folk, now that the baron's dead?\"\n\"Do I look like the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;? How should I know? We can stop here in the spring and see what's been planted in the field we burned tonight. I've no mind to stay and plow it. I've my own fields to tend, listen to me, I sound like a Nord farmer. Mines to dig is more like it.\" He yawned.\n\"The others didn't think about afterwards. You did.\"\n\"I'm a king; it's what we do.\""}

The Nords under Vrage's leadership spread into &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, conquering some of the sly and thievish dark elves and the weak and superstitious &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;.\nJosea and Lucky had opened a store and built a fine big house for their family. One night Josea awoke alone, and heard voices in the hall. She left her bed and crept to see. The voices sounded angry!\nLucky was standing there in his nightshirt; the passing years had changed him little. He looked no older, but he had grown leaner and paler, and somehow less substantial. Standing with him were a tall matronly woman, dark haired, and clad in a fine blue robe, a knight in black armor, carrying a black sword and a handsome blond man, greenclad, with a bow. Two elves were there as well, one fair and one with golden skin; one had a harp, the other a lute. Elves had not been seen in Skyrim in years! How did quiet simple Lucky come to know such grand people?\n\"Is this how you keep your pact with us? Did we not make the rules clear to you?\"\nThe woman was shouting at Lucky, who only muttered, \"Lady &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, I didn't realize it had been so long. It was only for a few days, and then a few days more. And then there were the children and Josea needed me. I thought no harm. Things seemed to go well for everyone. It hasn't been so long. &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; did well enough without me before.\" Lucky spoke softly, yet his face was set and Josea knew how stubborn he could be.\n\"Everyone! What of the Bretons? What of the dark elves? And the wood elves. Of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf\"&gt;ice elves&lt;/a&gt; I say nothing. They are gone, gone altogether and forever.\"\n\"Such shy folk...I tried,\" Lucky faltered. \"I did try. The ice elves were very hard to find, and not that friendly when I did find them.\"\n\"Are all the elves to follow them, and the Bretons, and then the other races?\"\n\"I'll go; I will go. But High Rock and Morrowind are so far from here. And how can I leave my children? Surely, I am entitled to children? And my woman...\"\n\"You could have arranged matters as I did,\" said the green clad ranger. \"Now it's too late for that. Matters have gone too far. We trusted you. It was a simple assignment. Yet we should have watched him.\" This last sentence was addressed to the black knight.\n\"I did watch him,\" the knight snapped, waving his sword, which Josea now saw was actually a part of his arm. \"Yet alone I could do nothing! I'd few devotees in either High Rock or Morrowind. Once I realized I knew I had to find the rest of you; alone I could do little. What I could, I did. They're halted for now, yet the damage must be repaired, and he who caused it must do the fixing, Tinker! It won't be easy. You'll have to avoid the Skyrim folk altogether for a couple of hundred years, I think.\"\n\"No! My Lord Ebonarm, no!\" The cry was wrenched from Lucky's heart. \"I cannot. I implore you. Do not ask it of me...leave me something of my own! Why must I always give it all to others? I'm tired of it! You promised me a life, and what you gave me, that endless wandering, was not a life!\" The black knight Ebonarm scowled back at Lucky.\n\"We are a gentle folk,\" the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;wood elf&lt;/a&gt; bard said in his musical voice, \"yet &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; can no longer be restrained. And if he wars against you, the other elven gods stand with him! If the gods war, &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; itself may be destroyed. You may find daedra to stand with you; they love chaos. But I think you will find that not even Springseed, Ebonarm and Mara will fight for you if you defy them further.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt; speaks truth, as ever. Let us not speak of war among ourselves, my friend. We wished your folk no ill. We deeply regret what has happened and will labor to repair our fault. I regret our long absence, yet it was necessary. Raen and I were needed...elsewhere.\" Mara said. \"And not even a god, or a goddess, can be everywhere at once.\"\n\"As for you, Sai,\" she said, turning to Lucky, \"One night a year with your woman and your children I will grant you. But not in the flesh. The temptations are too strong for you, I see. It was a mistake to let you hold the flesh so long. I apologize to the rest of you. Now, go and make your farewells. You are dismissed.\"\nThe knight and ranger vanished, but the elves remained. The golden skinned one spoke to Mara, \"Watch these new folk of yours more carefully, Lady Mara. We are a patient people, and kindly disposed to other sentient races, yet there are limits to our patience. Take warning.\" Then the elves too were gone.\nLucky fell to his knees, clutching at Mara's robe, his face a mask of anguish, \"Lady, wait! I implore you. Am I never to feel again? Never? It is more than I can bear. The rest of you can assume mortal form on occasion. Better I should have died naturally, and gone to rest,\" he added bitterly.\nMara considered, frowning. \"Others have paid dearly for the life you have stolen. Their spirits are not at rest; they too will exact payment. And yet...very well. If you will labor to repair the damage you have done, then you may on occasion assume bodily form, but not as human. Wolf shape shall be yours, in return for the kindness you showed Grellan.\"\nAnd she was gone, leaving Lucky standing alone, barefoot. Josea ran to him and clasped him...oh, how thin and cold he was!\n\"What is it, dearest? Who were they? What does it mean? Oh, don't leave us!\"\n\"I must,\" he said, shivering. \"I have stayed far too long. My dearest, I am Luck itself. I was born with the talent, though mortal as yourself. My lord took me for a soldier. I was killed in my first battle, even as the battle was won. I ever brought luck to others, never to myself, never. Ebonarm appeared to me, said I had an interesting talent and offered me immortality if I would agree to spread my luck about.\"\n\"He said the gods were overworked, seeing to events, and constantly quarreling over what should happen. He thought that I could balance things out naturally with my inborn talent. I was young. I'd barely lived. I didn't want to die, so I agreed, and Ebonarm said that I could keep my body for a time. I wouldn't age or die, but I would fade slowly, as you have seen. I am nearly eighty now. I did as he bade for many years. Then I met you, and found myself trapped by your need, I think. I was your Luck, you see, what you needed. And truth is, I needed you, too, my dear love.\n\"Yet while I've stayed here, my luck has spread like ripples, strongest in the center, weak along the edges until there's none at all in Morrowind and High Rock and the Wilderness to the south, and the folk are dead or chained in slavery. Also I've brought luck only to the Nords among whom I've lived, so that the wood elves have fled and the ice elves have died. Now I must go, and bring Luck back to them and redress the balance, as it should have been.\"\nHe went to the children's rooms and kissed them as they slept, while his tears fell on them. Then he said, \"I'll be with you one night each year, though you will not see me. Yet you will feel my presence, dearest. Oh, and I could never speak of love or marriage...but know I love you, as no man or god loved woman.\" Then he kissed her one last time, and was gone.\nMats stopped talking at last. The fire had burned down to ashes. Edward drew a long breath.\n\"That's some story,\" Edward said. \"Is it true?\"\n\"Are you calling my grandmother a liar? I know she used to leave a bit of food and a bowl of milk out on winter nights. 'For the Wolf,' she said. And we &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; hold it very unlucky to attack a wolf unless it attacks you. It just might be Sai!\n\"My grandmother said she got the tale from her great-grandmother, and her great was Josea herself. So she said. Or maybe it was her great-great-grandmother. I get lost there. Anyway it happened during the reign of King Vrage the Gifted, like I said, when the Nords invaded Morrowind and High Rock. It took &lt;a href=\"Sai\"&gt;Sai&lt;/a&gt; a hundred and fifty years to get things set right again, and he needed a lot of help. From Moraelyn's brothers and father, among others. The dark elves and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; have been lucky to get their lands back, you see, and it's been hard times for &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; folk, although once your luck builds up the way theirs did, it takes a long time to really run out altogether. And Sai didn't make the same mistake again. He's been spreading luck around ever since. Otherwise folk get arrogant and start thinking they're entitled to more than others. Yet he's kept his promise. You see, I'm his descendant and once a year I feel his presence. That was tonight.\"\n\"I thought being a god means you can do just as you please,\" Edward said.\n\"Well, they can, you see. Sai did, for awhile, but he and his fellow gods weren't pleased with the results. There's rules to being a god, it seems, just as there are rules to being a man or a boy.\"\n\"Who makes the rules then?\" Edward demanded.\nMats laughed. \"Best save that question up for the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt;. It's much too deep for me! Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going to have a drink. I'm parched after so much talking and then rouse Mith, so I can sleep myself.\"\n\"Mats, I was taught that Moraelyn's father and brothers were just raiders and that the Nords were the real owners of the lands they took. That the dark elves come up out of the ground and raid for meanness and profit.\"\n\"Moraelyn's father, Kronin, and his brothers, Cruethys and Ephen, took to raiding after the Nords drove them out of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. Guerilla warfare isn't pretty, but neither is losing your homeland. Human memories of that time are faded hand-me-downs, but there's a fair number of dark elves who lived through it still around. Moraelyn's aunt Yoriss for one, she who rules in &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, there's some dark elves still, along the borderland in &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, who are just thieves and kidnappers, no question. They have holds up in the mountain caverns and raid farms and villages in east Skyrim. But Moraelyn's folk have naught to do with them, leastways not since they regained their own lands in Morrowind. &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; hates the raiding. He'd stop it if he could.\" Mats sighed.\n\"Why can't he?\"\nMats yawned widely. \"That's a matter of politics and power, boy. You ask him about it, and you'll likely get more answer than you want, for once. Me, I'm off to bed. Good night.\""}

The next morning they resumed their journey eastward, moving through rolling hills towards the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; borders, and camping the next two nights under clear early summer skies. When they resumed traveling the third morning, Moraelyn told everyone to watch the slopes north of the road for a notch opening to a high meadow that faced to the southwest. Shortly afterward everyone spotted it almost simultaneously when the group completed a bend around a rocky outcrop.\n&lt;a href=\"Silk\"&gt;Silk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Beech%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Beech&lt;/a&gt; went ahead to scout a good route, and to look for a campsite for the evening ahead. By dusk they had covered most of the distance to the meadow, but still faced some stiff climbing the next morning. They agreed that it was time to camp once again, but happily a lunchtime picnic seemed very likely the next day.\nBy mid-day the next day, which was &lt;a href=\"Loredas\"&gt;Loredas&lt;/a&gt; the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid Year&lt;/a&gt;, the Companions were sprawled across a grassy slope within the Dragon Village, having been joined by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and one other dragon. This second dragon was smaller than Akatosh, and seemed to be a female, although characteristically Akatosh had just introduced the dragon as Debudjen, with no further explanations being forthcoming. The two dragons politely chatted with the humanoids as they enjoyed their repast, though Debudjen flew off afterwards, to arc gracefully above, and then swoop down upon a steer in a grassy field some distance away.\nAkatosh had been watching Edward's reaction to this, and asked: \"Why did you flinch, Edward? Debudjen had not eaten recently, and really behaved no differently than you just have.\"\nEdward replied with a small smile, \"I don't think that our meal was quite that violent in nature.\"\nAkatosh returned the smile, but then responded. \"A good reminder then, that we are only similar, rather than the same.\"\nEdward paused, squinting into the mid-afternoon sun, and then turned to the golden dragon: \"Akatosh, why did you choose this spot for your village?\"\n\"Well, it was high enough up into the mountains to suit us, but flat enough for raising the cattle with trees for the deer and it is very defensible for all of us. There is plenty of room for the humans to build their ranches and farms, and the elves are quite comfortable in the dense trees along the cliff edges. The adits in the surrounding cliff faces provide us the access to our lairs, which we have located within the mining tunnel system. All in all, an ideal site for such an experiment involving this many races of beings. It even opens to the southwest, providing reasonable warmth for the smaller beings, with some protection from the elements during the colder months.\"\nEdward responded, \"It is difficult for me to get used to the notion of a village without some central concentration of buildings, but perhaps these will be developed in the future; at least, a few buildings for meetings and socializing. And, I suppose that there are also some beautiful sunsets to be seen.\"\nThe dragon smiled again, but replied \"Quite so, but I am the only one of the dragonkind to show any interest, and that was not a legitimate consideration when we chose this site.\" Then wistfully: \"I wish that I could assemble the words to describe some of them. I have attempted this many, many times, but the results just are not...very admirable.\" More briskly: \"And by the way, we do intend to erect a meeting hall for the humanoids, and also some stores for barter and other exchanges of goods.\"\nMoraelyn had wandered over and seated himself, and he asked, with a notable absence of the usual humanoid respect for dragons, \"Whatever possessed you to attempt such a crazy experiment, Akatosh?\"\nThe dragon paused thoughtfully, and then replied \"As is my wont I had been analyzing, in this case one might say the history of dragon behavior. Clearly our lengthy contest of resistance to these new Aurielian gods was futile, but it took many of our generations for us to realize and accept this. Then, our next pattern was to isolate ourselves, even from each other, and to resist intrusion from any and all beings. The exception of course was to mate among ourselves and procreate our race. However, aside from that one activity, we fought any and all for our precious privacy, and really for no good reason except that we can be an especially stubborn race.\"\nEdward said, \"Then you maintained a pattern of behavior long after the reason for it was gone?\"\nAkatosh looked a bit embarrassed. He said stiffly, \"I believe that is what I just said. We are not the only sentient race to fall prey to that.\"\nEdward said, \"The Archmagister has told me that much behavior is inborn.\"\nMoraelyn smiled at him, \"And inborn behavior patterns are a particular problem for long-lived species who change slowly as conditions change. We elves suffer from it even more than you short-lived humans, which is why we like to keep things as they are, though life is change and to resist it utterly is death. Dragons live far, far longer than even elves, and, in consequence, breed even more slowly. Still, who can say what alterations being born into a social setting may produce, for good or ill, in dragon behavior.\"\nAliera had by this time joined the conversation, and observed: \"The &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; must have been long pleased with dragon behavior.\"\nAkatosh responded, \"Perhaps so, but I approached our queen with this suggestion moreso because it seemed clear to me that as a race we had fallen into a stasis, and we needed to break this shell in order to invigorate ourselves. She didn't quite agree with me, but, perhaps because of my reputation, she told me to go ahead and make this attempt.\"\nBy this point, all of the Companions were sitting within hearing range, and Mats asked: \"Did you have to get your queen's permission? And have there been many difficulties among the various races?\"\n\"Permission is not quite accurate in this case, Mats; being the beings that we are, it was moreso that I was obliged to tell her of this so that she would have the information. For example, other dragons regularly come to me with potential military intelligence, following this same philosophy of preparedness.\"\nMats grinned and said, \"You mean 'just in case', right? But what about these elves and humans?\"\n\"Ah, our humanoid Lord and Lady do set a most remarkable example of tolerance and respect for differing shapes and customs. I owe a debt of gratitude to Moraelyn for the loan of his smiths and miners, who have been most generous in sharing their knowledge and skills with the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; that my young friend Edward and I have, ah, persuaded to attempt settlement here. It is my experience that Bretons, well, many Bretons, will do virtually anything so long as it is profitable and they gain skill and knowledge from it. The &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; lust for individual honor and glory makes the &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Armor%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;mithril armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Weapons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; produced here extremely profitable - t'was sheer genius that inspired &lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt; to insist that we sell only to the nobility while the delving opens new tunnels and provides access to - that which we dragons require.\" Akatosh smiled a little slyly. He was very reticent on the subject of exactly what dragons required. \"&lt;a href=\"Beech%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Beech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willow\"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt; have made it known among their people that wood elves are welcome here, so those who have long missed their ancient High Rock homes have returned to these hills.\"\n\"Fortunate for me that I'm now a Duke, and thus qualified to wear and carry mithril. If only I could afford more than a piece or two! But for the cost I might retire.\" Mats said.\n\"If you retired you would not require the mithril,\" Moraelyn pointed out.\n\"And what of my son and daughter? Thinkst thou I will beg from thee for them?\" Mats said indignantly. \"My knees and wind may not be what once they were, I grant you. I'fact I'm somewhat tempted to remain up here, now I am here, yet I can still swing my axe with any!\"\nMith grinned delightedly, \"Nords can't count. It's why they seek honor and glory, not profit. Honor and glory are not amenable to enumeration much past what one can tally on the fingers. Mats, if thou art but thirty-nine, thou wert the largest ten year old humanoid I ever met or hope to meet!\"\n\"But what then are these benefits to those who neither delve nor smith?\" Mats persisted, ignoring his old friend. \"I would think that many would be terrified to live so close to such... formidable beings\" Mats spoke the last of this with a sly grin.\n\"Well, on the other hand, the presence of the 'formidable beings' means that they are certainly well-protected. And this area is surprisingly fertile, so the crops seem to be growing well, and although they provide the meat for us, we allocate one fifth of each herd to them for their own consumption. We've also been finding out what I have long suspected - the three sets of races, when combined, fight much more effectively than the sum of each when considered in isolation - that is, each race covers or cancels weaknesses of the others. At least it is certainly true that the local &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; population has been drastically reduced in a very short period of time.\"\n\"Aye,\" Edward responded, \"so Moraelyn proved in Morrowind.\"\n\"With a bit of help from his friends,\" Moraelyn acknowledged. \"I reap the praise, but in truth I'm little more than the standard they wave -- and at times I feel more like the target they set up!\"\nA wave of laughter greeted this remark. Edward persisted, \"With you and the others up here, Akatosh, I feel my borders are well guarded, should Skyrim ever feel the urge to move its borders west again.\"\nAliera asked: \"Was it easy to convince the other dragons to move to here?\"\n\"Actually, the most difficult part of that was moving our hoards to our new lairs\" Akatosh responded with a lazy smile, \"although once it was known that we had no use for the metals, gems and jewelry that we accumulate, everything went much more smoothly.\" But then more seriously: \"Essentially I had to approach each dragon personally, and convince them that this idea had merit. Again, once I had persuaded a couple of our especially independent specimens, things went much more smoothly. However, there are only nine of us living in this area and there is really only room for two or three more of us. We shall have to see what develops hereafter.\"\nAliera now observed: \"I think that now the gods and goddesses might look very favorably indeed on dragon behavior.\"\n\"That may be so, Aliera, but again that was not really why this was done. Besides, they still may remember and resent our long opposition to them.\"\nBeech asked deferentially \"But what is the name of this village?\"\nAkatosh sighed, and then responded \"I fear that we shall never reach a decision, since each race has decided opinions in that regard. Perhaps once the initial building phase is completed, we will able to be more contemplative about such matters.\"\nBeech replied \"That just doesn't seem right; everywhere should have a name, shouldn't it?\"\nWillow chuckled and then said \"Perhaps to us this is so, but who knows how dragons think; and I'm sure that the humans and elves will squabble over the style of the name, besides the specifics of it.\"\nMoraelyn interrupted with great drama, \"Surely you don't mean to imply that an elf can be overly stubborn!?\" and the discussion dissolved into a period of laughter and teasing amongst the group.\nPresently, Akatosh said, \"I favor the name '&lt;a href=\"Section%2022\"&gt;Section 22&lt;/a&gt;.'\"\nBeech stared at him, \"Akatosh, I see what thou dost mean about thy difficulties with the poetic. If you will allow my frank opinion? That is the single worst village name I have ever heard.\"\nAkatosh sighed gustily, then pardoned himself hastily to Beech - humanoids found dragon sighs quite unpleasant and sometimes actually hazardous. \"Then thou seest what I mean by differences. To me, it is very meaningful, and most appropriate. Is 'Section 16' any better as a name? Not? Then is it the word 'Section' that offends you? In what way is it inferior to 'Keep' or 'Reich' or 'Glen' or 'Hold'?\"\nEdward said, \"But Akatosh, a name should make some sense. At least humans think so. You should have 21 other sections first, if you're going to name this place '22'.\"\n\"Really?\" Akatosh said, \"Why is that? Are not all numbers equally valid? They serve well to distinguish one place from another. There could be many 'Greenvales' for instance. I myself know of four such villages. The number 'Twenty-two' does appeal to me...aesthetically, as well as possessing some 'sense' - at least to me,\" he smiled secretively.\nMoraelyn said, \"I think Lord Akatosh is enjoying what some call an 'in-joke'. Were I so rash as to instruct a dragon in manners.\"\n\"Who,\" &lt;a href=\"Silk\"&gt;Silk&lt;/a&gt; said, \"would e'er accuse Moraelyn of being rash?\"\nA bit later, Edward asked Akatosh: \"Do you think that we could play a game or two of Battle? I brought the board and playing pieces with me.\"\nMoraelyn interrupted \"I'm afraid that Akatosh and I must discuss some matters this evening - and you'd only lose again anyway\" he added with a fond smile.\nEdward replied \"But I can beat everyone else. Akatosh, will I ever win a game with you?\"\n\"No, Edward, you won't\", and Akatosh was slightly bemused by Edward's startled expression, and then the hearty laugh that quickly followed it.\n\"That wasn't very diplomatic of you, Akatosh. But why won't I ever win?\"\n\"Because I have been playing for much longer than you have Edward, and so long as I continue to play, you will not be able to catch up to me. Besides, this game is what I am starting to think of as a 'bounded problem', and that sort is most easily dealt with.\"\n\"What do you mean by 'a bounded problem', Akatosh?\" asked Mats.\n\"That is a problem that has a countable number of possible actions and results, Mats. There are only 81 squares on the board, and each side has exactly 27 playing pieces, each piece moves in a specific way, and so on.\"\n\"But the game is like a real battle, isn't it?\" asked Ssa'ass.\n\"No, it is very good practice for learning, and for thinking about how to execute a battle - but my Elven Archers never become tired or demoralized, and my Master Mage always does what I want. Such things seldom happen in a real battle.\"\nMoraelyn nodded in agreement, and asked with mock slyness \"Then what is an example of an unbounded problem?\"\n\"Certainly a real battle...but also, to me a poem is an unbounded problem\"\n\"But any poem can be analyzed, Akatosh\" Aliera said chidingly.\n\"Of course - but only after it is written. I am unable to define, or bound, the act of writing it, though...that is, the act of creating it. If I start to write a poem...there are so many possibilities\" and then wryly \"I never get beyond the first line, because I start imagining all the things that I could put into the beginning and...\""}

What do you think about that notion?\"\n\"I am not so certain that one can attribute anything to the gods, Edward. They are another example of an unbounded problem, of course, but also, their characteristics are just not very well known to us.\"\n\"But surely one can determine things about any being that is a god?\"\nAkatosh replied, \"I do not think that we can, at present; they are not like the Daedra, who have a nature that is with them at their birth. That is, the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; capabilities are inherent in them, and not are the result of any changes that have occurred to them.\"\nWillow interrupted: \"Akatosh, we can determine that the gods have a few basic characteristics, can't we?\"\nEdward added \"Of course, Akatosh - they are powerful beings who can perform acts that are incomprehensible to us. That in itself must signify their difference.\"\nAkatosh nodded and replied \"I understand your point of view, but to a farming community on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in our southern lands, that could also describe how they would perceive me. Perhaps this is attributable to the fact that they seldom see a dragon nowadays, but it also does not mean that I am a god ... neither does it mean that I am not a god.\"\nWillow giggled, and said \"Of course you're not a god, Akatosh\" and Edward, smiling, nodded agreement.\nAkatosh replied \"How do you know, &lt;a href=\"Willow\"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt;? I can understand that you would guess that I am not a god, particularly since I am a dragon.\" He grinned, and then continued \"But how can you know that I am not a god?\"\nEdward scoffingly replied \"Well, I know that I'm not a god anyway. And I've certainly never seen you perform any godly acts, Akatosh - you also don't seem to have any worshippers about either.\"\nThe Companions were smiling and generally agreeing with this, but Akatosh responded \"But that does not mean that I have no worshippers, nor does it mean that I cannot perform any godly acts - it just means that you have not seen either of these. I am not yet certain that gods and goddesses require worshippers to maintain their existence. And as I said, I can perform magic that would look like 'godly acts' to many Tamrielians.\"\n\"But the gods must have worshippers, Akatosh\" said &lt;a href=\"Aliera\"&gt;Aliera&lt;/a&gt;, \"That's how they get their ... sustenance, or whatever it is that allows them to continue ... to be godly. Husband, you must know more about this subject. After all, you made a god of your brother S'ephen.\"\n\"I did no such thing!\" Moraelyn responded, with a touch of indignation. \"His godhood is between him and his worshippers, among whom I am numbered. I did establish a temple cult in his memory. Anyone with the worldly means could do as much for anyone, living or dead. That alone is not enough. Maybe it helps -- facilitate matters, but I think it's not really necessary. I know no more of it, but if you want my opinion--\" he paused politely for confirmation that it was indeed still solicited, as elven etiquette demanded if one were giving opinion at length.\nHe continued. \"There must be something, well, godly, in the person's soul or essence or whatever part it is that does not die with the body. I know not whether that capacity is innate in the person, from birth or conception, or quickening ... whene'er it is that soul and body are wedded for a life span, or whether great deeds and great generosity might breed it, enlarging the soul and transmuting it, so to speak. We all change and grow with each passing day, with every breath, some more than others. What else is life about?\"\nHe went on without pausing for an answer to his rhetorical question, probably for fear that he might get one. \"In other cases, gods seem to arise from a locality, a mountain, or a spring, or wood, or a collection of localities, such as Tamriel itself. Places, like persons have souls, some greater than others. This place might produce a god or a daedra -- or maybe it already has one or more. As it changes, so do its gods and daedra, I think. Maybe they can choose to resist the change or aid it, if propitiated.\"\nHe looked at Akatosh inquiringly. The dragon had stopped fighting the new gods, he said, but would he go so far as to worship them? \"That speaks to the question of whence gods arise, but source is not nature: of that I know as little as the rest of you, maybe less, since the question does not truly interest me. The gods are; my worship of them benefits me and mine. It is sufficient.\"\nAkatosh did not respond immediately and Aliera refused to be distracted, \"But suppose such a cult were established and worshippers provided for one of small and mean spirit. Would that spirit not become a god?\"\n\"I suppose it might be done, if one were determined enough and had a sufficiency of means to pay worshippers to perform rituals without -- spirit -- behind them. Maybe that's where small, mean gods come from, wife. Or maybe daedra? Maybe I'll raise a cult to thee and see what happens.\"\n\"Are you calling my spirit small and mean?\" Ali glared at him.\n\"Only by comparison -- you don't fancy yourself a goddess, do you? You might make a daedra, though. The experiment might be a bit too chancy. Could I just mourn you for a century or two instead?\"\n\"Mm. I'll think on it. What about you? You've deeds enough already to qualify for godhood, surely ... although if you plan on many more such you may not outlive me.\"\n\"I'm doomed to be &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;R'Aathim&lt;/a&gt;, living and dead. It's godhood of a sort, but what a sort! Don't begrudge me my long life span. Think of me doomed to eternity in the gloomy &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; council chamber listening to the eternal wrangles ... small wonder the dead R'Aathim pulled the place down on the live ones twenty years ago, thus causing my brother and my mother to join their number. The dead R'Aathim must have welcomed the century and a half of respite while the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; held Ebonheart.\"\n\"But your brother &lt;a href=\"S%27ephen\"&gt;S'ephen&lt;/a&gt; was killed too, as well as your brother King Cruethys, and S'ephen wasn't R'Aathim, being your mother's son and not your father's, if I have the story straight -- that's why he got his own temple,\" Edward said. \"So why did they kill him, too? The story sounds very daedric to me.\"\n\"You'd have me justify the ways of the gods to you, would you? I think they act for ends we cannot see, and slay the just and the unjust together -- not that I'd label any of my Kin as either -- not altogether. We see only the means -- how can we judge? Gods too face choices; I do not think their power supreme. They can overrule nature on occasion, as can any Mage, yet they, like Mages, are in the end bound by it -- and their overrule must answer other rules still -- and in those rules, whate'er they be, I think lies the answer to your questions. I think it's not something men and women may know while living.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; smiled and replied \"It is not so easy to describe the gods, is it? This is true even though, myself included, each of us thinks that we have a mental picture of what godliness means. On the other hand, the gods and goddesses certainly do exist - and I also believe that there is a connection of some sort between them and the Daedra, and another connection between these entities and the power associated with performing magic.\"\n\"The priests of &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; have been calling this power '&lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;'\" said a stranger who had joined the group.\nAkatosh replied \"Greetings bard. Please allow me to introduce ... &lt;a href=\"Geoffrey\"&gt;Geoffrey&lt;/a&gt;, a ... wandering poet who has been visiting our village for these last few days.\" The Companions greeted the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;wood elf&lt;/a&gt; newcomer, some rising to their feet to do so according to their individual customs, and then all resumed sitting (actually sprawling about) and conversing.\n\"A number of priests are theorizing that the gods and goddesses live on another plane, as do the Daedra - there is some debate amongst these priests as to whether they share the same plane of existence, or whether each has their own. And some of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; priests are claiming that we can visit these alternate planes in our nightly dreams\" added Beech.\nEdward asked \"Why doesn't someone just ask a goddess or a Daedra about this?\"\nGeoffrey chuckled and replied \"Most of us are not able to be so thoughtful when confronted by one of these beings, Edward. Also, there is a common belief that the gods and Daedra are as reluctant to discuss their own natures as dragons are to reveal anyone's True Name.\"\nEdward looked quizzically at Akatosh, but Beech stated to Geoffrey \"Well said, &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;\" ... and that pair shared the slightest of smiles.\nBeech then said, \"Do you know what the &lt;a href=\"Resolution%20of%20Z%27en\"&gt;Resolutions of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; has been saying about the gods and magic? This magic power, or Magicka, is just the power generated by the existence of, well, existance itself. When it becomes focused by living beings through natural processes, then it becomes accessible to the gods and goddesses as worship power, which is the next level of Magicka. After receiving some from their worshippers, the gods can then concentrate it up to god-level power - the true &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;. The gods themselves can't generate the mid-level Magicka, since they are dependent on it for their own existence, but they can 'convert it' to Magicka, which can then be used by mortals to cast spells. This Magicka is usually dispersed widely across the planes but there are areas of greater and lesser concentration due to interferences with the dispersion process.\"\n\"When a goddess loses worshippers, her inflow of mid-level Magicka is decreased, so she in turn produces less god-level Magicka. With less Magicka under her control (for providing to worshippers, or dispersion), her influence is decreased in the mortal planes - of course the converse is also true. In the extreme, she receives nothing, and is relegated to a state of Stasis, barely existing from the ordinary Magicka generated by her few remaining Consecrated lands, zones of influence, and so on.\"\nBeech continued, \"On the other hand, Daedra receive very specific, or 'modified' mid-level Magicka from a few mortals with specific areas of interest, and these Daedra are normally tied to very specific circumstances. Because of their nature, they gain much more power from their small worship base, but the gods, with their much broader base, generally have greater overall power, even though the amount of concentrated worship that they receive from any one source is much less than a Daedra's. Most of the Magicka that the gods 'process' is dispersed into and throughout the universe, no longer under their control, thereby making it available for everyone. It's not really something they do consciously, but as a natural process that happens automatically - in other words ... just because they are divine.\"\nAliera said, \"I would think that Magicka is simply available to sentient beings, although the gods and Daedra could facilitate its usage. I would think that the gods and Daedra have other influences on us as well, because not everyone has spellcasting ability! Maybe in those 'alternate planes' it's actually existance, and not sentient entities, that radiates Magicka, just as the stars give off light in our dimension. I just assume that Magicka is 'out there' in the ether, or maybe sentient consciousnesses automatically tap into an alternate plane as they sleep. I think that everyone has some supply of Magicka, but most don't know how to use it very well, or else they adopt a way of life that inhibits or forbids its use. Maybe certain gods and Daedra serve as facilitators for the entire process; that is, both obtaining and using Magicka? But how do priests heal and cure and bless? Is Magicka involved at all or do they invoke their goddesses directly?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ssa%27ass\"&gt;Ssa'ass&lt;/a&gt; said, \"I am not ssssure that Magicka isss usssed; perhapss there isss yet another capability involved here. Thisss capability would be unknown at thisss time, and maybe even unsssenssssed... but I feel fairly certain that sssomehow it is a godly 'force' that they are employing.\"\nThen Geoffrey responded: \"Ssa'ass, I believe that Magicka fills the universe of planes. All things are infused with Magicka to one extent or another. In this regard Magicka is attracted to some people and things over others, and some people with talent or training can control and even release Magicka in new forms. There may be other sources of Magicka available by tapping into alternate and otherworldly planes. There is also the possibility of alternate planes that are entirely void of Magicka. Regardless, certain beings of great power, such as the gods and Daedra, can not only control Magicka, but can see, absorb, and transfuse Magicka to and from objects and people. By employing this ability, worshippers of these beings are sometimes capable of greater acts of Magic than they could accomplish otherwise. Also in this way, some items sacred to powerful beings can be said to be holy, with additional amounts of directed Magicka provided by gods or goddesses.\"\n\"Magic items fall into two main categories by definition. Items that draw on the surrounding Magicka to create spell-like effects, and items that hold Magicka in reserve for their own internal effects. Normally magic items which absorb Magicka, giving increased abilities to their wielders, only affect themselves and are considered to use internal Magicka. In some areas where great amounts of Magicka have been used, the surroundings may be completely devoid of it. This of course negates the ability of beings to produce magic effects in these areas, although gods and Daedra carry their own supplies of Magicka, as do magic items that do not depend on the use of surrounding Magicka.\"\nAliera said, \"We've been investigating some rumors and stories concerning something that might be called anti-Magicka. I think the presence of a powerful Daedra with whom you weren't in 'tune' could cause interference with spellcasting - maybe even cancel out existing spells. Perhaps particular Daedra simply favor thief or warrior types. Or some goddesses, and their priests, might frown on 'competing' magic in certain areas, for example in locations dedicated to them. So then unauthorized spells could interfere with their rituals.\"\nWillow asked, \"Can Daedra supply Magicka? And how about both a god and a Daedra being nearby? - wouldn't they sort of nullify each other's powers? This might be the cause of the anti-Magicka effect.\"\n\"I've experienced an anti-Magicka zone myself\" inserted Mith. \"It felt a lot like the effect of casting a spell like &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magicka\"&gt;Dispel Magicka&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, I thought that a truly powerful spellcaster could still effectively cast spells, but their resulting power would have been much reduced. I didn't get a chance to test this out though\" added Mith with a smile.\n\"We can also assume that certain powerful spells, creatures and even magic items might actually drain the surrounding area of Magicka,\" replied Geoffrey. \"This could be extended to places where great amounts of magic energy were once gathered and expended, for example in ancient temples where great spells were cast, or battlefields where powerful mages contested. Perhaps certain metals or stones could act as absorbers of Magicka, allowing for whole structures of anti-Magicka zones. If so, you might be able to wear a amulet made out of anti-Magicka material and gain a good advantage against spellcasters. Perhaps the purity of the material used would allow for better and better magic resistance\".\nAkatosh spoke: \"Dragons have long been interested in the anti-Magicka effect, naturally enough. We have found some amulets that appear to act as Magicka absorbers. They might contain something like Negative Magicka, in which case they would attract any 'stray' Magicka floating free in the local area. They are made of a stone, or mineral, resembling marble - it is very rare, but could be extracted, and shaped by skilled craftsmen. For example, I'm sure that the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; could have worked with this material. They might have made these amulets - or even that statue that I once saw ... it was taller than any of you humanoids. Regardless, in these mountains we have found deposits scattered throughout the halls and tunnels at random, sometimes deep within the walls. Consequently, one appears to go in and out of these anti-Magicka zones of varying intensities, with little or no warning. I have been imagining that this material works almost automatically; it seems to 'reflexively' absorb Magicka if given a chance to. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that they have been magically charged somehow - perhaps this happened long ago, but the charge has somehow remained.\"\nMoraelyn asked, \"Would the amulet affect its wearer, or would he be immune?\"\n\"Maybe a blocking spell could be developed, and then cast, to shield the wearer from the effects of the substance.\"\nMoraelyn then asked, \"But Akatosh, getting back to our earlier discussions - what do you think of the speculations concerning the connections between the gods and goddesses, Daedra and Magicka?\"\nAkatosh replied, \"I think that there are many truths that we do not know, and perhaps there are some truths that we are not meant to know.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; asked with a smile, \"All right then, I've always wanted to know this - considering the shape of your mouth and teeth, how do dragons manage to speak the humanoid languages so clearly?\"\nAkatosh paused, and then carefully responded, \"Why, in much the same way that we can fly, even though our wings are not naturally strong enough to support such heavy torsos.\"\n\"Speaking of dragon flight and sunsets...\" Mith said, rising to his feet and squinting into the red-gold eastern sky, \"We have a vistor, Dragon Lord. That's not a bird.\"\nAkatosh's head came up and he too scanned the sky. Tension grew in him, and one by one the Companions rose, watching as the distant dot grew nearer and resolved itself into the largest dragon they'd seen yet.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Ma-Tylda\"&gt;Ma-Tylda&lt;/a&gt;!\" Akatosh exclaimed, \"She deigns to bestow her presence on us!\" His wings lifted and unfurled, and the Companions broke and ran for cover as he took flight. The two dragons wheeled through the sky, spouting great gouts of flame against the purpling sky.\n\"They're fighting,\" Edward cried, \"what does it mean. Who is Ma-Tylda?\"\n\"I don't know who she is, son,\" Moraelyn replied, \"but they do not fight. You behold a dragon greeting ceremony.\" The pair alit beyond a rock outcropping out of sight.\n\"Should we go greet the stranger, too?\" Edward asked.\n\"Nay,\" Mith said. \"They'll let us know if our presence is wanted -- look, even the other dragons stay away.\" It was true. Dragon heads had poked from the caverns to witness the event, but none of them had taken wing, and now they were retreating to their hoards within.\nThe Companions ambled back into the meadow together and built a fire as a chill wind had sprung up. The elves sang an evening hymn to the stars, deftly weaving the dark elf version with the wood elf form. Aliera added her voice to theirs, but Mats and Edward and Silk and Ssa'ass sat listening silently. They couldn't manage elven music of this kind. Geoffrey had a particularly clear sweet voice, Edward thought.\nAkatosh returned presently, smiling in satisfaction. \"Ma-Tylda's going to join us here, at least for awhile,\" he said. He was actually glowing in the dusk, each scale giving off a golden radiance.\n\"Is she your queen?\" Edward asked, feeling very small and human.\n\"She -- just is. Maybe she'll want to meet you all some day. I hope so. Until then, well, I don't talk about other dragons, you know.\"\nTo which Edward blinked in surprise and then surmise, and the discussion dissolved into jokes and songs for the remainder of that clear and beautiful evening."}

He ruled over the city of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; when it was a vassal-state of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and later went on to found &lt;a href=\"Bisnensel\"&gt;Bisnensel&lt;/a&gt; and win the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;. He was deposed after a conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Seekers\"&gt;Primeval Seekers&lt;/a&gt;, a Hermaeus Mora cult. He and his family fled to &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, where he begged refuge of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt;. He was captured by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; shortly after Meridia pushed &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was the last known surviving member of his race, which he explains is possible due to &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia's&lt;/a&gt; blessings and Coldharbour's time-warping nature. He can initially be found in the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Oubliette\"&gt;Lightless Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;, a tower which he was imprisoned in by Molag Bal. After being freed, Dynar takes command of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and plays a key role in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Main questline&lt;/a&gt;. Dynar dies in the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Light\"&gt;Chapel of Light&lt;/a&gt; of wounds received near the end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Assault\"&gt;The Final Assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nStruggles of the Late Ayleid Period.\nLaloriaran Dynar was born in the Ayleid city state of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt;, located in the bays of the Niben, at the mouth of the Silverfish River. His father was personally humiliated by &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; herself after the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Rebellion's&lt;/a&gt; success. By the time Dynar donned the Crown of Nenalata, the city had gone through rough and dark times, having been forced to abandon slavery, to worship the Divines and to become a vassal state to the First Empire to survive. There was a sense of impending doom surrounding Nenalata.\nAlessian Order, Ayleid Disorder.\nThe Alessian Order, a monotheistic cult centered on the teachings of the Imga &lt;a href=\"Maruhk\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; and the worship of Akatosh forcefully took over the First Empire in 1E 332, imposing a cruel theocracy. Although Dynar swore loyalty to the new Emperor, the Alessians' hatred of Elves, especially the Ayleids, led to terrible amounts of death and destruction. By 1E 371, Nenalata was the only surviving Ayleid city state.\nTears for Lost Nenalata.\nIn 1E 372, the Emperor sent an ultimatum to Dynar, presumably ordering him to leave Cyrodill or be killed. This caused a split in the city's population, dividing themselves between those who wanted to stay in the City, known by Dynar as the Intransigents, and those who wanted to stay by his side. Dynar and his followers left the Imperial Province on a dangerous trek, beset by the hateful Alessians and bands of Goblins. By 1E 374, Nenalata was razed by the Order's armies, and all of the Intransigents were massacred.\nRefugees on the Bjoulsae.\nDynar and the surviving Nenalatans found refuge under the wings of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock. After displacing the Orcs that lived on the Bjoulsae River's bays, the Nenalatans founded a new city, made in the image of their old home: &lt;a href=\"Bisnensel\"&gt;Bisnensel-By-The-Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Once they had a new home, Dynar and his alliance with the Direnni ensured a friendly relationship with the native Bretons and Orcs. Dynar was worried and horrified by the Reforms and the crimes against Merkind committed by the Order in Cyrodiil.\nMenace of the Primeval Seekers.\nAlas, Dynar's happiness was not to last. In 1E 453, the &lt;a href=\"Primeval%20Seekers\"&gt;Primeval Seekers&lt;/a&gt;, a cult dedicated to the worship of Hermaeus Mora, Daedric Prince of Knowledge slowly and certainly took over Bisnensel, culminating in a coup led by their leader, Uluscant. Dynar and his family were forced to flee to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt; in 1E 460.\nSanctuary Among the Direnni.\nIn Balfiera, Dynar became a close friend of Prince Aiden Direnni and his cousins, Ryain and Raven. Somewhere between 1E 461 and 1E 477, the Kingdom of Skyrim declared war on the Hegemony. During a vital battle in 1E 477, Dynar found his true calling and proved his worth as a master tactician and strategist, inflicting a humilliating defeat to the Nord forces, led by Hoag Merkiller.\nApproach of the Alessian Horde.\nIn 1E 478, due to a combination of the Thrassian Plague and the defeat of Emperor Gorieus' forces at the hands of Rislav Larich The Righteous, and the secession of Western Cyrodill, the Order was severely weakened. Inspired by Rislav, Aiden's forces wiped out most of the Alessianists in High Rock, and stopped the Order's attempts to bring the Bretons to their side. This actions incensed Gorieus in such a way he invaded High Rock, and his hordes laid waste to the city of Craglorn in 1E 479, which was an Ayleid city at the time.\nThe Mustering of High Rock.\nin 1E 480, Dynar sent an envoy to the Vassal Kings of the Bretons, asking for their aid against the Alessians. The Kings accepted, with one condition: Men would be equals with Mer in the Hegemony. Aiden Direnni reluctantly accepted, and signed the Rights Charter. In a single year, much of the province's farmers were conscripted into the army. By 1E 481, the Order's hordes, led by Faolchu the Changeling reached the Glenumbra region, committing horrible atrocities against both Man and Mer.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;The Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1E 482, the largest battle of High Rock's history occurred. With the help of Dynar's tactics, and their alliance with the armies of High Rock and Skyrim, the Direnni forces lured Faolchu's legion into a trap, and a group of hidden knights killed him. And the fathers of modern Conjuration, Corvus and Calani Direnni summoned terrible creatures upon the Alessian armies, slaughtering them. The demoralized Order forces were routed from High Rock, and their defeat marked the beginning of the downfall of the First Empire, and the rebirth of the Kingdom of Skyrim, by the hands of Ysmir Wulfharth, Hoag's successor.\nReturn to Nenalata.\nAiden's armies pursued the fleeing Alessians all the way to Craglorn, where the survivors were completely wiped out. Two years later, in 1E 484, Once the threat of the Alessian Order was finally over, Dynar was lured back to Cyrodill by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. On his way back to Nenalata, and while he made a stop at the city of &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where both Men and Mer lived in peace, Molag sprung his trap.\nDelodiil was besieged by the minions of\u00a0Molag Bal, who poured out of portals from\u00a0Coldharbour. While everyone outside the gates were slain, those inside managed to hold the city. It soon became clear that the forces of Molag Bal were too great, and that the city would eventually fall. However, Meridia saw an opportunity to both save Delodiil and fight back. Using the portals Molag Bal had opened, she transported the entire city, with all its inhabitants, into Coldharbour. Unfortunately, due to the enchantments protecting Coldharbour, the inhabitants of the city were scattered all across the realm. Dynar was quickly captured, and was imprisoned inside Coldharbour's equivalent to White-Gold Tower, the Lightless Oubliette, where he remained for millennia.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Step%20Back%20in%20Time\"&gt;A Step Back in Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alana%20Relin%20%28Ghost%29\"&gt;Alana Relin&lt;/a&gt; has led the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to a crypt that will provide a doorway to the past. After using &lt;a href=\"Time%20Travel\"&gt;Time Travel&lt;/a&gt; to see visions back into the Battle of Glenumbra Moors in order to learn how &lt;a href=\"Faolchu\"&gt;Faolchu&lt;/a&gt; was originally killed, Dynar must be spoken to.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Hollow%20City%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"The%20Groundskeeper\"&gt;The Groundskeeper&lt;/a&gt; is walking you through the history of the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;, a brief vision of Laloriaran Dynar is seen.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%27s%20Embrace\"&gt;Shadow's Embrace&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"An%20Unusual%20Circumstance\"&gt;Unusual Circumstance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being guided to the entrance of the Lightless Oubliette by either &lt;a href=\"Faraniel\"&gt;Faraniel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tzik%27nith\"&gt;Tzik'nith&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Projection%20of%20King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;projection&lt;/a&gt; of Dynar can be seen. He will greet you, saying, \"The promised one has finally arrived. The Light of Meridia is yours to claim. With it, you can finally set me free.\"\nAfter obtaining the crystal from the tree, he will say, \"Excellent! Bring the crystal with you. You will need it to free me from my bonds.\" After speaking to him, the quest will be completed, and the quest to free him begins.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%20from%20the%20Darkness\"&gt;Light from the Darkness&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Light of Meridia is obtained, Dynar will task you with retrieving the Lifeshadow, Mindshadow, and Flameshadow crystals from certain parts of the oubliette. After the crystals are placed in their displays, he asks you to enter the Lightless Cell.\nAfter entering the cell, Dynar will give you the following instructions:\n\"You have done well to make it this far, but there is still more to do to set me free.\"\n\"My body is imprisoned within a pillar of darkness, generated by ebon shards to each side.\"\n\"Place a Light of Meridia in both sconces. Each will create a beam of light that will strike a nearby crystal.\"\n\"By rotating the crystals, you can change a beam's direction. You may need to rotate a crystal multiple times to connect the beams and form a path of light to the ebon shards.\"\n\"Adjust the crystals until the beams of light destroy the ebon shards. Then the pillar of darkness will collapse and I shall be free.\"\nOnce he is freed, he will open a portal and head back to the Hollow City.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;The Army of Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Groundskeeper tasks you with rescuing Dynar from the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Oubliette\"&gt;Lightless Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;. She recommends bringing him to the Hollow City before &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Dynar has been brought back to the city, he will take command of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter speaking to him, he will remark that he was instilling the soldiers with confidence, and that to trust someone they never met would be foolish. He advises you to continue to gather troops.\nOnce Vanus Galerion and a certain number of allies are rescued, the Groundskeeper asks you to meet with them and Dynar within the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. With your permission, Dynar will begin the Council of War, discussing the further steps to take to stop the &lt;a href=\"Planar%20Vortex\"&gt;Planar Vortex&lt;/a&gt;.\nDynar will than request you lead the assault, and reward you with an amulet called \"Ayleid's Hope.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Crossing%20the%20Chasm\"&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/a&gt;.\nLaloriaran Dynar tasks you with rendezvousing with &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt; and assaulting &lt;a href=\"the%20Chasm\"&gt;the Chasm&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Citadel%20Must%20Fall\"&gt;The Citadel Must Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter going across the bridge of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reaver%20Citadel\"&gt;The Reaver Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Dynar will say, \"Ah, the champion has arrived! Just on time, as always.\" He will task you with finding an alternate route into the Citadel, and will answer questions you may have.\nHe will later be found in the Fighters Guildhall once the barrier is broken, and tasks you with assisting the Mages Guild opening a portal to their guild hall, by finding the four portal stones. Later on, he will be in front of the\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Assault\"&gt;The Final Assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nDynar can be asked to come along with you through the portal, though he will not accept as he must oversee the forces. Once you have chosen your partner (Cadwell, &lt;a href=\"Skordo%20the%20Knife\"&gt;Skordo the Knife&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt;) he will give the following briefing:\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Our forces are gathered and the time has come to strike fast and strike hard. Time is not on our side, so we must make every moment count.\"\n\"Troops are already inside, fighting and holding ground, causing a distraction so that you can deal with Molag Bal's ability to call reinforcements.\"\nCadwell is chosen: \"For the initial assault, Cadwell will assist you. Don't be fooled by his bizarre antics, for his heart is full of courage and honor.\"\nSkordo is chosen: \"Skordo the Knife, pride of the Fighters Guild, will aid you in your initial assault. Let his strength sweep away your foes and keep you safe.\"\nDarien is chosen: \"\n\"Close the reinforcement portal. That is your first priority. &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle&lt;/a&gt; and her forces will join you then for the push to the Labyrinth. Once the Labyrinth is opened, you must make your way through Molag Bal's personal sanctum and find the portal to the planar vortex. That is your ultimate objective. If we are to end the Planemeld, we must disrupt the planar vortex and cease its destructive storm. Take your brave companion and venture forth! Close the reinforcement portal so that our forces can wage war on the Daedric Prince. Then open the Labyrinth and lead us to the planar vortex. Our destiny is in your hands!\"\"\nConversations.\nAt the Fighters Guild:\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Attend me, soldiers!

The &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; do not tolerate desertion. A fitting end for my transgressions, I suppose.\nIf you know of the Mythic Dawn, you may have heard that the cult was eradicated long ago, after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;3rd era&lt;/a&gt; came to an end. This was true until perhaps one year past.\nAs discord began to sow in the lands of Skyrim, the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; made their way to the ears and mind of a fervent worshipper named Vonos. These whispers led him deep underground to an ancient Mythic Dawn temple, long since collapsed, where rumors spoke of an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gates\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;, lying in ruin for centuries.\nVonos soon made a pact with Mehrunes Dagon, and began to quietly reform the Mythic Dawn as its new leader. He began to cultivate more members to the cause, and I myself fell victim to the promise of such power.\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis, the gates throughout Skyrim were buried deep within the lands. However, with much effort, we retrieved many of the pieces, and successfully rebuilt an Oblivion Gate.\nVonos, a master of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, has been working tirelessly to open the gate and give Mehrunes Dagon's troops a doorway into Tamriel.\nAs dictated by the pact, the cleansing of the Oblivion Gate required a personal blood sacrifice from each of us to prove our devotion. Blinded by ambition, I offered up my own brother, Sune. A simple farmer who could not harm a Dartwing.\nWatching the knife penetrate his body sent shock and horror through my very being. The blood that spilled from his loins was that of my blood. In that moment I realized what I had done. It was not power that bewitched me, but deceit.\nAs an Acolyte, I was not privy to much information, but I know that Vonos is searching for a powerful, ancient artifact that is necessary to open the gate. What that artifact might be, I do not know. I heard something about an excavation camp to the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, near a mountain pass. Perhaps more information can be found there.\nLastly, in order to keep its location secret, all but the highest priests in the order are blindfolded when taken to and from the Oblivion Gate, so I have no further information on its whereabouts. I only know it was a cave. I wish I could tell you more.\nI've been on the run day and night, and now the &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigil of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; are also on my trail. I can only imagine what they might do to someone like me, so I come to you with my &lt;a href=\"Stranger%27s%20Plea\"&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt;, someone who might better understand my plight.\nPlease stop the Mythic Dawn however you can. For myself, my forsaken brother, and for Tamriel.\n-Skorvild"}

They cough very often, and they have a very short life.

In addition, they served as messengers between &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt; and Mere-Glim.\nThe kitchens finally discovered that the skraws were responsible for the sabotage. &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Lord Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; ordered Anna\u00efg to kill Mere-Glim, and the skraws were hardly punished. They were planned to be replaced by Argonian shaped Umbrielians, who would be able to breathe underwater and dive faster.\nAfter the Ingenium was destroyed and Umbriel returned to the Oblivion plane of the Hist, the skraws and other Umbrielians left the flying city to find their livings in the lush world around them."}

Skuldafn holds the only gateway to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, which is the Nordic afterlife. When Skuldafn was under the occupation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;, it was governed by &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSkuldafn is situated deep within the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, making it highly inaccessible from the rest of Skyrim. During the Second Era, there was a passage that led to Skuldafn near &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, though it is currently unavailable. Skuldafn is a large temple with a Dragon Mound on the outskirts. Inside the Mound is the hidden passage. Across it is the temple, with several levels. Throughout the temple are large towers and the typical Nordic arches. Aqueducts run over the streets. The tombs eventually led to the top level that overlooks the entire Skuldafn valley. The top of Skuldafn is a large courtyard that has a large pit. This pit leads into Sovngarde, but only &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Staff%20%28Wall%20of%20Lightning%29\"&gt;Nahkriin's Staff&lt;/a&gt; can activate it.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Orcthane&lt;/a&gt; waged civil war with the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Brigade\"&gt;Stormfist Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. Fildgor fled to Skuldafn to seek out his deceased sister so that the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Freydis\"&gt;Crown of Freydis&lt;/a&gt; would recognize him as the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. He would retrieve the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt; by trespassing into &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. The Ebonheart Pact followed suit, encountering the Stormfist at Sovngarde. Using the hidden passage, the Ebonheart Pact had entered Skuldafn. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Mera%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Thane Mera Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Pact had burned the Stormfist's stockpile, weakening their forces. The Agent had light the signal fires, prompting the Pact to attack the Stormfist. Once Fildgor entered Sovngarde, the Agent followed him and defeated him before he could reach the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. The Agent decided his fate. After the battle, the leaders of the Pact convened at Skuldafn for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt;. The Nords offered the Crown of Freydis, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; offered the &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20of%20Veloth\"&gt;Judgment of Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; offered the &lt;a href=\"Mnemic%20Egg\"&gt;Mnemic Egg&lt;/a&gt;. After that, the Pact had been officially set in stone.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; the World-Eater had returned, as foretold in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. After a decisive battle at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, Alduin escaped into Skuldafn so that he could enter Sovngarde and eat the endless souls that inhabit the land. Once the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; had captured his esteemed general, &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt;, they traveled to Skuldafn to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. As the Dragonborn traversed Skuldafn, they encountered &lt;a href=\"Nahkriin\"&gt;Nahkriin&lt;/a&gt;. They defeated the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; and entered Sovngarde, following suit. It was there the Last Dragonborn defeated Alduin and saved Tamriel from his wrath."}

The quest is the last of the Oracle's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult%20Quests\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;. The quest involves tracking down another legendary magical item, the enchanted warhammer &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Crusher%20%28Morrowind%20Weapon%29\"&gt;Skull Crusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Oracle, Lalatia Varian, at Ebonheart's Imperial Cult chapel, has been granted a vision by the god &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; of the artifact Skull Crusher. She needs someone to solve the mystery of her vision and recover this enchanted warhammer. In her vision she was shown Hilbongard's forge at the heart of a Daedric ruin. She advises seeking out a Dunmer Savant and a Dunmer Scout to question them about the \"Halls of the Dead\" and \"sealed Daedric ruin.\"\nSeek out Llaalam Dredil, a Dunmer Savant, next door within Ebonheart Grand Council Chamber. Speaking with him about the \"Halls of the Dead\" reveals that it may refer to a Dunmer ancestral tomb as it translates to 'cardruhn. Next, travel to Vivec, Hlaalu Canton and speak with Arvama Rathri within the Elven Nations Cornerclub, &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Plaza\"&gt;Hlaalu Plaza&lt;/a&gt;. She believes the \"sealed Daedric ruin\" may refer to Anudnabia, which lies near Sadrith Mora.\nUse the guildguide's services in the Vivec Mage's Guild, travel to Wolverine Hall. From there travel north along the eastern coast of Sladrith Mora to reach the Daedric ruins of Anudnabia. Nothing marks these ruins as Anudnabia, as the doorway is blocked by collapsed stones. Directly to the east of the ruins across a narrow band of water lies the entrance to an ancestral tomb. Cross over the water to Omaren Ancestral Tomb.\nTravel through the tomb to find a broken section of wall. The tunnel leads to a large cavern. On the northwestern side of the cavern, Daedric construction is visible. There are two levels; the door leading to Forgotten Vaults of Anudnabia, Forge of Hilbongard is on the top level. There is a chest on the bottom level which contains an Ancient daedric Key.\nThe Forgotten Vaults of Anudnabia, Forge of Hilbongard is a section of Daedric construction within a large cavern. The actual forge dominates the final chamber filling the center of the room. Magically floating in the middle of the forge is a chest (lock 80, trapped), which can be opened with the Ancient daedric Key. The warhammer Skull Crusher is inside.\nReturn to Lalatia Varian. She says that she can detect no evil curse on the weapon and that it is safe. She also provides an enchanted ring, &lt;a href=\"Foe-Grinder\"&gt;Foe-Grinder&lt;/a&gt;, as a reward."}

This is not counted as an aggressive action, thus targets do not become hostile. Five dreams are received from each person.\nThe &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to harvest dreams due to the large number of sleeping members and the ease of access. The same is true for &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20Living%20Quarters\"&gt;Jorrvaskr Living Quarters&lt;/a&gt;. Sleeping &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; are also a good source of dreams, as most burial chambers have a number of draugr lining the walls.\nAnother effective location for harvesting dreams are soldier barracks in a &lt;a href=\"hold\"&gt;hold&lt;/a&gt; capital, as there are often guards (usually 3\u20134) sleeping inside. When dreams are collected or used in an attack, the number of dreams in the staff will be shown.\n&lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Inns&lt;/a&gt;, specifically\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, are also good places for harvesting dreams.\n&lt;a href=\"Haelga%27s%20Bunkhouse\"&gt;Haelga's Bunkhouse&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; has many workers and merchants of Riften who sleep there.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul gems&lt;/a&gt; are still needed to charge the weapon.\nUsefulness.\nThe Skull of Corruption can damage multiple targets at once.

Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt; is useful with the staff, pickpocket perks, and killing enemies in such a fashion due to the sneak bonus and ability to feed prior to harvesting a dream charge and killing the target.

Its purpose was to record the accumulated dragonlore and prophecy that the Akaviri Dragonguard possessed at the time. Given that Alduin's return was inevitable, they believed that this was their gift to those who came after them.\nCraftsmen from temples across the Empire were called upon to work on the wall, and after six years it was completed. Emperor Reman II visited the temple to officially dedicate the wall. The Blood Seal outside the temple was consecrated in the presence of all the Akaviri Dragonguard of Skyrim. This allowed the temple to be sealed, only ever to be opened by a Dragonborn. As time went by and the Dragonguard fell into obscurity, the temple fell into a state of disrepair.\nArchitectural design.\nUpon arrival, the temple is dark and decrepit with only a few bare furnishings. Sections within the temple include a dining area, an armory and sleeping quarters.\nAlduin's Wall.\nA large mural called Alduin's Wall dominates the central chamber. This wall, built by the ancient Blades, prophesied several key events in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. The prophecy that is foretold through Alduin's Wall is seen in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bookshelves next to Alduin's Wall have many unique and interesting volumes on both dragons and the Blades.\nCourtyard.\nThe courtyard can be accessed from within the temple. The courtyard itself is fairly sparse, with several trees and some practice dummies used for training."}

A feat of Nedic engineering, Skyreach was the height of Nedic civilizations, where the now extinct people have achieved several concepts such as the &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSkyreach was one of the largest cities in the continent of Tamriel, taking a large portion of the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Craglorn\"&gt;Upper Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; region. Skyreach is situated in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, through and beneath it. The outside of Skyreach shows ruined bridges that tower over the lower basin, as well as towers that pierce the skyline. The city is left largely in ruins, but several buildings remained intact throughout the eras. In the center of the Skyreach Basin is the &lt;a href=\"Skyreach%20Hold\"&gt;Skyreach Hold&lt;/a&gt;, a tower that was once thought to be the private estate of &lt;a href=\"Durac\"&gt;Durac&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of the Nedes. The northern end houses the &lt;a href=\"Loth%27Na%20Caverns\"&gt;Loth'Na Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, which contains the Skyreach Temple, where the Nedic-folk worshipped the Celestials. The temple was mainly left in ruins, leaving it inaccessible. To the west is the &lt;a href=\"Skyreach%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Skyreach Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, which served as a prison for the Celestial experiments that the Nedes had created. Various creatures not seen throughout Tamriel can be found within the tower. To the southwest is the &lt;a href=\"Skyreach%20Catacombs\"&gt;Skyreach Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, which is used as a burial ground for the residents of Skyreach, both rich and poor. The layout of the former Skyreach City is unknown, but based on the location of the five mentioned areas, the layout can be speculated.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot much is known about the history of Skyreach, but there have been several theories proposed by the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt;. During the incoming &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; invasion, the city-state of Skyreach was ruled by High King Durac, who has little information to his name. The Ra Gada invasion did not consist of one massive wave of warriors, but several waves, that hail from different parts of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra\"&gt;Anka-Ra&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Tarish-Zi\"&gt;Tarish-Zi&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the region of Craglorn, dispelling the local natives, which included the Nedic people. The Skyreach Hold is said to have been used as a haven for the Nedes when the Anka-Ra attacked, while other theories imply that the tower served as a home for the High King, which would have been Durac at the time. Throughout the ruins of Skyreach are various depictions of &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Malazar the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, who is better known as the Serpent, represented through the Serpent constellation. Nedic religion revolves around the constellations, and so they have taken several feats to make their gods a reality. The Skyreach Catacombs were utilized by the Nedes as a burial tomb for the people of Skyreach, regardless of social classes. It was here that several figures had been buried, including High King Durac and &lt;a href=\"Virmaril\"&gt;Virmaril&lt;/a&gt;, his advisor.\nThe Nedic scholars of Skyreach have worshipped the Constellations for years. They took it upon themselves to create their own &lt;a href=\"Celestial\"&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures of the cosmos. The &lt;a href=\"Star-Gazers\"&gt;Star-Gazers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Belkarth\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt; have studied the Celestials from their observatory and continue to do so throughout the eras. Taking various normal creatures such as the common &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt; or the mighty &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;, and giving them immense power that the Celestials possess. Because of this, the Skyreach Pinnacle was used as a prison for the Celestials that were too dangerous and unstable. One of their most severe experiments was &lt;a href=\"Aetherion\"&gt;Aetherion&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt;, embedded with the powers of the Celestials, making it a serious threat. To keep them from wreaking havoc, the Nedes imprisoned them with a celestial ward. The exact purpose to create these pseudo-Celestials is unknown, whether it was for the Yokudan invasion or it was just mindless experiments, regardless, they were sealed away.\nThe Skyreach Catacombs was the site of a summit between various Kings in Nedic-society in Craglorn, by the call of Virmaril, who told them that he had a plan for the invading Yokudan force. The Nedic Kings of Craglorn gathered here, which includes &lt;a href=\"Kestic\"&gt;Kestic&lt;/a&gt;, the Forest King, among other kings such as the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20King\"&gt;Sun King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20King\"&gt;Shadow King&lt;/a&gt;. For years, Virmaril was the personal advisor of High King Durac but was given the short stick throughout his reign. Not only was he denied the hand of his daughter, but she was given to Kestic of the forest region. Virmaril used the Ra Gada as an opportunity to bring the Nedic Kings together, to create an undead army with the millions of corpses in Skyreach Catacombs. Virmaril would then turn himself into a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, as a way to become immortal. However, the Elven Lich would be imprisoned within the Skyreach Catacombs by Elite Nedic Warriors who utilized &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Magic\"&gt;Soul Magic&lt;/a&gt; created by the Nedes. Virmaril's exploits would later become a legend throughout Craglorn, and he would be dubbed Virmaril the Betrayer. Skyreach would later become besieged by the Anka-Ra as Tarish-Zi advanced all throughout Craglorn.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; had revealed themselves with the intent of excavating &lt;a href=\"Nirncrux\"&gt;Nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; and using it as a drug. The purpose was to enhance their militia in the name of &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. The Skyreach ruins had become a large focal point for the Scaled Court, prompting them to uncover the ruins. The Scaled Courts took an interest in both the Skyreach Hold and the Skyreach Pinnacle. Believing that a large source of Nirncrux is found in the Hold, &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Arnoth\"&gt;Exarch Arnoth&lt;/a&gt; inhabited the ruins. Arnoth and the Scaled Court were tasked by &lt;a href=\"Regent%20Cassipia\"&gt;Regent Cassipia&lt;/a&gt; to test the Nirncrux for the Scaled Court. During his stay, Arnoth injected himself with Nirncrux, increasing his power tenfold. He began to grow power hungry, creating his own army to battle Cassipia's forces. Fortunately, Exarch Arnoth and his group of warriors were defeated by a group of adventurers which were led by a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious warrior&lt;/a&gt;. Even though Exarch Arnoth's plans were foiled at Skyreach Hold, the Scaled Court remained in Skyreach.\nAcross the valley is the Skyreach Pinnacle, which was used as a prison for celestial creatures. The Scaled Court had tempered the celestial ward, causing it to break and letting the prisoners roam free. The Celestial creatures murdered scholars of the Scaled Court. One of the few remaining scholars was &lt;a href=\"Mederic%20Vyger\"&gt;Mederic Vyger&lt;/a&gt;, who denounced his position the Scaled Court, though, at that point, he was stranded in Skyreach. Fortunately for him, a group of adventurers had arrived on the scene and offered their help to Vyger. The adventurers fought through waves of Celestial creatures until they reached the fell beast, the Celestial Titan named &lt;a href=\"Aetherion\"&gt;Aetherion&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Aetherion was defeated, and the prisoners were secured. Mederic Vyger was able to entrap the creatures in the Pinnacle, though it was not enough. It is unknown whether the ward was sealed entirely, nor is known about Vyger's fate.\nAround the same time, the Nedes were resurrected, prompted action to be taken by the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;, the knightly order of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Temple of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Dalamar\"&gt;Crusader Dalamar&lt;/a&gt; made the journey himself to the Skyreach Catacombs, to quell the situation, though it was too much to handle. Dalamar called upon the help of a group of adventurers, who traversed the ruins of the Catacombs, defeating the undead as they moved. The Catacomb Inner Sanctum was sealed; the adventurers were forced to face obstacles blocking it. The Council of Nedic Kings and &lt;a href=\"Gravelord\"&gt;Gravelord&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus\"&gt;Bone Colossus&lt;/a&gt; were these obstacles. Of the Nedic Kings was High King Durac and Kestic the Forest King. In the Inner Sanctum, the adventurers faced the three Nedic warriors that sealed away Virmaril. The way to Virmaril's chamber was open, and the group encountered the Lich known as Virmaril. In the end, Virmaril the Betrayer was defeated, and the souls of the forsaken Nedes ascended to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. Crusader Dalamar remained at the Catacombs, to ensure no further disturbances to the Catacombs. It is unknown whether the Crusaders continued to safeguard the area."}

He's currently resting at the base camp with a cup of hot juniper tea. He reluctantly agreed to allow me to explore the pinnacle ruins without him, as we can't afford to waste time waiting for his ankle to heal to complete our examination of the Skyreach complex.\nHere I am, inside the highest accessible point within the Skyreach ruins. A long, winding corridor leads deeper into the structure, though I have yet to see any evidence that would allow me to formulate a theory about the purpose of this place. I do have the unnerving feeling that I'm not alone in here. Well, in addition to my guards and research assistants. I wonder if it has something to do with the faces staring out from the carvings in the pillars and walls?\nAnyway, the corridor into the ruins appears to have seen damage in the past. Parts of the walls have fallen away, and sections of the approach appear to consist of natural cave instead of worked stone. Perhaps an earthquake caused the damage and even opened natural passages through the ruins? And it still feels as though I could turn around and look into the face of an ancient Nede\u2014or something even stranger\u2014at any moment.\nAs I reached the end of the corridor and it opened into a vast, finished chamber, I wondered whether or not the passage I entered the ruins by was ever meant as an original accessway. It appeared to bisect the main chamber almost as an afterthought, as though someone or something dug their way into this section of the ruins at some point after the fall of Skyreach and I was now following the path of previous explorers or tomb robbers.\nI need to think about that a bit before I write any additional comments."}

(I love how he hates that I have a more friendly and exciting writing style than he does! Smashing!)\nI'm coming more and more to the certainty that the Nedes possessed an advanced society. Perhaps even more advanced than our own in certain ways. The engineering skills that were required to construct these massive spaces within the mountain are almost too much to fathom. I'm not sure if our best engineers and crafters wouldn't be hard-pressed to duplicate the effort. The intricate gardens, the vaulted ceilings, the ingenious waterways and fountains\u2014it all points to a level of sophistication and aesthetic that rivals or exceeds the best Cyrodiil has to offer.\nI think that the overall skill and craftsmanship demonstrated in the stonework that surrounds us clearly shows that the Nedes were much more than war-loving savages. I'm sorry, Reginus, but I have to record it as I see it. The architecture demonstrates that they treated stonework and masonry as an art form. The carvings are more than simple decoration. They tell a story of a proud and powerful people, of a culture reaching for the stars that was then cut short by jealous invaders. Even in ruins, there is a grandeur here that leaves me breathless.\nEven more impressive are the spaces that are open to the sky. These open ceilings let in fresh air and sunshine, and were perfect for observing the night sky\u2014a practice we know the Nedes were fond of thanks to ancient texts and tablets such as the Perenaal Fragment and others. I believe that the Nedic obsession with the stars isn't simply because they worshipped or had some other deep connection to the Celestials. I believe that the Nedes were somehow involved in the very creation of the whole concept of the Celestials. I plan to find proof of this during our explorations of this space and the neighboring ruins.\nOf course, Reginus strongly disagrees with my proposition. He even demands that I return the quill to him. Historian, indeed! He wouldn't know a fact from a fantasy if it walked up and said \"hello.\" Oh, very well. My hand was beginning to cramp, anyway."}

The University of Gwylim has generously funded this expedition, in exchange for the exclusive rights to publish at least two books related to the subject at hand.\nNote, however, that these journals are not the finished, published work. They contain my observations, theories, and general musings on everything I encounter throughout this trip. The journals will also contain asides by my scholarly partner, Verita Numida, whose theories are usually wildly opposite of anything I propose. I like to think that our differing points of view help to create a more complete picture of the past, but I will admit here, within these pages, that she often drives me into an intellectual rage. Without her support and the addition of her lofty credentials alongside my own, however, I'm not sure this expedition would have come to fruition.\nWhy Skyreach? These ancient ruins, we believe, hold the answers to the question that has intrigued us both since we first started looking into &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil's&lt;/a&gt; past. Namely, who were the ancient Nedes, the people who eventually gave rise to the mighty Imperials? I always imagined them to be uncivilized brutes that were as likely to fight each other as they were their enemies, but Verita has constantly insisted that they had to have a more advanced culture than I gave them credit for. Perhaps deep within the ruins of Skyreach, we will settle our argument once and for all.\nRemarkable! The city of Skyreach appears to extend not only around the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, but through them and even beneath them. What an amazing feat of engineering went into the crafting of the place. It appears I have lost at least one argument with Verita. The ancient Nedes were certainly not simply uncivilized brutes. But beyond that, these monoliths have yet to tell us exactly who they were.\nWe have begun our investigation in a section of the ruined city we have decided to call \"The Hold.\" Our first goal is to explore the area and come to some conclusions about what daily life must have been like in this Nedic metropolis. Did they utilize both the exterior and interior spaces, or were they primarily dwelling within the space carved from the very heart of the mountain? Perhaps the intricate carvings will provide some clue.\nOn first inspection, I theorize that the Nedes built this massive living structure as a private estate for one of their vaunted &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;s. Perhaps it was even the final residence of &lt;a href=\"Durac\"&gt;Durac&lt;/a&gt;, the High King that presided over the fall of the Nedes.\nVerita, as usual, disagrees. She posits that the commonfolk lived and worked both inside and outside these now-ruined buildings. The evidence we see for what appear to be areas converted into living spaces, she claims, lend credence to the theory that the Nedes retreated into the mountain as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n invasion. Her theory may be more sound, on further consideration, but I am not yet ready to concede to her on this. Not yet."}

But now that I think about it, maybe he was just getting tired of crawling around in dusty, old ruins and decided he needed a break. I wouldn't put it past him to have me do all of the work around here.\nI've reached the main chamber of this portion of the ruins. It was obviously a ceremonial room of some sort, perhaps associated with the Nedic religion or arcane practices. Four summoning circles or ritual stones of some sort occupy key positions around the room. I'm not an expert on arcane rituals by any means, but I wouldn't be surprised if these stone platforms were wards of some sort. I'll make etchings of the stones and see what Reginus thinks they represent.\nThe center of the chamber appears to be decorated with an engraved ritual circle that seems to depict an alien visage of some kind. Is it another of the supposed Nedic gods that we have yet to fully identify? I'll put that it the definite \"maybe\" category. I do get a sense of foreboding in this ancient space, as though something of great consequence took place here. I wish I could find a text or something that would just explain everything to me, but then I guess I'd have no work to do for the university, would I?\nThe raised platform at the far end of the chamber contains two interesting and noteworthy features. First, a fifth summoning circle (ward stone?) is embedded in the floor of the platform. Second, a huge opening in the wall provides a view into the night sky. Could this have been an astronomical tool of some sort? Does a particular pattern of stars appear in this portion of the sky on a given day? I'll need to see how I can research that avenue of study, but in the meantime, I really don't like the sense I'm getting in this chamber. The place feels \u2026 angry. Like a hornet's nest of dark emotions waiting to explode.\nYes, I'm done here. Let's see if Reginus can make any sense of what we've discovered here."}

It is evident that the dead of the Nedic city were interred within this vast labyrinth. However, we have not yet been able to determine if all classes of citizens were allowed to make use of these facilities, or if it was just a place for the rich and powerful. We will begin examining a sampling of the graves at once. Who knows what relics we might find buried with each Nedic corpse?\nSome of the guards and workers in our party have begun to complain about this place. They say these catacombs are haunted. One of my students actually reminded me of the legend of Virmaril the Betrayer. I usually don't hold with such nonsense, but I must admit that a feeling of dread has settled over me. And like some of the others, I imagine I'm hearing a voice whose words are spoken just low enough that I can't make them out. Perhaps we're just frightening each other with these wild tales. Still, the faster we complete our study, the faster we can exit this dismal place.\nI don't know what came over me, but I have shaken off the feeling of doom and retrieved my quill from our fanciful Verita. I must document the position of each of these ancient kings so that our record of this discovery is complete. Though their names have been lost to history, we know the titles of each of the kings spread out around the High King Durac. They include such luminaries as the Forest King, the Spirit King, and the Frost King. We don't know why they carried these titles, but I'm sure it had something to do with the region of the Nedic realm they ruled. Or perhaps it had something to do with their own personal portfolios of power.\nNonsense! Virmaril is nothing more than a legend. And ghost stories do nothing to advance the cause of knowledge and history. Let's move on before we all succumb to these imaginary voices."}

I contend that this is proof positive that the Nedes worshipped some sort of serpent god and were so enamored of this deity that they wanted to see him wherever they looked.\nVerita says my theory has merit, and I thank her for that. But she insists on offering an alternate opinion. She says it's to make sure all avenues of possibility are explored, but I contend she just wants to be contrary. She does enjoy disagreeing with me at every chance she gets. Her theory is that the snake was simply a popular figure in Nedic culture, not unlike the Friendly Netch, the Brave Little , or the Gift-Giving Guar of our own popular legends.\nWe must agree to disagree, as the other popular saying goes.\nOther images we have spotted over and over again in the stonework include an odd, Orcish face, a stag-skull sort of creature, and a winged serpent, which could be related to the other snake images. Gods? Popular story characters? Simple decorative elements without higher meaning? I believe we are looking upon the Nedic pantheon, for I can't imagine going to all this trouble just to depict imaginary creatures from camp-fire tales.\nWe now believe that the catacombs were originally used as the city of Skyreach's graveyard. We have found evidence that the interred came from all walks of life, from commoners to crafters, nobles to royals. We have also developed conflicting theories about why the confines of these catacombs have disturbed us so profoundly.\nI believe that it is shared illusion, given substance by lingering legends and fueled by our own fears. We just need to rely on our intellects and strength of will, then everything will be fine. Besides, illusions cannot hurt us. Of that, I am fairly certain.\nVerita, of course, has a differing opinion. She believes that the legends concerning Virmaril the Betrayer, who we know of only through the remains of a text now called the Perenaal Fragment, have at least a grain of truth to them. It is her belief that Virmaril was indeed a necromancer, and that somehow he has defied the laws of nature and still exists in one form or another somewhere deep within this labyrinth. I say balderdash, but as I agreed to let her join this expedition, I feel somewhat obligated to allow her to express her theories\u2014no matter how outlandish they may be.\nIt is Verita's contention that Virmaril has been asleep these long aeons, and we have somehow begun the process of awakening him from his eternal slumber. Just to be on the safe side, we have decided to cut our exploration of the catacombs short and move on to the next site in the complex. Perhaps we shall return to these ruins at a later time, after our heads have cleared."}

It is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, large and hardy &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and women who have a strong &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Frost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resistance to frost&lt;/a&gt;, both natural and magical. Skyrim was originally inhabited by a race of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, though after the &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Nordic-Falmer War&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Elves were mostly destroyed and the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; settled the land. It is bordered by &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to the east, the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to the west. The island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; lies to the northeast of Skyrim, now a sovereign territory of Morrowind.\nPeople.\nAn inhabitant of Skyrim is sometimes known as a \"Skyrimian\".\nNords.\nThe Nords are the race of men native to Skyrim. Nords consider themselves to be the Children of the Sky. They call Skyrim the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; because it was where the sky first brought the North Winds upon land and formed them. Breath and the voice are the vital essences of a Nord; the art of breathing, &lt;a href=\"speech\"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; and articulation is with them. Though the art of speech is usually associated with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the art of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, or Storm Voice, is associated with &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, who gave Men the ability to speak.\nReachmen.\nThe Reachmen are a race native to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;. They share ancestry with many of the other &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; and can be traced back to when both first began breeding within the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and were also believed to have interbred with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nExpedition to Skyrim.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, a legendary Atmoran leader named &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; led an expedition from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, across the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; to the land that would later be known as Skyrim. They called the land Mereth, in recognition of the vast number of Mer that lived there. It was the first region of Tamriel to be settled by humans. According to legend, Ysgramor landed first at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;, at the extreme northern tip of Skyrim's &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that he and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; were fleeing the civil war in Atmora, which at that time had a sizable population. \nThe Atmorans settled the area that in the future would be known as &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;; they eventually built a city in the region and named it &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. For a long while, relations between the Snow Elves and the Atmorans were relatively peaceful.\nNight of Tears.\nThe Night of Tears was the infamous sacking of Saarthal by the Snow Elves. There are a variety of accounts as to why this happened. Some say the Snow Elves saw that the Nords, with their considerably shorter life expectancy, fast rates of physical maturation and expedient (by Elvish standards) reproductive cycle, would eventually overtake them if left unchecked. Another theory suggests that the sacking of Saarthal was brought on by the Atmoran discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; beneath the city. Other sources are less certain in their pronouncements, but also point to a very focused attack on locations that are not of strategic importance, lending weight to the theory that the Eye of Magnus, not the extermination of the Nords was the primary reason for the attack. According to legend, only Ysgramor and his two sons were able to escape back to Atmora.\nThe Return.\nWhen Ysgramor and his sons returned to Atmora, they told stories of the events that occurred in Skyrim, and gathered many around them for a return to retake Skyrim and avenge Saarthal. After Ysgramor was set to return to Skyrim with an army known as the \"Five Hundred Companions\", composed of the heroes of the Atmoran Civil War. On the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;, the Five Hundred Companions left the port of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; to return to Skyrim.\nNordic-Falmer War.\nThe Nordic-Falmer War took place in the late middle Merethic Era, and was a campaign which seemed to be indecisive for much of its duration. The battle that decided it for the Atmorans was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, the Atmorans were winning and it appeared that they would be victorious, until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;. He rallied and led his forces into combat, inspiring the troops of the last remaining army of Snow Elves, before allegedly being killed by a small child. The death of the Snow Prince shattered the morale and motivation of the remaining Snow Elf warriors. Many Snow Elves fled, and those who remained on the battlefield were killed. The Snow Prince himself was buried with honor by his Nord foes.\nThe war would end shortly after, and was followed by a purge of Skyrim's remaining Snow Elves. The Five Hundred Companions, without much resistance, secured the region and laid the foundations for the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar against the Giant clans of Sinmur.\nYsgramor and his Five Hundred Companions not only fought the Snow Elves, but also the &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;. After many hundreds were slain in battle, the Giant of Legend, &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, was cornered in his barrow and fought Ysgramor to the death. However, the Giant was no match for Ysgramor's mighty axe, &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;. The axe was driven into Sinmur's skull after he was brought to his knees by Ysgramor. With the death of Sinmur, the Giants were never as mighty a threat and so the war ended.\nFounding of Whiterun.\nAfter the war against the Snow Elves, the Five Hundred Companions broke into separate groups to find their way in the newly conquered land. The crew of &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Jeek%20of%20the%20River\"&gt;Jeek of the River&lt;/a&gt;, journeyed around Skyrim until they came upon a mysterious yet wondrous sight; \"a monument of a bird, whose eyes and beak were opened in flame.\" This monument, that would soon later known to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, was older than the Snow Elves themselves. It was supposedly as old as &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and was \"some remnant of the god's efforts to render a paradise in &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; before the shattering of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;.\" A city was built up around Jorrvaskr, and this city became known as &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, with the initial area around it later known as &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding of Windhelm.\nYsgramor and his group traveled eastwards, heading towards &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Yngol Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. After stopping there, Ysgramor's eyes turned to the south, where a river met the sea. He decreed that he and his crew would build a great city, in monument to the glories of Mankind, and so he could look upon his son's final resting place and \"feel that his line would know peace in this new home that was never known in Atmora.\" The city was built with a long bridge stretching across the White River, with much of the city made of stone. This city would be known as &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the City of Kings.\nDragon War.\nWhen the Atmorans came to Skyrim, they brought with them their history and culture, including their religion. Their religion focused on the worship of animal gods, the chief deity of which was the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Just as dragons ruled supreme in Atmora, with dragon priests being their lieutenants to whom actual governance was left, the same occurred in Tamriel.\nAt an unknown time, the people of Skyrim rebelled against the Dragons. At first, people died by the thousands. Later, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic goddess of the Storm, intervened to help Mankind. She gave &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; the task of teaching Mankind the Voice.\nThe tide began to turn in favor of Man, and eventually, Dragons were hunted down and the cultists were killed or overthrown. The Atmorans solidified their victory after &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt; seemingly vanquished the Dragon lord &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. Mankind would win the Dragon War, with many Dragons killed and the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; dispersing and going into hiding. What was left of the Dragon Cult built the Dragon mounds, entombing themselves and the remains of the dragons that died during the war with the belief that Alduin would one day return and resurrect the faithful.\nFirst Era.\nSplit with Atmora.\nSnow Elves persisted within the borders of Skyrim until the reign of the Thirteenth of the Ysgramor Dynasty, &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt;, at the beginning of the First Era. King Harald was the first to relinquish all holdings in Atmora, proclaiming the people of Skyrim as independent, as until that time, the Nords of Atmora and Skyrim had been considered the same group.\nThe First Empire of Men.\n&lt;a href=\"Vrage\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt; started the expansion that would eventually lead to the First Empire of Men. Within fifty years of his reign, the Nords ruled all of Skyrim as well as parts of High Rock, Cyrodiil, and the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; lands of Morrowind.The acquisition of Morrowind was particularly bloody, still remembered by the Dunmer. The purpose of the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; was to expel the Nords.\nWar of Succession.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. His death led to the start of Skyrim's &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. The War of Succession caused Skyrim's influence over many of its dominions to wane. The &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of the internal strife in Skyrim, and began taking land north and south of High Rock, even claiming portions of Skyrim at certain moments.\nFirst Battle of Red Mountain.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, the discord produced by the War of Succession greatly weakened the Nords and caused them to be expelled from Morrowind during the First &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; (the Second Battle of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; would occur in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;). The Nords lost all of their territory in Morrowind, and their armies suffered huge casualties at the hands of the combined Chimer-Dwemer army.\nWar of Succession ends.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the Skyrim War of Succession ended with the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftans\"&gt;Pact of Chieftans&lt;/a&gt; and the crowning of &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; as High King. Records indicated that Olaf expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the Reach.\nFollowing Olaf's reign, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; was created to ensure that the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; would select a ruler worthy enough to rule Skyrim. The crown caused controversy when it rejected the Moot's choice of King, &lt;a href=\"Asurn%20Ice-Breaker\"&gt;Asurn Ice-Breaker&lt;/a&gt;. Following this rejection, Asurn was then killed by &lt;a href=\"Kjoric%20the%20White\"&gt;Kjoric the White&lt;/a&gt;, who took the crown for himself.\nWar of Righteousness.\nRelations soured with Cyrodiil when Kjoric rebelled against Emperor &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Army\"&gt;Alessian Army&lt;/a&gt;, but was killed at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sungard\"&gt;Battle of Sungard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20477\"&gt;1E 477&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;478&lt;/a&gt;. His son and heir, &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt;, resented the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; so much that he allied with the Direnni Hegemony and King &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt;'s insurgents in their war against the Order. Hoag was soon killed at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; and his successor, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, continued his predecessor's work in devastating the Alessian Order.\nKing Wulfharth.\nHigh King Wulfharth reestablished the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20pantheon\"&gt;Nordic pantheon&lt;/a&gt; as the mainstream faith in Skyrim, drove the Direnni Hegemony from Skyrim, and waged war against the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Legend has it that Wulfharth drew the ire of the Orcs' god &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had the ghost of Alduin Time-Eater reduce all the Nords to the age of six. Wulfharth pleaded with &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; to aid them and supposedly Shor's own ghost fought the Time-Eater on the spirit plane, as he did at the beginning of time, and won. Orkey's followers, the Orcs, were ruined by this act. Wulfharth watched the battle in the sky and learned a new thu'um that would change his people back to normal. But in his haste to save so many, he shook too many years out on himself. He grew older than the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; themselves, and died.\nAllegedly, Wulfharth would later be resurrected as Shor's avatar and united the sons of Skyrim to invade Morrowind and reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. The initial battles for the Nords were devastating after making landfall. Although they thought the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; armies would be weaker with reports of them warring with each other, they were surprised to be beset by both armies. Believing that Shor's army would need all the strength it could muster, Wulfharth had also allied himself with orcish clans and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; in his holy war, much to the vexation of some Nords who still clung to old hatreds. Some tales claimed &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; deceived Wulfharth and the Nords into believing he was an ally and betrayed the sons of Skyrim by leading them into a combined Dwemer-Chimer ambush. Other tales claimed that some of Wulfharth's Nords deserted him when he allied himself with their traditional enemies and fell in the climactic battle with the combined Dwemer-Chimer army. Ultimately, Wulfharth died at the Battle of Red Mountain in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, either by being weakened by &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; and slain by &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, or blasted away into ashes by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; wrested &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt; and the Heart of Lorkhan from &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and used them to give themselves divine powers. Unbeknownst to them, Voryn Dagoth did not die from their conflict but had secretly connected himself to the Heart long ago, turning into &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a divine being himself.\nSecond Era.\nAkaviri Potentate.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt; saw the decline and disintegration of much of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Skyrim was one of the most rebellious provinces in this respect, destroying a fortress at Dawnstar, which catalysed the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; to crush all other large-scale armed forces on Tamriel.\nDuring this period, Skyrim maintained most of its own structure, with the Moot continuing to elect kings and functioning largely independently of &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shae&lt;/a&gt; and his son. &lt;a href=\"King%20Logrolf\"&gt;King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; was the last High King during the Potentate, and was assassinated in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Interregnum.\nFollowing Logrolf's assassination, the Crown chose his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, as High Queen. This was disputed by &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, who held a partial moot to proclaim himself High King in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;west&lt;/a&gt;, signaling the split of Skyrim into two kingdoms. Svartr was unable to keep an influx of orcs fleeing the recent destruction of Orsinium out of his realm, and the chieftain &lt;a href=\"Yashnag%20gro-Yazgu\"&gt;Yashnag gro-Yazgu&lt;/a&gt;, along with increasingly rebellious &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, was a disruptive presence in the West for several decades, although some sources claim this was confined to Falkreath. This was ultimately ended in &lt;a href=\"2E%20467\"&gt;2E 467&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Hakkvild\"&gt;Hakkvild&lt;/a&gt; slew Yashnag in single combat. Without a leader, the orcs scattered into the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second Akaviri Invasion of Tamriel.\nThe Second &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invasion landed east of Windhelm in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, rather than landing on the east of Morrowind. The leader was the king of the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. They sacked Windhelm, and killed Queen &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;, her heir. &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt;, her younger son, either escaped the sack, or was in &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and came to Windhelm as the gates fell. In response to this invasion, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; is formed.\nJorunn and rallied troops from across eastern Skyrim, including summoning the spirit of Wulfharth to help the Nords. Following the return of Jorunn, now calling himself King Jorunn, the Nords held the Akaviri at bay while the Dunmer approached from the East and cornered the Akaviri at &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, and supplemented by a legion of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, drive the Akaviri into the sea.\nAnother account claims that Jorunn and &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Strong-Prince\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the battle at the same time, and following the invasion dueled for the kingship of Eastern Skyrim to avoid civil war. After three hours of fighting, Jorunn emerged victorious and banished Fildgor, who fled to the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Ten years after the formation of the Pact, Jorunn is noted to be its head.\nBattle of Sancre Tor.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E 852&lt;/a&gt;, an allied force of Nords and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; occupied the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in northern Cyrodiil, which was then besieged by &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; under the authority of King &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, and defeated through Breton treachery. Following the battle, the Nords swore allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and joined the efforts to conquer Cyrodiil. Note that available texts regarding the battle do not say that this was the point where Skyrim joined the Second Empire, merely that Nordic troops joined the Cyrodilic army.\nReunification.\nThere is no documented account of how or why Skyrim was reunified, but it had presumably been a single entity for some time when the first \"&lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20First%20Edition\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt;\" was published in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt;, as its division and reunification does not merit a mention in the text. Another possibility is that the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Geographic%20Society\"&gt;Imperial Geographic Society&lt;/a&gt; had some motive to hide the fact that the kingdom was ever divided. It is also likely that Tiber Septim reunified Skyrim through his actions at Sancre Tor in &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E 852&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nThe Wolf Queen.\nPrincess &lt;a href=\"Potema\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;, child of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20II\"&gt;Pelagius II&lt;/a&gt;, known to Tamrielic history as the \"Wolf Queen\", was married to &lt;a href=\"King%20Mantiarco\"&gt;King Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt;, noted as \"King of Solitude\". In &lt;a href=\"3E%2082\"&gt;3E 82&lt;/a&gt;, when she was 14, she had her first child, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel&lt;/a&gt;, after many miscarriages. In the intervening years, she spent much time gaining the allegiance of other Skyrim nobility. She initially attempted to be made Empress herself by forging a letter by her brother, claiming he knew he was a bastard, but she was discovered. Following this, Potema and her son Uriel attempted to have her brother's heir, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Kintyra&lt;/a&gt;, declared a bastard before co-ordinating several attacks on the empire across Skyrim and High Rock, and ultimately a successful attack on the Imperial City in &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt;. These initial attacks resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Empress Kintyra&lt;/a&gt;'s capture in &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt; and execution at Glenpoint Castle in High Rock, and Uriel proclaiming himself Uriel Septim III. This triggered the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Red Diamond lasted for six years, between the rival claimants. Uriel was captured after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; in Hammerfell in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;, and killed by a mob while traveling to Cyrodiil for trial. Following this, Potema's allies deserted her and swore loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus&lt;/a&gt;, while Potema summoned &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and raised &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to serve her dwindling armies in the next years. After a 3-year siege of her castle in Solitude, the Wolf Queen was declared dead in &lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Oblivion Crisis.\nAt the beginning of the Fifth Century of the Third Era, the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to enter Tamriel in his \"true and terrible form.\" &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; opened up all over Tamriel, and a massive war between Mortals and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; ensued. Though most of the fighting took place in Cyrodiil, it is known that Oblivion Gates opened up all across Tamriel.\nFourth Era.\nThe Red Year and its Aftermath.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, Red Mountain erupted in Morrowind. Much of the land was destroyed, and as such many Dunmer were forced to flee their homeland. to &lt;a href=\"4E%206\"&gt;4E 6&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt; the High King of Skyrim gave the island of Solstheim to the Dunmer, giving the refugees coming from Morrowind a place to live. Four years later, in &lt;a href=\"4E%2020\"&gt;4E 20&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Decree%20of%20Monument\"&gt;Decree of Monument&lt;/a&gt; was signed by the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s to \"decree this site as a monument to the struggle of those who fled their native home of Morrowind in the time following the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe Forsworn Uprising.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Reachmen launched an uprising in which they took the city of Markarth. This event would later be known as \"The Forsworn Uprising.\" Since the Empire was fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil at the time, Markarth was undefended and was thus left open for attack. The Reachmen who took control of Markarth took over the government administration and created an independent Reach kingdom.\nMarkarth Incident.\nTwo years later, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, who was the Jarl of Markarth prior to the Reachmen reclaiming it, asked a militia force led by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; to retake Markarth. The militia was victorious, however, many people who were related to the Forsworn were executed, those of the Forsworn who didn't flee Markarth were killed, except for &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nepos%20the%20Nose\"&gt;Nepos the Nose&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of others. Those of the Forsworn who did manage to escape swore revenge against the Nords for preventing them a life of independence. After this, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned and had to accept the agreement of free Talos worship, which was made between Ulfric and Hrolfdir, supposedly due to chaos running through the streets in Markarth. However, sometime after this, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; found out that the Empire wasn't honoring the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; and demanded them that Ulfric and his men be arrested or face another war. The choice was clear for the Jarl, Ulfric and his men were arrested and the Thalmor came to Skyrim with their treaty enforcers, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciars&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that the Talos ban wouldn't be dishonored again. It was the founding day for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and where the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim truly started.\nSkyrim Civil War.\nThe Civil War in Skyrim is known to have started before &lt;a href=\"4E%20199\"&gt;4E 199&lt;/a&gt; and after &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;. The exact cause for the war is a matter of debate in the province. On the Imperial side, it is generally thought that Ulfric coveted the High King's throne and that he just want to become High King of Skyrim. On the Stormcloak side, however, people see him as a liberator who tries to free Skyrim from the claws of a corrupt and dying Empire. Whiterun is neutral in this war and it's current Jarl, &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; claims that it will stay that way until the Hold is forced to draw its sword against one side or the other. There haven't been recorded any significant clashes in the Civil War prior to The Last &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; arriving in Skyrim. Save from a few skirmishes outside of Windhelm, Whiterun, and Skyrim in general. As a result, not much territory has been gained by either side.\nDragon Crisis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; was a series of events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when Alduin, the Nordic god of destruction, returned to Tamriel. He, along with the many dragons that he resurrected, caused destruction and chaos throughout Skyrim, already in strife from the Skyrim Civil War. However, a mysterious individual\u2014later revealed to be the hero of legend, the Last Dragonborn\u2014rose up and was able to defeat Alduin, as foretold by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nGeography.\nSkyrim is the most rugged region of Tamriel; not only containing five of the highest peaks on the continent, but also very snowy and cold. Much of Skyrim is vertical; mountains, cliffs, and deep valleys. The vast majority of settlements cling to these valleys.\nFlora and fauna.\nFlora.\nA vast number of types of flora are found throughout Skyrim. Plants can be found anywhere in Skyrim, even in the least hospitable of locations. Flora such as &lt;a href=\"Snowberries%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Snowberries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Mirriam\"&gt;Frost Mirriam&lt;/a&gt; are capable of surviving in cold, harsh conditions. There are nine types of &lt;a href=\"Fungi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fungi&lt;/a&gt; found in Skyrim. These can be found in cave networks beneath the surface. Of particular note are &lt;a href=\"%20Jazbay%20Grapes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Jazbay grapes&lt;/a&gt;, originally a rare delicacy, &lt;a href=\"tundra%20cotton\"&gt;tundra cotton&lt;/a&gt;, an alternative clothing fibre to animal skins, and &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Crown\"&gt;Bleeding Crown&lt;/a&gt;, a fungus common to many of Skyrim's caverns.\nOne of the most intriguing plants in Skyrim is the &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; plant. Nirnroot typically grows near fungi and water resources, and depends on water and sunlight to survive. This rare plant is light green or crimson and emits a very bright glow, as well as a chiming sound. Nirnroot flourished on Skyrim and all of Tamriel until the event known as the &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, which catastrophically affected almost all plant life, including Nirnroot.\nFauna.\nA number of animals found in Skyrim are domesticated. These include the &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chicken%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chickens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;goats&lt;/a&gt;. The horses of Skyrim are hardy and strong, and \"make up for endurance what they lack in speed.\" Horses and horse-drawn carriages are commonly used as methods of transportation. Both being capable of traveling the harsh terrain and climate with ease.\nHolds.\nHolds are the nine administrative sections of Skyrim. Scattered across the rugged landscape of Skyrim are five major cities and four minor ones, as well as minor settlements.\nThe Pale.\nThe Pale is located in the central northern area of Skyrim and extends to the northern coast where Dawnstar is situated. The hold borders Hjaalmarch to the west, Whiterun to the south, and Winterhold and Eastmarch to the east. Most of the region is treacherously cold with pine forests that stand facing the harsh winds whipping down the mountains. Only in the southernmost part of the hold towards Whiterun does the harsh terrain abate and become grassy plains.\nDawnstar.\nA garrison town on the northern coast of Skyrim, the port of Dawnstar is the trade center of the region. Once the location of a major Imperial fortress until its destruction in &lt;a href=\"2E%20283\"&gt;2E 283&lt;/a&gt;. Dawnstar is one of the northern most cities in Skyrim along with Solitude and Winterhold.\nFalkreath Hold.\nFalkreath Hold is the second-southernmost hold in Skyrim, after the Rift. It borders Cyrodiil to the south (via the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;) and Hammerfell to the west, with a single road leading to both provinces. Its capital is the city of Falkreath, the epicenter of the region. The other notable town in the hold is &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, the first settlement in Skyrim to be attacked by a dragon during the Dragon Crisis. &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt;, the biggest lake in the province, covers a large portion of the northwestern part of the hold; it feeds the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; cover Falkreath's southern border, and the eastern part of the hold features mountains adjacent to the Throat of the World.\nFalkreath.\nA smaller city, Falkreath is situated on one of the southernmost roads in Skyrim and is not far from the province's southern border. The city has been the site of many historical battles. Given its history, the city is known for its large &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Graveyard\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, which dominates the southern part of the town.\nThe Reach.\nThe Reach covers much of the western border of Skyrim, with High Rock and Hammerfell to the west. This mountainous region is dotted with &lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Berries\"&gt;juniper trees&lt;/a&gt; and rich in valuable ores, especially &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Ore\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. Surrounding Holds include Whiterun to the east, Haafingar past the mountains to the north, Hjaalmarch to the north-east and Falkreath to the southeast. The Reach is infamous for harboring the Forsworn, Reachmen who are fighting a long war of independence and seek to retake Markarth from the Nords and free the hold from Imperial authority.\nMarkarth.\nNestled in the westerly &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of the Reach, Markarth is the capital city of the hold. Markarth was notable for possessing the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Imperial College of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;, which was founded by Tiber Septim to restore the Voice to the art of warfare. Half of the town is controlled by a wealthy family known as the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Bloods\"&gt;Silver-Bloods&lt;/a&gt;. Violence runs rampant throughout most of the city due to the Forsworn and governmental corruption. Originally known as &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel&lt;/a&gt;, the city's architecture is primarily Dwemer in style. The city features significant elevation change within its limits, as well as a pair of rivers flowing through it.\nHjaalmarch.\nHjaalmarch is located in northern Skyrim, at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;. Morthal lies near the center of the hold. The hold borders Haafingar, separated by the Karth River to the northwest, The Reach to the west, Whiterun to the south and The Pale to the east. Much of the terrain is covered by wetlands, marshes, and swamps, collectively known as the &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;Drajkmyr Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. One of the largest Ancient Nordic ruins in Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the southern part of the hold.\nMorthal.\nMorthal is a small city at the southern edge of the Drajkmyr Marsh, between Fort &lt;a href=\"Snowhawk\"&gt;Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stonehills\"&gt;Stonehills&lt;/a&gt; mining village. It is situated on an off-path river from the &lt;a href=\"River%20Hjaal\"&gt;River Hjaal&lt;/a&gt;, which starts from the Whiterun Hold and ends around the Karth River, where it meets the Sea of Ghosts. Morthal's folk traditions include a legend about the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pale%20Lady%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt;,\" a dangerous ghost who is said to stalk the marshes to find her daughter.\nThe Rift.\nThe Rift is located in the southeastern part of Skyrim and features autumnal forests ringed by mountains. The lower half of the region is known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Stony%20Basin\"&gt;Stony Basin&lt;/a&gt;,\" containing mining settlements like &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt;. The elevation rises closer to the capital city of Riften. The hold is bordered on the west by mountains adjacent to the Throat of the World. Just east of these is &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Geir\"&gt;Lake Geir&lt;/a&gt;, a source of food for the surrounding settlements, including &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nimalten\"&gt;Nimalten&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Geirmund%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Geirmund's Hall&lt;/a&gt;. In the southeast of the Rift is the &lt;a href=\"Smokefrost%20Peaks\"&gt;Smokefrost Peaks&lt;/a&gt; sub-region, which is warmed by the nearby volcano of &lt;a href=\"Trolhetta\"&gt;Trolhetta&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; stand to the east. The city of Riften is also found here, built on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiften.\nRiften, also known as Rifton, is capital of &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;. This town is located in south-eastern Skyrim, close to the province's borders with both Cyrodiil and Morrowind and on the eastern shore of Lake Honrich. Home to the Skyrim &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, it was in Riften that &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; joined the Guild during her return to Morrowind from exile in Skyrim. The city's outskirts are primarily farmland, utilized mainly by the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Snow-Shod%20Clan\"&gt;Snow-Shod Clan&lt;/a&gt; and other ancestral families of the Rift. A canal runs through Riften, where fishing skiffs dock their ships and sell produce. Larger vessels utilize the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Docks\"&gt;Riften Docks&lt;/a&gt; on the outside of city walls.\nHaafingar.\nHaafingar is the smallest hold in area, located in the far northwest of the province. Since the Fourth Era, the High King of Skyrim is seated in the wealthy city of Solitude. The hold is separated from Hjaalmarch by the Karth River and the Reach by mountains. &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; is the only access to the hold by road, crossing the Karth River. Much of the hold is rocky and mountainous with soaring snowy mountains surrounding the north and west of Solitude, though the lower lying areas including Dragon Bridge are mostly comprised of forests and hills.\nSolitude.\nSolitude is the center of Imperial influence within Skyrim and capital city of &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe capital city of Solitude is one of the largest cities in Skyrim. It is set upon a great stone arch that towers above the mouth of the Karth River, and is bordered by mountains to the north. The &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; and elaborate &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; are located here, as well as a large &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to its natural defenses, Solitude's outer gate is fortified by the &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Tower\"&gt;Sky Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Solitude is a major port, and its ships control much of Skyrim's northern coastline.\nSolitude's Bards College is known for its liveliness, including an annual week of celebrations, the climax of which is the burning of \"King Olaf\" in effigy, possibly a now-forgotten contender in the War of Succession. Graduates have no trouble finding employment in noble households across Tamriel, and many take to becoming wandering minstrels, providing entertainment in courts across Tamriel.\nWhiterun Hold.\nWhiterun Hold is the central hold of Skyrim, and is named for its capital city, Whiterun. It features a wide variety of geographical features, including vast plains and snow-capped mountains, including the Throat of the World, which is the tallest mountain in all of Tamriel. The monastery of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; is also situated on the mountain. Whiterun Hold is the hub of trading and a core part of the province's economy. Other notable settlemenets in the hold include &lt;a href=\"Riverwood\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;. The hold is divided by the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, leading from Lake Ilinalta in Falkreath Hold, to the south. The local giant population uses the grasslands and tundra outside Whiterun as a pasture for their &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; herds, and a place to set camp, such as in &lt;a href=\"Bleakwind%20Basin\"&gt;Bleakwind Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhiterun.\nLocated in the central part of the hold, the area around the city of Whiterun is very open, stretching far to the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Hills\"&gt;Sundered Hills&lt;/a&gt; of the Reach. The hill known as the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt; was the foundation of Whiterun's construction, the city having grown around it since its discovery by the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;. The city is well-fortified city, with watchtowers all along the border and a drawbridge protecting its western and only gate. The city is divided into three districts: the mercantile Plains District, the residential and wealthier Wind District, and the upper Cloud District, made up of the palace of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;. The city contains the &lt;a href=\"Gildergreen\"&gt;Gildergreen&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient tree that grew from the &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Tree\"&gt;Eldergleam Tree&lt;/a&gt; of Eastmarch.\nWinterhold Hold.\nWinterhold is located on the northeastern corner of Skyrim, with the Sea of Ghosts to its north. It is a cold region, largely covered in tundra and high mountain ranges. Along the coast is a polar environment of glaciers and icebergs. The surrounding holds are Eastmarch to the south and the Pale to the west. The hold is home to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinterhold.\nWinterhold, sometimes known as \"The Winterhold,\" is one of the four oldest holds in Skyrim, known collectively as \"Old Holds,\" and was once the province's capital, In &lt;a href=\"4E%20122\"&gt;4E 122&lt;/a&gt;, the city was diminished greatly in size due to environmental change known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;the Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;, although the College of Winterhold was left unharmed. With only one connecting road, Winterhold is one of the most isolated cities in the province.\nEastmarch.\nEastmarch is located along the eastern border with Morrowind, separated from its neighbor by the Velothi Mountainss. The northern part of Eastmarch features snowy tundras and mountains, while the central and southern areas of the hold are volcanically active and contain a number of sulfur pools called &lt;a href=\"Aalto\"&gt;Aalto&lt;/a&gt;. The western part resembles much of central Skyrim. The &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20River\"&gt;Darkwater River&lt;/a&gt; runs throughout the region, near &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. It continues into the north-flowing White River. The ancient monastery of &lt;a href=\"Mistwatch\"&gt;Mistwatch&lt;/a&gt; is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt;, who are some of the few worshippers of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; that still exist in Skyrim.\nEastmarch's capital city, Windhelm, is located along the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt; in the northern part of the hold, before the boreal forests that inhabit the central province. Many settlements like &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Yorgrim\"&gt;Lower Yorgrim&lt;/a&gt; live along the river, feeding off its fish. To the south is the sacred forest of &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;. To the east connecting the city of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind is &lt;a href=\"Dunmeth%20Pass\"&gt;Dunmeth Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Peaks\"&gt;Icewind Peaks&lt;/a&gt; sub-region is highly mountainous, featuring only a few small settlements such as the village of &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow\"&gt;Cragwallow&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt; was one of the biggest Dwemer cities in Skyrim. The ruined temple of &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; sits high among the Velothi Mountains, containing a portal to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic afterlife.\nWindhelm.\nWindhelm was once the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim, but as of the Fourth Era, it was the capital city of Eastmarch. The palace of the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; still dominates the center of the Old City. Windhelm was sacked during the War of Succession, and again by the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; army of Ada'Soon Dir-Kamal; the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; is one of the few First Empire buildings that remain. In the Second and Third Era, Windhelm was the only sizable city in the Hold of Eastmarch and served as a base for Imperial troops guarding the Dunmeth Pass into Morrowind during Tiber Septim's reign. Following the Great War and the ensuing Skyrim Civil War, Windhelm became the primary hold of the Stormcloaks. The city's proximity to the Sea of Ghosts allows it a status as a lucrative trading post. The city can be accessed through its docks or across a large stone bridge crossing the Yorgrim River. The city is split into several districts: the mercantile Stone Quarter, the residential Snow Quarter (or \"Gray Quarter,\" as of the Fourth Era), and the wealthier quarter of Valunstrad.\nTerritories.\nBleakrock Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; is located north of the Dunmer city of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; and northeast of Windhelm. The ruling capital on the small island is &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Village\"&gt;Bleakrock Village&lt;/a&gt; which is the only real settlement on Bleakrock. There are a few Nordic ruins located on the isle including the massive ruins known as &lt;a href=\"Skyshroud%20Barrow\"&gt;Skyshroud Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. Bleakrock Village has a set of ruins to the southeast of it called the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Rest\"&gt;Last Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Southwest of Bleakrock Village is a monument called &lt;a href=\"Companions%20Point\"&gt;Companions Point&lt;/a&gt; which depicts Ysgramor of the Five Hundred Companions.\nRoscrea.\n&lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt; is an island that was conquered by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20271\"&gt;3E 271&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the Sea of Ghosts. It was the first of the four known islands conquered by Septim and his expeditionary force. According to records, it took his armies roughly three years to conquer the island. The island was later annexed by Solitude.\nGovernment.\nThe entire province of Skyrim is ruled by the High King or the High Queen, and their consort. Each hold is ruled by a Jarl. Following the death of King Harald, the High King was chosen through a Moot of the Jarls, which has varied in importance from the ultimate legitimizer of a High King's rule to a mere ceremonial acknowledgment of the heir apparent. Disagreements over the Moot in the First Era led to the War of Succession in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, and after that a Moot has only been convened when the current High King has had no direct heir.\nUntil the Skyrim Civil War, the province was included in the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. While under this banner, Skyrim enjoyed military aid from the Emperor's army.\nThe &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29%23cite%20ref-galmar%200-0\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; was a symbol of leadership and power of a High King or High Queen. It was made out of the teeth and bones of Dragons and was an ancient relic of the Nords. It was made for King Harald. The last High King to wear the crown was King Borgas and the crown was lost during the War of Succession.\nThere are no known laws or legal documents of Skyrim. There were some surveys, censuses and records used by the government, such as the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Life\"&gt;Book of Life&lt;/a&gt;, which was a census that kept track of people and livestock in a certain region. The government also kept records of cities' general status and economic production. One such survey was the Survey of the &lt;a href=\"Holdings%20of%20Jarl%20Gjalund\"&gt;Holdings of Jarl Gjalund&lt;/a&gt;, taken down during the First Era by &lt;a href=\"Slafknir%20the%20Scribe\"&gt;Slafknir the Scribe&lt;/a&gt;, under the rule of Jarl &lt;a href=\"Gjalund\"&gt;Gjalund&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmed forces.\nOther than the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks, Skyrim appears to have no centralized armed forces. Each Hold has its own section of &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s who act as both a national guard and police force. These soldiers are the first line of defense against any opposing force who threatens Skyrim and its people. All the Hold Guards were Legion Soldiers prior to the Civil War and were able to be conscripted by the Empire in times of war. After the Civil War erupted sometime after the Markarth Incident, the Hold Guards of Skyrim were divided just as Skyrim itself was, with Haafingar, Hjaalmarch, The Reach and Falkreath Hold remaining under Imperial control and Eastmarch, The Pale, The Rift and Winterhold Hold changing to Stormcloak control.\nThe Hold Guards and all armed forces are under the command of their respective Jarl of the nine Holds which are largely independent. However, in theory, all Jarls must swear fealty to Skyrim's High King who can unify the Holds' armed forces into a centralized army. The Nords' warlike character and history of conflict contributed much to Skyrim's formidable reputation. As an ally of the Empire, it was also considered to be the Empire's strong arm.\nEconomy.\nSkyrim is a wealthy and powerful province and traditionally was a profitable trading partner of the Third Empire.\nIn the Fourth Era, Skyrim was politically unified until the outbreak of the Civil War, which pitted the Eastern Holds against the Western Holds. Although this, coupled with the Great Collapse, has caused some damage to Skyrim's economy, the city of Riften has become an industrial powerhouse, producing mead and fish. Skyrim is also abundant in a variety of wildlife that is hunted as prey by local &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. These animals are hunted for their meat and pelts which can be sold or utilized for cooking and leather crafting.\nThere are many forms of economic production in Skyrim. This includes agriculture, which is common despite the harsh and cold conditions, as well as grain production, mining, stone-cutting and logging. In Skyrim, there are many &lt;a href=\"Farms%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"grain%20mill\"&gt;grain mill&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt;s, docks, and ports that produce goods and services. In addition, the trading and shipping industries are another part of Skyrim's economy. In each major city in Skyrim, of which there are five, there is a central marketplace where business, trading and social activities take place.\nSome cities, towns, and villages produce specific goods and services. During the First Era, &lt;a href=\"Rorik%27s%20Steading\"&gt;Rorik's Steading&lt;/a&gt; (Rorikstead) produced grain, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; and horses, &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt; produced hides and &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volunruud\"&gt;Volunruud&lt;/a&gt; produced meat and worked ivory, &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt; produced lumber and stone, &lt;a href=\"Granite%20Hill\"&gt;Granite Hill&lt;/a&gt; held a weekly market and &lt;a href=\"Hillgrund%27s%20Steading\"&gt;Hillgrund's Steading&lt;/a&gt; (Ivarstead).\nThe &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; is a multi-national, monopolistic trading and shipping company based out of Cyrodiil. The East Empire Company essentially dominates the shipping and trading industry in Solitude, which is a major shipping port of Skyrim. However, the East Empire Company has been having troubles with the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Horker\"&gt;Blood Horker&lt;/a&gt; pirates, who were used by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Clan Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt; to diminish the flow of Imperial goods to Skyrim, which in turn enabled Clan Shatter-Shield's trading and shipping business to rival them in Windhelm.\nSkyrim uses the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which is the main currency used in Cyrodiil and throughout all of the Empire.\nReligion.\nThere are two religious pantheons of Skyrim, both worshipped in different time periods throughout Skyrim's history. The first was the Ancient Nordic Pantheon, worshipped during the Merethic and early First Era. The Ancient Nordic Pantheon venerated animal gods; the deities were the hawk, wolf, snake, moth, owl, whale, bear, fox, and the dragon, which some scholars equate to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; in different forms. The second was the Nordic Pantheon, revered during the rest of Skyrim's history prior to the Fourth Era. During the Fourth Era they adapted to the Imperial Pantheon.\nThe Nordic Pantheon consists of various deities, resembling the Nine Divines. Specific deities venerated by Skyrim and her people include: &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;. These deities are divided into several groups that represent the different stages of the world. Shor and Tsun form the group known as the Dead Gods, who fought and died in order to bring about the current world. Kyne, Mara, Dibella, Stuhn, and Jhunal form the group known as the Hearth Gods, who watch over the current world. Alduin is the Twilight God, who ushers in the next world. Orkey, along with &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;, form the group called the Testing Gods, from which the Nords guard against rather than worship. Shor is considered the father deity of the province, as opposed to Akatosh, the chief Divine of Cyrodiil. While most &lt;a href=\"Pantheons%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;pantheons&lt;/a&gt; consider the time god to be the head of the pantheon, the Nordic pantheon is led by Kyne. Some scholars report that Akatosh and Alduin are the same deity, while others disagree. Sovngarde is believed to be the Nordic afterlife created by Shor. If a Nord dies a heroic and honorable death, they ascend to Sovngarde.\nDaedra worship is rare in Skyrim, although the traditional Nordic Pantheon acknowledges some of these beings. These include Herma-Mora, an Atmoran demon who some claim is the incarnation of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;, an incarnation of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, is the patron of the ostracized.\nOther Daedric Princes are worshipped in Skyrim by those who do not follow predominant faiths in the province. These include &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;\u2014whose followers fled Morrowind after receiving spiritual dreams from their liege; &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;\u2014worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;s; &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;\u2014worshipped by a cult of cannibals; and &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, largely patronized by &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropes&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalos worship.\nWorship of Talos is prevalent in Skyrim, despite the signing of the White-Gold Concordat by the Thalmor and the Third Empire as a treaty to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; conflict. The document contained explicit demands by the Third Aldmeri Dominion to uproot the worship of Talos in Cyrodiil and its territories. Skyrim, at the time, was a territory of the Empire. Following the Markarth Incident, the Thalmor were authorized to eradicate Talos worship in Skyrim, although the Stormcloaks refused to relinquish these beliefs. Sometime after the Concordant was signed into law, the shrine of Talos in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt; was desecrated and removed.\nCulture.\nMusic.\nMany songs are found in Skyrim's culture; some notable songs included \"&lt;a href=\"Ragnar%20the%20Red\"&gt;Ragnar the Red&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20the%20Dragonborn%23Lyrics\"&gt;Song of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dragonborn%20Comes\"&gt;The Dragonborn Comes&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Tale%20of%20the%20Tongues\"&gt;Tale of the Tongues&lt;/a&gt;\". Music is also popular in relation to war and propaganda. In the third century of the Fourth Era, when the Civil War was taking place, two songs were produced with lyrics altered to suit each side. \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Age%20of%20Aggression\"&gt;The Age of Aggression&lt;/a&gt;\" was for the Empire and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Age%20of%20Oppression\"&gt;The Age of Oppression&lt;/a&gt;\" was for the Stormcloaks. These songs are sung by &lt;a href=\"Bards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bards&lt;/a&gt; in inns and &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Taverns&lt;/a&gt; all across Skyrim.\nOne very notable song of the past was \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;King Olaf's Verse&lt;/a&gt;\". The verse, written by Bard &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, criticized King Olaf One-Eye and his adventures and referred to his adventures as \"lurid and false.\" In response, King Olaf One-Eye ordered Svaknir to be imprisoned and all copies of his verse to burn. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn joined the Bards College; their initiation task was to retrieve the last known copy of King Olaf's Verse from &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Men%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Dead Men's Respite&lt;/a&gt;.\nQueen Elisif the Fair banned the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20King%20Olaf\"&gt;Burning of King Olaf&lt;/a&gt;, a festival of the Bards College, after the death of her husband, Torygg. She considered it to be in bad taste. The Bards, however, desired for the festival to take place. &lt;a href=\"Viarmo\"&gt;Viarmo&lt;/a&gt; and the Last Dragonborn went to Elisif the Fair and presented to her King Olaf's Verse. Elisif soon allowed holding of the Burning of King Olaf festival. The festival was to be held that day, and for all days in the future when the festival was to take place.\nFestivals and holidays.\nA few notable holidays and festivals are customary in Skyrim and in Nordic culture. One notable festival is the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Feast of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, which is held on the 13th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in Windhelm to honor Ysgramor and the Five Hundred Companions. During the festival, the names of the Five Hundred are recited. \nArchitecture and infrastructure.\nThe architecture and infrastructure of Skyrim is a mix of rural and urban; much of Skyrim is untamed wilderness, broken up by nine major cities spread across the province. Of these nine cities, there are five that are more urbanized, heavily populated, and more city-like, and four that are smaller, less populated, and more rural in nature.\nThe actual architecture of the buildings varies, but it is unknown what they were based on. The city of Markarth was originally built by the ancient Dwemer. The buildings were made of stone and the unique metal known only to the Dwemer. After the Dwemer disappeared in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, people started to settle into Markarth, so the Nords who settled the city did not have to use their cultural styles of architecture and infrastructure.\nExamples of Ancient Nordic architecture include longhouses, with \"each beam and cornice festooned with carvings of dragons, bulls, boars, leering wild men, and dancing, long-tressed women.\" The Ancient Nords, known as the Atmorans, built massive structures called &lt;a href=\"Word%20Wall\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt;s. Whether it was out of fear or respect, the Ancient Nords learned the language and writing system of the dragons.\nThere are also examples of Akaviri architecture present in Skyrim. Sometime during the First Era, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; was constructed for and by the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Dragonguard\"&gt;Akaviri Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202812\"&gt;1E 2812&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20II\"&gt;Reman II&lt;/a&gt; permitted the construction of &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple, a massive stone mural built to record all of the Akaviri's accumulated dragon-lore and the Prophecy of the Dragonborn. Sky Haven Temple and Alduin's Wall are testaments to Akaviri architecture and sculpturing, and is considered to be some of the best-preserved examples of early Akaviri structures and sculptures.\nEducation.\nThree colleges are recorded as existing in Skyrim throughout its history: the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20College%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Imperial College of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; in Markarth, the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude, and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; in Winterhold. Tiber Septim endowed a college in Markarth to begin teaching the Voice as a tool of war, but whether this college began teaching or not is unclear. There is no trace of the college in any of the games."}

And in each, I have found a method of governing and customs of leadership unique to that particular province.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, for example, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; King relies upon his &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt; Assassins to eliminate threats secretly, without the common knowledge of his people. In the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; may rule directly, but the power granted to his &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; cannot be understated.\nDuring a recent journey to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, that harsh, frozen realm of the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, I was able for the first time to witness the unique manner of rule of this strong, proud people.\nIt would appear that the entire province of Skyrim is separated into territories known as \"&lt;a href=\"holds\"&gt;holds&lt;/a&gt;,\" and each hold finds its seat of power in one of the great, ancient cities. And in each of those cities, there rules that hold's king, known as a &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jarls of Skyrim are, as a whole, a fierce sight indeed. Sitting on their thrones, ready to administer justice, or send their forces out to quell some local threat, be it a pack of feral wolves or a terrifying giant that has wandered too close to a settlement.\nIn observing these Jarls, I found each to of course have his or her own unique personality and leadership style. But what I perhaps did not expect - especially considering the Nord leaders' unfair reputation as barbarians or uncivilized chieftains - was the formal structure of each Jarl's court. For while that hold's leader may be the one to sit on the throne, there is also a collection of functionaries who serve very specific and important roles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;court wizard&lt;/a&gt; counsels the Jarl in all matters magical, and may even sell services or spells to the keep's visitors. The &lt;a href=\"Steward\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt; is the Jarl's primary advisor, and generally takes care of the more mundane aspects of running the keep, the city, or even the hold, depending on the situation. And woe is the fool who defies the &lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt; - a personal bodyguard who rarely leaves the Jarl's side, and has pledged to sacrifice his or her own life to save that of their honored leader, if ever the need should arrive.\nBut as mighty and influential as each individual Jarl is, Skyrim's true power comes from the strength of its &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. The High King is ruler above all, and is always one of the Jarls, selected by a body called the \"&lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt;\" - a specially convened council of all the Jarls, who meet with the express purpose of choosing Skyrim's High King. Or so it is, in theory.\nThe reality, however, is that the High King swears fealty to the Emperor, and as &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; is the city most directly influenced by Imperial culture and politics, the Jarl of Solitude has served as High King for generations. The Moot, therefore, is more formality and theater than anything else.\nBut as I prepared to leave Skyrim, I could feel a change in the air, sense the trepidation of some of the good Nord people. Many seemed unhappy with the Empire's continued presence in their land. And the outlawing of the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Ninth Divine&lt;/a&gt; - a stipulation of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, the peace treaty between the Empire and &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; - has only strengthened that division.\nSo while the Jarls of Skyrim still control their holds, and those Jarls are ruled over by their Imperial-sanctioned High King, will there come a day when the Moot convenes to select a new High King - one that is not, as many would say, the Emperor's \"Solitude puppet\"?\"\"\nIf that day comes, I will be thankful to be far away from Skyrim, in my own home of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. For such a decision could well mean civil war, and I fear that such a conflict would tear the fierce and beautiful Nord people asunder."}

{"id": "51548", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=51548", "title": "Skyrim Civil War", "text": "The Skyrim Civil War, called the Stormcloak Rebellion by the Empire, and frequently shortened to simply the Civil War is an ongoing civil war in the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Its origins can be found several years prior to the death of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; when skirmishes raged across the land, with large-scale military conflict starting after he was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, the war \"really started\" after Ulfric and his militia (the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;) were imprisoned and found they could trust the Empire no longer.\nPrelude.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric was taken captive by the Dominion, and interrogated, after which he was listed as an asset to &lt;a href=\"Elenwen\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;. During this interrogation, Ulfric was made to believe that he divulged information which led to the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; before being allowed to escape. Thalmor sources imply that they kept some degree of contact with Ulfric following his escape.\nAt the end of the war in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. The terms of the treaty included banning &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship. After the Great War ended, the Thalmor established contact with Ulfric, believing that he could be a valuable asset. The &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; proved his worth to them, although the Thalmor later forcibly imprisoned him.\nFollowing the signing of the treaty, Ulfric led a force of militia to retake &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;, which had declared independence under the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; during the Great War. Ulfric held the city and refused to surrender it to the Imperial Legion until they agreed to allow Talos worship once again. Following the Imperial acceptance of Ulfric's demands, the Aldmeri Dominion forced Ulfric and his militia to be arrested, and established a presence in Skyrim to oversee enforcement of the ban on Talos worship, which had up until that point been largely ignored. After the Markarth Incident, Ulfric refused direct contact with the Thalmor.\nBelligerents.\nStormcloaks.\nThe Stormcloak movement was initiated by &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, and aims to remove the Imperial Legion from Skyrim and turn the province into an independent kingdom. The rebels' stated goals include lifting the ban on Talos worship across Skyrim, expelling or executing all the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s who have been granted the authority by the Empire to enforce the White-Gold Concordat within the province, crown Ulfric Stormcloak the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and to independently prepare Skyrim for a future war with the Aldmeri Dominion.\nBesides stemming from deep discontentment with the ban on Talos worship, a secondary motivation behind the Stormcloak uprising is the belief that the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; have become a puppet state of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; in all but name, and no longer has the legitimacy to rule over Skyrim. The Stormcloaks claim to hold fast to old Nord customs and values and recruit from those who share their principles. They consider themselves the \"true sons and daughters of Skyrim\" since they are the only force in Skyrim who have not capitulated to the Aldmeri Dominion and are openly revolting against their influence. The Stormcloaks see the Empire's Thalmor influenced laws as a threat to their Nordic way of life. They believe once they have consolidated their control over Skyrim, they can set to reforming the autonomous kingdom into a strong and fearless nation capable of finishing the war with Aldmeri Dominion and not be hindered by the Empire's harmful policies.\nThe Stormcloak rebellion represents a large enough portion of Skyrim's population to have triggered a civil war. Some Nords, notably Jarl &lt;a href=\"Laila%20Law-Giver\"&gt;Laila Law-Giver&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, do not entirely trust or support Ulfric but back the Stormcloaks as they share the common goal of independence from the Empire, while others feel the civil war bleeds Skyrim dry and will leave the Thalmor as the sole beneficiaries.\nThe name \"Stormcloaks\" was created by the Empire in an attempt to belittle the uprising, by implying that its supporters are Ulfric's personal lackeys in his bid for power. However, the rebels have since defiantly taken the name and made it their own, to honor the common cause of Skyrim's independence they are fighting for. Others state the name was created by Ulfric himself to show his lust for power.\nTheir base of operations is the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; in the city of Windhelm, with &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; serving as their field commander.\nImperial Legion.\nThe Imperial Legion is the military arm of the Empire, which, prior to its &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; with the Aldmeri Dominion, ruled over most of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion is attempting to quell the rebellion led by Ulfric Stormcloak, with the goal of restoring the peace and keeping Skyrim in the Empire.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; believes that as a province of the Empire, Skyrim must abide by its laws and customs. Though most do not approve of the White-Gold Concordat, the Imperials are forced to allow the Thalmor to uphold it in order to preserve the peace between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion. If any legionaries keep faith in &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, as it is implied &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; do, they keep their religion to themselves and pray to Talos discreetly and out of earshot. Though the Empire has appeased the Aldmeri Dominion's demands, Vittoria Vici, the cousin of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, states that the Empire has little love for the Dominion. Even so, high ranking Imperials do acknowledge that Ulfric is not wrong that the Thalmor hold influence over the Empire. Some Imperial loyal Jarls and lords recognize the power of the Thalmor and seek to ingratiate themselves with them if it serves their interests. These people state that the times of war between the Empire and Aldmeri Dominion should be over and that peace and prosperity is good for everyone. At the same time, Maven Black-Briar respects the Thalmor due to them holding power.\nThe majority of Skyrim's more affluent populace are supportive of the Empire, as they feel Ulfric's speeches amount to political posturing and that his underlying motive is to become Skyrim's new High King. Furthermore, some of the Imperial supporters cling to the prosperous trade they have had with Cyrodiil, while others simply believe they have a better chance of defending against the Aldmeri Dominion if they are united with the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; is the military governor of Skyrim and the commander of the Legion in the province. He leads the Imperial war effort. Tullius has only been around for a few months, but has really turned things around for the Empire. A noteworthy event is him directing the ambush, and capturing Ulfric Stormcloak and his top lieutenants at &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. In Skyrim, the Legion is headquartered at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; serving as their field commander.\nInitial territories.\nInitially, both the Empire and the Stormcloak Rebellion control four &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire controls &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, while the Stormcloaks control &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;, Jarl of the central &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, remains uneasily neutral, but he eventually sides with the Empire.\nThalmor influence.\nThe Thalmor plays a role in the Skyrim civil war, certain sources indicate that they are the (indirect) cause of the Civil War in Skyrim. Prior to the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, everyone still had their shrines of Talos. However, when the Thalmor found out about the Empire breaking the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, they demanded the arrest of Ulfric Stormcloak and his militia, at this point the Emperor was also forced to grant the Thalmor access to Skyrim and give them the rights to \"drag people from their houses\" if they worshiped Talos. Ultimately, this is where the war against the Empire truly started. They also played a role at the execution in Helgen, where they tried to save Ulfric Stormcloak from execution, in order to keep the war going. While the Thalmor themselves were unsuccessful in stopping the execution, Alduin's attack on the town allowed Ulfric to escape.\nThe Imperial Legion has sent &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Fasendil\"&gt;Legate Fasendil&lt;/a&gt; to Skyrim to keep an eye on the Thalmor, who suspects that they are behind the unrest in Skyrim. The Thalmor dossier on Ulfric Stormcloak states than an Imperial victory harms the Thalmor's overall position in Skyrim and that a Stormcloak victory should also be avoided. The Thalmor state that they benefit the most from a long war in which neither the Empire, nor the Stormcloaks \"wins\". Even so, the Thalmor provide indirect aid to the Stormcloak rebellion.\nMajor battles.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhiterun Hold had been neutral territory during the Skyrim Civil War, with skirmishes on both sides taking place in the Hold and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greymoor\"&gt;Fort Greymoor&lt;/a&gt; switching hands between the Empire and Stormcloaks on a regular basis. Jarl Balgruuf refused the Legion's right to garrison troops in Whiterun city, on the other hand he also refused to acknowledge Ulfric's claim. After an unknown period of time, Ulfric started planning an attack on Whiterun. Shortly after Balgruuf got to know of this news, he declared his allegiance to the Empire."}

Skywatch is a bustling port-city that was served as the site of the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Skywatch\"&gt;Sack of Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious conflict between the High Elves and the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nSkywatch was built atop of a large plateau overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the area in between the island of Auridon and the province of Valenwood. The surrounding area consists of smaller islands, some of which are occupied by other High Elves. Notable islands include &lt;a href=\"Buraniim%20Isle\"&gt;Buraniim Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Errinorne%20Isle\"&gt;Errinorne Isle&lt;/a&gt;, each housing Ancient Elven ruins. In an alcove underneath Skywatch, the &lt;a href=\"Hightide%20Keep\"&gt;Hightide Keep&lt;/a&gt; has been used as an ancient defense for Skywatch from outside invasions. The beaches of Skywatch are expansive, reaching all across the Skywatch plateau and areas north of the city-state. The city-state of Skywatch ascends from the west and continues upward towards the eastern cliffs. Skywatch City is very open-aired, filled with bountiful gardens and local attractions from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkywatch is a magnificent city with various sights that the local business flaunt throughout the eras. The outside of the Skywatch walls is several caravans and merchants, that temporary house shops. The only business established here is the &lt;a href=\"Sky%27s%20Edge%20Tavern\"&gt;Sky's Edge Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, an open-aired tavern. The Mercantile Road takes a significant portion of West Skywatch, the northern end of the road held the &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20Coinhouse\"&gt;Skywatch Coinhouse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Sleepy%20Eaglet\"&gt;the Sleepy Eaglet&lt;/a&gt;, which is another tavern. The southern end of the road has &lt;a href=\"the%20Watcher%27s%20Forge\"&gt;the Watcher's Forge&lt;/a&gt;, where many of the craftsmen and alchemists do business and sell their wares. The Bridge leading to Upper Skywatch has been used by the peasants and some crafters of the street. Upper Skywatch is vast and is filled with gardens. The nobility comes here to socialize and bask in the abundant flora. Towards the &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20Manor\"&gt;Skywatch Manor&lt;/a&gt;, there is an entrance to an Ancient Elven ruin that is guarded by the Skywatch Mages Guild. South Skywatch is the local dockyards and is the home of the ruffians and riff-raff of Skywatch. The Skywatch Manor is the seat of power in the city, and it is located on the eastern edge of the city-state.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sack of Skywatch &amp; the Sload of Thras.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%201301\"&gt;1E 1301&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Skywatch was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Skywatch\"&gt;Sack of Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;. The battle has gone down in infamy for being one of the bloodiest and terrorizing conflicts in Tamrielic history. The Sload had taken &lt;a href=\"Errinorne%20Isle\"&gt;Errinorne Isle&lt;/a&gt;, just off the coast of Skywatch as a staging ground for the siege. The High Elves of Skywatch were unable to withstand the Sload onslaught, but they had a trump card hidden in their midst. On the Skywatch Plateau, the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Hightide%20Keep\"&gt;Hightide Keep&lt;/a&gt; were used by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; of the region as a wall of defense against foreign invaders. For quite some time, the fortress was abandoned, but it was activated when Skywatch was besieged. The Keep gave the High Elves an advantage in the conflict, breaking the offense that the Sload had given to the city. The battle had come to an end when a Sload Warcaster had swallowed various amounts of dangerous alchemic reagants and dove onto Hightide Keep, causing an explosion that destroyed the Keep, plunging it into the beachfront below.\nSyrabane, the Apprentice God &amp; the All Flags Navy.\nSeveral years later in &lt;a href=\"1E%202260\"&gt;1E 2260&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; King of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; had amassed a large army consisting of the Kingdoms of Tamriel The Grand Navy had participants coming as far as &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged the province and killed many people in its wake. The Plague had originated from the Sload, who had harassed the denizens of Tamriel for generations. Bendu Olo's &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt; had sailed towards the Abecean Sea, destroying the Sload in their path. The Sload who had invaded Skywatch had control over the Island of Errinorne ever since the Sack of Skywatch, making it one of the few times the Sload had control in Tamriel in recent years. &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, a Mage of Summerset had aided the Navy in their invasion over Sload, purging them from Errinorne and the entire province. Syrabane would become a part of the &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Altmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, for his bravery against the Sload and for being involved in the destruction of Thras. Errinorne Isle was abandoned by the Altmer of Skywatch, letting it waste away. The Errinorne Academy is the only remnant of Altmeri architecture on the island.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Veiled Queen; Estre of Skywatch.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Skywatch was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Errinorne\"&gt;House Errinorne&lt;/a&gt;, who was the spouse of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt;, the original heir to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, prior to &lt;a href=\"Ayrenn\"&gt;Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;'s return to the Summerset Isles. Ayrenn assumed the throne of Alinor and established the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of Valenwood and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the Blessed Isles' infamous xenophobia, many nobles of the province were heavily against this, and this included Kinlady Estre. From within the Auridon underground, Estre founded the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, a radical Altmer group with the sole purpose of thwarting the Aldmeri Dominion. Estre took the ruined Errinorne Academy and re-purposed it to become the Heritance headquarters. For quite some time, Estre worked in secret against Ayrenn, having a hand in the assassination attempt in &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlot against the Dominion; the Veil over Auridon.\nNews of the Heritance had spread across the Dominion, and Queen Ayrenn sought an audience with Estre. With news of this, the city of Skywatch hosted a veneration festival for Kinlady Estre, who was the Canonreeve of Skywatch originally. An Agent of the Dominion, known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, was tasked by Queen Ayrenn and &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, to infiltrate the Veiled Heritance that were supposedly in Skywatch. Through sleuthing, the Vestige had rendezvous with an Agent of the Heritance, who was residing in the &lt;a href=\"Barbed%20Hook%20Tavern\"&gt;Barbed Hook Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the Agent took the Vestige to Errinorne Isle, where they would undergo challenges to enter the Veiled Keep. Deep within the ruins, the Vestige had learned about Estre's involvement with the Heritance and escaped the island to tell Ayrenn. When she was told about Estre's betrayal, the Kinlady disappeared from Skywatch and invaded Auridon, beginning with the township of &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreak\"&gt;Dawnbreak&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkywatch during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Skywatch in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Skywatch was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Kalalian%20%28Skywatch%29\"&gt;King Kalalian&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Gialene &amp; her plot against Queen Morgiah.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Morgiah\"&gt;Princess Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; had married &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Karoodil\"&gt;Reman Karoodil&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, naming her the Queen of Firsthold. This had received large amounts of controversy throughout the Summerset Isles and Auridon, especially to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Gialene\"&gt;Lady Gialene&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of the King of Skywatch. Gialene was meant to marry Karoodil to establish peace between the rival kingdoms, but with Morgiah's intervention, her plan was altered. Behind the Court of Firsthold, Gialene had planned a revolution against Morgiah's reign, in the attempt to kill her and take the position of the throne. Gialene had sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Trebbite%20Monks\"&gt;Trebbite Monks&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Friar%20Lylim\"&gt;Friar Lylim&lt;/a&gt;. With these forces, Gialene had secretly ordered the Monks to invade Firsthold.\nKaroodil had left Auridon to deal with pirates in the nearby island of &lt;a href=\"Calluis%20Lar\"&gt;Calluis Lar&lt;/a&gt;, so he was not present. Morgiah had planned the defense, telling the Court and Gialene, who was secretly planning the offense. Morgiah told the Court that she planned to use fire magic to attack and so, Gialene rendezvoused the intel to Lylim, who used &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; magic to guard his troops. However, Morgiah had utilized the Altmeri Archers of the Castle to take down the offense, it was as if Morgiah knew that Gialene was responsible for the attack and lied to her, knowing that she will tell Friar. In the end, Karoodil returned and Gialene was sent back to Skywatch. In the aftermath, Morgiah continued her reign as the Queen of Firsthold, much to the dismay of the denizens of Auridon."}

On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;20th of Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Destruction Mehrunes Dagon may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the Mages Guild, a Temple, or a Witch Coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 20th of Sun's Dusk, the Agent may receive a vision of Mehrunes Dagon, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, the Prince of Destruction requests that a \"child\" of theirs must be \"punished,\" and requests that the Agent carry it out.\nA Chilling Child.\nAccepting the quest reveals that Mehrunes Dagon's child is a frost daedra that has decided to flee to a nearby dungeon. The Agent is therefore dispatched to \"slaughter frostflesh,\" before meeting with an apostle of Mehrunes Dagon's in another town. This apostle will hand the Agent their reward for completing the task before the end of Mehrunes Dagon's deadline, a random number of \"Mundal nights.\"\nWith that the Agent must head to and enter the dungeon, whereupon they may discover a number of frost daedra roaming inside the lair. Regardless, the Agent will know that they have slain Mehrunes Dagon's descendent when they receive the following notification:\n\"Dagon's prey returns to Oblivion.\"\nWith the frost daedra dispatched the Agent must head to the town mentioned by Mehrunes Dagon and meet with their apostle before the time limit expires. The apostle will always appear in a tavern, and will hand the Agent &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt; for completing the quest successfully.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the Mehrunes' Razor by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates. Conversely, failing the quest will result in the Agent losing reputation with the summoner's faction.\nThe changes made to reputation, either by successfully completing or failing the quest are shown below:"}

She will therefore ask the Nerevarine to quell the rebels in the mine.\nEnding a Rebellion.\nIn order to end the Rebellion at Abebaal (northwest of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt;), the Nerevarine is faced with two options: killing their leader, &lt;a href=\"Eleedal-Lei\"&gt;Eleedal-Lei&lt;/a&gt; and the majority of the slaves or convincing him to end it by freeing him. If the Nerevarine chooses to kill Eleedal-Lei they will receive the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Fire%20Storm\"&gt;Ring of Fire Storm&lt;/a&gt;, and, if they kill all the slaves in the mine, the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Toxic%20Cloud\"&gt;Ring of Toxic Cloud&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf however, the Nerevarine chooses to free Eleedal-Lei, they will have to obtain the key (either from Therana, the Lower tower of Tel Branora, or in a crate next to the kwama queen in the mine). Once freed Eleedal-Lei will ask to have the key to free the rest of the slaves and, regardless, end the rebellion. This will result in Ulessen teaching the Nerevarine two command spells as a reward. If the Nerevarine is interested in joining the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Lamps\"&gt;Twin Lamps&lt;/a&gt;, all six slaves count as freed even though the Nerevarine only directly frees Eleedal-Lei."}

{"id": "2947", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2947", "title": "Slavery", "text": "Slavery was a cultural and economic system in which people are treated as property. Slaves were sold, traded, and forced to work for their owners. It is unknown how long slavery was practiced on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, but the oldest mention dates back to the time of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, who enslaved the &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; in the early First Era. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Canonization\"&gt;Saint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, liberator of the slaves. \nHistory.\nAlessian Era.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s kept &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; slaves, when their &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; ruled the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic province&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, the Ayleids worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i divines, but also dealt frequently with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt; for assistance in keeping their slaves in line. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; worshiped a distinct group of divines, who were much more sympathetic to humanity than &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;folk. &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; began to pray to these divines for assistance in freeing her people, in particular &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Nords called &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;.\nKynareth sent her son, the Nordic demi-god hero &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, to advise and aid Alessia. During this period, Morihaus is usually identified as Alessia's lover, though the \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Pelinal\"&gt;Song of Pelinal&lt;/a&gt;\" claims he was embarrassed at his appearance because of her. He helped her to rally the other slaves to her cause. From that moment she was known as the Slave-queen. Kynareth also sent Alessia visions that would aid her fight against her masters. The third of these visions was of another legendary figure of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the infamous &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, who was sent to Alessia to become the leader of her army. Pelinal was a demi-god like Morihaus, and was possibly the &lt;a href=\"Shezarrine\"&gt;Shezarrine&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegional slavery.\n&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Dres.\nHouse Dres is one of the Great Houses of Morrowind. This House found its origins due to a successful slave raid, which secured their position as the primary source of slaves for the other Houses. Even so, the primary source of income for House Dres was their agriculture, with the slavery only coming in as a bonus.\nGreat &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, located in the south of Morrowind, borders the province of Black Marsh. House Dres focuses itself on agriculture, and its saltrice plantations were entirely fueled by slave labor. They are hostile to Imperial law and culture, and particularly opposed the ideas and attempts to limit or remove the practice of slavery. Not just House Dres used slaves to fuel their plantations; within the Ascadian Isles of Vvardenfell the plantations also heavily relied on slave labor, notable plantations using slaves being the &lt;a href=\"Dren%20Plantation\"&gt;Dren Plantation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arvel%20Plantation\"&gt;Arvel Plantation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nDuring the late-Third Era, Morrowind was the only province of Tamriel where slavery was still legal as part of the Armistice. Despite this, abolitionists attempted to put an end to slavery, and aid runaway slaves. While there were many who at least understood the reasoning behind this, the Dunmer of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; despised the abolitionists. Others, while not owning any slaves, opposed the abolitionists due to the fact that the owning of slaves was legal in the province. Some slave owners within the province opposed the outlawing due to them having trust issues with people who weren't slaves. The enslavement of humans, Orcs, Argonians and Khajiit had traditionally been permitted by Morrowind's Dunmer, while in some circumstances, even Dunmer themselves would be sold to slavery. The practice of slavery was uncommon in the districts of House Hlaalu and House Redoran, but very common in the districts of House Telvanni, Dres, and Indoril.\nWithin Morrowind, many Argonians were used for the practice of slavery, despite them being generally poorly suited for the practice. The Dunmer of Morrowind have performed countless slave raids into Black Marsh, and despite the outlawing of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; to do this, the practice persisted, resulting in a deep hatred between Argonian and Dunmer. While less popular among the Ashlanders, who never outlawed slavery, Khajiits were also commonly used by the Great Houses as slaves as well.\nWithin Morrowind, slaves were bound by enchanted slaver bracers. These bracers drained the magicka of the slaves, preventing them from using magic to escape. The only way to get the bracers off is by having the key.\nMost citizens of the Empire presumed that the barbaric practice of slavery would disappear in Morrowind as it adopted Imperial ways. The topic itself caused for little passion, except for Argonian and Khajiiti abolitionists, who were outraged by the Empire's neglect to suppress illegal slave raids. At this time, in 3E 427, slavery was on the wane in the province of Morrowind.\nTwin Lamps.\nTo aid runaway slaves, an organisation known as the Twin Lamps was created, which became the main abolitionist movement in Morrowind. The faction was dedicated to the outlawing of slavery. Notable members were the the Argonians of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;s Argonian Mission, as well as the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Ilmeni%20Dren\"&gt;Ilmeni Dren&lt;/a&gt;, a House Hlaalu member.\nCyrodiil.\nThe Ayleids were well known for their cruel tradition of keeping many slaves. They were said to herd men from all across &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s, al-gemha, men-of-'kreath, men-of-ket &lt;a href=\"Keptu\"&gt;Keptu&lt;/a&gt;, men-of-ge, and al-hared. The &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; put an end to this, and city-states that allied with Alessia, like &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt;, were also forced to transition to a slaveless economy. While not a common practice among Imperials, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; sold captive &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; into slavery after defeating them in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummerset Isles.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; have often kept &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s as slaves, though this practice is usually on the main &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; were also enslaved during the late Second Era, with the most famous being &lt;a href=\"Ulvul%20Llaren\"&gt;Ulvul Llaren&lt;/a&gt;, a slave who betrayed his masters by revealing the secret of forging &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor\"&gt;Elven Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack Marsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; have not traditionally kept slaves, as they despise the enslavement of their kind by the Dunmer. However, under the effects of the Mad &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Xit-Xaht\"&gt;Xit-Xaht&lt;/a&gt; tribe enslaved many of their own species to rebuild the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mazzatun\"&gt;Ruins of Mazzatun&lt;/a&gt;. Argonian mothers would sometimes sell their own children into slavery. In &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, a city in Black Marsh heavily influenced by Morrowind due to being on the province's border, the &lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt; clan kept many slaves in and around the city. They were generally despised by their own kind, whom considered them traitors.\nSkyrim.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Nordic-Falmer War&lt;/a&gt;, most &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; sought refuge with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, but in exchange for protection they had to eat toxic fungus that would blind and eventually degenerate them, while being servants to the Dwemer. Those who agreed became the savage &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, soon becoming slaves to the Dwemer, while most whom declined the deal perished. The Nords also captured many Falmer during their war with them. The Nords mistreated their slaves, being noted for cutting out the tongues of many of them, as well as killing slaves while marching. The city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; was created with slave labor under the command of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;. About as many Falmer were killed by the Nords on their way to the site, as died during construction itself.\nWhile Nords did not keep slaves in the Fourth Era, a colony of Falmer enslaved &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Servant\"&gt;a number of people&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nHammerfell.\nAn Argonian slave known as &lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt; was brought from Black Marsh to &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt; and kept as a slave, before running away and being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Pimsy\"&gt;Pimsy&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the region not being under the control of &lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown what the rest of Hammerfell's views on slavery is.\nElsweyr.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Euraxians\"&gt;Euraxians&lt;/a&gt; kept slaves during their rule over &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutlawing of slavery.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the practice of slavery was first outlawed, long before they became part of the Empire. When the practice of slavery was outlawed in Summerset is never specified, though it must have been after the seventh century of the Second Era. After these provinces, the nations of the Empire outlawed the practice, with Morrowind being the last province to outlaw the practice, by decree of King &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Helseth\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;. The only two Great Houses who are recorded to have let go of all their slaves were Great House Hlaalu and Great House Dres."}

This equipment includes a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Warhammer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric Warhammer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Veloth%27s%20Judgement%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Veloth's Judgement&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Warden's Ring&lt;/a&gt; (which casts a &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dispel&lt;/a&gt; spell) and the &lt;a href=\"Belt%20of%20Balyna%27s%20Soothing%20Balm\"&gt;Belt of Balyna's Soothing Balm&lt;/a&gt;. With that, the Nerevarine may proceed to Galom Daeus, which can be found to the west of &lt;a href=\"Uvirith%27s%20Grave\"&gt;Uvirith's Grave&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside Galom Daeus, the Nerevarine will encounter several vampires, while Berne can be found in the Observatory. Once Berne is killed, the Nerevarine may return to Rotheloth (although there is a lot of valuable loot, including a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shield%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;daedric shield&lt;/a&gt;, within Galom Daeus) to complete the quest.\u00a0"}

She requests the Vestige return the relics to their appropriate places within the crypts.\nAfter defeating several draugr, the Vestige will arrive at the first burial chamber where they will have to decide where to place the Old Nord Cup, which represents and honors the servants of each generation's royal family. Queen Nurnhilde instructs them to inspect the cup carefully to find its appropriate altar. After placing the cup on the simple altar, the Vestige must continue to the second burial chamber. Queen Nurnhilde will explain that upon desecrating the crypt, the Stormfists damaged several books and the Vestige must find the page that was torn from \"&lt;a href=\"Truths%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Truths of the North&lt;/a&gt;\" relic in order to return it to its altar. The book fits perfectly on the altar if they combine the dry page with it. After traversing through the crypts and arriving at the final burial chamber, Queen Nurnhilde tells the Vestige the following.\n\"This is wrong. Something is terribly, terribly wrong.\"\nThe Vestige must rush to the exit of the crypts through a connected tunnel. Upon exiting the crypts, Fildgor will escape and the Vestige is ambushed by three of his soldiers, lead by Shukul gro-Agluk. After disposing of the enemies, they must head back to the fort to report to Captain Hamar, who will inform them Lieutenant Koruni's counterattack was a success and the fort has been recaptured. Queen Nurnhilde will appear behind the Captain and will express her disappointment in her brother to the Vestige, but thanks them for their services and rewards them."}

It is located southwest of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greymoor\"&gt;Fort Greymoor&lt;/a&gt;, south-southeast of &lt;a href=\"Swindler%27s%20Den%20%28Cave%29\"&gt;Swindler's Den&lt;/a&gt;, and east of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Fang%20Cave\"&gt;Broken Fang Cave&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThis &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; camp is the only known place where the mysterious Sleeping Tree is found. The tree grows in the middle of a small pond with a light purple mist coming from its purplish blue water. Two giants and two &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; live in the immediate area. The entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Tree%20Cave\"&gt;Sleeping Tree Cave&lt;/a&gt; is on the west side of the path heading north from the camp.\nSleeping Tree.\nLittle is known about the origins of the Sleeping Tree. &lt;a href=\"Ysolda\"&gt;Ysolda&lt;/a&gt; mentions two ways the tree came into existence:\nRed Mountain.\nPeople believe that when the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted, a piece of it landed in the area, leaving a crater from which a tree grew.\nUmbriel.\nShe also heard the story that it was a spore that fell from a floating island in the sky. If that is the case, then the tree is one of the many types of Hist trees found on &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, which are different from the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; trees found in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarvesting Sleeping Tree Sap.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"spigot\"&gt;spigot&lt;/a&gt; sticking out of the tree, when activated, will yield a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Tree%20sap\"&gt;sleeping tree sap&lt;/a&gt;. Consuming this potion will boost health by 100 points for 45 seconds, but vision becomes purple and distorted and movement speed is decreased.\nIf the spigot is knocked out of the tree then the sap can no longer be gathered, until the cell resets in a month of game time. However, if the spigot is undisturbed the sap can be gathered every three in-game days. A miscellaneous quest allows the sap to be sold to Ysolda for gold after finding the necessary items to trigger it."}

Groups of high-ranking &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; are on hand, and the guards are turning travelers away from the inn. I should try to figure out what's going on.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon nearing Fort Amol, the Vestige will encounter &lt;a href=\"Hokurek\"&gt;Hokurek&lt;/a&gt;, a guard, trying to disperse a group of Dunmer travelers looking to enter the fort's inn. He will tell them &lt;a href=\"King%20Jorunn\"&gt;King Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; leaders are meeting at the fort, and the inn is completely full. When pressing him for information, he will direct the Vestige to Commander Yjarnn, who should have a better idea of what is going on. Commander Yjarnn will tell them the following.\n\"Where's that lazy skeever? I'm going to kill... What do you want? Someone steal your gold pouch or something?\"\nIf I find Thod for you, will you tell me what the King is meeting about? \"I just want this all to be over. We're not used to dealing with so many different groups all in one place. All right. Find Thod and I might let some information slip. We'll leave it at that.\"\nAs Thod was last seen near the King's tents drinking with the Prince's entourage, the Vestige must head there to find information of his whereabouts. A Dunmer named &lt;a href=\"Odrasa%20Saram\"&gt;Odrasa Saram&lt;/a&gt; will reveal Thod tried to drink as much as &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Jeggi%20Gap-Tooth\"&gt;Thane Jeggi Gap-Tooth&lt;/a&gt;, but couldn't keep up and wandered towards the river, where he probably still is. Whatever he was drinking smelled foul and she thinks it was of Argonian origin. Heading towards the river will reveal a path of empty bottles that will eventually lead the Vestige to a passed out Thod. He appears to be soundly asleep, and will not wake up. The Vestige has the option to steal the guard's uniform, which will be practical for later use. When returning to inform Captain Yjarnn of Thod's location, he is nowhere to be found. Instead, the Vestige must speak to &lt;a href=\"Hloenor%20Chill-Owl\"&gt;Hloenor Chill-Owl&lt;/a&gt;, who informs them Thod and the captain just headed to the barracks and he is likely going receive and earful. When the Vestige informs her they have just left Thod, she insists they must have mistaken them for another guard and advises them to head for the barracks on the west side of town to catch up to the captain and Thod.\nOnce there, the Vestige witnesses Captain Yjarnn speaking to a noble named &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vurlop\"&gt;Lord Vurlop&lt;/a&gt;, who both seem frustrated and on-edge. Lord Vurlop introduces himself to the Vestige and explains that he's suspicious of Captain Yjarnn's behavior, but because he can't toss around accusations without evidence, he asks the Vestige to shadow Captain Yjarnn to determine if his suspicions are justified. Trailing the captain will reveal a strange meeting with a woman named &lt;a href=\"Marla\"&gt;Marla&lt;/a&gt;, who has a house in town. The Vestige must search her house to determine the nature of this meeting. Upon entering the house, it is littered with corpses and an alchemy report reveals &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Brigade\"&gt;Stormfist Clan&lt;/a&gt; conspirators have been poisoning the local soldiers and using illusion magic to steal their identities, under orders from &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor Orcthane&lt;/a&gt;. After reading the alchemy report, Marla will appear and attack the Vestige. When she is close to defeat, she will return to her true identity as a Stormfist assassin. \nThe Vestige must return to Hloenor to inform her of the Stormfist impostors. She is, however, still doubtful but after the Vestige insists she visits Marla's house to confirm their story, she will reluctantly give in and reward them."}

This Regent Cassipia wants me to help her stop the Scaled Court's process for creating a new type of creature for their the Serpent's growing army\u2014the mantikora. The first component used in the alchemical process to create the mantikoras comes from the scorpion matron and her nests, deep in the cave called &lt;a href=\"Fearfangs%20Cavern\"&gt;Fearfang&lt;/a&gt;. I need to find the scorpion matron so we can kill her and destroy her nests.\"\n\"A woman named Regent Cassipia has plans for the Scaled Court. It seems she opposes the Serpent.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Vestige will first encounter Regent Cassipia standing alone in a burnt house near Dragonstar. When they approach her, she will tell them: \"Do not be afraid, I am not your enemy.\" When the Vestige initiates dialogue with her, she will say the following:\n\"You and I have a common enemy; the Serpent and his Scaled Court. If you will stay your hand and hear what I have to say, I can offer you a unique opportunity to see this enemy slain. Will you listen to my offer?\"\nIf the Vestige accepts her proposition, they will be tasked with killing the scorpion matron and destroying her nests. Cassipia will accompany them, wearing her Scaled Court disguise. The &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; ruin of Fearfang Cavern is located in northern &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. After the Vestige has made their way to the cavern, they will have to continue on inside. Within the entrance area of the cavern is large library, containing multiple &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; improving books. The Vestige will have to cross the library and make their way to the lower parts of the cavern, where the scorpion matron will be awaiting them. After defeating the matron and destroying her nests, the Vestige will have to speak with Cassipia. She will tell them the following:\n\"These scorpions were specifically selected for their compatibility with the mantikoras. With the matron slain and her nests destroyed, this portion of the process can't be duplicated. I wouldn't have been able to do this without your help.\"\nAfter this conversation, the Vestige will have to make their way to the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Lair\"&gt;Sunken Lair&lt;/a&gt;. There, they will have to defeat &lt;a href=\"Takara%20the%20Eggbearer\"&gt;Takara the Eggbearer&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the creature's eggs. Takara is located early into the cave, and is not hard to find. After the Vestige has defeated Takara, they will have to meet Cassipia near Dragonstar, where she will task them with her final request: Destroying the progenitor mantikora located in &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Serpent's Nest&lt;/a&gt;. There are several prisoners being held in Serpent's Nest, whom the Vestige will have to free. After entering Serpent's Nest, the Vestige will have to make their way to the lower area of the cavern. Located in a large, open area of the cavern are three &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lamias&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Aurieae\"&gt;Aurieae&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laurieae\"&gt;Laurieae&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taurieae\"&gt;Taurieae&lt;/a&gt;. Note that defeating these bosses is optional, and not required to complete the quest. The Vestige will have to enter the Spawning Pools Chamber area of the caverns, where they will find several blood-filled lakes holding prisoners. The Vestige will have to kill the pair of guards guarding each prisoner to release them. After they have done so, they will have to slay &lt;a href=\"Hruzizolk\"&gt;Hruzizolk&lt;/a&gt;, and confront Regent Boward, a high-ranking member of the Scaled Court. The Vestige will, however, not have to defeat him. Instead, Cassipia will cast a spell on him, completely obliterating him. After the Vestige has witnessed Cassipia doing so, they will have to enter a portal created by her to return to Craglorn. There, they must speak to Cassipia and receive their reward."}

{"id": "2823", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2823", "title": "Sload", "text": "The Sload, also referred to as Slugmen, are an amphibious, slug-like, &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;bestial&lt;/a&gt; race native to the isles of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Well known for their mastery of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, they are arguably the most hated race amongst the people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Sload are believed to have lived on Thras since the earliest years of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, but other sources imply that they also used to live in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that the most ancient ruins of Summerset were large coral structures seemingly created by the Sload. While some believe this means the Sload may have considered the Isles part of their kingdom, it is also speculated that the Isles may have been considered part of Thras as a whole. The lost first and second ships (the latter named &lt;a href=\"Pasquiniel\"&gt;Pasquiniel&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href=\"Topal\"&gt;Topal&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet are thought to have possibly been sunken by &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;, Sload, or &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, a legendary &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; king from the Merethic Era, was known to have a wine sack made from a Sload, implying he had some form of contact with them. Since before recorded time, the Sload were said to have frequently raided the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i inhabitants of the Isles, often conjuring up horrific sea beasts to do the work they were physically incapable of. The master archer of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;, Ondre Veloth, is recorded as having fought the Sload at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Nabia\"&gt;Lake Nabia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; for nine days before his defeat. Since the earliest &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; settlers landed in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;, the Sload had taken advantage of their custom of burying criminals on islands off of the coast, with the bodies being used for necromantic practice and small invasions into the mainland. While the Redguards eventually removed these raiders, sightings of Sload living along the coast of Hammerfell have continued into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Siege of Skywatch.\nOne of those most notable and brutal invasions, orchestrated by the Sload, occurred at the city of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; on the northern coast of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201301\"&gt;1E 1301&lt;/a&gt;. During the invasion, the Sload first conquered the small &lt;a href=\"Errinorne%20Isle\"&gt;Isle of Errinorne&lt;/a&gt;, the eastern most island of the Summerset Isles, using diseases to their advantage. The Altmer inhabitants of Skywatch coordinated a staunch defense of the city, primarily resisting from a sprawling citadel known as &lt;a href=\"Hightide%20Keep\"&gt;Hightide Keep&lt;/a&gt;. From the citadel, the Altmer utilized powerful magical constructs to destroy dozens of Sload ships. The defense held up until a Sload Warcaster consumed volatile alchemy reagents and leaped to the base of the cliff resulting in a massive explosion, toppling the citadel into the sea and allowing for the Sloads conquest of the city. Unfortunately for the Sload, they were unable to hold the city for very long and were quickly removed. Despite this, the Sload held out on Errinorne for close to a thousand years before eventually being wiped out by a remnant of the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;. Errinorne became devastated, and was left abandoned and in ruins rather than rebuilt due to being deemed indefensible.\nThe Thrassian Plague.\nThe Sload-engineered Thrassian Plague is by far the most devastating attack organized by the race, and certainly one of the most horrible events in Tamrielic history. Appearing within the western mainland as early as &lt;a href=\"1E%202200\"&gt;1E 2200&lt;/a&gt;, the plague was responsible for the deaths of more than half of Tamriel's population at the time, as well as large amounts of livestock. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202260\"&gt;1E 2260&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; had the King of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, Baron-Admiral &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt;, assemble the largest coalition of Tamrielic navies in history, the All Flags Navy, and set siege to the Isles of Thras. On the way to Thras, many of the ships were lost in a storm seemingly conjured up by the Sload, but it was unable to stop the fleet. The All Flags Navy arrived at the shores of Thras and slaughtered the hopeless defenders of the beaches along with any other Sload they came across, in an event known as the Fall of the Sload. While some sources claim Thras was sunk with powerful magicks used by the fleet, primary sources appear to imply that the Isles were purposely sunk by the Sload, with the purposeful demolition of their coral tower, in an effort to halt the invasion and destroy a large portion of the opposing fleet. It is said that the God/Arch-Warlock\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0aided Bendu Olo in his conquest of Thras, and was responsible for destroying the plague that ravaged Tamriel with &lt;a href=\"Warlock%27s%20Ring%20%28Item%29\"&gt;his ring&lt;/a&gt;. Thras was reported to have risen from the sea again some time prior to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s conquests.\nThe War of the Uvichil.\nThe War of the Uvichil was another attempted invasion of the Summerset Isles by the Sload. The war lasted from &lt;a href=\"1E%202911\"&gt;1E 2911&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1E%202917\"&gt;1E 2917&lt;/a&gt; and is remembered for the Sloads use of necromantic rituals and infernal machines.\nWarp in the West.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, it was said the Sload Priests talk to their new God of Worms. Only a few Sload Necromancers operate successfully in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, and even then they are only active near the coast. During the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; debate regarding outlawing Necromancy, &lt;a href=\"Ulliceta%20gra-Kogg\"&gt;Ulliceta gra-Kogg&lt;/a&gt; said Necromancers are the scourge of Tamriel, whether operating independently or in concert with the sloads or King of Worms.\nBiology.\nThe Sload begin their lives as tiny, amorphous, non-sentient grubs that eventually evolve into squishy, aquatic, octopus-looking creatures known as polwygles during adolescence. The larvae and polwygle stage that Sload take at birth is sometimes collected by matured Sload and used in the creation of a rare, potent, alchemical mixture known as '&lt;a href=\"Sload%20Soap\"&gt;Sload Soap&lt;/a&gt;'. It is believed by many, including the renowned mage, &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, that the dreadful gastropods that were responsible for spreading the Thrassian plague, were actually mutated forms of the Sload larvae. The most commonly seen stage of Sload is that of the adult, which appear as large, bipedal, slug-like creatures, known for their highly obscene odor. Younger adults lack the ability of self-reliance and are normally not seen on land, while older adults, due to their extreme weight, are completely immobile unless buoyed in water. Sload are said to be very slow moving, and have extremely limited grasping ability, hindering tool use. Sload, at birth, are hermaphroditic until they grow old enough to walk on land, in which their reproductive organs are absorbed into their bodies. Fully matured Sload are incapable of reproduction and do not care for any of the offspring that they have spawned beforehand. For these reasons, it is generally assumed that Sload are incapable of mating with other races such as Men, Elves, or Beastmen, and are not considered \"human\".\nThey are rumoured to have sixty-seven pain centers, compared to Argonians having fifty-two.\nLiteracy.\nWhile early observations claimed that the Sload were incapable of reading or writing, a feared Sload necromancer, &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;, was later known to have written his own book, \"&lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta%21%20Kvata%21%20Kvakis%21\"&gt;N'Gasta! Kvata! Kvakis!&lt;/a&gt;\", in the unique Sload-language during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Sload are said to be blessed with perfect memory and are capable of remembering everything they have seen or heard.\nPersonality.\nSload are stated to have careful and deliberate personalities. They possess incredibly strong minds and are very quick thinkers, though this natural gift is generally hampered by the Sload's incredibly cautious nature. Sload attempt to meticulously consider every possible consequence of an action before it is undertaken, resulting in a very slow decision making process. They are capable of answering questions quickly, but, oftentimes, choose not to. The average Sload is said to be very self-centered and calculating, often scheming for their own benefit and interests, breaking laws when they believe there will be meager consequences. Sload have a rather clear lack of morality, having no issues with committing acts of blasphemy, theft, torture, kidnapping, murder, genocide, or other similar atrocities. Sload are unable to sincerely display notable human emotions beyond that of greed. They, however, have an impressive natural talent to act out human emotions, allowing for notable competence in diplomacy, but often do so in seemingly exaggerated parodies, such as laughing at bad jokes, or weeping at slight misfortunes. The Sload do not have any affinity with the concept of honor, friendship, or any form of loyalty, only showing a strange respect to those who are able to defeat or trick them. N'Gasta, the only known Sload to speak &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt;, referred to himself in third person when speaking, in a similar manner that &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; often do.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nThe culture of the Sload is largely based around magic, most notably Necromancy. Every land traversing Sload knows how to use the &lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt; spell as teleportation is the most efficient form of travel in Thras, due to the innate physical ineptitudes of the Sload. The natural personality of the Sload is based around greed and self-absorption, causing them to gain a well-known reputation as excellent merchants and smugglers. The Sload frown upon recklessness, and view mindfulness as a trait of the greatest value. All known heroes in Sload myth spend their time contemplating for years on end until they finally act, in which they always succeed; villains, on the other hand, are always quick thinking, brash, and doomed to fail. The Sload are so adamant in this demeanor that in their language, the best known translation for the word \"adventure\" means \"tragic disaster\". Very little is known about any form of cultural leadership amongst the Sload, but one rare text briefly speaks of a bloated, eldritch, corpulent mass with a pulsating head and three eyes upon its belly, referred to as the \"Elder Distended One.\" Why the Sload are so belligerent to other races is not fully understood by the scholars of Tamriel. The only known race the Sload have ever had any diplomatic contact with was the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;, due to their mutual hostilities against all other races. Despite this, there are more recorded accounts of conflict between the two races than alliances.\nNecromancy.\nThe Sload are notorious for their adeptness in the necromantic arts, often being claimed to be Tamriel's most famous necromancers. Sload have reportedly utilized &lt;a href=\"Airships\"&gt;Airships&lt;/a&gt; to carry massive amounts of corpses from &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; to Thras, and that an eerily large number of slaves are purchased by Sload merchants in &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;, whom are implicitly killed and revived as thralls. While Sload have never been observed to practice necromancy on their own kind within Tamriel, it would not be beyond belief that they do so in Thras. It is true that Sload use massive amounts of their own larvae in necromantic rituals, and have on Thras, been known to revive various dead sea-creatures, such as crabs and turtles, as pets of some sort. &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;, possibly the most notable Sload relative to Tamrielic records, found himself in the service of the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Worms\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;. The King gifted N'Gasta &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20N%27Gasta\"&gt;an island&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; where he could practice his necromantic rituals and Daedra dealings. It is rumored that this type of settling was almost common-place for Sload, setting up laboratories on old Redguard burial grounds built off the coast of the mainland. While invading other lands, Sload almost always use necromancy to their advantage, infamous for conjuring massive sea monsters along coastal regions.\nReligion.\nWhile the Sload are normally said to not worship any gods, some speculate based on their strange ceremonies, that they do practice some form of religion, be it ancestor worship, preservation of ancient magicks, or some other completely foreign pantheon. The Sload are known to practice ritualistic sacrifice to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, but they seem to be approached from a purely business standpoint, rather than a form of worship. More unorthodox Sload customs speak of them spending years grooming certain individuals to reenact incredibly long scenes from Sload myth which conclude with each of the actors being killed by the voluntary ingestion of \"desiccation crystals.\" The Sload, as a people, have a strange, unheard of, respect for the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Worms\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, no doubt due to his association with necromancy, who made some form of alliance with their race. Many of their kind considered him to be a hero to their race. It is even said that upon his ascension to godhood, that some Sload willingly communed with him.\nCuisine.\nA drink known as &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Chai\"&gt;Thrassian Chai&lt;/a&gt; was sometimes sold by drink vendors during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, though whether or not this beverage was an actual conception of the Sload can not be said with certainty. They were also known to have selectively bred the &lt;a href=\"Tangerine%20Dragon%20Frog%20%28Pet%29\"&gt;Tangerine Dragon Frog&lt;/a&gt; so that they could notice it more easily in their isles, and while some scholars say the Sload keep them as pets, the Sload word for them translates to \"snack,\" implying they eat them as a delicacy.\nArchitecture.\nSload architecture is immediately recognizable due to the use of coral as their main building material. Within the large brackish lagoon of the atoll that makes up Thras, there lies a massive network of coral constructions and ancient shipwrecks which the Sload reportedly use for quick transit between the isles, along this network lies a multitude of submerged towers. The floors of every land-based building on Thras is said to be covered with several inches of slime covered water.\nCertain texts speak of two enormous coral towers constructed by the Sload within Thras.\nThe Coral Tower.\nThe Coral Tower was an incredibly large, blood-red coral structure built upon an isle of Thras. The tower was reported to have 'reached into the sky' and had been tipped with a large, flickering blue light. During the invasion of Thras by the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;All Flags Navy&lt;/a&gt;, the light was said to pulse and bleed energy, making the island crack and sink along with collapsing the tower. The Tower's collapse generated a great whirlpool that engulfed a large portion of the attacking fleet. It has been speculated that this structure may have actually been one of &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;The Towers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pillar of Thras.\nThe Pillar of Thras was a thousand-foot-tall spiral of coral used primarily by the Sload for ritualistic sacrifice. Its location, looking over a massive unending whirlpool known as the 'Maelstrom of Bal', has led many to believe that it is, itself, a reconstruction of the Coral Tower. Sload are often brought to the peak of the tower and tossed into the whirlpool, where they either die from the water and rocks below, or vanish into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;."}

Anna\u00efg's knowledge of the ingredients brought from Tamriel and her natural instict made her the most valuable staff in Qijne's kitchen.

The creature blamed Slyr of the crime, and Toel allowed Phmer to deal with her."}

Now, they are all paying the cost of ignorance. &lt;a href=\"The%20Sunken%20One%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;The Sunken One&lt;/a&gt; strikes swift and hard. He swats those who oppose Him as if they did not exist at all. The excuses of man fall upon deaf ears. The Sunken One has no pity; He has no mercy, He only sits below and passes sentence. And now, with a mighty stroke, He's toppled one of man's pitiful blights on His land. And yet, He still hungers. His appetite is voracious. Kvatch will not be the last city to fall by His hand. The world of man grows more and more corrupt, and it angers Him. Man's lies and deceit will be his undoing as The Sunken One grows impatient and no longer waits for or accepts the proper offering.\nThe burden is mine to shoulder. I am the last who knows of He Who Shakes The Ground. If I do not bring him the Offering, who knows what city may fall prey to his whim? &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;?

I must get the Offering to him like my father did before me. Man may be fallen in His eyes, but they must have time to learn The Sunken One's teachings.

If anyone finds this page, let them know that I, Slythe Seringi, do this for the good of all man.\nPage 2.\nAs I descend into the depths of Sandstone Cavern, I wonder to myself... why? Why would The Sunken One test me so? Have I not been loyal? Have I not spread His word? Have I not obeyed His laws? This journey has been cruel and unfair. I've nearly met my end more than once. I don't know if I can make it to His home. But no, I cannot think this way! I must get there! I must see Him. If I do not, then the world of man is doomed. I dare not tarry longer, as I do not wish to suffer His wrath. I must get the Offering to Him.\nPage 3.\nI have failed. I will not reach Him in time. And because of me, man is doomed.

If you pick a floor number that is lower, the rewards are significantly reduced. Rewards consist of a random set of items and experience. Value of both increases the further you go.\nEach reward requires an amount of experience: match it and the reward is added to inventory and a new reward created with new experience requirement. Completing a floor with at least one kill, also grants experience that counts towards the reward. Rewards include &lt;a href=\"Chests%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Golden and better chests&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn average there will be 2\u20134 monsters per floor or one dragon. There is no blacksmith and no other way to repair your gear. This will be the thing that will stop you eventually from proceeding further."}

This led to widespread resentment from Argonians and slave revolts became quite common in Morrowind, particularly near the end of the Third Era, with the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt;. Coincidentally, Argonian armies in Black Marsh were warned of the upcoming Oblivion Crisis by the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, and were thus prepared before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s opened. A radical faction in Black Marsh called the An-Xileel rallied the armies of Black Marsh into fighting the hordes of Daedra invading their home. They poured into Mehrunes Dagon's &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; and fought the Daedra on their own turf so successfully the &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; Lieutenants closed their gates to prevent being overrun.\nWhile Morrowind and the Imperial forces in Black Marsh were still reeling from the consecutive catastrophes of the Oblivion Crisis and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the An-Xileel invaded Morrowind. Their motivations for doing so vary. Some sources indicate Thalmor incitement, whereas others imply a desire for revenge after millenia of enslavement and abuse, or a desire for expansion. Even others state that the invasion of Morrowind was done at the command of the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; directly.\nThe invasion.\nThe Argonians invaded Morrowind in &lt;a href=\"4E%206\"&gt;4E 6&lt;/a&gt;, devastating the southern half of the province. Little is known about the course of the invasion, save that &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; was sacked and the army of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; was able to halt the Argonian advance. It is implied that the Argonian forces managed to go as far north as the city of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;, on Vvardenfell. Likewise, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, or rather, the Scathing Bay which existed in its place, was claimed by the Argonian forces. At the bay, the Argonians perform rituals on occassion. Some Argonians settled in southern Morrowind, though they probably suffered when &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; flew across the land. The Imperial Legion garrisons on the border remained cut off by Red Mountain's &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;eruption&lt;/a&gt;, and were insufficient in defending &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; from the An-Xileel.\nAftermath.\nThe war took a great toll on Morrowind, with thousands dead and many Dunmer forced to flee, scattering across to the other provinces and countries of Tamriel. To help remedy the crisis, the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; granted refugees the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; for future use. Despite this, many still headed northwest into Skyrim, mostly stopping at &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Some Argonian clans still live within Morrowind's borders, and engage in combat with Dunmer settlements."}

I can collect my cake by finding the baker and his bakery barge in the ports of &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and the Harbor District of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Jubilee%20Cake%20Voucher\"&gt;Jubilee Cake Voucher&lt;/a&gt; for free from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt; and activating it, the Vestige will initiate the quest. The first objective will be to find Chef Donolon and speak with him. Chef Donolon can be found in his bakery stall in the dock areas of Vulkhel Guard, Davon's Watch and Daggerfall. When speaking to him, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"It's like this whenever I arrive in a new city. Everyone wants one of my cakes. That's why they call me Wizard of Whisking, you know. I wonder if anyone here received one of my rare cake voucher? Those luckey netches are in for a special treat!\"\nThe Vestige can find all three ingredients near Chef Donolon, on the dock and in his boat. Honey can be found in several nearby barrels, flour in flour sacks, and bananas on top of one of the barrels. Apples and Bittergreen can also be found here.\nThe Vestige also has two other options; stealing the ingredients, or purchasing them from &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. The latter option will, however, cost the Vestige a lot of , and may prove to be difficult for low-level players. Most to all &lt;a href=\"grocers\"&gt;grocers&lt;/a&gt; will have at least one of the ingredients in stock.\nIf the Vestige does not possess the sufficient amount of gold to purchase the ingredients, they may also find or steal them. This method may take significantly longer than purchasing the items, but will cost the Vestige nothing. The bananas and honey can be found in any crates, barrels or sacks, while the flour is only found in flour sacks. While flour sacks can be difficult to come across, most grocers have one or several in their booth.\nAfter the Vestige has gathered all the necessary ingredients, they must return to Chef Donolon who will tell them the following:\n\"Welcome back to Chef Donolon's famous traveling bakery barge! Were you able to gather the ingredients I need to make you your cake?\"\nCan I have my cake now? \"Cake? I don't know. This one came out so well, I might just keep it for myself. Just kidding! You earned this special cake. Wait until you taste it! I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised.\"\nAfter this, the Vestige will receive their reward, and the quest will be completed."}

A common one for those not yet on the path: What type of bones should we use to attain harmony with death? Another: If I meditate two hours each day, will I achieve harmonic transcendence faster?\nQuestions like these underline how focused on life these students remain. Wondering what types of bones we use places the attention on checklists, questions of right and wrong ways to do things, and labels applied to living things, which takes it away from that moment when your life, as you know it, ends. Putting a time limit on meditation reminds you of the construct of time, which ticks away with each breath you take while living. In death, time is meaningless. Acknowledgement of time's passage can limit your ability to achieve harmony with death as a result. To help both students and masters, I provide my own thoughts below for knowing where students are on their paths. Your experiences may, of course, vary.\nFirst, a student needs to grapple with the concept of \"harmony with death.\" I assign any who have not yet done this meditations to practice. When they question their attachment to the living world and start struggling with the discomfort of life's uncertainty, they have opened their minds enough to start walking the path. And only when they are comfortable with the idea of their own deaths are they ready to take that first step.\nStudents fail when they cannot find that path.\nSecond, a student needs to understand that everyone's path toward harmonic transcendence is different. Those who have found the path still seek certainty of a sort: What is the next step? What does this journey look like? What should I avoid? What should I make sure I do?\nAll these questions are natural, but they also point toward an attachment with \"right\" and \"wrong.\" Again, the path to harmonic transcendence varies from individual to individual. When these students feel comfortable not knowing for sure where their next step will land, they are on their correct paths. More specific indicators than that are useless because, again, their paths are their own. Also, the feeling of comfort with uncertainty differs for each individual.\nStudents fail when they cannot follow their own path.\nThird, you need to understand that harmonic transcendence, once achieved, is never retained indefinitely. You make the choice repeatedly to remain within that space of harmonic transcendence\u2014to retain your harmony with death.\nEven masters fail in this. That does not mean that they have failed to be masters. Indeed, acceptance of this failure, after they have already traveled their path long enough to achieve harmony, is a hallmark of a master."}

Possessing highly honed skills in agility and balance, they are especially adept at scaling walls, running, jumping, and tumbling. Due primarily to their stealthy characteristics, Acrobats retain a high ability to score critical hits when in combat. They also possess an uncanny ability to leap great distances and climb more quickly and confidently than the average thief. Acrobats are some of the fleetest characters in any game.\nBecause of their nimble agility, acrobats are difficult to hit or strike in combat, and can be dangerous adversaries. To retain their nimbleness and swiftness of foot, acrobats typically use light armor and rarely carry shields. Acrobats are typically adept at using such weapons as &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt;, short swords, broadswords, tantos, and short bows.\nDescription.\nAcrobats are traditionally entertainers, aiming to amaze audiences with displays of great gymnastic skills. Such skills also make them great cat burglars and second-story men, able to gain entrance to any building without attracting notice, and to effectively discourage pursuit if noticed. Leaping, rolling, and dodging, their art is to leave less agile, less swift pursuers behind. In terms of adventuring, their agility make Acrobats great tomb raiders.\nAn Acrobat is a stealth-oriented and very agile class. Their basic &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt; strategy is to initiate attack with a stealth hit, then outmaneuver their adversaries, and &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; any incoming blows.\n&lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; is, of course, the principal &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; of the Acrobat. Lacking any skill in the wearing of &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, which slows them down too much, or knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; to give the ability cast &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Oblivion%20Spell%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, the Acrobat needs to be able to dodge any incoming attacks. Acrobatics also allows for the Acrobat to access hard-to-reach places, a useful ability in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcrobats also make great assassins due to their skills with &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and their Marksman, &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Security&lt;/a&gt; skills.\nSecurity and Sneak are the skills of a &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, but, as mentioned above, many Acrobats use their skills in a life of crime.\nAny entertainer needs a knowledge of the likes and dislikes of their audience, a skill that also comes in handy in conversation. Because of this, many Acrobats are very skilled in &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlade and Block are the close-combat skills of the Acrobat, skill in each is useful if performing juggling acts involving knives and the like. When in combat, an Acrobat may prefer to use a dagger or &lt;a href=\"Shortswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shortsword&lt;/a&gt;, as they allow for very quick and agile strikes, and can also be used to block faster than a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Claymores%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;claymore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Longswords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;longsword&lt;/a&gt;. As mentioned above, the Acrobat usually lacks any protection, so must block or dodge any damage. An Acrobat also tends not to commit to slower power attacks, but rather fast strikes that can more easily be changed into a parrying move. But it is good to invest in &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt;, as heavy or equally skilled fighters can prove troublesome in combat. Utilizing &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Health\"&gt;Drain Health&lt;/a&gt; can be really helpful and make combat quick and easy."}

Fortunately, many dungeons have alternate routes that are only accessible via a very high Acrobatics skill. These alternate routes allow for a skilled acrobat to run the dungeon in reverse and get to loot quickly. Also, while attacking, it is useful to be able to jump over enemies or fall from heights that will kill them if they follow. It can also be used to travel faster, because it is possible with Acrobatics to jump on buildings and similar obstacles."}

These effects can be\u00a0negative,\u00a0positive, or both, and\u00a0have varied durations. The Active Effects menu is found in the magic section of the player interface and lists the effects currently impacting the player. Active effects can be derived from &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, eating &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20item\"&gt;enchanted item&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Abilities&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Books\"&gt;Black Books&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of active\u00a0effects.\nPotions &amp; poisons.\nPotions and poisons function in similar fashion but are opposites. Potions typically aid the player while poisons have negative effects.\u00a0If a mixture has both positive and negative effects it is considered a potion and is drinkable, only affecting the drinker.\u00a0\nThe player must drink the potions for any effect to take place. These effects are typically positive such as &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restore Health&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nPoisons have a negative effect on the recipient. Typical poisons are not drinkable and are instead applied to weapons.\u00a0\nEating alchemy ingredients.\nThe player can choose to eat an alchemy ingredient. When doing so, the first effect of that ingredient is revealed. If one has the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; perk Experimenter more may be revealed as well. When eating an alchemy ingredient the first effect will be applied to the player for a short period of time. For example, eating a &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Mushroom%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;glowing mushroom&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will give the player the active effect &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Shock\"&gt;Resist Shock&lt;/a&gt;.\nFood items.\nFood items can be eaten by the player usually restoring health points. Food is not essential for survival in any of \u00a0games.\nEnchanted items.\nEquipping\u00a0enchanted items allows the wearer\u00a0to take on that magical quality, which will then be listed in the Active Effects menu. The magical item will affect the wearer for as long as it remains equipped. Also, the player can be negatively impacted by being struck with an enchanted weapon. For example, when hit with\u00a0a weapon enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Absorb Magicka&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0the player will lose a set amount of magicka in addition to the health lost from the strike. The absorb magicka effect will register in the Active Effects menu for as long as it is active.\nAbilities.\nAbilities are magical effects that alter some of the\u00a0player's stats and skill values. There are many types of abilities, depending on the duration and acquisition of the ability:\nSpells.\nSpells\u00a0have a temporary magical impact on the caster or on the target of the spell. For example, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0spell &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms\"&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/a&gt; gives\u00a0all recipients increased combat abilities, stat boosts\u00a0in three disciplines, and increased &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt;."}

At some time prior to &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, Ada'Soom amassed a large army of Kamal warriors and sailed west to the neighboring continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic interrogations of his captured soldiers yielded little results as barely any of them spoke &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt;, though one report revealed that Dir-Kamal was searching for something or someone known as the &lt;a href=\"Ordained%20Receptacle\"&gt;Ordained Receptacle&lt;/a&gt;. Dir-Kamal lead his army through the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and passed by the coasts of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; peninsula of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkyrim.\nDir-Kamal's ships landed at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. In 2E 572, Dir-Kamal attacked the northeast coast of Skyrim.\nAda'Soom was responsible for the sacking of Windhelm whilst in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and only the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; was left undestroyed, although it was heavily damaged. During this battle, the Queen, &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;, and her short-lived successor, Princess &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;, were killed.\nMorrowind.\nAda'Soom is also known to have fought in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; summoned help from the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; army. It has also been suggested that the Underking was actually &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, but this fact is disputed. In actuality, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; helped the Tribunal, with his Nordic army, and the help of &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;. Along with &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"shellbacks\"&gt;shellbacks&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0the three races fought off the invasion at &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and crushed Dir-Kamal's army. This led to the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, which would participate in the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; ten years later. Dir-Kamal was then killed at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; by Almalexia and the Underking in 2E 572.\nLegacy.\nAda'Soom Dir-Kamal is still remembered on Tamriel as the most famous member of his race. Following his death, many of his remaining soldiers fled to &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to hide from the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Attrebus\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt;, who ordered that all foreigners in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; be executed. The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; gladly provided Dir-Kamal's remaining warriors a safe haven in their city. Years later, the remnants of Dir-Kamal's warriors resurfaced and seized the Imperial Throne from Attrebus' successors. Allied with the Khajiit, the Kamal attempted to rebuild the Empire, but the operation was deemed a failure."}

He spent much of his career hunting down the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe continues to serve the Imperial Legion until a certain point in the Dark Brotherhood questline, when he retires to &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;, as a Dark Brotherhood assassin, then tracks him down and assassinates him. He is succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Civello\"&gt;Giovanni Civello&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAs said by Phillida's successor, Giovanni Civello, Phillida fought the Dark Brotherhood every day of his life and, according to the Dark Brotherhood member &lt;a href=\"Ocheeva\"&gt;Ocheeva&lt;/a&gt;, Phillida tended to \"make their lives uncomfortable\" when their contracts took them to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Phillida had vowed to bring the leaders of the Brotherhood to justice, the Brotherhood targeted him for assassination twice, but failed on both occasions. Phillida reportedly uncovered thirteen separate attempts by citizens to contact the Dark Brotherhood. One of these included the unfortunate &lt;a href=\"Claudius%20Arcadia\"&gt;Claudius Arcadia&lt;/a&gt;, who was locked up in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt; and whose house was seized and made into an Imperial Legion outpost. He defended the Imperial City for 40 years, 25 as the Legion Commander.\nPersonality.\nAdamus Philida is a very famous guard of the Imperial Legion. Many praise him for his skills, by which he became Commander of the Imperial Legion and is known throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps his best known trait is his loathing for the Dark Brotherhood, a feeling which is mutual due to his actions against them. As head of the Legion in Cyrodiil, Phillida made it his personal mission to eradicate the shadowy organisation and prevent them from operating successfully. This included interrupting contracts, killing members of the Brotherhood and making the act of summoning them punishable by life imprisonment.\nPhillida is known to have discounted the rumors about the presence of a &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil, and denied &lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Lex\"&gt;Hieronymus Lex&lt;/a&gt;'s requests of having a bounty placed on &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;the Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;'s head.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Permanent%20Retirement\"&gt;Permanent Retirement&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdamus Phillida has pledged his life to destroying the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Hero accepts the Dark Brotherhood quest \"Permanent Retirement,\" Phillida retires and takes up residence in the &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;City Watch&lt;/a&gt; barracks just outside Leyawiin. He follows a strict schedule and is protected only by a single, inexperienced &lt;a href=\"Adamus%20Phillida%27s%20Bodyguard\"&gt;bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0It is in this vulnerable state that he is being\u00a0targeted by the Dark Brotherhood for the final time, both to remove an old rival, and to send a message to whoever follows him that the Brotherhood is not to be trifled with. The Hero of Kvatch is sent to Leyawiin to do the deed.\nDialogue.\n\"What is it, citizen?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Permanent%20Retirement\"&gt;Permanent Retirement&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Do we know each other?

The slaying occurred in the sleepy town of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, where Phillida had chosen to spend the remainder of his days. It was to be a life of quiet solitude, far removed from the hustle and bustle of the Imperial City, where Phillida had served the Imperial Legion proudly for more than twenty-five years.But even in retirement, the noble Legion commander could not escape his past. Throughout the years, Adamus Phillida had become a rather vocal opponent of the Dark Brotherhood and its practices, and vowed to expose the organizations' secrets and bring its leaders to justice. Indeed, Phillida had been targeted for assassination twice in the past, but both attempts were thwarted by the commander and his Legion soldiers. Sadly, his luck ran out in Leyawiin.When asked if there was any doubt as to the Dark Brotherhood's involvement in Phillida murder, newly appointed Imperial Legion commander &lt;a href=\"Giovanni%20Civello\"&gt;Giovanni Civello&lt;/a&gt; had this to say:\"It was the Dark Brotherhood, all right. No question about it. This was a crime of vengeance, a despicable act of hatred and evil against a pinnacle of nobility and virtue. Adamus fought the Dark Brotherhood every day of his life, and he died for what he believed in. Adamus Phillida was a great man. He taught me everything I know, and I'll be damned if I let his dream die with him. From this day forward, I vow to destroy the Dark Brotherhood and everything they stand for!\"Adamus Phillida may be dead, but it would seem his fight against the Dark Brotherhood lives on in Giovanni Civello and the rest of the Imperial Legion. There may soon come a day when those bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s have more to fear than the good people of the Imperial Province."}

He's not entirely clear on the details, but thinks that one of his people or &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Syl\"&gt;Lady Syl&lt;/a&gt;, the Duchess of &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, has more information.\nFind &lt;a href=\"Wide-Eye\"&gt;Wide-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; who generally stays in Thadon's throne room. She will say the Chalice is in &lt;a href=\"Dunroot%20Burrow\"&gt;Dunroot Burrow&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to her further, one learns that the Burrow is inhabited by a unique form of &lt;a href=\"Elytra%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt; that are somehow connected with the Chalice and Felldew.\nTravel to Dunroot Burrow where there will be an Elytra outside that glows with a green hue. This means that the Elytra is carrying Felldew. Kill it and make sure to take the Felldew. It must be ingested in order to enter the Burrow.\nAlthough Felldew is technically an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;, its only effect is \"Felldew Effect\" and cannot be mixed with any ingredient but a &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Order\"&gt;Heart of Order&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Greenmote\"&gt;Greenmote&lt;/a&gt;. Once this quest is over, Felldew is useful only for its resale value.\nFelldew has the characteristics of an addictive drug. Once taken, it gives \"Felldew Euphoria,\" a +20 bonus to &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, however, the effects will lessen and withdrawal will set in. One must continuously ingest Felldew or one's attributes, (and eventually health), will deteriorate. At any point these withdrawal effects are neutralized by ingesting a single unit of Felldew.\nOnce inside the Burrow, make sure to check each Elytra for Felldew. The ones who carry it are easy to spot by their greenish glow. While not incredibly common, there should be enough Felldew in the Burrow to allow some exploration while avoiding withdrawal. While under the influence of Felldew (Felldew Euphoria), the Felldew-carrying Elytra will not attack you.\nIf in a dead end, look for ramps made of roots that climb upward. The second level of the Burrow is called the Kelp Fen. It is a large pool of standing water in which many &lt;a href=\"Red%20Kelp\"&gt;Red Kelp&lt;/a&gt;s grow. The third level is the \"Drone Tunnels.\" This is a confusing section of the Burrow, so keep an eye on the map. The final level of the Burrow is \"Bramble Halls.\" At the end of the Halls is a door that leads to the \"Sanctum of Decadence.\"\nInside the Sanctum, fight several Felldew Addicts and &lt;a href=\"Joofy%20the%20Brown\"&gt;Joofy the Brown&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; in tight pants. After killing all of them, explore the room. There is lots of valuable Felldew, many bottles of &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Wine\"&gt;Cheap Wine&lt;/a&gt;. The Chalice sits on a pedestal in the center of the room. Take the Chalice and a door to the southwest will unlock, an exit from the Sanctum.\nOnce Chalice is taken, the effects of Felldew disappear. Return the Chalice to Thadon, who grants the Hero the title \"Courtier of Mania,\" which, Thadon notes, is meaningless.\nNote that the Felldew ingestion requirement for entering the Burrow is only for the initial entry. Once the door is opened, the Hero can re-enter at any time, either via the front entrance, or if they have already exited via the Sanctum of Decadence, from the rear entrance. This suggests a strategy of going as fast as possible through the Burrow and ingesting Felldew only when needed (e.g., before combat). Then after the Hero is cured of addiction, they can come back to the Barrow to explore it more leisurely, harvest alchemical ingredients, hunt &lt;a href=\"Elytra%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;elytra&lt;/a&gt; and so on without the pressure of the Felldew clock ticking.\nAnother useful tip is that felldew carrying elytra respawn outside the front door. Thus combinations of waiting and fast travelling back and forth to the entrance will allow the Hero to kill a number of them, thus building up a reservoir of felldew before ingesting the first dose."}

I started with startlings, but they never stayed for long. Too unpredictable - too dependent on the shared movement of the flock. I had some measured success with vultures, but the repitition gives me vertigo. Round and round and round they go. Telling the same story again and again.\nI was surprised to find that I've had the most success with crows. They're perceptive, adaptable, and seem just as interested in the process as I am. I released a few yesterday, and breathed deep from my Nirn-powder box. Before longm the birds started weaving patterns - some Daedric letters I think. Soon afterward, most of the birds gathered into a hoop of sorts, while the largest soared through it - spinning like a half-fletched arrow. A corkscrew? Or perhaps a key? I counted sixteen passes before they finally settled back into their coops.\nI can't help but think it relates to a door. OR perhaps a portal? Doors, always doors! And sixteen passes? Sixteen Princes. It can't be a coincidence. But where is this door? Do they speak of the artifact's position or the artifact itself? More questions. Always more questions. I should confer with Neelo. I think he's done something similar with fish If we don't make more progress soon, I think w'll have to inform the Arch-Mage. We've spent too much time already.

She will become Jarl of &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; occupies &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Mjoll%20the%20Lioness\"&gt;Mjoll the Lioness&lt;/a&gt;, Maven has strong ties with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, making her the most influential person in Riften. When asked about her influence, Maven claims that she has Jarl &lt;a href=\"Laila%20Law-Giver\"&gt;Laila Law-Giver&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Guard\"&gt;Riften Guard&lt;/a&gt; in her pocket. She is able to influence the outcome of any situation with &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; or by exploiting the fear that her allies will retaliate. According to &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt;, her ties to the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood essentially make her untouchable, and that if anyone is told to do something for her, they had better listen and do exactly what she says, or else.\nThe matriarch of the Black-Briar family, Maven is virtually unapproachable and elitist. She holds the actual pulse of Riften in her crushing grip and is not above using unscrupulous methods to ensure things go her way. Anyone who crosses her typically ends up dead or in prison, even members of her own family, such as Sibbi Black-Briar.\nRoutine.\nIf she does not become &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, she can be found in various places about Riften, including the marketplace, &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Meadery\"&gt;Black-Briar Meadery&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Manor\"&gt;Black-Briar Manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFamily.\nMaven is the mother of &lt;a href=\"Hemming%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Hemming&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ingun%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Ingun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sibbi%20Black-Briar%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sibbi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt; is her right-hand-man, and enforces her will in the city. He tells the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; not to stir up trouble with the Black-Briars. Extremely subservient to Maven, Maul will do whatever she asks of him without question.\nConflicting relations.\nThere is conflicting information about Maven's relationship with the rest of her family. Mjoll refers to Hemming, Ingun, and Sibbi as Maven's children, and Maven has a conversation with Ingun during which each identifies the other by familial relationship. However, Hemming says that Ingun and Sibbi are his children. This can support the theory that Hemming was originally written to be Maven's husband, but was changed to her son later in the development of the game. Or simply Hemming is Maven's son and had two other children with her. In the &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Kit\"&gt;Creation Kit&lt;/a&gt; Maven is set as Hemming's mother and the grandmother of both Sibbi and Ingun.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaven becomes &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; if the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; gains control of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. She will appoint Hemming as her &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt; as her &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn sided with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, and gave Riften to the Empire in \"&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;,\" then retakes it for the Stormcloaks later, Maven, Hemming, and Maul will not be exiled; they will simply resume their daily routine like before the Legion took over Riften. This is likely due to Maven's level of influence in Riften and the rest of Skyrim, and because several quests in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; storyline make it necessary for her to be in Riften.\nIf she does become Jarl, however, she will stay in &lt;a href=\"Mistveil%20Keep\"&gt;Mistveil Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and her normal conversations will not occur. &lt;a href=\"%23Imperial%20victory\"&gt;New conversations&lt;/a&gt; with her court, rather than the citizens of Riften, can be overheard. Her bodyguard Maul and son Hemming can also be heard talking about her new position:\nMaul: \"Your mother seems to have taken to her seat quite well.\"\nHemming: \"Yes, she's been grooming herself for this for quite a long time.\"\nMaul: \"It's surprising the Council is allowing a Nord rule Riften under the Imperial flag. That can't be their first choice.\"\nHemming: \"Let's just say my mother knows which pockets to line and keep it at that.\"\nImprisoning her son.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Anuriel\"&gt;Anuriel&lt;/a&gt;'s chambers, a note from Maven reveals that she had her son Sibbi imprisoned for unknown reasons, writing that it is in his best interest to be kept under lock and key. The Dragonborn discovers that he was arrested for \"airing out his family's dirty laundry.\" Specifically, he killed his ex-fianc\u00e9e's brother after he was confronted about his affairs with other women.\n&lt;a href=\"Dampened%20Spirits\"&gt;Dampened Spirits&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Loud%20and%20Clear\"&gt;Loud and Clear&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; will say that Maven wishes to speak to the Dragonborn.\n&lt;a href=\"Quill%20of%20Gemination\"&gt;Quill of Gemination&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaven asks the Dragonborn to find a &lt;a href=\"Quill%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quill&lt;/a&gt; that was lost by &lt;a href=\"Vald\"&gt;Vald&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Promises%20to%20Keep\"&gt;Promises to Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Louis%20Letrush\"&gt;Louis Letrush&lt;/a&gt; tasks the Dragonborn to steal Sibbi's horse, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20%28Horse%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, and give it to him.\nConversations.\nGeneral.\nMaven: \"\"I don't like being made a fool of, &lt;a href=\"Brand-Shei\"&gt;Brand-Shei&lt;/a&gt;. Not one bit.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Maven, please. I didn't know it was your man. Had I known, I would have looked the other way, I swear.\"\nMaven: \"\"Turning him in to the guards? Have you joined &lt;a href=\"Mjoll%20the%20Lioness\"&gt;Mjoll&lt;/a&gt; as official peacekeepers of Riften? You cost me a lot of coin.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Maven, I... please, don't hurt me.\"\nErikur: \"Heard any news about the other parts of Skyrim?\"\nMaven: \"I'm not sure that it's news, but lately it seems like every blacksmith in Skyrim is out to prove that he's the equal of Eorlund Gray-Mane. It's not really a fair comparison, if you ask me. After all, Eorlund works the Skyforge. How is any smith going to compete with that?\"\nErikur: \"Heard any news about the other parts of Skyrim?\"\nMaven: \"Well, I did hear that the Argonians have been banned from living inside the walls of Windhelm. They're only allowed on the city docks now. Most of them sleep together in one building, and they're as poor as wretches.\"\nMaven: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Grelka\"&gt;Grelka&lt;/a&gt;, how fast can you get your hands on some &lt;a href=\"Long%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;longbows&lt;/a&gt;?\"\"\nGrelka: \"I don't usually deal in weapons, but I know someone who can get them for me. You mind paying a little extra to get them fast?\"\nMaven: \"I don't care what it costs. I need four longbows and four score of arrows. Just make it happen.\"\nGrelka: \"I'll contact my man tonight and let you know what he says.\"\nMaven: \"\"Haelga, I like you, so I'm only going to say this one time. If you ever try and \"practice the Dibellan arts\" with Hemming again, I'll make sure that pretty little face loses its beauty.\"\"\nHaelga: \"He wasn't protesting, Maven.\"\nMaven: \"Of course he wasn't you stupid whore; he's a man. Now I'm not going to warn you again. Is that clear?\"\nHaelga: \"Very well.\"\nHemming: \"Bersi still refuses to cooperate. What did you want to do?\"\nMaven: \"I've known Bersi a long time. Even before he opened that rubbish heap he calls a shop.\"\nHemming: \"And if he still refuses?\"\nMaven: \"Then put the thumbscrews on him and hit him... hard.\"\nMaven: \"Hemming, I want you to personally supervise the next shipment.\"\nHemming: \"We already have people that do that and they make quite a bit of coin for it.\"\nMaven: \"I don't trust them. Come to think of it, I don't trust you either, but at least you're family.\"\nHemming: \"Anything you say, Mother.\"\nMaven: \"Hemming, I need you to bring a note to Sibbi. I need him to do something for me.\"\nHemming: \"Sibbi? He's in prison... you put him there.\"\nMaven: \"\"I know that!\" or \"I can promise you when he's ready, he'll find the cell door unlocked.\"\"\nHemming: \"Why do you tolerate him, mother? All he contributes to this family is embarrassment and disgrace.\"\nMaven: \"I tolerate your son because he'll do anything I ask, without question. I'd expect the same from my own son.\"\nHemming: \"I understand, mother. Forgive me.\"\nMaven: \"Ingun, how much longer do you intend to waste your life concocting your foolish little potions?\"\nIngun: \"I've told you, my interest in the family business is quite low. I wish to be much more than just a merchant.\"\nMaven: \"Your interests lay where I wish them to lay otherwise my favorite daughter may end up homeless and without a septim to her name. Is that clear?\"\nIngun: \"Yes, mother.\"\nMadesi: \"Lady Maven, how may I help you?\"\nMaven: \"Is it true that you refused to sell one of your... trinkets to Hemming?\"\nMadesi: \"Please, milady, it was only because he threatened me. He said he'd have me thrown in the prisons if I didn't give him what he wanted! I can't afford to just give my jewelry away!\"\nMaven: \"Next time a Black-Briar asks for something, I suggest you respond quickly and affirmatively.\"\nMarise: \"Oh! Miss Maven. What can I do for you?\"\nMaven: \"\"Relax, &lt;a href=\"Marise%20Aravel\"&gt;Marise&lt;/a&gt;... I have no quarrel with you. I just wish to speak a moment.\"\"\nMarise: \"Yes?\"\nMaven: \"\"You watch the market, you hear the rumors around Riften. What have you heard about these &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nMarise: \"I heard a traveler say that &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by one of those creatures. Didn't leave a soul alive they said.\"\"\nMaven: \"Interesting. Keep your ears open for me and tell me if you hear anything more. I'll make it worth your while.\"\nMjoll: \"Maven. How's the criminal underworld treating you this fine day?\"\nMaven: \"You may have everyone else impressed around here, but you don't impress me. You couldn't touch me if you wanted to.\"\nMjoll: \"You're a cold, unfeeling bitch.\"\nMaven: \"My dear, you have no idea who you're trifling with. Now I suggest you turn around and rattle someone else's cage before you get hurt.\"\nMjoll: \"I'm watching you, Maven Black-Briar. One day, you'll slip up and your Imperial friends won't be there to catch your fall.\"\nVulwulf: \"Maven! So good to see you again. Hoist a flagon and celebrate with me!\"\nMaven: \"Vulwulf, it's always a pleasure. When you're standing downwind of me.\"\nVulwulf: \"Sorry, what was that?\"\nMaven: \"Nothing Vulwulf... cheers.\"\nMaven: \"I'm telling you, Vulwulf, it's the investment you've been waiting for.\"\nVulwulf: \"So I pay for the weapon shipments and you oversee their distribution to the Stormcloaks?\"\nMaven: \"Exactly. What better way to help the cause than to put weapons into the hands of young Nord warriors dying for their homeland?\"\nVulwulf: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;'s Beard! You're right! I'll do it... provided you supervise the shipments personally.\"\"\nMaven: \"Don't worry, I'll treat those shipments as if I owned them myself.\"\nImperial victory.\nIf Riften is taken by the Imperial Legion during the Civil War questline and Maven becomes Jarl, she will have the following conversations with her court:\nHemming: \"There's still the matter of the prisoner to discuss. Now, his family is willing to contribute handsomely if we release him.\"\nMaven: \"The execution will proceed as planned.\"\nHemming: \"But, mother... this is quite a sizable contribution and the crime doesn't befit such a harsh punishment.\"\nMaven: \"Are you going soft on me, Hemming? Perhaps I made the wrong choice installing you as steward.\"\nHemming: \"No, mother. The execution will proceed as planned.\"\nMaven: \"Hemming, have you dispatched that letter I gave you yesterday?\"\nHemming: \"Yes, and I sent it with our fastest courier and under the cover of night, exactly as you specified.\"\nMaven: \"Good. If I need to light a few fires in order to get what we need to defend this place from the Stormcloaks, so be it.\"\nHemming: \"\"I'm almost certain he'll reach the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow, so we should have an answer by the end of the week.\"\"\nLaila: \"Maven! Always a pleasure to receive you. What can I help you with today?\"\nMaven: \"\"Thank you, Laila. I wanted to discuss the protection of my shipments.\" OR \"I'm certain you're aware of the loss I sustained a fortnight ago.\"\"\nLaila: \"Yes, indeed. An entire caravan shipment of your mead taken by Imperial soldiers. What of it?\"\nMaven: \"Well, I'm also certain you're aware that our own city guard failed to provide the protection required to ensure safe passage of the shipment.\"\nLaila: \"Indeed. We lost three soldiers in that attack. A sad day for Riften.\"\nMaven: \"\"I have payments to make you realize. If I can't make them, I can't make Black-Briar Mead.\" OR \"Quite. To be brief, I need compensation for the lost shipment. Since Riften was responsible for it, Riften should pay for it.\"\"\nLaila: \"We... don't have enough to...\"\nMaven: \"Laila, Riften is my home, but if my meadery can't be safe here, I'll just move it elsewhere.\"\nLaila: \"No, that won't be necessary. You'll have compensation for your loss.\"\nMaven: \"Thank you, Laila.\"\nMaven: \"Any word about our little problem in the Ratway?\"\nMaul: \"I've spoken to Brynjolf and he assures me it'll be taken care of.\"\nMaven: \"Next time you speak to him, tell him to clean up his own messes. I'm not about to jeopardize this position for a bunch of low-life thugs.\"\nMaul: \"I'll let him know.\"\nMaul: \"\"My agents are telling me that we've appropriated the caravan from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;... with minimal losses.\"\"\nMaven: \"For what it's costing me, I should be handed the merchandise on a silver platter.\"\nMaul: \"The coin isn't just for the men, there's a lot of people that need to be compensated in order to make this happen.\"\nMaven: \"And a hefty cut for yourself too I'm sure.

So tell me, what's the price for a woman's integrity these days?\"\nMaven: \"You never were able to see the forest for the trees, were you?\"\nLaila: \"We Nords were proud warriors once. And we still could be. Evidenced by the men and women who fought and died bravely today. You could see that if you had any faith left in that black heart of yours.

We will soon begin publicly executing captured men. That should send a clear message to the people.\"\nLaila: \"Yes, but not likely the one you intend.\"\nMaven: \"Oh?

His fellow soldier, Euphemius, had been killed by &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt;. He began to grow resentful of his position, enough so that the only thing that kept him going were his loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the strong words of General Carius each morning. He began to feel that the Empire had simply stranded him and his fellow soldiers on Solsthiem, feeling isolated and abandoned.\nEventually, he and Fort Frostmoth itself succumbed to the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, his last letter detailing the devastation of Solsthiem and his last thoughts being of home, family and Empire.\nLocation.\nOnce inside Fort Frostmoth, head\u00a0right and down the stairs.

He was born in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, though his mother's family were horrified of his elvish traits. They forced her to confess that Maxivian's father was Ianus, Lord Nunex Faleria's son. Lord Faleria took his grandson and hid him with the rest of his Ayleid family, as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; would banish or execute him due to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Pogrom\"&gt;First Pogrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin days, the Alessian Army was at the gate of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Faleria\"&gt;Fort Faleria&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to arrest Nunex for his crimes of treason after discovering his elvish children.

Ianus put his hand on his Nunex's shoulder, but it was too late for Lord Faleria to cancel the ritual, and the darkness he summoned inadvertently killed Maxivian and Ianus. Lord Faleria buried him with his uncle &lt;a href=\"Neransi%20Faleria\"&gt;Neransi&lt;/a&gt; on the surface, where he never allowed his children to go, writing \"You are the Light in My Darkness\" on his &lt;a href=\"Epitaph%20for%20Ianus%20Faleria\"&gt;epitaph&lt;/a&gt;."}

Only a few entries are legible.&gt;\nI suppose I could whine or complain that my search for an education led me here, to &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. Graciously described as a backwater on the best of days, there's not much that I would recommend to other travelers. The damp scent that wafts off the rivers pervades everything. And from the moment I arrived, the locals made clear they don't relish outsiders in their midst. Nobody acts hostile; they just keep their distance. Which is fine by me.\nHowever, three details about this little town cause me to appreciate it ever so slightly. First, if the sun is up, the sawmill operates non-stop. It produces a loud steady drone that helps my sleep during the day. My research into the &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Dark Practice&lt;/a&gt; is most efficient through the dim hours, so I welcome the ability to enjoy a full day's rest.\nAdditionally, Morthal is precisely the hub of necromantic power that I hoped for. It hums with death energy. My nightly hunt for the source should soon prove fruitful. Then, with some adjustments, I can begin the siphoning ritual. Even a partial extraction of the local power should provide enough potency for several years of study.\nLastly, I met a local who has become quite the enjoyable companion. She's the daughter of the town's &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl&lt;/a&gt;. Although she admits to never leaving Morthal, she exhibits a strange wisdom and curiosity about the world that I admire. Her mother originally comes from &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps she is the source of this unexpected worldliness. But most of all, I've found that she's kind. We spend quite a bit of time together and I've told her about the nature of my investigations. She did not recoil in disgust as many would. Instead she promised to keep my secret and assist where possible. I confess that I look forward to spending more time with her.\n\u2026 feel like I'm much closer to determining the necromantic source around the town. Last night I wandered east while testing the soil for traces of mortus energy. The new moons next week should properly amplify the ambient resonances. Tracking the locus should be easy during that period.\nWhile in the woods, we saw a figure standing in the distance. She watched us but did not move. &lt;a href=\"Freiwen\"&gt;Freiwen&lt;/a&gt; called her a \"clever woman,\" a local term for hedge mages. For the first time since my arrival, I grew nervous. Interference from some nosy old crone is the last thing I need right now.\nOh, yes, Freiwen joined me on this trip. She had to sneak out from her house, which I found endearing. I enjoy her presence. No one could ever accuse me of being a romantic but walking under the stars with her felt precious.\n\u2026 refer to them as the &lt;a href=\"Kjenstag%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kjenstag ruins&lt;/a&gt;. No one that I've asked knows anything about their history. But without a doubt it contains powerful spiritual emanations. I must adjust the Lanovo siphoning ritual for the sheer volume of energy, but those calculations should be simple enough.\nPerhaps Freiwen would agree to be the living attractant. I planned on using a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; or some other nearby wildlife. But a born-and-raised native to these lands would be more effective. Lanovo claimed that his attractant suffered no ill effects \u2026."}

Because the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; had sent two Legions to defend Orsinium she later joined the Legion.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"4E%2048\"&gt;4E 48&lt;/a&gt; she was the bodyguard of an Imperial scholar by the name of &lt;a href=\"Brennus\"&gt;Brennus&lt;/a&gt;. She was ordered to defend him by the name of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20war%20office\"&gt;Imperial war office&lt;/a&gt;. While the mages made their measurements, Mazgar noticed something was wrong. They were attacked by a party of zombies. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Falcus\"&gt;Captain Falcus&lt;/a&gt; ordered to retreat south.\nThey arrived at &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Watch\"&gt;Mountain Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Mazgar talked to &lt;a href=\"Sariah\"&gt;Sariah&lt;/a&gt;, the charter-holder, and asked her to evacuate the village. After an hour of rest, they marched to &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; with the villageres from Mountain Watch. In their way to the city, Mazgar met a girl named &lt;a href=\"Lorcette\"&gt;Lorcette&lt;/a&gt;. They talked about their past, Lorcette's mother died when she was six. Mazgar's mother was killed in the sack of Orsinium. When they were about half a mile away from the city walls, the undead approached them. Falcus ordered Mazgar to run with the refugees while they held back the undead. She was attacked by six zombies, she used her sword Sister to defeat them. After she ended up with them, she run to the city gates before more undead approached. Once inside the city, Mazgar accompanied Brennus to the chapel of Arkay to make some measurements.\nThe imperial legionaries and the Cheydinhal guard broke the line of the wormies so that the citizens could scape from the siege. They hold the line for hours before Falcus gave the order to regroup on the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;. Brennus and Mazgar broke away from the group. They headed to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but they were spotted by a zombie scout party. They run away from them,\nbut Brennus began to falter.\nThey came across a farmstead, they barricaded the door and they prepared to hold the ground. When the zombies managed to take down the door, Brennus casted a spell that desintegrated three zombies. Mazgar prepared for the incoming undead, but none entered the frarmstead. &lt;a href=\"Ilver%20Indarys\"&gt;Ilver Indarys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Thorn\"&gt;Knights of the Thorn&lt;/a&gt; had seen Mazgar and Brennus escaping from the zombies from a hill, so they galloped to save them. They talked about the evacuation of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; to the knights, who offered them horses to travel to the Blue Road.\nMazgar and Brennus met with the refugees in the Blue Road. Mazgar and Lorcette talked about what they had done in the days she had been away. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Prossos\"&gt;Commander Prossos&lt;/a&gt; gave Mazgar a field promotion to captain due to her experience. Prossos informed her that &lt;a href=\"General%20Takar\"&gt;General Takar&lt;/a&gt; was going to meet the enemy. He sent Mazgar to a hill to make sure it was free of the enemy. The battle went wrong for the imperial army, so General Takar retreated to the Imperial City. Prossos left Mazgar in charge of the refugees, but she requested him to allow her go to defend the Imperial City. To Mazgar's surprise, Brennus accompanied her.\nThey crossed &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; by boat. They were attacked by zombies which emerged from the lake. They landed as soon as they could, the surviving soldiers formed a defence line in the shore. &lt;a href=\"Blondie\"&gt;Blondie&lt;/a&gt; was mortally wounded, and he asked Mazgar to finish him off and end his suffering.\nThey met up with what was left of the Twelfth Legion. They cleared the gate and set up positions to defend it from another siege. Mazgar and Brennus found themselves on the western flank of the action, where little or no fighting was going on. Yet, Umbriel approached the city from that direction, followed by thousands of zombies. Mazgar shread the enemy with Sister. Some zombies poured through the gaps that dead soldiers left. Brennus was severely wounded, so Mazgar and him retreated back. Mazgar told him that he would survive, so Brennus told her to do what she had to do. Just when she was going to end with Brennus' life, Attrebus destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;, and all the wormies became lifeless. She turned around to ask Brennus what had happened, but he was already dead."}

He wants to know why Mazoga the Orc will not leave his hall.\n&lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20White%20Stallion%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Knights of the White Stallion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Hero and Mazoga have killed the Black Bow Bandits and Black Brugo, the Count of Leyawiin will grant them the title of Knight-Errant of the White Stallion and the Leyawiin Shield. They also get the key to the lodge and so does Mazoga.\nConversations.\nWeebam-Na: \"You want to speak to me?\"\nMazoga: \"You are Weebam-Na?\"\nWeebam-Na: \"Yes.\"\nMazoga: \"I want to go to Fisherman's Rock.

This &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; starts when the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; talks to Count &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Leyawiin\"&gt;Castle Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. He wants to know why &lt;a href=\"Mazoga%20the%20Orc%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Mazoga the Orc&lt;/a&gt; will not leave his hall.\nWalkthrough.\nGo to Mazoga and speak to her, she is extremely rude but will ask to find &lt;a href=\"Weebam-Na\"&gt;Weebam-Na&lt;/a&gt;. His house is in town across from the &lt;a href=\"My%20Leyawiin%20House\"&gt;For Sale house&lt;/a&gt;. He will not help until he is persuaded, however.\nFollow Weebam-Na back to Mazoga and listen to them talk. She will be rude to him and demand that he take her to &lt;a href=\"Fisherman%27s%20Rock\"&gt;Fisherman's Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a camp north of Leyawiin. Weebam-Na will refuse, but talk to Mazoga and she will demand that she be taken there.\nHead to Fisherman's Rock north of Leyawiin and across the Lower Niben River. She will follow but will not swim, so it is a good idea to lead her around the southern end of the river. Mazoga confronts one of the bandits, &lt;a href=\"Mogens%20Wind-Shifter\"&gt;Mogens Wind-Shifter&lt;/a&gt;, and reveals that she is seeking revenge on him for killing a friend when she was a bandit.\nFight the &lt;a href=\"Mogens%20Wind-Shifter\"&gt;four bandits&lt;/a&gt;, making sure to keep Mazoga alive, and return to the Count to complete the quest. After fighting the bandits and talking to Mazoga, she calls the Hero an idiot for killing them, yet she will engage in conflict herself if the player does not. If the player tells her they did not know about the Knights' etiquette, she will just agree and blame herself. It is important, if tedious, to walk Mazoga all the way back to the castle. With her low health after the bandit fight, she will tend to get killed by roving enemies on the way. It also helps to have a &lt;a href=\"convalescence\"&gt;convalescence&lt;/a&gt; spell to use on her after the fight. An alternative and simpler way of escorting Mazoga is fast travelling back to Leyawiin.\nIf Mazoga dies, the Count will hold the Hero responsible, and not give the next quest. This is not hinted at anywhere in the game, but she needs to live - protect her at all costs. However, she may die during the next quest with no serious repercussions."}

Oh yes, and another. There are two very important things I know about, and those two things are fighting and dancing. You will forgive me for sometimes confusing the two, for they are each one close to the other, side by side, partners like so many things under the moons.\nTo fight and to dance, your feet must be light, fast, never stumbling. Whether it is a battle or a celebration, in each, a stumble means death, means the sword across your neck or the stab of embarrassment and rejection. One foot and two, each sure where it lands on this beat and the next. You must be bold. Take the lead and your partner and enemy will follow; you will be master of the movements, impressive and strong.\nYou must inspire, you must project the power inside forth and out. Consider: What dancer wishes to engage with the beggar, filthy and low? What enemy will fear you if you are shabby and wear dingy padding? Best to prepare, to choose the right garments to show who you are and who you intend to be. You intend to be the winner. The best.\n&lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt; knew we needed &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; to protect us and guide us, and likewise you must use the left and right hands. The moons are different, but they are both moons, and, just so, you shall hold a weapon in each hand for battle. Maybe not the same weapon, but weapons still. The moons are both circles, not a circle and a square. For dance, it is the same; you hold the hands - left and right in right and left, but hands all the same.\nIn the fight and the dance, there is rhythm. Give and take, ebb and flow. Mastery of movement, of spinning and twirling just at the right times, is what you must display. You must know when to move forward and when to leap back, watching the other for cues. The other is just another side of you - ignore them at your peril. There is no feeling to compare with a good fight or dance. If you practice, you feel each piece falling into place, each motion flowing exactly to where it should.\nAnd that is how you win."}

He loved to taunt and tease the kwama workers, but especially enjoyed getting &lt;a href=\"Brave%20Little%20Scrib\"&gt;Brave Little Scrib&lt;/a&gt; into trouble. Oh, he was never obvious about his trouble making, and for the most part, the Brave Little Scrib considered the tiny Torchbug to be her friend. If Brave Little Scrib took a moment to consider all the times she wound up punished because she listened to Torchbug, she might have felt differently about the mean little creature. But the Brave Little Scrib never thought much about such things. It wasn't in her nature.\nOne day after she grew bored watching the Kwama Workers busily move the kwama eggs from one section of the hatchery to another, Brave Little Scrib ventured out of the mine. It was a beautiful day, sunny and warm, with a gentle breeze blowing through the mushroom forest. Kwama Warrior stood guard at the entrance and asked her where she was going. \"I'm going out to play,\" she answered, which she thought was totally obvious to anyone other than the serious Warrior.\nAs Brave Little Scrib entered the mushroom forest, she saw a glowing light hovering above the trail ahead. It was her friend, Mean Old Torchbug, though she never called the tiny insect such a horrible name. \"Hello, tiny Torchbug,\" Scrib called out.\n\"And greetings to you, Little Scrib,\" Torchbug sang, his voice like a crackling fire. \"What brings you out of the mine on this beautiful day?\"\n\"I've come to play,\" Brave Little Scrib said cheerfully. \"The mine is dreadfully dull as the workers are constantly busy, and all the warriors want to do is fight and fight and fight. I'm looking for an adventure!\"\n\"An adventure?\" Torchbug asked gleefully. \"I know just the thing to fill your day with excitement and provide me with an amusement to brighten up my afternoon.\"\nRemembering the other suggestions Torchbug shared with her during the time they'd known each other, Scrib asked suspiciously, \"What do you have in mind?\"\n\"There's a mage tower nearby, in one of the tall mushrooms. The mage that lives there is always looking for a brave little scrib to play games with. She knows the most interesting games.\"\n\"What kinds of games?\" Scrib asked, suddenly excited despite her suspicions.\n\"Oh, the best kind, I assure you!\" \"Then lead the way, tiny Torchbug,\" Scrib said, and she followed the glowing insect deeper into the shadows cast by the looming mushroom spires.\nAs Brave Little Scrib followed Torchbug toward the mushroom tower, she noticed a pile of empty jars heaped haphazardly near the tower's base. She stopped to inspect the jars, sniffing at the sticky-sweet residue that clung to the discarded vessels.\n\"Is something wrong, Little Scrib?\" Torchbug asked, flitting back to hover above the piled jars.\n\"There's something familiar about this smell,\" Brave Little Scrib said, \"but I can't quite place it.\"\n\"That's just the remains of the jelly the mage likes to spread on toasted bread. In fact, that's one of the games she loves to play when brave little scribs come to call.\"\nNow, Brave Little Scrib isn't the most clever kwama in the mine, but she has her moments. This was one of them. \"You want to watch the mage turn me into scrib jelly, don't you, you Mean Old Torchbug?\"\n\"Of course,\" Torchbug sang. \"I so want to see how the jelly gets made.\"\n\"I think we'll save that for another day, Torchbug,\" Brave Little Scrib said.\n\"If you insist, Little Scrib,\" Torchbug sang. \"Have a good day.\"\nAnd Brave Little Scrib raced back to the kwama mine, leaving Torchbug in the shadows with the empty jars. That was one adventure she was glad to miss!"}

The Mede Dynasty saw the fracturing of much of the Empire, which began with the secession of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFounding.\nThe murder of &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt; in the years following the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; began the Stormcrown Interregnum, with various factions vying for the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; and the administrative structure of the Third Empire remained intact.\nSeven years after Ocato's murder, a &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; witch-warrior known as Thules the Gibbering was ruling in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt; from a family of &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, came to power at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. Titus overthrew Thules and with the help of Minister &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; satisfied the Elder Council that he was, if not a legitimate ruler, then preferable to any alternative.\nTitus Mede I (~4E 21\u2013?).\nTitus Mede I became emperor in or around 4E 21. Despite his efforts to secure the empire following the Stormcrown Interregnum, Titus Mede I's reign saw its continued disintegration. In particular, the nation of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; was proclaimed, following the overthrow of the old &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; royal family. Following Alinor's annexation of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;, it severed all ties with the Empire.\nTitus' reign also saw the creation of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, and a potential attack on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; from it. The Empire did little to respond officially, although Titus' son &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; was involved in its destruction. During this period Hierem attempted to form an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. Whether he succeeded in this is unknown.\nDuring Titus' reign, the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; ceased performing their role as the Emperor's bodyguards, and were replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is no record of the year of Titus Mede I's death. We can only assume that his line continued through Attrebus, potentially with &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg%20Ho%C3%AFnart\"&gt;Anna\u00efg Ho\u00efnart&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he was romantically involved during Umbriel's rise and destruction.\nUnknown rulership (?\u20134E 168).\nFollowing the death of Titus Mede, a period of unknown rulers began, although presumably his son Attrebus was his immediate successor. During this time the Empire continued to disintegrate, with the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; bringing chaos across Tamriel, including the assassination of at least one &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Its most notable effect however was to cause panic among the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, who dubbed the Thalmor saviors after they claimed to have instigated their return in 4E 100. 15 years later, a coup in the province dissolved the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; and recreated the ancient kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt; as client states of the Aldmeri Dominion.\nTitus Mede II (4E 168\u20134E 201?).\nTitus Mede ascended the Ruby Throne in 4E 168, in unknown circumstances.\nThe Great War (4E 171\u20134E 176).\nThe Aldmeri Dominion issued an ultimatum to the Empire at the Imperial City in 4E 171 demanding that the Blades be disbanded, that the Empire cede portions of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the Dominion and outlaw the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. Mede rejected this, leading to a declaration of war.\nFollowing the Dominion's initial successes, Titus Mede made the decision to abandon the Imperial City and join up with reinforcements from High Rock, which were then divided and used to destroy the Thalmor army sacking the Imperial City. Titus is said to have led the assault himself, wielding the artifact sword &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, although some claim that this was done by another Hero, who has been forgotten to history. Titus then agreed to most of the terms of the treaty that he originally rejected, which became known as the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. \nPost-war.\nThirty years after the Great War, the Empire had achieved peace with the Dominion. However, many were not satisfied by the terms of the White-Gold Concordat, mainly &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; due to the outlaw of Talos worship.\nThe Markarth Incident.\nIn 4E 174, &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; was subjected to what is known today as the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Uprising\"&gt;Forsworn Uprising&lt;/a&gt;. While the Empire was beset by the Aldmeri Dominion in the Great War, the native people of the Reach, called the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, took this opportunity to seize control of the city. This was only possible as the Imperial Legionnaires stationed in Markarth were recalled to fight, leaving the city vulnerable. The Jarl of the Reach could not quell the uprising and was forced to flee his city. The rebellion was successful, and the Reachmen ruled over Markarth and the Reach as an independent kingdom from Skyrim from 4E 174\u2014176. During this time, the kingdom was said to be relatively peaceful. The Reachmen were said to have ruled their lands fairly and were making overtures to be recognized by the Empire as a legitimate kingdom. In 4E 175, the Great War ended with the Empire signing the White-Gold Concordat. During this time, Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, took it upon himself to seek help from &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; in ousting the Reachmen. He promised Ulfric that if he re-took the Reach, then Hrolfdir as Jarl would allow free worship of Talos - an act that was recently outlawed at the end of the war. Ulfric agreed and marched his militia to the gates of Markarth and ruthlessly retook the city using the power of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reclaiming Markarth, Ulfric was brutal to the Reachmen usurpers and executed any remaining insurrectionists in the city except for &lt;a href=\"Nepos%20the%20Nose\"&gt;Nepos the Nose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;, and a handful of others. Jarl Hrolfdir was said to have executed children of alleged Forsworn sympathizers and unjustly imprisoned those accused of colluding with Forsworn usurpers.\nWhen the Imperial Legion arrived to restore the rule of law, Ulfric refused them entry into the city until they also agreed to the free worship of Talos that was promised. The Empire had no choice but to grant Ulfric and his men their free worship because chaos and violence was running through the streets of Markarth and they believed Ulfric and his militia were using it to coerce them. The Thalmor discovered this blatant violation of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; and pressured the Empire to arrest Ulfric and his militia or end the peace agreement with the Aldmeri Dominion. Eventually, the Empire and Hrolfdir rescinded upon the agreement and arrested Ulfric and his militia. This betrayal left Ulfric bitter towards the Empire and is considered to be the initial conception of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkyrim Civil War.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric\u00a0returned to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; after his father died during his incarceration with the Thalmor. In 4E 201, after years of brewing resentment for what he and his followers considered the Empire's betrayal of Skyrim, Ulfric challenged &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; to a duel. After Torygg's death, Ulfric fled to Windhelm. Some time after this event, the Imperial Legion managed to lure Ulfric into a trap in order to capture him. The trap worked and Ulfric surrendered himself without a fight. &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; ordered Ulfric to be sent to Cyrodiil to face trial, but there was a change of plan and instead it was decreed that Ulfric be publicly executed in &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric was saved by the timely arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; who destroyed Helgen. Ulfric and his men escaped and returned to Windhelm to continue the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, which was unresolved as of 4E 201.\nAssassination.\nTitus Mede II may have been assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; while in Skyrim, possibly at the order of &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;."}

I do know that it is not on the field of Cryngaine where they erected that monument to him. If you do speak to him...could you tell him I still love him.

The &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Wraith of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt; is located within the last room in Juno Burial, and will defend the area. After defeating Sul-Senipul's wraith, the Nerevarine may take the &lt;a href=\"Bonebiter%20Bow%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt; from his remains and return to Sul-Matuul.\nNibani Maesa.\nAfter returning to Ashkhan Sul-Matuul, who is pleased with the Nerevarine's success, the Hero receives the bow and is asked to use it honorably. Sul-Matuul will, then direct the Nerevarine to the tribe's wise woman,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nerevarine goes to the &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%27s%20Yurt%20%28Urshilaku%29\"&gt;Wise Woman's Yurt&lt;/a&gt; to speak with Nibani about the \"Nerevarine Prophecies\". She readily answers all questions and explains the conditions that the Hero must fulfill to be considered as the Nerevarine, \"The birth under moon and star, the mark on the corpse and the uncertain parents\". However, she says that they are not the Nerevarine, yet, but they are one of the people who may become. Then, she gives them two books containing information about the prophecies, and explains that more may be learned from books called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Prophecy\"&gt;The Lost Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;\", and that the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; may have these books.\nThey should now report back to Spymaster Cosades, who will issue new orders."}

On the docks. Yes, yes, I know. My father forbade me from going anywhere near that part of the city, but what the General doesn't know won't hurt me, right?\nAnyway, &lt;a href=\"Za%27ji\"&gt;Za'ji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caska\"&gt;Caska&lt;/a&gt;. They're pirates! I think. Maybe smugglers? Something not quite legal in any event, I'm pretty sure about that. Za'ji claimed to be a captain and said he had the finest vessel to ever sail the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Sea\"&gt;Topal Sea&lt;/a&gt;. He called his ship the Perfect Pounce. Isn't that a glorious name? I hope he'll let me sail with them some day! I could be a great pirate, provided my father the General ever lets me out of his sight. Za'ji is one of the smaller Khajiit, of the &lt;a href=\"Dagi-raht\"&gt;Dagi-raht&lt;/a&gt; furstock, from what I've learned since my father and his legion took up their post here in &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;. Za'ji was outgoing, energetic, and rather boastful, but not in an annoying way. I found his claims to be more funny than arrogant. And I'm pretty sure he was a little drunk. I have seen my father's soldiers guzzle down wine when they were off duty, so I know what I'm talking about.\nCaska, on the other hand, is a &lt;a href=\"Senche-raht\"&gt;Senche-raht&lt;/a&gt;. One of those big battle cats. She carried herself like she didn't have a care in the world, but she also radiated confidence and power. I'm certain she ends more fights just by rising to her full height and staring down the crowd, but she also looked like she wasn't above mixing it up if she had to. In contrast to her captain, her voice was deep and smooth. It made me feel comfortable and safe, but I could see how it could also be used to scare a banekin out of a flower basket, if you take my meaning. She explained in a relatively sparse number of words that she was the Pounce's first mate. And then matter of factly added, \u201cAnd I keep Za'ji from doing anything that would get us all killed.\u201d She seemed rather proud about that.\nDear Journal,\nThe locals have taken to calling my father's legion \u201cthe Shields of Senchal\u201d now. I guess that means they've finally accepted us as part of the community. And I've learned how to lose the soldiers the General has assigned to keep an eye on me\u2014at least when I really need to. Like today. I gave the soldiers the slip and snuck aboard the Perfect Pounce for my first real outing since my father packed us up and moved us down here. Captain Za'ji was his usual charismatic self, welcoming me aboard with a bow and a flourish. He really is a charmer! And he's extremely proud of his ship. The Pounce is a fine vessel, and I admit I fell in love with it as soon as its sails filled and we roared away from the shore. He might be eccentric and a little outlandish, but Za'ji's captaining skills were evident from the start of our cruise. He orchestrated the actions of his crew the way my father commands his legion, and all those rough and tumble pirates worked together to keep the Pounce on a straight and even keel. It was an impressive display and I hope to sail alongside Za'ji and his crew again. It was exhilarating!\nAs the Pounce's bow cut through the waves, Caska was never far from her captain's side. The big Khajiit didn't use a lot of words, but then again, she didn't have to. When Za'ji issued a command, Caska would reinforce it with a subtle nod or a stern look. In the rare instance when Za'ji gave an order that Caska didn't agree with, she didn't argue or complain. She simply shook her head and roared a correction. For example, at one point Za'ji grabbed a line and pulled himself up to gaze over the side and ordered, \u201cHard to port!\u201d Caska shook her head and stated, \u201cStarboard.\u201d Za'ji, without missing a beat and without a hint of anger at being corrected said, \u201cRight. Za'ji's other port.\u201d\nWhen the ship sailed back into Senchal's bay and approached the docks, I was sitting with Caska, enjoying her quiet presence. It really felt, well, peaceful, just sitting there next to the big Khajiit. That's when she surprised me with a question. \u201cWhat tree do you want to climb, little one,\u201d she asked. Not knowing what she meant, as there wasn't a single tree in the bay or even near the Senchal docks, I sort of just fumbled for an answer. She put me out of my misery by rephrasing for my non-Khajiit perspective. \u201cWhat do you plan to do with your life, Aeliah?\u201d I wasn't sure how to respond. No one had ever asked me that before. Then, without warning, an answer popped into my head. \u201cI want to help people,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe as a soldier, like my father. Or maybe as a pirate, like you and Za'ji. Something. I want to help and I want to have adventures. It probably sounds silly to you, but that's what I want to do.\u201d Caska nodded and said, \u201cSounds reasonable.\u201d Then she put down her head, closed her eyes, and went to sleep.\nIt was a perfect day!\nDear Journal,\nMy father, the General, has decided to make use of me. While I can tell he still doesn't approve, he asked me to use my connections with Khajiit such as Za'ji and Caska to act as a sort of intermediary between them and the Shields of Senchal. Like an ambassador. He probably asked so he could keep better tabs on my comings and goings, but I kind of felt honored. And by now, Za'ji and Caska have become my very best friends. Oh, they argue all the time, but they're also loyal to each other. Za'ji respects his crew, cares for their well-being, and keeps his eyes open for the very best adventures. He gets so excited that everyone around him gets excited, too. For all Za'ji's cunning and good cheer, it's Caska that keeps the Pounce afloat. She makes sure the ship remains in good repair, orders provisions, and pays the crew. And she keeps them all safe. No one can beat Caska in a fair fight. I'm not sure they could beat her in an unfair one, for that matter. And between the two of them, the Pounce couldn't be in better hands."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/60077\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 05/17/2021.\nContents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;: Where Are They Now?\nBy Adandora, Chronicler-at-Large\nThe Imperial Elder Council. Once the finest collection of politicians and advisers in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but noticeably absent since the fall of the Empire and the start of the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;. Now, rumors of &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;'s exploits spring up like mold on cheese, including the latest reports of Tharn sightings in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, but this chronicler seeks to learn what happened to the rest of that illustrious band of legislators and why they aren't doing more to find a resolution to the ongoing war.\nWhile many of the councilors remain missing and assumed dead in the wake of the atrocities that engulfed the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, this chronicler located a number of prominent members living in the province of &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, Chief Councilor Lovidicus, second in power only to High Chancellor Tharn, now serves as a member of the Chamber of Legates in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nCouncilor Lovidicus, now technically a legate, retains his original title as a matter of longstanding tradition. Since joining the Leyawiin Chamber of Legates, Lovidicus has risen to prominence and serves as the de facto leader of the august body. Like his fellow councilors, Lovidicus fled to Blackwood to escape the war in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, he has served the city of Leyawiin admirably and helped bolster the region's defenses against the ongoing war.\nCouncilor Abor once oversaw the workings of the Imperial Legion and has a deep and abiding respect for military training and discipline. She was particularly close to &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; when he was still alive, but since retreating to a villa outside Leyawiin, she has kept a low profile and considers herself to be retired from public service. I found her to be arrogant and uncooperative, but perhaps that's just the way Abor treats anyone she considers to be her lesser.\nCouncilor Faleria, also retired, nevertheless maintains cordial relations with Lovidicus and the Chamber of Legates in Leyawiin. Her former position as the overseer of the Imperial treasury makes her a valuable adviser when it comes to budgeting and taxation. The legates utilize her often, especially at those times of the year when they are preparing the city's list of deposits and expenditures. She appears to thoroughly enjoy the work and the attention it continues to bring her.\nCouncilor Sophus, on the other hand, has practically disappeared from public life. Living in a modest villa in the Blackwood countryside with his wife, he refused to talk to me or discuss his time as an Imperial bureaucrat. He practically commanded his dog, Chareo, to attack me. His wife Lunia was slightly more accommodating, but she also preferred that the past remained buried. Perhaps I can convince them to submit to an interview the next time I visit the area.\nCouncilor Vandacia comes from a distinguished noble family with deep roots in &lt;a href=\"Gideon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding region. His record as a member of the Imperial Council of Elders is impeccable, and his service stretches back to the time of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Durcorach\"&gt;Emperor Durcorach&lt;/a&gt;. Since the collapse of the Empire, he returned to his family holdings in Gideon and continues to take an active hand in the local politics. He is a constant presence at the Gideon courthouse and governor's mansion, and Governor Keshu\u2014the war hero also known as the Black Fin\u2014seems to appreciate Vandacia\u2019s advice and willingness to share knowledge. He may not be in charge in Gideon, but he certainly wields an unprecedented level of power in the city.\nCouncilor Jirich, likewise, continues to serve as an advocate of sorts from her manor and offices in Leyawiin. Nobles and commoners alike visit her manor at all hours of the day and night, seeking to secure his assistance in one matter or another. When they have trouble getting an appointment with Countess Caro of Leyawiin or the Chamber of Legates, they beseech Jirich to get them on the docket. When they find themselves overburdened with an abundance of taxes, they turn to Jirich to help them negotiate an equitable payment plan. She has become a fixer of sorts, a role not unlike the one she reportedly had on the Elder Council. Of course, such is the demand that most require a fixer to help them get in to speak with the ultimate fixer, Councilor Jirich.\nThere you have it, faithful readers. Six of the most prominent of the surviving Elder Council, living and working in Blackwood. Whether the shadow of Emperor Leovic and the Three Banners War still haunts them in the relative safety of the region is a story for another article. Rest assured that this chronicler is already hard at work on it even as you read this."}

This entry was &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/26373\"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on 04/25/2018.\nContents.\nDearest &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Maestro%20Forte\"&gt;Grand Maestro Forte&lt;/a&gt;\nI would first like to thank you ever so much for placing &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; within my troupe. What a true delight she has been to me! Her passion for performance is simply unmistakable. She throws herself into every lesson with a certain fearlessness, whether it be fencing, singing, even juggling! Every day she seems to master a new craft, and every day she shines just a little bit brighter.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reveries\"&gt;House of Reveries&lt;/a&gt; has always been renowned for our wonderful performers, and I have a feeling that Alchemy will soon be known as one of our greatest. Though her skills as an actress are still developing, her stage presence is undeniable. You and I both well know there are some things you simply cannot teach. The way that Alchemy draws in a crowd and keeps them on the edge of their seats, well, it seems to come as naturally to her as breathing.\nShe's simply dazzling, Forte, there's no other way to state it.\nStill, I worry about our poor darling. There's a sadness in her eyes sometimes, and slump within her shoulders. At first, I thought the pressure was getting to her, but now I'm not so sure. If anything, she seems to delve further within her work to forget something. Or someone, perhaps? Of course, I would never delve within a troupe member's background, but you know how I worry. And so, however much I hate to part with my newfound favorite, I believe a change of pace is called for.\nWith a heavy heart, I must recommend Alchemy return to &lt;a href=\"Rellenthil\"&gt;Rellenthil&lt;/a&gt; in order to benefit from your most excellent tutelage. Perhaps you can find a way to heal the sorrow which seems to dull her eyes. In any case, as one of the few who know of her past, she may at least find you a steady confidant for whatever ails her.\nI also know that you've lately struggled to secure a mentor for our troupe's Hopefuls. May I suggest our lovely lady take up that role? She has a good eye for talent, and a good heart for those who struggle. In any case, I've always found aiding others to help ease the burdens of my heart. Perhaps she will as well.\nYours lovingly,\nMaestro &lt;a href=\"Engima\"&gt;Engima&lt;/a&gt;"}

Go back to Vos and enter &lt;a href=\"Savarak%27s%20Manse\"&gt;Savarak's Manse&lt;/a&gt;. Sneak into the cellar and you will find the first evidence on the right after crossing the large room. The second one is on a desk further down the corridor and the last one is in the last room of the cellar. Bring the evidence to Llayne in the Tel Mora Tower.\nThen search for &lt;a href=\"Nerandas\"&gt;Nerandas&lt;/a&gt;. He is on the second boat on the way back to Vos. After talking to him go around the Tel Mora Tower and find the &lt;a href=\"Malignant%20Growth\"&gt;Malignant Growth&lt;/a&gt;. Return to Llayne and tell her what you found.

Mudcrabs seem to have a natural affinity for &lt;a href=\"moon%20sugar\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt; grasses. While it may seem at first that mudcrabs are harming the newly sprouted moon sugar grasses by clipping the base of their stalks, this actually encourages growth and resilience. Any browning or what would normally look to be a deceased plant is really a thriving moon-sugar grass sprout that will one day be vastly productive.\nMoon sugar grasses that continue to grow in the vertical direction and emanate vibrant colors after the mudcrab treatment should be drowned in molten lava. While this may seem like it kills the plant immediately, it is actually creating an environment that encourages the effected moon sugar grass to thrive after an extended period of time. Repeat this process until numerous moon sugar grasses begin sprouting from the piles of cooled, hardened lava.\nUsing these methods in conjunction with recommended fertilization techniques will ensure thriving and productive moon sugar grass crop. Keep in mind this process is quite time consuming and will need to be consistently repeated before truly obtaining the desired product."}

He claims to have been seduced by a witch, who then cast a spell on him while he was asleep, took everything he had including his prized enchanted axe Cloudcleaver, and left him by the road for the amusement of passersby. He requests that I take him to find the witch and help retrieve his axe, in exchange for a reward.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Barbarian.\nWhile traveling northwest from Caldera, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; encounters a barbarian clothed only in a loincloth. He explains to the Nerevarine how he was drugged and robbed of his precious Cloudcleaver and most of his clothes by a witch he was trying to help. He asks if the Nerevarine could help find the witch to retrieve his weapon and clothes. He indicates that her camp is somewhat northwest of his present location.\nThe Witch.\nAs the Nerevarine escorts the barbarian northwest on the road and follows the north path at the first intersection, the witch is located. She has a different story to tell than the one the barbarian told, saying she hired Hlormar as an escort for safety. After he became \"too friendly,\" she taught him a lesson by casting a sleep spell on him and taking his possessions. She also says that he has not calmed down enough for her to return his possessions yet, but after three days she will meet him at the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Caldera Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and return them then. He, of course, turns down that offer, leaving it up to the Nerevarine to decide whose side to take in this conflict.\nScenario One: Take Sosia's side.\nHlormar will attack the Nerevarine, and they will be forced to kill him. Hlormar is a bare-handed fighter, so almost anyone carrying a weapon can take him down easily. Sosia rewards the Nerevarine with three potions.\nScenario Two: Take Hlormar's side.\nHlormar will attack Sosia. The Nerevarine may choose whether or not to help kill her. After she has dies, loot Sosia's corpse for the Cloudcleaver and return it to Hlormar. A &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Staff%20of%20Chastening\"&gt;Steel Staff of Chastening&lt;/a&gt; can also be found in her inventory. Upon speaking with Hlormar, the player can choose whether to keep Cloudcleaver or not. If they keep the axe, Hlormar will attack them, but if they give it back he will reward the player.\nBoth the Strength increase and Cloudcleaver can be received as a reward by giving Hlormar Wine-Sot the axe, thereby receiving the Strength increase, and then killing him to take the axe from his inventory either by attacking him directly or taunting him. He will, however, wield Cloudcleaver against the Nerevarine, making the fight more difficult."}

The door leads to a large room, with several &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt; patrolling the area, with a staircase leading to another. Following the staircase, Cyrus comes across two pressure plates. Stepping on either pressure plate raises a bridge connecting the hallway leading to the large room, and a new area. Cyrus must run over the pressure plate, jump, and quickly move across the bridge into the new room in order to make use of the timed bridge mechanism.\nIn the room, a lever must be pulled, revealing a small stone gauntlet. Cyrus must then return to the large room. At the top of the staircase, Cyrus must drop down onto a raised floor, and light an unlit torch to gain access to a control panel. Using the stone gauntlet, Cyrus uses the button to unlock the door leading to the next hallway.\nIn this hallway, several blade traps are found, which quickly move from left to right, allowing only brief periods to cross. After the hallway are two rooms, the first room has two staircases on either side, with ropes going upward. The second room is a large open room with more guards patrolling the area. In this room another hallway can be seen at an elevation, underneath which is a small area containing potions. In order to access this elevated hallway, Cyrus must return to the ropes of the first room and climb up to access a lever which raises a bridge, allowing passage onto the new hallway.\nThis hallway is also protected by guards, and leads to a locked stone door which requires a key. To the right of the stone door is a ledge with a &lt;a href=\"Health%20Potion\"&gt;Health Potion&lt;/a&gt;, to the left of the door is another ledge leading to a small hallway which can be accessed via a broken pillar. Between either ledge is a lava stream. Following the hallway via the pillar, four lava pits must be passed, leading to a room with iron weight. These weights must be picked up to continue.\nNext to the room with the weights is a hallway with pressure plates. Stepping on a pressure plate and then stepping onto the next one triggers a blade trap which instantly kills Cyrus. The only way to bypass this is to leave a weight on one of the adjacent pressure plates. Three of these pressure plates are marked with the same marking as can be seen on the door at the end of the hallway, and these must have weights on them in order to open the door. Behind the door is a key, which can be used to unlock the door back along the main path.\nBehind this door is a large pillar, and various floors which can be accessed via a hole in the first floor. Before jumping into the hole, Cyrus must press a button to trigger the floors to start rotating. Each floor has several blades attached to its walls, the ones on the outer walls are static, while the ones on the inner walls move with the floor. Cyrus must find a small path leading down to the second level. Once at the second level, Cyrus must wait for a small opening between floors, as this is the only way to access the third level via a hole in the ground. From this third level, he must find a steep path leading down, bringing him to the bottom of the area outside of the turning floors. Here he has access to a tunnel leading to a large stone door. Passing through the door leads to the treasury.\nAt the treasury, the dragon, &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt; enters in conversation with Cyrus, while guarding the soulgem of Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;. He lights a brazier with his &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt;, and speaks to the protagonist. After it becomes clear that the dragon is not willing to part with his treasure, Cyrus must fight the dragon. His sabre itself will not damage Nafaalilargus, and as such, the brazier which was lit by dragonfire must be hit to give the sword the power it needs to damage the beast. After Nafaalilargus has been slain, a small cutscene plays featuring &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt;."}
