Perhaps because of this, it was deemed appropriate to give the primordial tribes of lizard-folk the name \"Argonian\" in our common tongue. What cannot be argued is the pitiful state of this province; it positively oozes with the devastated and fetid: the scars of battles past and plunderers present permanently disfigure these already-inhospitable borderlands. Wade inward, though, and the dark heart of Black Marsh will elude you; its elements combine to infect explorers with poxes both real and imagined.\nThe inhabitants of this province enjoy an anonymity not seen elsewhere. The early &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i explorer and poet &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt; described \"manlike reptiles, fleet of foot and running the length of this great mire,\" and gave the impression of an abandoned place, unlivable to settlers.

The Priory is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Order of Talos&lt;/a&gt;, a religious group that worships &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of retired members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWeynon Priory is situated along the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Road\"&gt;Black Road&lt;/a&gt;, that runs between the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt; and the city-state of Chorrol. The settlement serves as the point that connects the Black Road, with the &lt;a href=\"Orange%20Road\"&gt;Orange Road&lt;/a&gt; that runs between Chorrol and &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. Weynon Priory is a typical Imperial priory, with a large building called Weynon House, which serves as the residency for the priest, a farm and stable controlled by a herder, and the Weynon Priory chapel, the place of worship in the settlement. In earlier years, Weynon Priory had small walls and a fountain in the middle, but these were lost to time.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the region of Central Cyrodiil was engulfed in war as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the entire land. Weynon Priory was neutral in the conflict, but it was located in what was considered territory of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, Weynon Priory was an abbey dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the chief deity of &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. With the city-state of Chorrol in utter ruin, the Priory was a noteworthy target by the alliances. During the conflict, the Priory would be attacked by passing &lt;a href=\"bandits\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s, resulting in numbers dwindling. Passing &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;travelers&lt;/a&gt; aided a local priest, &lt;a href=\"Mael\"&gt;Mael&lt;/a&gt;, by burning dead friends at the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lipsand%20Tarn\"&gt;Lipsand Tarn&lt;/a&gt; and even face enemies such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowed%20Path\"&gt;Shadowed Path&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Daggers\"&gt;Black Daggers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the Weynon Priory had been a temple to Talos, ever since the Emperor's rise to power. At this point in time, the Grandmaster of the Blades, &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; had taken residence in the Priory, after serving &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; for many years. When the Emperor was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Priory with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to tell Jauffre the news. Jauffre then sends the prisoner to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, where the heir was said to be located.

She has asked for help investigating the Dwemer ruins to find Nervyna, the mine's owner.\"\nWalkthrough.\nReturn to Darkshade Caverns.\nUpon reentering &lt;a href=\"Darkshade%20Caverns%20II\"&gt;Darkshade Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, the first thing you find is an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Her name is &lt;a href=\"Shatasha\"&gt;Shatasha&lt;/a&gt;, and her expertise is in the field of Dwemer relics. She was supposed to meet &lt;a href=\"Nervyna%20Selos\"&gt;Nervyna Selos&lt;/a&gt;, the proprietor of the mines, who had apparently found an ancient Dwemer ruin which she wished to be surveyed by an expert. Unable to find Nervyna and shaken by the numerous &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kwama&lt;/a&gt; corpses strewn near the entrance, she requests your aid in finding out what has happened here.\nAs you enter the main chamber, you will see the bodies of what appear to be miners, seemingly in a catatonic state. However, before they can be properly examined, the bodies reanimate with a strange blue aura emanating from their corpses. They attack you in a feral state. Deal with them, and it quickly becomes clear that the miners aren't the only ones that are afflicted. In deeper sections of the mine, Kwama and miners attack in unison, with both sporting the same characteristics. As you pass them, you come to the sight of a terrifying battle taking place between the reactivated Dwemer Automatons and the Kwama. Breaking up the fight is not enough, as a powerful &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kwama Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Transmuted%20Hive%20Lord\"&gt;Transmuted Hive Lord&lt;/a&gt;, emerges from the ground, disturbed by all the commotion. Its power is greatly boosted due to the affliction and it is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Draining%20Scrib\"&gt;Draining Scrib&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sedating%20Scrib\"&gt;Sedating Scrib&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href=\"Scrib%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scribs&lt;/a&gt; with debilitating attacks.\nOvercome them and save Nervyna Selos. Although she is in a very foul mood, she recognizes you as the one who helped her kill &lt;a href=\"Tervur%20Sadri\"&gt;Tervur Sadri&lt;/a&gt;, and reveals what has happened since the last time you were here. The Kwama continued digging through the Dwemer ruins, which resulted in them displaying feral instincts and inducing anger in those nearby. This incursion also awakened the Dwemer constructs, which turned the entire mine into a battlefield. Shatasha volunteers to explore the ruins further in an effort to find the source of the problem. \nThe Path to Rkugamz.\nYou find yourself once more upon the outskirts of the unearthed Dwemer ruin. Shatasha and Nervyna went on ahead to the large cavern below. Shatasha identifies the ruin as &lt;a href=\"Rkugamz\"&gt;Rkugamz&lt;/a&gt; and the pair is distracted by &lt;a href=\"Grobull%20the%20Transmuted\"&gt;Grobull the Transmuted&lt;/a&gt; that has apparently been injured by the Dwemer constructs. As they approach, they are surprised when the netch suddenly reawakens and shocks them, rendering them immobile. Fight through the horde of constructs and face the hostile netch in combat.\nGrobull has a damage shield that reflects all incoming damage and can summon large groups of netch calves. Attack it during the small windows of time where its shield wears off, rendering it vulnerable to attacks. Shatasha and Nervyna come to once more, and Shatasha figures out what is causing the strange behavior in the kwama and the miners. She reveals the legend behind Rkugamz, of how the Dwemer abandoned this city when their masterwork, known only as the \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Engine\"&gt;Great Engine&lt;/a&gt;,\" was seemingly cursed by the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;. She hypothesizes that destroying the engine would put a stop to the spread of the infection and beseeches you to hurry, lest they become infected too.\nThe Great Engine.\nThe entrance to the room where the Great Engine lies is behind a veritable army of &lt;a href=\"Engine%20Garrison\"&gt;Dwemer constructs&lt;/a&gt;, composed of every kind imaginable, from &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spheres&lt;/a&gt; and even mighty &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;centurions&lt;/a&gt;. Take on each contingent of constructs slowly, and don't bite off more than you can chew. After dispatching them, enter the engine room. You are confronted by &lt;a href=\"The%20Engine%20Guardian\"&gt;The Engine Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, a massive Dwarven Spider kitted with many elemental attacks, including fire, electricity and poison.\nAfter a grueling battle, the guardian is destroyed, which starts a cascading effect, destroying the entire room and the engine along with it. Escape the engine room and meet up with Nervyna and Shatasha, who are relieved that the nightmare is finally over. This incident has resulted in both of them receiving unexpected benefits. Nervyna is poised to get a tidy sum of money with the deal she intends to make with the Mages Guild, and she plans to retire from the kwama mining business forever. Shatasha expects to become famous for her research of Rkugamz, which would set her up for life."}

It has cultural ties to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, though scholars fail to agree on just about every detail that has ever been written about it\u2014including whether or not different accounts are referencing the same object.\nAcademics recognize one such artifact, called Volendrung, as a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Artifacts\"&gt;Dwemer relic&lt;/a&gt; forged by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Rourken\"&gt;Clan Rourken&lt;/a&gt;. It was carried into battle as a family symbol as much as it was the chieftain's weapon, and was made famous when the Rourkens refused to join the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The other Dwemer forsook them for the slight, and the Rourkens refused to stay with their people if it meant an alliance with the Chimer\u2014their sworn enemies.\nSo the Rourken chieftain hurled Volendrung into the sky, declaring that their people would find a home wherever it landed. Volendrung thus served as a guiding light for Clan Rourken in exile as the Hammer roared, beastlike, across the sky. It shone like a second sun during the day, mirrored the moons at night, and led the Rourken to the other side of the continent. There, they supposedly founded the fabled city of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;\u2014which has yet to be discovered in the modern era, if it ever truly existed.\nBut how did the unidentified Rourken chieftain manage such a tremendous throw? Dwemer armies were known for their engines of war, and their mechanical infantry. If the Dwemer had the capability to project a weapon cross-continent by hand, why did they never utilize such long-range assaults in warfare? Even a modern Arch-Mage would have difficulty concocting a spell to launch an object over such a distance. Unless Volendrung was actually a flying engine, powered by lost Dwemer mechanics, the whole story reeks of a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; tale.\nSome skeptics, including this one, believe the Dwemer Volendrung's flight is simply poetic imagery representing the wandering exile of Clan Rourken.\nA second hammer called Volendrung, this time a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, exists in records nearly as old as the Dwemer version. Malacath's relic echoes the Dwemer name, and for this reason, many assume that it is the same legendary weapon. But why would the God of Curses associate himself with an object forged by enemies? To make a mockery of Dwemer work? To take something the Dwemer treasured and use it as an instrument against them? A rather subversive and indirect action\u2014unbecoming of Malacath's historically straightforward mentality.\n&lt;a href=\"Angarin\"&gt;Angarin&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Daedric%20Armory\"&gt;The Daedric Armory&lt;/a&gt;\" speculates on the Hammer's magical features: the text cites several &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; papers, claiming the Hammer empowers its wielder, and drains the strength of struck foes\u2014very much in line with a Malacathan design. There is little doubt that the relic described could be tied to the God of Curses. What is in doubt is whether it was named by mortals or by Malacath himself\u2014and whether the Rourken Clan wielded the same Hammer in centuries past.\nWhat is Volendrung? Tamriel may never know."}

She will desperately ask for help, addressing that Stibbons is in danger in a near location known as the Manor or Revelry.\nEntering the Manor, the Vestige is surprised by a sunny desert landscape inside Coldharbour, with people eating, bathing, dancing, playing, singing and sleeping full of joy. Stibbons is being accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; sisters, &lt;a href=\"Nuzara\"&gt;Nuzara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rayyaima\"&gt;Rayyaima&lt;/a&gt;, who warmfully welcome the Vestige and makes an invitation to the banquet.\nIt's optional to talk with Fatahala, who insists the Vestige may play along and go to the banquet to understand the illusion.

Still, both want Fatahala to be turned to their madness.\nHeading to the banquet, while eating, the screen goes bright, and all the manor guests turn into undead, revealing it was all another of many illusions of Coldharbour. Stibbons can't see through it, and decides to go to the pools. It's optional to talk with Fatahala, who affirms the Vestige could see through the illusion and for that can save Stibbons.\nMeeting &lt;a href=\"Shayaifa\"&gt;Shayaifa&lt;/a&gt;, another of the sisters, she welcomes the Vestige once again and insists for a bath in the pool with Stibbons and the other guests. But after that, she suggests the Vestige to be washed in the basin, for its purest waters.\nTalking with Fatahala, she will ask to place cleansing reagents into the basin, in order to break the illusion. After doing so, the illusion is broken, all guests become undead, and Fatahala is revealed as a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoing to the manor house, the place is guarded in all floors. Stibbons is located in the storage room, without clothes and locked in a cage. The key to the cage is with Shayaifa, also a Dark Seducer. After defeating her and freeing Stibbons, who takes a moment to dress, Fatahala arrives. Stibbons realizes they got Lady Laurant's jewels, and asks the Vestige to get it back.\nThe jewels are guarded by Nuzara and Rayyaima. After dealing with them, the Vestige, Fatahala and Stibbons head to the cave that leads to a secret exit. There, after facing numerous foes, the three escape outside the Manor."}

Ethian will tell you that his wife is currently missing; he last saw her in the ice fields getting people off the wrecked ships. You can talk to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Henrisa\"&gt;Captain Henrisa&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Either way, head up north into the ice fields.

You will not find her there, but you will find Lord Ethian; talk to him and he will tell you he saw the captain head for the tower just to the southeast. Follow him there; you will have to kill Coris Rufinus at the tower's base. Climb to the top of the tower and you will find Lord Ethian. When you talk to him here, he will admit that he was aware of a scheme to go off course and have the ambassador miss her meeting with Kurog. \nHead back to the base of the tower. Holbert will come running up to you to tell you that Skordo followed Henrisa to an old smuggler's hole to the northwest. Talk to Skordo there and he will theorize that they are keeping the ambassador in this cave. After you are done talking, Ethian will start shouting at the door that they need to release his wife, and the captain will come out and stab the man before heading back in. \nHead into the cave and kill Henrisa. Once she is dead, head to the back of the cave to free Lady Sovelle, then follow her outside. Ethian will have died of his injuries; talk to Lady Sovelle to finish the quest."}

(Kirkbride)", "text": "1E1200-2208 The Dragon Break.\nScholar-priests of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; tamper with the Dragon God of Time.\nA fanatical sect of the Alessian Order, the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;, becomes frustrated by ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i traditions still present within the theological system of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, they hated any admission that &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Spirit, was indisputably also &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Elven High God.\nNewly invented rituals were utilized to disprove this theory, to no avail. Finally, the secret masters of the Marukhati Selective channeled the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; itself to mythically remove those aspects of the Dragon God they disapproved of. A staff or tower appeared before them. The secret masters danced on it until it writhed and trembled and spoke its protonymic.\nThe tower split into eight pieces and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Time broke&lt;/a&gt;. The non-linearity of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; had returned.\n&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; slept through the disaster, which 'lasted one thousand and eight years', until the pieces of the tower came to rest on the mortal plane.\nEvery culture on Tamriel remembers the Dragon Break in some fashion; to most it is a spiritual anguish that they cannot account for. Several texts survive this timeless period, all (unsurprisingly) conflicting with each other regarding events, people, and regions: wars are mentioned in some that never happen in another, the sun changes color depending on the witness, and the gods either walk among the mortals or they don't. Even the 'one thousand and eight years,' a number (some say arbitrarily) chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, is an unreliable measure.\nWhether or not the secret masters of the Marukhati Selective were successful is unknown, and any records of their survival were destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; that ended the Alessian Order a hundred years later.\n&lt;a href=\"Corax\"&gt;Corax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;.\n\u201cNo one understands what happened when the Selectives danced on that tower. It would be easy to dismiss the whole matter as nonsense were it not for the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Even the Elder Scrolls do not mention it -- let me correct myself, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; cannot mention it. When the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Moth Priests&lt;/a&gt; attune the Scrolls to the timeless time their glyphs always disappear. The Amulet of Kings, however, with its oversoul of emperors, can speak of it at length.

Throughout Cicero's one-sided conversation, the Night Mother will be illuminated and speak directly to the Dragonborn informing them that they are the \"one\" and that Cicero cannot hear her because he is not the &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;.

Astrid will then enter the room to check on the commotion and when the Dragonborn informs Cicero that that the Night Mother spoke to them, with the phrase she provided, Cicero will become ecstatic and proclaim the Dragonborn as Listener of the Dark Brotherhood. Astrid, however, after being informed of the Night Mother's instructions, orders the Dragonborn not to go to Volunruud until she can assess what has happened and to instead seek out Nazir for contracts, as she feels her authority as Mistress of the Sanctuary has been challenged. After accepting a contract from Nazir, the quest will be complete."}

Although the exact causes of the conflict are not specified, the Elven Supremacist government, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a few quotes throughout Skyrim suggest the Elves were the aggressors. The events of this occurred after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; (the events of ) and before those of . The treaty was the only means to end the conflict for the Empire and heavily favors the Aldmeri Dominion. Among its terms were the outlawing of the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, disbandment of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and the right for the Thalmor to move throughout Skyrim after the Empire didn't enforce the White-Gold Concordat during the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, to hunt down both worshipers of Talos and any remaining Blades in the province.\nEffects of the Concordat.\nThe treaty, though its terms are very unfavorable to the Empire, was initiated by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to by the Aldmeri Dominion due largely to the outcome of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Aldmeri army in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was completely destroyed by the Imperial army under Titus II. The Empire initiated the treaty knowing that, despite a temporary reversal in fortunes, the Aldmeri were in a position to eventually overwhelm the Empire - the Imperial army had suffered the loss of three entire Legions during the war (one in the retreat from the Imperial City in the previous year and two more during the Battle of the Red Ring) in addition to the surviving portion having lost over half its men.\nThe Concordat has caused a great deal of resentment in the &lt;a href=\"Nordic\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; population of Skyrim, who feel angered at the ban of Talos worship and are dishonored at the Empire's signing of the treaty. The Jarls weren't asked about their views on the treaty, and were never given a chance to object to the terms of the treaty either, with the empire ordering them to adhere to it. They were, however, given chests of gold by the emperor so that they would be motivated to not dispute it.\nThe Concordat's terms also included the cession by the Empire of a large portion of southern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the Aldmeri Dominion. Hammerfell, however, was unwilling to accept the loss of so much territory and continued to fight, forcing Titus II to officially release Hammerfell from status as an Imperial province in order to maintain the treaty. After five more years of fighting, the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; were able to fight the Aldmeri to a standstill, leading to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt;, as a result of the signing of this treaty the Aldmeri forces completely withdrew from Hammerfell. Southern Hammerfell was, after ten years of continuous warfare, left in a devastated state, and Hammerfell remained an independent province. It has been claimed that the Aldmeri stipulated the cession of southern Hammerfell to intentionally further weaken the Empire, knowing that the Empire would be forced to release Hammerfell as a province and create Imperial resentment among the Redguards, many of whom see the release by the Empire as abandonment.\nTreaty Terms.\nUltimatum Terms.\nA large tribute of gold would be paid to the Aldmeri Dominion, the Empire would give a large portion of southern Hammerfell to the Dominion, the worship of Talos would be banned from the empire, and the Blades would be forced to disband. This was the original demand of the Thalmor prior to the Great War, which was rejected by Titus Mede II.\nConcordat Terms.\nDespite the White-Gold Concordat being nearly identical to the ultimatum, Titus Mede II agreed to signing it:\nThe only part of the original ultimatum not present in the Concordat was the tribute of gold the Dominion initially demanded."}

Upon exiting the staircase, you'll move forward to a large open area with a drawbridge spanning to the other side. There is a pull chain to the left of the bridge that only drops the first half. To cross, you will need to move to your right to the small platform next to the wood slat wall. Whirlwind sprint to the opposite side where you will find a chest and a soul stone. Above the chest is the chain to lower the other half of the bridge.\nSublocations.\nWhite Ridge Sanctum.\nImmediately upon entering you will come across a closed door and the bodies of two Reavers.

The chamber consists of a ramp to the left, a large chasm to the front, a passageway further to the South leading to the Priest &lt;a href=\"Dukaan\"&gt;Dukaan&lt;/a&gt; and the Black Book. To the right a passageway which leads down to the chasm, containing 5 Ruby Geodes.\nTo the immediate left is a ramp leading to the &lt;a href=\"Imbuing%20Chamber\"&gt;Imbuing Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, used to make the Spider Scrolls. In this area to the left of where you came in is a passage covered in breakable cobwebs. This leads to a prison of sorts where multiple Reavers under the control of Spiders, along with a few Albino Spiders will be trapped behind an Apprentice-Expert locked door. At the end of the passage is a lone chest with leveled loot. Also in the chamber are several Geode veins: two located by the entrance, one located under the scaffolding by the cage.\nUnder the cage itself containing the Imbuing Chamber is another passage, also covered in cobwebs. This contains the living quarters that were used. It's covered in webbing and cobwebs, with an egg clutch located by the entryway among some bookshelves. Following upstairs will lead you to a ladder which leads to the outside and a quick entry point to get to the Imbuing Chamber from outside. Continuing along the passage will lead to a Geode at the end of the hallway, along with a Silver Ore and Iron Ore in a trough next to a knapsack.\nBack in the main chamber to the south is the main passageway leading to Dukaan the Dragon Priest. This area is guarded by a few Albino Spiders, various pods and, depending on the level of the Dragonborn, a Draugr Deathlord. Following down the passage will lead to a balcony facing the Word Wall and a sarcophagus. Directly beneath the balcony will be the \"\"."}

The cartel controls the flow of money in Abah's Landing through legal or illegal practices. Usually through smuggling, slavery, and unlawful transactions.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nLike the other Merchant Lords of Abah's Landing, the Thazahrr Cartel became a sufficient figure around &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;2E 422&lt;/a&gt;. The Cartel was unique for multiple reasons, one for their peculiar great founder, and their ironic way of trading. The group was founded by a female Khajiit named &lt;a href=\"Thazahrr-ra\"&gt;Thazahrr-ra&lt;/a&gt; who took the male honorific \"ra\". The Cartel made its money through the slave trade which is ironic since their founder is a Khajiit. The Cartel had members ranging from &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, and other Khajiits. The Cartel did not just benefit from the slave trade, but like other shady groups, they excelled at smuggling and processing information.\nDuring the Resurrection of the Thieves Guild.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; situated in &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt; began to grow in prominence after a few occurrences at &lt;a href=\"Hubalajad%20Palace\"&gt;Hubalajad Palace&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, the Merchant Lord of the Cartel was &lt;a href=\"Thazahrr%20Goldfang\"&gt;Thazahrr Goldfang&lt;/a&gt; who was the sixth woman to take the name of the founder. Goldfang was a very stubborn and unhappy woman who felt that the current conditions of the Merchant Houses at the time was piss poor at best. Business hit that houses hard but it affected the Cartel the hardest. Goldfang desired to bring the cartel back from the grave and into the light."}

Better that I had died believing myself the victor. Although cast beyond the doors of night, he will return. Be vigilant!

You knew her as Paravant, given to her when crowned, 'first of its kind', by which the gods meant a mortal worthy of the majesty that is killing-questing-healing, which is also Paraval, Pevesh, Perrethu, Perrif, and, in my case, for it is what I called her when we were lovers: Paravania.\"\n\"Though she is gone to me, she remains bathed in stars, first Empress, Lady of Heaven, Queen-ut-Cyrod.\"\nAnd they considered themselves full-answered, and departed."}

The series is fictional, as indicated by the names of the characters. For example, Eslaf Erol, the main character in the series, is \"False Lore\" when spelled backwards. This can be found for all of the characters, as shown below:\nContents.\nBeggar.\nEslaf Erol was the last of the litter of five born to the Queen of the prosperous &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic kingdom of Erolgard, Lahpyrcopa, and her husband, the King of Erolgard, Ytluaf. During pregnancy, the Queen had been more than twice as wide as she was tall, and the act of delivery took three months and six days after it had begun. It is perhaps understandable that the Lahpyrcopa elected, upon expelling Eslaf to frown, say, 'Good riddance,' and die.\nLike many Nords, Ytluaf did not care very much for his wife and less for his &lt;a href=\"Children\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;. His subjects were puzzled, therefore, when he announced that he would follow the ancient tradition of his people of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; of following his beloved spouse to the grave. They had not thought they were particularly in love, nor were they aware that such a tradition existed. Still, the simple people were grateful, for the little royal drama alleviated their boredom, which was and is a common problem in the more obscure parts of northern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in wintertide.\nHe gathered his household staff and his five fat, bawling little heirs in front of him, and divided his estate. To his son Ynohp, he gave his title; to his son Laernu, he gave his land; to his son Suoibud, he gave his fortune; to his daughter Laicifitra, he gave his army. Ytluaf's advisors had suggested he keep the inheritance together for the good of the kingdom, but Ytluaf did not particularly care for his advisors, or the kingdom, for that matter. Upon making his announcement, he drew his dagger across his throat.\nOne of the nurses, who was rather shy, finally decided to speak as the King's life ebbed away. 'Your highness, you forgot your fifth child, little Eslaf.'\nGood Ytluaf groaned. It is somewhat hard to concentrate with blood gushing from one's throat, after all. The King tried in vain to think of something to bequeath, but there was nothing left.\nFinally he sputtered, irritably, 'Eslaf should have taken something then' and died.\nThat a babe but a few days old was expected to demand his rightful inheritance was arguably unfair. But so Eslaf Erol was given his birthright with his father's dying breath. He would have nothing, but what he had taken.\nSince no one else would have him, the shy nurse, whose name was Drusba, took the baby home. It was a decrepit little shack, and over the years that followed, it became more and more decrepit. Unable to find work, Drusba sold all of her furnishings to buy food for little Eslaf. By the time he was old enough to walk and talk, she had sold the walls and the roof as well, so they had nothing but a floor to call home. And if you've ever been to Skyrim, you can appreciate that that is scarcely sufficient.\nDrusba did not tell Eslaf the story of his birth, or that his brothers and sister were leading quite nice lives with their inheritances, for, as we have said, she was rather shy, and found it difficult to broach the subject. She was so painfully shy, in fact, that whenever he asked any questions about where he came from, Drusba would run away. That was more or less her answer to everything, to flee.\nIn order to communicate with her at all, Eslaf learned how to run almost as soon as he could walk. He couldn't keep up with his adopted mother at first, but in time he learned to go toe-heel toe-heel if he anticipated a short but fast sprint, and heel-toe heel-toe if it seemed Drusba was headed for a long distance marathon flight. He never did get all the answers he needed from her, but Eslaf did learn how to run.\nThe kingdom of Erolgard had, in the years that Eslaf was growing, become quite a grim place. King Ynohp did not have a treasury, for Suoibud had been given that; he did not have any property for income, for Laernu had been given that; he did not have an army to protect the people, for Laicifitra had been given that. Furthermore, as he was but a child, all decisions in the kingdom went through Ynohp's rather corrupt council. It had become a bureaucratic exploitative land of high taxes, rampant crime, and regular incursions from neighboring kingdoms. Not a particular unusual situation for a kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but an unpleasant one nonetheless.\nThe time finally came when the taxcollector arrived to Drusba's hovel, such as it was, to collect the only thing he could - the floor. Rather than protest, the poor shy maid ran away, and Eslaf never saw her again.\nWithout a home or a mother, Eslaf did not know what to do. He had grown accustomed to the cold open air in Drusba's shack, but he was hungry.\n'May I have a piece of &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;?' he asked the butcher down the street. 'I'm very hungry.'\nThe man had known the boy for years, often spoke to his wife about how sorry he felt for him, growing up in a home with no ceilings or walls. He smiled at Eslaf and said, 'Go away, or I'll hit you.'\nEslaf hurriedly left the butcher and went to a nearby tavern. The tavernkeeper had been a former valet in the king's court and knew that the boy was by right a prince. Many times, he had seen the poor ragged lad in the streets, and sighed at the way fate had treated him.\n'May I have something to eat?' Eslaf asked this tavernkeeper. 'I'm very hungry.'\n'You're lucky I don't cook you up and eat you,' replied the tavernkeeper.\nEslaf hurriedly left the tavern. For the rest of the day, the boy approached the good citizens of Erolgard, begging for food. One person had thrown something at him, but it turned out to be an inedible rock.\nAs night fell, a raggedy man came up to Eslaf and, without saying a word, handed him a piece of fruit and a piece of dried meat. The lad took it, wide-eyed, and as he devoured it, he thanked the man very sweetly.\n'If I see you begging on the streets tomorrow,' the man growled. 'I'll kill you myself. There are only so many beggars we of the guild allow in any one town, and you make it one too many. You're ruining business.'\nIt was a good thing Eslaf Erol knew how to run. He ran all night.\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;.\nThief.\nIf the reader has not yet had the pleasure of reading the first volume in these series on the life of Eslaf Erol, &lt;a href=\"Beggar%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Beggar&lt;/a&gt;, he should close this book immediately, for I shan't recap.\nI will tell you this much, gentle reader. When we last saw Eslaf, he was a boy, an orphan, a failed beggar, running through the wildy winter woods of Skyrim, away from his home of Erolgard. He continued running, stopping here and there, for many more years, until he was a young man.\nEslaf discovered that among the ways of getting food, asking for it was the most troublesome. Far easier was finding it in the wilderness, or taking it from unguarded market stalls. The only thing worse than begging to get food was begging for the opportunity to work for the money to buy it. That seemed needlessly complicated.\nNo, as far as Eslaf was concerned, he was best off being a scavenger, a beggar, and a thief.\nHe his first act of thievery shortly after leaving Erolgard, while in the southern woods of Tamburkar in the rugged land near Mount Jensen just east of the village of Hoarbeld. Eslaf was starving, having not eaten anything but a rather scrawny raw squirrel in four days, and he smelled meat cooking and then found the smoke. A band of minstrel bards was making camp. He watched them from the bushes as they cooked, and joked, and flirted, and sang.\nHe could've asked them for some food, but so many others had refused him before. Instead, he rushed out, grabbed a piece of meat from the fire, and wincing from the burns, scrambled up the nearest tree to devour it while the bards stood under him and laughed.\n'Wh\u200bat is your next move, thief?' giggled a fair, red-headed woman who was covered with tattoos. 'How do you intend to disappear without us catching and punishing you?'\nAs the hunger subsided, Eslaf realized she was right. The only way to get out of the tree without falling in their midst was to take the branch down to where it hung over a creek. It was a drop off a cliff of about fifty feet. That seemed like the wisest strategy, so Eslaf began crawling in that direction.\n'You do know how to fall, boy?' called out a young &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i, but a few years older than Eslaf, thin but muscular, graceful in his slightest movements. 'If you don't, you should just climb down here and take what's coming to you. It's idiotic to break your neck, when we'd just give you some bruises and send you on your way.'\n'Of course I know how to fall,' Eslaf called back, but he didn't. He just thought the trick of falling was to have nothing underneath you, and let nature take its course. But fifty feet up, when you're looking down, is enough to give anyone pause.\n'I'm sorry to doubt your abilities, Master Thief,' said the Khajiiti, grinning. 'Obviously you know to fall feet first with your body straight but loose to avoid cracking like an egg. It seems you are destined to escape us.'\nEslaf wisely followed the Khajiiti's hints, and leapt into the river, falling without much grace but without hurting himself. In the years that followed, he had to make several more drops from even greater heights, usually after a theft, sometimes without water beneath him, and he improved the basic technique.\nWhen he arrived in the western town of Jallenheim on the morning of his twenty-first birthday, it didn't take him long to find out who was the richest person, most deserving of being burgled. An impregnable palace in a park near the center of town was owned by a mysterious young man named Suoibud. Eslaf wasted no time in finding the palace and watching it. A fortified palace he had come to learn was like a person, with quirks and habits beneath its hard shell.\nIt was not an old place, evidently whatever money this Suoibud had come into was fairly recent. It was regularly patrolled by guards, implying that the rich man was fearful of been burgled, with good reason. The most distinctive feature of the palace was its tower, rising a hundred feet above the stone walls, doubtless giving the occupant a good defensive view. Eslaf guessed that that if Suoibud was as paranoid as he guessed him to be, the tower would also provide a view of the palace storehouse. The rich man would want to keep an eye on his fortune. That meant that the loot couldn't be directly beneath the tower, but somewhere in the courtyard within the walls.\nThe light in the tower shone all night long, so Eslaf boldly decided that the best time to burgle was by the light of day, when Suoibud must sleep. That would be the time the guards would least expect a thief to pounce.\nAnd so, when the noon sun was shining over the palace, Eslaf quickly scaled the wall near the front gate and waited, hidden in the crenelations. The interior courtyard was plain and desolate, with few places to hide, but he saw that there were two wells. One the guards used from time to time to draw up water and slake their thirst, but Eslaf noticed that guards would pass by the other well, never using it.\nHe waited until the guards were distracted, just for a second, by the arrival of a merchant in a wagon, bearing goods for the palace. While they were searching his wagon, Eslaf leapt, elegantly, feet first, from the wall into the well.\nIt was not a particularly soft landing for, as Eslaf had guessed, the well was not full of water, but gold. Still, he knew how to roll after a fall, and he didn't hurt himself. In the dank subterranean storehouse, he stuffed his pockets with gold and was about to go to the door which he assumed would lead to the tower when he noticed a gem the size of an apple, worth more than all the gold that was left. Eslaf found room for it down his pants.\nThe door did indeed lead to the tower, and Eslaf followed its curving stairwell up, walking quietly but quickly. At the top, he found the master of the palace's private quarters, ornate and cold, with invaluable artwork and decorative swords and shields on the walls. Eslaf assumed the snoring lump under the sheets was Suoibud, but he didn't investigate too closely. He crept to the windows and looked out.\nIt was going to be a difficult fall, for certes. He needed to jump from the tower, past the walls, and hit the tree on the other side. The tree branches would hurt, but they would break his fall, and there was a pile of hay he had left under the tree to prevent further injury.\nEslaf was about to leap when the occupant of the room woke up with a start, yelling, 'My gem!'\nEslaf and stared at him for a second, wide-eyed. They looked alike. Not surprising, since they were brothers.\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarrior.\nThis is the third book in a four-book series. If you have not read the first two books, '&lt;a href=\"Beggar%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Beggar&lt;/a&gt;' and '&lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;', you would be well advised to do so.\nSuoibud Erol did not know much of his past, nor did he care to.\nAs a child, he had lived in Erolgard, but the kingdom was very poor and taxes were as a result very high. He was too young to manage his abundant inheritance, but his servants, fearing that their master would be ruined, moved him to Jallenheim. No one knew why that location was picked. Some old maid, long dead now, had thought it was a good place to raise a child. No one else had a better idea.\nThere may have been children with a more pampered, more spoiled existence than young Suoibud, but that is doubtful. As he grew, he understood that he was rich, but he had nothing else. No family, no social position, no security at all. Loyalty, he found out on more than one occasion, cannot truly be bought. Knowing that he had but one asset, a vast fortune, he was determined to protect it, and, if possible, increase it.\nSome otherwise perfectly nice people are greedy, but Suoibud was that rare accident of nature or breeding who has no other interest but acquiring and hoarding gold. He was willing to do anything to increase his fortune. Most recently, he had begun secretly hiring mercenaries to attack desirable properties, and then buying them when no one wanted to live there any more. The attacks would then, of course, cease, and Suoibud would have profitable land which he had purchased for a song. It had begun small with a few farms, but recently he had begun a more ambitious campaign.\nIn north-central &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, there is an area called The Aalto, which is of unique geographical interest. It is a dormant volcanic valley surrounded on all sides by glaciers, so the earth is hot from the volcano, but the constant water drizzle and air is frigid. A grape called Jazbay grows there comfortably, and everywhere else in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; it withers and dies. The strange vineyard is a privately owned, and the wine produced from it is thus rare and extremely expensive. It is said that the Emperor needs the permission of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Council to have a glass of it once a year.\nIn order to harass the owner of The Aalto into selling his land cheap, Suoibud had to hire more than a few mercenaries. He had to hire the finest private army in Skyrim.\nSuoibud did not like spending money, but he had agreed to pay the general of the army, a woman called Laicifitra, a gem the size of an apple. He had not given it to her yet \u2014 payment was to be delivered on the success of the mission \u2014 but he had trouble sleeping knowing that he was going to giving up such a prize. He always slept during the day so he could watch his storehouse by night, when he knew thieves were about.\nThat brings us up to this moment when, after a fitful sleep, Suoibud woke up at about noon, and surprised a thief in his bedroom. The thief was Eslaf.\nEslaf had been contemplating a leap from the window, a hundred feet down, into the branches of a tree beyond the walls of the fortified palace, and a tumble into a stack of hay. Anyone who has ever attempted such a feat will testify that it takes some concentration and nerve to do such a thing. When he saw that the rich man sleeping in the room had awakened, both left him, and Eslaf slipped behind a tall ornamental shield on display to wait for Suoibud to go back to sleep.\nSuoibud did not go back to sleep. He had heard nothing, but could feel someone in the room with him. He stood up and began pacing the room.\nSuoibud paced and paced, and gradually decided that he was imagining things. No one was there. His fortune was safe and secure.\nHe was returning to his bed when he heard a clunk. Turning around, he saw the gem, the one he was to give to Laicifitra on the floor by the Atmoran cavalry shield. A hand reached out from behind the shield and grabbed it up.\n'Thief!' Suoibud cried out, grabbing a jeweled &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; katana from the wall and lunging at the shield.\nThe 'fight' between Eslaf and Suoibud will not go down in the annals of great duels. Suoibud did not know how to use a sword, and Eslaf was no expert at blocking with a shield. It was clumsy, it was awkward. Suoibud was furious, but was psychologically incapable of using the sword in any way that could damage its fine filligree, reducing its market value. Eslaf kept moving, dragging the shield with him, trying to keep it between him and the blade, which is, after all, the most essential part of any block.\nSuoibud screamed in frustration as he struck at the shield, bumping its way across the room. He even tried negotiating with the thief, explaining that the gem was promised to a great warrior named Laicifitra, and if he would give it back, Suoibud would happily give him something else in return. Eslaf was not a genius, but he did not believe that.\nBy the time Suoibud's guards came to the bedroom in response to their master's calls, he had succeeded in backing the shield into a window.\nThey fell on the shield, having considerable more expertise with their swords than Suoibud did, but they discovered that there was no one behind it. Eslaf had leapt out the window and escaped.\nAs he ran heavily through the streets of Jallenheim, making jingling noises from the gold coins in his pockets, and feeling the huge gem chafe where he had hidden it, Eslaf did not know where he should go next. He knew only that he could never go back to that town, and he must avoid this warrior named Laicifitra who had claims on the jewel.\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book &lt;a href=\"King%20%28Book%29\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;\nKing.\nGentle reader, you will not understand a word of what follows unless you have read and to memory the first three volumes in this series, &lt;a href=\"Beggar%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Beggar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, which leads up to this, the conclusion. I encourage you to seek them out at your favorite bookseller.\nWe last left Eslaf Erol fleeing for his life, which was a common enough for him. He had stolen a lot of gold, and one particularly large gem, from a rich man in Jallenheim named Suoibud. The thief fled north, spending the gold wildly, as thieves generally do, for all sorts of illicit pleasures, which would no doubt disturb the gentleman or lady reading this, so I will not go into detail.\nThe one thing he held onto was the gem.\nHe didn't keep it because of any particular attachment, but because he did not know anyone rich enough to buy it from him. And so he found himself in the ironic situation of being penniless and having in his possession a gem worth millions.\n\"Will you give me a room, some bread, and a flagon of beer in exchange for this?\" he asked a tavernkeep in the little village of Kravenswold, which was so far north, it was half situated on the Sea of Ghosts.\nThe tavernkeep looked at it suspiciously.\n\"It's just crystal,\" Eslaf said quickly. \"But isn't it pretty?\"\nLet me see that,' said a young armor-clad woman at the end of the bar. Without waiting permission, she picked up the gem, studied it, and smiled not very sweetly at Eslaf. 'Would you join me at my table?\n\"I'm actually in a bit of a hurry,\" replied Eslaf, holding out his hand for the stone. 'Another time?'\n'Out of respect for my friend, the tavernkeep here, my men and I leave our weapons behind when we come in here,' the woman said casually, not handing the gem back, but picking up a broom that was sitting against the bar. 'I can assure you, however, that I can use this quite effectively as a blunt instrument. Not a weapon, of course, but an instrument to stun, medicinally crush a bone or two, and then - once it is on the inside \u2026'\n'Which table?' asked Eslaf quickly.\nThe young woman led him to a large table in the back of the tavern where ten of the biggest Nord brutes Eslaf had ever seen were sitting. They looked at him with polite disinterest, as if he were a strange insect, worth briefly studying before crushing.\n'My name is Laicifitra,' she said, and Eslaf blinked. That was the name Suoibud had uttered before Eslaf had made his escape. 'And these are my lieutenants. I am the commander of a very large independent army of noble knights. The very best in Skyrim. Most recently we were given a job to attack a vineyard in The Aalto to force its owner, a man named Laernu, to sell to our employer, a man named Suoibud. Our payment was to be a gem of surpassing size and quality, quite famous and unmistakable.\"\n\"We did as we were asked, and when we went to Suoibud to collect our fee, he told us he was unable to pay, due to a recent burglary. In the end, though, he saw things our way, and paid us an amount of gold almost equal to the worth of the prize jewel \u2026 It did not empty out his treasury entirely, but it meant he was unable to buy the land in the Aalto after all. So we were not paid enough, Suoibud has taken a heavy financial blow, and Laernu's prize crop of Jazbay has been temporarily destroyed for naught,\" Laicifitra took a long, slow drink of her mead before continuing. \"Now, I wonder, could you tell me, how came you in the possession of the gem we were promised?\"\nEslaf did not answer at once.\nInstead, he took a piece of bread from the plate of the savage bearded barbarian on his left and ate it.\n'I'm sorry,' he said, his mouth full. 'May I? Of course, I couldn't stop you from taking the gem even if I wanted to, and as a matter of fact, I don't mind at all. It's also useless to deny how it came into my possession. I stole it from your employer. I certainly didn't mean you or your noble knights any harm by it, but I can understand why the word of a thief is not suitable for one such as yourself.'\n'No,' replied Laicifitra, frowning, but her eyes showing amusement. 'Not suitable at all.'\n'But before you kill me,' Eslaf said, grabbing another piece of bread. 'Tell me, how suitable is it for noble knights such as yourself to be paid twice for one job? I have no honor myself, but I would have thought that since Suoibud took a profit loss to pay you, and now you have the gem, your handsome profit is not entirely honorable.'\nLaicifitra picked up the broom and looked at Eslaf. Then she laughed, 'What is your name, thief?'\n'Eslaf,' said the thief.\n'We will take the gem, as it was promised to us. But you are right. We should not be paid twice for the same job. So,' said the warrior woman, putting down the broomstick. 'You are our new employer. What would you have your own army do for you?\"\nMany people could find quite a few good uses for their own army, but Eslaf was not among them. He searched his brain, and finally it was decided that it was a debt to be paid later. For all her brutality, Laicifitra was an simple woman, raised, he learned, by the very army she commanded. Fighting and honor were the only things she knew.\nWhen Eslaf left Kravenswold, he had an army at his beck and call, but not a coin to his name. He knew he would have to steal something soon.\nAs he wandered the woods, scrounging for food, he was beset with a strange feeling of familiarity. These were the very woods he had been in as a child, also starving, also scrounging. When he came out on the road, he found that he had come back on the kingdom where he had been raised by the dear, stupid, shy maid Drusba.\nHe was in Erolgard.\nIt had fallen even deeper into despair since his youth. The shops that had refused him food were boarded up, abandoned. The only people left were hollow, hopeless figures, so ravaged by taxation, despotism, and barbaric raids that they were too weak to flee. Eslaf realized how lucky he was to have gotten out in his youth.\nThere was, however, a castle and a king. Eslaf immediately made plans to raid the treasury. As usual, he watched the place carefully, taking note of the security and the habits of the guards. This took some time. In the end, he realized there was no security and no guards.\nHe walked in the front door, and down the empty corridors to the treasury. It was full of precisely nothing, except one man. He was Eslaf's age, but looked much older.\n'There's nothing to steal,' he said. 'Would that there was.'\nKing Ynohp, though prematurely aged, had the same white blond hair and blue eyes like broken glass that Eslaf had. In fact, he resembled Suoibud and Laicifitra as well. And though Eslaf had never met the ruined landlord of the Aalto, Laernu, he looked him too. Not surprisingly, since they were quintuplets.\n'So, you have nothing?' asked Eslaf, gently.\n'Nothing except my poor kingdom, curse it,' the King grumbled. 'Before I came to the throne, it was powerful and rich, but I inherited none of that, only the title. For my entire life, I've had responsibility thrust on my shoulders, but never had the means to handle it properly. I look over the desolation which is my birthright, and I hate it. If it were possible to steal a kingdom, I would not lift a finger to stop you.\"\nIt was, it turned out, quite possible to steal a kingdom. Eslaf became known as Ynohp, a deception easily done given their physical similarities. The real Ynohp, taking the name of Ylekilnu, happily left his demesne, becoming eventually a simple worker in the vineyards of The Aalto. For the first time free of responsibility, he fell into his new life with gusto, the years melting off him.\nThe new Ynohp called in his favor with Laicifitra, using her army to restore peace to the kingdom of Erolgard. Now that it was safe, business and commerce began to return to the land, and Eslaf reduced the tyrannical taxes to encourage it to grow. Upon hearing that, Suoibud, ever nervous about losing his money, elected to return to the land of his birth. When he died years later, out of greed, he had refused to name someone an heir, so the kingdom received its entire fortune.\nEslaf used part of the gold to buy the vineyards of The Aalto, after hearing great things of it from Ynohp.\nAnd so it was that Erolgard was returned to its previous prosperity by the fifth born child of King Ytluaf - Eslaf Erol, beggar, thief, warrior (of sorts), and king."}

It spoke in curses of affliction and knew no other words. &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;, and Boethra battled the demon in the ancient songs, but Orkha could only be banished and would not die. Khajiit understand that Orkha and others of his ilk serve as tests along the Path, and nothing more.\n&lt;a href=\"Merrunz\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. The Demon Cat. Also called Merrunz. Born of &lt;a href=\"Fadomai\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;'s Second Litter, he quickly turned destructive and wild. &lt;a href=\"Ahnurr\"&gt;Ahnurr&lt;/a&gt; exiled him, but he chose to explore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Darkness\"&gt;Great Darkness&lt;/a&gt; rather than the Many Paths. There he fell to the demon &lt;a href=\"Molagh\"&gt;Molagh&lt;/a&gt;, who tortured him until the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;the World&lt;/a&gt;. During the chaos, it is written that the wife of Molagh freed Merrunz and used his destructive nature as a weapon against the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Lattice\"&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt;. Merrunz reveled in this and became a kinslayer, and was henceforth the demon we call Dagon. You will face him on the Path.\nMolagh. One of the twelve Demon Kings. Elder Spirit of Domination and Supreme Law. This demon was the first to assault the Lattice with intent, alongside Dagon and &lt;a href=\"Merid-Nunda\"&gt;Merid-Nunda&lt;/a&gt;. Boethra and Molagh fought to a standstill before the Lattice, but it was &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; who shackled the Demon King with secrets only she knows. He will test you, and you will overcome him with the might of Boethra, the Will Against Rule.\nMerid-Nunda. False Spirit of Greed. The Orphaned Glimmer. She is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;, who loved only himself and his own creations. Magrus did not take a mate, but instead forged children of the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;aether&lt;/a&gt;. Merid-Nunda is a cold spirit, born of light without love. She is intellect without wisdom, knowledge without purpose. She is the consort of demons, and some songs blame her for orchestrating the death of mighty Lorkhaj. When Merid-Nunda dared assault the Lattice, Azurah struck her down before the &lt;a href=\"Varliance%20Gate\"&gt;Varliance Gate&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her away from it. She then cast Merid-Nunda into the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and bound her there with mirrors. The nomads say she has since escaped."}

In the span of three short years, the great dwarven cities of Skyrim, from &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, fell before the armies of the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. Cities that had held fast against the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; for over a hundred years crumbled abruptly and without warning.\nFor centuries, scholars have marveled at the sudden collapse of the Dwemer city-states. Even the Nords seem to have been taken by surprise, though their chroniclers were quick to ascribe their success to &lt;a href=\"Gellir\"&gt;King Gellir&lt;/a&gt;'s inspired tactics and the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMy research suggests a much different cause, however. In the decades preceding their fall, the dwarven cities of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; had been decimated by internal disputes and infighting over a most surprising cause: Aetherium.\nModern scholars know &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt; as a rare, luminescent blue crystal found in some &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; ruins. Most consider it little more than a curiosity, as it has proven all but impossible to work with: while it has a strong magical aura, it is alchemically inert, and no known process can enchant, smelt, mold, bind, or break it.\nTo the dwarves, of course, such problems were merely a challenge. In the years following &lt;a href=\"King%20Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, the Dwemer discovered a considerable source of Aetherium in their &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deepest delvings&lt;/a&gt;. An alliance of four cities, led by &lt;a href=\"Arkngthamz\"&gt;Arkngthamz&lt;/a&gt;, the great research center in the southern Reach, was formed to oversee its extraction, processing, and study, and a new 'Aetherium Forge' constructed to smelt it under precisely controlled conditions.\nIf the inscriptions I discovered are to be believed, the results were nothing short of spectacular: the items produced by the Forge were artifacts of immense power, imbued from the moment of their creation with powerful enchantments. The dwarven alliance shattered almost immediately, as the four city-states and their rivals attempted to claim the Forge.\nWe can only speculate that none were successful. Decades of conflict merely weakened them all, allowing for King Gellir's subsequent conquests. And though the Dwemer reclaimed most of their lands a century later, there is no evidence that they ever resumed their research on Aetherium. Perhaps the costs had just been too great.\nBut nothing like the Aetherium Forge described in the inscriptions has ever been found within the borders of Skyrim. It may have been destroyed long ago, by the Nord invaders or the Dwemer themselves. Or perhaps it, like the secrets of Aetherium itself, still remains to be discovered."}

Telvanni accept all races as candidates for membership.\nAnd, since the Telvanni are ruled by wizard-lord nobles, many assume they accept only candidates of the highest &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;willpower&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot true. Telvanni accept candidates of modest intelligence and willpower.\nIt is true that advancement in Telvanni ranks depends on high intelligence and willpower, and that candidates proficient in the arts of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; -- especially &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; - can expect to advance faster and higher in the ranks.\nBut adventurers of all races and abilities who apply to Telvanni &lt;a href=\"Mouth\"&gt;Mouth&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Council%20Hall\"&gt;Telvanni Council Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; for acceptance in House Telvanni can expect a cordial welcome.\nThe truth is that House Telvanni wizard-lords depend on loyal, well-paid, skilled retainers for most services. Though House Telvanni does recruit from their own lower classes, they must go outside their house to hire the craftsmen and specialists they need. And since for political reasons House Telvanni has chosen to reduce its reliance on &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries for protection and security, it has been forced to turn to Western mercenaries for guards and agents.\nPromotion in the ranks of House Telvanni, however, is very difficult for outsiders. Most disconcerting for some potential candidates is House Telvanni's casual acceptance of murder and assassination of rivals as a means to advancement. Those reluctant to prove their worthiness by killing off the competition, and those uncomfortable about competing in such a ruthless atmosphere, might better employ their time and efforts in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Hero was a close and loyal friend of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe Hero was born in 3E 375, making him 30-years-old at the start of . During the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero was imprisoned due to varying reasons (the Hero's history changes during character creation). However, after the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, and Uriel Septim VII was reinstated to the throne, many prisoners, among him the Hero of Daggerfall, were released. This particular prisoner caught the Emperor's attention, no doubt due to the visions the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim line&lt;/a&gt; is known for. According to the book \"\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Warp%20in%20the%20West%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;\"\" in , the Hero is canonically a male.\nIliac mission.\nIn 3E 405, the Emperor presented the Hero with a task: investigate the circumstances of King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Daggerfall's&lt;/a&gt; death. Rumors abounded that Lysandus stalked the streets of his capital city in undeath. The Emperor gave the Hero a second, lower-priority mission: track down the whereabouts of a misplaced letter the Emperor had written to the Queen of Daggerfall, &lt;a href=\"Mynisera\"&gt;Mynisera&lt;/a&gt;, and destroy it. The following day, the Hero embarked from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; for the city of Daggerfall. While entering the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero's ship was hit by a fierce storm and wrecked on the western cliffs of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. After fighting through a series of privateer-infested caverns in the cliff face, the Hero emerged in the southern forests and made the journey to the capital.\nLady Brisienna.\nBefore speaking with Lysandus's widow, Mynisera, the Hero received a letter from a Daggerfall noble, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Brisienna\"&gt;Lady Brisienna&lt;/a&gt;. The letter told the Hero to see Brisienna in a remote &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Region%29\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero altered course and eventually located the noblewoman. Once face-to-face Brisienna admitted that she was actually a high-ranking member of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. She warned the Hero that the situation in the Iliac Bay was far less stable than it appeared: each kingdom and city-state was at each other's throats for control of the twin provinces of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Brisienna also warned the Hero that enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; had discovered her true identity, and that she would soon be returning to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. In closing, she encouraged the Hero to speak directly to the primary powers in the Bay area, but to first work up from the lower nobility to avoid suspicion.\nThe King of Worms.\nAfter the meeting, Brisienna left the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt; and the Hero began to meet with courtiers across the Bay. They asked the Hero to do minor favors in exchange for information regarding Lysandus' passing. Along the way, the Hero met &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Morgiah\"&gt;Lady Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;. Morgiah requested that the Hero speak with the necromancer lord &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; to arrange a wedding between herself and the eminent ruler of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero journeyed to Scourge Barrow, high in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and entered the ancient tomb, eventually locating the King of Worms and striking the deal. Upon returning to Morgiah, the Hero was told that the Emperor's letter to Mynisera had been intercepted by &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Aubk%27i\"&gt;Princess Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall. The letter had then been stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, before being bought by &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;, king of the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath of Lysandus.\nThe Hero then traveled to the court of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;, who asked that the Hero recover a stolen painting of Lysandus that had been sealed within &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Castle Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero managed to infiltrate the castle, and fought to where the magical painting was stashed. The painting's magical canvas was animated, and revealed that Lysandus had not died on the field of &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;, but had been assassinated before the battle even occurred. The assassin was none other than Lysandus's trusted adviser: &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero then journeyed back to Sentinel and returned the painting to Akorithi.\nThe Underking's Ruby.\nAfter discovering the true fate of King Lysandus, the Hero was contacted by an agent of &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt;. The mysterious agent asked the hero to recover a magical gem resembling a &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; from a band of renegade Blades knights. The Hero journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Llugwych\"&gt;Castle Llugwych&lt;/a&gt; in the fiefdom of &lt;a href=\"Ykalon%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting into the castle's dungeon, the Hero found the Ruby being studied by a number of the renegade Blades. After killing the knights and retrieving the Ruby,the Hero returned to the Underking's agent, who disappeared after telling the Hero that Lysandus's remains did not lie in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;, but in a crypt in &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;.\nFreeing Medora.\n&lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Prince Lhotun&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; would send a letter to the Hero shortly afterward, informing him of an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; sorceress named &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Medora Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, who had been Lysandus's lover before his assassination. After the king's murder, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mynisera\"&gt;Queen Mynisera&lt;/a&gt; had sealed the sorceress in a tower on a remote island in the Bay. The Hero traveled to the island, located the tower, and eventually met with the sorceress after slaying the tower's wardens. Direnni informed the Hero that there was a way to speak directly to Lysandus's shade without fear of harm. Before offering to help the Hero to this end, the sorceress asked for the Hero's aide in freeing her from her tower. She could not physically cross the threshold of the tower without a &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Unicorn%20Horn%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;horn&lt;/a&gt;. She then told the Hero of &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus's mother. Nulfaga was a sorceress with powers rivaling Direnni's, and she was in possession of a unicorn horn. She then bid the Hero travel to &lt;a href=\"Shedungent\"&gt;Shedungent&lt;/a&gt;, a castle on the border of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; where the aging Nulfaga resided.\nThe Dust of Restful Death.\nThe Hero met with Nulfaga, who granted the Hero a single unicorn horn. The Hero returned to &lt;a href=\"Medora%20Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; with the horn, and the sorceress was finally freed. After emerging into the open air, the sorceress told the Hero that the only way to pacify &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt;' shade was to cast the Dust of Restful Death upon the dead king's body. The only known sample of the Dust was in the possession of Gortwog gro-Nagorm, King of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. With the knowledge that both the Dust and the letter lay in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; king, the Hero returned to the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Deep in the mountains' highest peaks lay Orsinium, the fortress city of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%23History\"&gt;Western Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Upon entering Gortwog's keep, several of the king's warriors attempted to kill the Hero. After slaying the warriors, the Hero spoke with Gortwog himself. The king said that he would give the Dust to Direnni only out of respect for the benevolent King Lysandus. He also told the Hero to tell Direnni that the price for his cooperation was a \"claim to the heart,\" but failed to explain himself to the Hero. The Hero recovered the Dust from Greensly Hall and returned to Direnni.\nLysandus' revenge.\nAfter retrieving the Dust of Restful Death from &lt;a href=\"King%20Gortwog\"&gt;King Gortwog&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero traveled to Lysandus' crypt in &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt;. After locating the king's sarcophagus and casting the Dust on the bones, the Hero spoke with the shade face-to-face. Lysandus told the Hero that he would continue to haunt the mortal plane until his assassin, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt;, was killed or humiliated. The Hero learned that Woodborne had a large manor in the forests north of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero infiltrated the castle and enacted Lysandus's revenge (depending on player choice, Woodborne is either slain in combat or hanged by Daggerfall officials if the Hero gives the traitor's journal to the rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;). With justice meted out to the traitor, Lysandus and his ghostly army disappeared from &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Emperor's Letter.\nWith Lysandus finally at rest, the Hero began to track down the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;the Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; letter to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Mynisera\"&gt;Queen Mynisera&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually cornering the original courier, the Hero questioned the messenger, who claimed that he had in fact delivered the letter to the Queen of Daggerfall, as asked. But because of the disturbance of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt;, the letter did not reach the court of Daggerfall until after Lysandus's assassination. After the war ended, Queen Mynisera was succeeded by her daughter-in-law, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Aubk-i\"&gt;Princess Aubk-i&lt;/a&gt;. As the new Queen of Daggerfall, the letter had been delivered into Aubk-i's hands. After she had read the letter, the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; had stolen it from Castle Daggerfall, at which point it had been bought by King Gortwog. The Hero then returned to the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; once more. Upon confronting Gortwog, he admitted to having bought the letter knowing its value. He agreed to hand the letter over, but only if the Hero could recover it without being slain by the hostile &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of the fortress. The Hero eventually did, after defeating some of Orsinium's finest warriors. The Hero read the letter, and discovered that it had never been addressed to Mynisera, but to Lady Brisienna. The seal on the envelope was meant to tip off the Spymaster that the letter was for her. The letter warned the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;automaton&lt;/a&gt; of incomprehensible size, had recently been unearthed in the Iliac. The Numidium was powered by an enormous &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, which had been created by &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. The only person who knew the location of the Mantella was &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, mother of the late Lysandus. The only &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundane&lt;/a&gt; artifact that could control the Mantella was small amulet called the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Lysandus had been in possession of the Totem, which had led to his assassination after the discovery of the Numidium. The Hero returned promptly to Daggerfall, presenting Mynisera with the letter. She warned the Hero that Gortwog would have sold copies of the letter to every major power in the Bay, and added that should the Totem be recovered, its only safe guardian was &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;the Emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Totem of Tiber Septim.\nNot even a day passed before the Hero received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Brisienna\"&gt;Lady Brisienna&lt;/a&gt;. The letter told the Hero to meet her in a pub in Daggerfall, adding that &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s fate lay in the balance. The Hero met with the Blade, who had returned from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; with grave news. The &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; had been located. It had been briefly in the hands of Lord Woodborne. The Blades had launched an attack on Woodborne's castle, suffering heavy casualties only to find that the Totem had been moved. Brisienna believed that the Totem was in the possession of &lt;a href=\"King%20Gothryd\"&gt;King Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall. Upon entering Castle Daggerfall, Gothryd ordered his guards to slay the Hero. The Hero then fought down into the Castle treasure vaults, which were protected by magical wards. After killing all guards and dissipating the wards on the vaults, the Hero found the Totem. As soon as the artifact was lifted out of its vault, a voice filled the Hero's thoughts, warning that only a descendant of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; could bear the Totem. Since every major leader in the Bay knew of the Emperor's letter, the Hero began to receive numerous letters and requests formally asking for the Totem. The &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt;, King Gortwog, and the Bay leaders all sent missives to the Hero requesting the Totem. It was at this point that the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; began to occur (depending on player choice, the Totem can be given back to the Emperor, to the King of Worms, to the Underking or to any of the Bay Kings).\nThe Mantellan Crux.\nThe Hero made one last journey, this time to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; border to speak with &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;. Deeming the Hero worthy, Nulfaga told the Hero that the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; did not exist in the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;mortal plane&lt;/a&gt;, but occupied a plane of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt;. Nulfaga explained how to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;, and then transported the Hero to a rock in the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. The only object on the rock was a portal of pure &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero stepped through and was transported to a realm of infinite darkness and architecture defying the laws of nature. Savage &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; sentinels guarded a labyrinth of intensive puzzles and tests. The Hero completed all of these tests, passing through starry voids, buildings of magma, and briefly coming face-to-face with &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, who was watching the Hero's progress from the comfort of an isolated sitting room. Finally the Hero arrived at the heart of the Crux, and found the Mantella. All that needed to be done to free the Mantella was to touch it. When the Hero touched the Mantella, the Crux collapsed and a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; occurred.\nThe Dragon Break.\nAt this point, all of the Hero's possible actions occurred simultaneously, with results so different they caused a Dragon Break that would later come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Miracle of Peace.\nTwelve years after freeing the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, all realities were restored into a single continuity when the Dragon Break was divinely repaired in an act referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Miracle of Peace&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of three days in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, the peoples of the Iliac were blighted by disease, teleporting armies and shifting borders. After the three days, the Iliac region was reshaped into a peaceful land at rest internally and with the Empire.\nFinal fate.\nAfter reactivating the Mantella and unleashing its and Numidium's power on the Iliac Bay, the Hero was teleported back to Shedungent. Nulfaga, with her newly-regained sanity, prepared the Hero on the consequences of their actions in the upcoming chaos.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Blades\"&gt;The Blades&lt;/a&gt; claim they lost contact with the Hero during the event, as they did with most of their other agents at the time. The Hero of Daggerfall was never seen again."}

Fortunately, in most cases, the ingredients are common and cheaply obtained.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Health%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;restore health&lt;/a&gt; to the afflicted and wounded, combine in equal parts two or more of the following cheap and common ingredients: &lt;a href=\"marshmerrow\"&gt;marshmerrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wickwheat\"&gt;wickwheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corkbulb%20root\"&gt;corkbulb root&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"saltrice%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt;. Marshmerrow is an important crop of the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;, but it also grows wild in the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Coast&lt;/a&gt;. Wickwheat is a wild &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashland&lt;/a&gt; grain that grows in the Grazelands. Corkbulb grows best in the Ascadian Isles. Most saltrice comes from southeastern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, but there are also some new and prospering farms and plantations in the Ascadian Isles. Saltrice occasionally grows wild in the Grazelands and on Azura's Coast.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Fatigue%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;restore fatigue&lt;/a&gt; after heavy exertion, combine two or more of the following: &lt;a href=\"Crab%20Meat%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;crab meat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bread%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"small%20kwama%20egg\"&gt;small kwama egg&lt;/a&gt;, and chokeweed. Crabmeat is taken from the &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;mud crab&lt;/a&gt;, commonly found along all coasts. &lt;a href=\"Bread%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bread&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind is usually baked from saltrice flour. Kwama eggs are harvested from &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;egg mines&lt;/a&gt;, and sold everywhere in Morrowind; the smaller eggs retain properties lost in later states of gestation. &lt;a href=\"Chokeweed\"&gt;Chokeweed&lt;/a&gt; is a tough shrub growing in the rocky highlands of the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Common%20Disease\"&gt;cure common diseases&lt;/a&gt;, combine &lt;a href=\"gravedust\"&gt;gravedust&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"green%20lichen\"&gt;green lichen&lt;/a&gt;. Gravedust is spirit-affinitive dust taken from remains buried in consecrated ground. Green lichen is a hardy primitive plant that grows in the Ascadian Isles and Azura's Coast.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;restore magicka&lt;/a&gt; for spellcasting, combine comberry and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;frost salts&lt;/a&gt;. Comberry is a bitter berry, used to make wines. It grows mainly in the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Frost salts, by contrast, are rare and expensive. These crystalline compounds precipitate from elemental frost in solution. Such residues may be collected from the remains of frost astronachs that have been banished from the mortal plane.\nTravelers' Recipes.\nPilgrims and travelers will find the following inexpensive recipes of particular interest.\n&lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt; reduces the weary traveler's burdens and can be gained from heather and scuttle. &lt;a href=\"Heather%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Heather&lt;/a&gt; is a low evergreen shrub of the Ascadian Isles, known for its small, pinkish-purple flowers. &lt;a href=\"Scuttle\"&gt;Scuttle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;'s favorite local dish, is similar to cheese and made from the flesh of local beetles.\n&lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Levitation&lt;/a&gt; can be produced from any two of the following ingredients &lt;a href=\"Trama%20Root%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;trama root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"racer%20plumes\"&gt;racer plumes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"coda%20flower\"&gt;coda flower&lt;/a&gt;s. A thick, bitter-tasting root of the trama shrub grows in the Ashlands, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; regions. Racer plumes are plucked from dead &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;cliff racers&lt;/a&gt;. Coda flowers are collected from the primitive &lt;a href=\"draggle-tail\"&gt;draggle-tail&lt;/a&gt; plant of the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe power of &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; is handy for travelers. A potion may be made from two or more of the following ingredients &lt;a href=\"Luminous%20Russula%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;luminous russula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hackle-lo%20leaf\"&gt;hackle-lo leaf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"kwama%20cuttle\"&gt;kwama cuttle&lt;/a&gt;. Luminous russula is a squat, mottled-brown-and-green toadstool mushroom of the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; region. Hackle-lo leaf is a succulent leaf of the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt;, prized for its taste and its roborative powers. Kwama cuttle is a tough, waxy substance that comes from sacs in the mouths of kwama.\nAdventurers' Recipes.\nUnfortunately, the potions most favored by adventurers require more rare and expensive ingredients. There are exceptions, like the easy and affordable recipe for fire shield. But most such potions require at least one ingredient with high cost in coin or blood.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Shield%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Fire Shield&lt;/a&gt; potions can be made from &lt;a href=\"Comberry%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;comberry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sload%20soap\"&gt;sload soap&lt;/a&gt;. Comberry is the bitter berry of the Ascadian Isles. Sload soap is a waxy substance made from the immature non-sentient forms of the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;. Sload soap is not expensive, but is only rarely stocked by apothecaries or alchemists, and cannot be collected locally.\nAn adventurer can &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Strength%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;fortify his strength&lt;/a&gt; with a potion made from &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Yam%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ash Yams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;dreugh wax&lt;/a&gt;. Ash yam is a tough tuberous root vegetable common to the Ascadian Isles region. Dreugh wax is a tough, waxy substance scraped from dreugh shells. &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt; are powerful aquatic creatures, and hunting them for their hides and wax is a dangerous occupation.\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most prized effects of potions, can be made only from crushed diamonds and &lt;a href=\"Bittergreen%20Petals%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bittergreen petals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bittergreen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bittergreen&lt;/a&gt; is a red flowering plant growing in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; region. &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, are very rare and expensive and usually must be purchased from fine alchemists."}

He who is the very embodiment of infinity.\nI am, quite obviously, a man of deep and unwavering faith. But not blind faith, for I am also a man of scholarly endeavors, and have always valued education and the pursuit of truth, in all its forms. And so, I have had the honor and privilege of making it my life's work to discover the truth about Akatosh, in all of our beloved Divine's incarnations.\nThroughout the civilized world (and I refer not only to the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but to every nation on great Nirn that has embraced the virtues of learning and letters), the Great Dragon is worshipped. Usually, the highest of Divines is referred to as Akatosh. But what some may not be aware of is that he is occasionally referred to by two other names as well.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; refer to Akatosh as &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; call him &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. These names come up repeatedly in certain ancient texts, and in each one, it is clear that the deity in question is none other than he whom we call Akatosh.\nYet there are those who believe, even in this enlightened age, that this is not so. That the regional interpretations of Akatosh are not interpretations of Akatosh at all. Rather, they are references to altogether different deities, deities who may or may not share the same aspects or be the Great Dragon at all.\nMany &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; worship Auri-El, who is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; the Everything. But if you ask the high elves themselves (as I did, when I traveled to Summerset Isle to continue my research), the majority will concede that Auri-El is but Akatosh with a different name, colored by their own cultural beliefs.\nSo maybe it comes as no surprise that the real theological dissention lies in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, among the Nord people - renowned as much for their stubbornness as they are their hardiness and prowess on the fields of valor. When I journeyed to the stark white province, I was surprised to find a people whoe views on Akatosh are almost diametrically opposed to those of the Altmer. The majority of Nord people seem to believe that their Alduin of legend is not Akatosh, but another deity entirely. A great dragon, yes, but not the Great Dragon.\nDetermined to get to the deart of this matter, I consulted with several Nords, chief among them an old and respected clan chief by the name of Bjorn Much-Bloodied. And what surprised me most about those I talked to was not that they believed in Alduin instead of Akatosh, but that they recognized Alduin in addition to Akatosh. In fact, most children of Skyrim seem to view Akatosh in much the same way I do - he is, in fact, the Great Dragon. First among the Divines, preserverance personified and, more than anything, a force of supreme good in the world.\nAlduin, they claim, is something altogether different.\nWhether or not he is actually a deity remains in question, but the Alduin of Nord folklore is in fact a dragon, but one so ancient, and so powerful, he was dubbed the \"World Eater,\" and some accounts even have him devouring the souls of the dead to maintain his own power. Other stories revolve around Alduin acting as some sort of dragon king, uniting the other dragons in a war against mankind, until he was eventually defeated at the hands of one or more brave heroes.\nIt is hard to deny that such legends are compelling. But as both High Priest and scholar, I am forced to ask the most important of questions - where is the evidence?\nThe Nords of Skyrim place a high value on their oral traditions, but such is the core of their unreliability. A rumor passed around the Wayrest market square can change so dramatically in the course of a few simple hours, that by the end of the day, one might believe half the city's residents were involved in any number of scandalous activities. How then is an educated, enlightened person possibly supposed to believe a legend that has been passed down, by word of mouth only, for hundreds, or even thousands of years?\nThe answer to such a question is simple - he cannot.\nAnd so, it is my conclusion that the Alduin of Nord legend is in fact mighty Akatosh, whose story grew twisted and deformed through centuries of retelling and embellishment. Through no real fault of their own, the primitive peoples of Skyrim failed to understand the goodness and greatness of the Great Dragon, and it was this lack of understanding that formed the basis of what became, ironically, their most impressive creative achievement - \"Alduin,\" the World Eater, phantom of bedtime stories and justification for ancient (if imagined) deeds."}

Indeed, of the Grandee Zizzeen it was said by the Poet Behrouz that he was of such rectitude that, when he in error entered the Ladies' Bath-House, he forthwith put out both his eyes, lest he commit an indecency.\nNow when the All-Beneficent King &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; was but a Prince in Antiphyllos, on a day of days he did hunt birds in the Garden of the Grandees with his Ivory Bow, and by happenstance he saw a great Crow alight in a fig tree. And Prince Fahara'jad vowed, \"By Onsi's bright blade, I shall slay me this Crow!\" And he did nock an Ivory Arrow to the Ivory Bow and let fly, and lo, the Crow was taken in the eye and did die of the instant.\nThen dropped from the sky a hideous &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;, with a cursing of curses, and the she-daemon menaced the Young Prince with unclean talons, crying, \"You have slain the child of my bosom, and must die the death therefore! In sooth, I shall pluck out your eyes and partake of them like grapes!\" And screaming a great scream, she clawed at the Prince's orbs of vision.\nThen did a beam of golden light shine down from the heavens, and striding upon it as if upon a bright blade came down the Ever-Glorious &lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt;, crying, \"Hold, Creature of Evil.\" And he smote off the Hagraven's claws, which fell upon the ground like hail, and the she-daemon fell likewise and commenced to grovel unto the god and beg for mercy. And Onsi spake, saying, \"Pleas shall avail you not, shrill virago, for you have threatened the Fateful Prince, whom it is my special care to foster and protect. For this noble stripling is the Fahara'jad whom prophesy foretells shall lead our people in the Years of Peril, and so you must needs die.\" And he struck off her head.\nAnd the Prince, sore amazed, did cover both his eyes, and when he dared to look again, both god and she-daemon were gone. Thus the Prince did misdoubt his own eyes, and hurried to the Holy Temple where he related all that had occurred to the Priest of Onsi. And the Priest deemed his seeing a True Seeing. And this was the first of the Prophesies of Monarchy."}

The high and haughty Ayleids relied on the patrons, the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Lords\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt;, to provide armies of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; with dead spirits; with these fearless magical armies, the Ayleids preyed without mercy upon the young races of men, slaughtering or &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaving&lt;/a&gt; them at their whim.\nOn behalf of the suffering human races, &lt;a href=\"Saint\"&gt;St.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, the first in the line of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;s, sought the aid of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon God of Time, and the ruler of the noble &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;. Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew precious blood from his own heart, and blessed St. Alessia with this blood of Dragons, and made a &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt; that so long as Alessia's generations were true to the dragon blood, Akatosh would endeavor to seal tight the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Gates of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and to deny the armies of Daedra and undead to their enemies, the Daedra-loving Ayleids.\nIn token of this Covenant, Akatosh gave to Alessia and her descendants the Amulet of Kings and the Eternal &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Thus does Alessia become the first gem in the Cyrodilic &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. The gem is the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of the Amulet. This is the Symbol of the Empire and later taken as the symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim line&lt;/a&gt;, It is surrounded by eight other &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gem\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, one for each of the divines.\nSo long as the Empire shall maintain its worship of Akatosh and his kin, and so long as Alessia's heirs shall bear the Amulet of Kings, Akatosh and his divine kin maintain a strong barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion, so that mortal man need never again fear the devastating summoned hosts of the Daedra Lords.\nBut if the Empire should slacken in its dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, or if the blood of Alessia's heirs should fail, then shall the barriers between Tamriel and the Daedra realms fall, and Daedra-worshippers might summon lesser Daedra and undead spirits to trouble the races of men."}

Your next job is to find Eveli. The moment you leave the keep, you will be approached by a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Owayine\"&gt;Owayine&lt;/a&gt;, who has a message from Eveli. He will tell you that Eveli said the letter itself is not really important, but what really matters is the beginning of every thought. \nWhen you read Eveli's letter, it will appear to be gibberish. However, if you take the first word of every sentence, it will read \"We are at the inn hidden room secret words Orcs don't smell.\" This indicates that Eveli is at the Greedy Gut. Head there, then up the stairs and turn left. Speak to the woman named &lt;a href=\"Mulzah\"&gt;Mulzah&lt;/a&gt;; once you tell her that Orcs do not smell, she will direct you to the hidden room in the storage area. Head down the stairs to your south and proceed through the corridor; you will find Eveli, Bazrag and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Solgra\"&gt;High Priestess Solgra&lt;/a&gt; in a heated discussion. \nSpeak with Solgra and she will tell you that Bazrag was attacked at the same time the temple was attacked, so he could not have been behind that. She will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt; are planning something big, and she wants you and Eveli to invade their temple to the west to find out what they are planning. Go and speak with Eveli next; she is up the stairs. She will be upset that Solgra tricked and used her to free Bazrag, but she will agree to work with you on this. \nHead to &lt;a href=\"Paragon%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Paragon's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt; in the far west of Wrothgar. You will meet up with the other scouts just northwest of &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Road%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Siege Road Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with Eveli there and she will tell you that they have not found the temple's entrance and that there is probably no way in without getting attacked. However, she did notice some high-ranking, masked Vosh Rakh wander into an &lt;a href=\"Echatere\"&gt;Echatere&lt;/a&gt; mating ritual to the west, which did not end well for them. She suggests that you go out there and retrieve the uniforms as a disguise. \nYou will find the bodies of the Vosh Rakh to the west; you will have to fight off the pair of echateres to get to them. Take the amulet off of one of the bodies; this will grant you the full disguise. This disguise will allow you to freely enter Paragon's Remembrance, further west. Once inside, take a turn to your right to meet with your companions, who are also in disguises. Speak with Eveli and she will suggest splitting up. She will look around here while you and &lt;a href=\"Talviah%20Aliaria\"&gt;Talviah Aliaria&lt;/a&gt; head into the Chambers of Loyalty. \nHead through the door and proceed ahead. You will come upon someone holding a speech, declaring that those who pass the trials ahead will be able to take part in the Vosh Rakh's greatest mission. You must select a scroll to help you during the trials; you can speak with &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Azulg\"&gt;Elder Azulg&lt;/a&gt; for some more information. Each of the three scrolls contains a story from Orsimer legend; \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Scroll%20of%20Avalian\"&gt;The Scroll of Avalian&lt;/a&gt;\" describes a particularly quick hero, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Scroll%20of%20Vaia\"&gt;The Scroll of Vaia&lt;/a&gt;\" describes one with a strong shield and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Scroll%20of%20Usunok\"&gt;The Scroll of Usunok&lt;/a&gt;\" describes a hero with great strength. Once you have read the scrolls, speak with &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Akarah\"&gt;Elder Akarah&lt;/a&gt; and choose a blessing for the trials ahead. Once you have made your choice, proceed and speak with &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Yozth\"&gt;Elder Yozth&lt;/a&gt; about the first trial. \nFor this trial, you will have to run around the room and activate four switches within a three minute time limit. The room will be tricky to navigate, and other Vosh Rakh will try to kill you as you do so. Once you have succesfully completed this trial, head through the corridor to the east and on to the council chamber. There, your final trial awaits; the Vosh Rakh council will demand that you kill Talviah to prove your devotion. You can either follow through with this, or you can kill the Vosh Rakh here and try to make your escape. If you choose to strike at the Vosh Rakh, . \nIf you attack Talviah, he will put up a fight, so be prepared. After he is dead, a vision of &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt; will appear and congratulate you; speak with her and she will reveal that she is the leader of the Vosh Rakh. The plan is to eliminate the clan chiefs at the moot, and to pin the blame on High Priestess Solgra. Her orders for you are to assist the Vosh Rakh storming the inn to get to Chief Bazrag. \nAfter this, rendezvous with Eveli outside the Chambers of Loyalty. Tell her what you have learned to finish the quest. If you sacrificed Talviah, she will be upset with you."}

They came into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and Time began.\nAs Anu and Padomay wandered the Void, the interplay of Light and Darkness created &lt;a href=\"Nir\"&gt;Nir&lt;/a&gt;. Both Anu and Padomay were amazed and delighted with her appearance, but she loved Anu, and Padomay retreated from them in bitterness.\nNir became pregnant, but before she gave birth, Padomay returned, professing his love for Nir. She told him that she loved only Anu, and Padomay beat her in rage. Anu returned, fought Padomay, and cast him outside Time. Nir gave birth to Creation, but died from her injuries soon after. Anu, grieving, hid himself in the sun and slept.\nMeanwhile, life sprang up on the twelve worlds of creation and flourished. After many ages, Padomay was able to return to Time. He saw Creation and hated it. He swung his sword, shattering the twelve worlds in their alignment. Anu awoke, and fought Padomay again. The long and furious battle ended with Anu the victor. He cast aside the body of his brother, who he believed was dead, and attempted to save Creation by forming the remnants of the 12 worlds into one -- &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, the world of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. As he was doing so, Padomay struck him through the chest with one last blow. Anu grappled with his brother and pulled them both outside of Time forever.\nThe blood of Padomay became the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. The blood of Anu became the stars. The mingled blood of both became the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; (hence their capacity for good and evil, and their greater affinity for earthly affairs than the Daedra, who have no connection to Creation).\nOn the world of Nirn, all was chaos. The only survivors of the twelve worlds of Creation were the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;. The Ehlnofey are the ancestors of Mer and Men. The Hist are the trees of &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. Nirn originally was all land, with interspersed seas, but no oceans.\nA large fragment of the Ehlnofey world landed on Nirn relatively intact, and the Ehlnofey living there were the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;. These Ehlnofey fortified their borders from the chaos outside, hid their pocket of calm, and attempted to live on as before. Other Ehlnofey arrived on Nirn scattered amid the confused jumble of the shattered worlds, wandering and finding each other over the years. Eventually, the wandering Ehlnofey found the hidden land of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, and were amazed and joyful to find their kin living amid the splendor of ages past. The wandering Ehlnofey expected to be welcomed into the peaceful realm, but the Old Ehlnofey looked on them as degenerates, fallen from their former glory. For whatever reason, war broke out, and raged across the whole of Nirn. The Old Ehlnofey retained their ancient power and knowledge, but the Wanderers were more numerous, and toughened by their long struggle to survive on Nirn. This war reshaped the face of Nirn, sinking much of the land beneath new oceans, and leaving the lands as we know them (&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;).

A small corner of it survived to become &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel, but most of their realm was sunk beneath the sea.\nEventually, Men returned to Tamriel. The Nords were the first, colonizing the northern coast of Tamriel before recorded history, led by the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;. The thirteenth of his line, &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt;, was the first to appear in written history. And so the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt; ended."}

In old times, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; worshipped the Daedra as gods. But they did not deserve this veneration, for the Daedra harm their worshippers as often as help them.\nThe Advent of the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names) changed this unhappy state. By the Apotheosis, the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names) became the Protectors and High Ancestor Spirits of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and bade the Daedra to give proper veneration and obedience. The Three Good Daedra, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, recognized the Divinity of the Triune Ancestors (Blessed Be Their Holy Names). The &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;Rebel Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, refused to swear fealty to the Tribunal (Blessed Be Their Holy Names), and their worshippers were cast out.\nThese Rebel Daedra thus became the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, and they continue to plague our tranquility and tempt the unwary into Heresy and Dark Worship. The Priests of the Temple remain ever vigilant for signs of the Adversaries' return, sometimes aided by the loyal Three Good Daedra, who are familiar with the wiles of their rebellious kin.\nThe Good Daedra are known to the Temple as the Anticipations, since they are the early ancestral anticipations of the loving patronage of the Tribunal. The Anticipations are the Daedra Lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; is the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; but male to her female. Boethiah was the ancestor who illuminated the elves ages ago before the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt;. He told them the truth of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan's&lt;/a&gt; test, and defeated &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;'s champion, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. Boethiah ate Trinimac and voided him. The followers of Boethiah and Trinimac rubbed the soil of Trinimac upon themselves and changed their skins.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; is the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, but manifold and androgynous. Mephala taught the Chimer to evade their enemies or kill them with secret murder. The &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; were few in those days and threatened on all sides. Mephala taught the Chimer to build Houses. Later, Mephala created the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; is the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, but female to his male. Azura was the ancestor who taught the Chimer how to be different from the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. Her teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often encountered more as a communal progenitor of the race as a whole rather than as an individual ancestor. She is associated with Dusk and Dawn, and is sometimes called the Mother Soul. &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;, also called the Twilight Star, appears briefly at dawn and dusk low on the horizon below the constellation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt;. Azura is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy."}

They came into the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and Time began.\nAs Anu and Padomay wandered the Void, the interplay of Light and Darkness created &lt;a href=\"Nir\"&gt;Nir&lt;/a&gt;. Both Anu and Padomay were amazed and delighted with her appearance, but she loved Anu, and Padomay retreated from them in bitterness.\nNir became pregnant, but before she gave birth, Padomay returned, professing his love for Nir. She told him that she loved only Anu, and Padomay beat her in rage. Anu returned, fought Padomay, and cast him outside Time. Nir gave birth to Creation, but died from her injuries soon after. Anu, grieving, hid himself in the sun and slept.\nMeanwhile, life sprang up on the twelve worlds of creation and flourished. After many ages, Padomay was able to return to Time. He saw Creation and hated it. He swung his sword, shattering the twelve worlds in their alignment. Anu awoke, and fought Padomay again. The long and furious battle ended with Anu the victor. He cast aside the body of his brother, who he believed was dead, and attempted to save Creation by forming the remnants of the 12 worlds into one -- &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, the world of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. As he was doing so, Padomay struck him through the chest with one last blow. Anu grappled with his brother and pulled them both outside of Time forever.\nThe blood of Padomay became the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. The blood of Anu became the stars. The mingled blood of both became the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; (hence their capacity for good and evil, and their greater affinity for earthly affairs than the Daedra, who have no connection to Creation).\nOn the world of Nirn, all was chaos. The only survivors of the twelve worlds of Creation were the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;. The Ehlnofey are the ancestors of Mer and Men. The Hist are the trees of &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. Nirn originally was all land, with interspersed seas, but no oceans.\nA large fragment of the Ehlnofey world landed on Nirn relatively intact, and the Ehlnofey living there were the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;. These Ehlnofey fortified their borders from the chaos outside, hid their pocket of calm, and attempted to live on as before. Other Ehlnofey arrived on Nirn scattered amid the confused jumble of the shattered worlds, wandering and finding each other over the years. Eventually, the wandering Ehlnofey found the hidden land of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, and were amazed and joyful to find their kin living amid the splendor of ages past. The wandering Ehlnofey expected to be welcomed into the peaceful realm, but the Old Ehlnofey looked on them as degenerates, fallen from their former glory. For whatever reason, war broke out, and raged across the whole of Nirn. The Old Ehlnofey retained their ancient power and knowledge, but the Wanderers were more numerous, and toughened by their long struggle to survive on Nirn. This war reshaped the face of Nirn, sinking much of the land beneath new oceans, and leaving the lands as we know them (&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;).

Stories carried from province to province, all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in awe of my feats of magical prowess. More than once, I am sure, you have thought \"if only I had &lt;a href=\"Aramril\"&gt;Aramril&lt;/a&gt;'s ability. Then I too could seek fame and fortune in magic duels!\"\nIt is true, of course. Great fame and limitless fortune await those who are successful. But to be successful, one needs to learn from the best. That is why you have purchased this book, so that I may teach you. I am, of course, the best.\nHere, then, is my advice. Follow it, and you too can make a name for yourself throughout Tamriel.\n1. To know your opponent is to know his weakness.\nInfinitely more versatile than a simple blade of steel, a good mage has a wide array of spells at her disposal. More than that, she knows when to best use them. She knows that frost spells can stop a charging beast, or keep a savage brute from swinging his sword. She knows that shock spells can drain her opponent's magicka. She knows that illusion spells can set a group of enemies against each other (should she find herself in a less than fair fight, an all-too-common reality when her opponents know they cannot win in single combat) and that there are spells that can save her in a moment when all seems lost.\n2. To know yourself is to know your limits.\nEven the best mage has a finite reserve of &lt;a href=\"magicka\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;; none born yet have been graced with &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;' infinite reserves of power. And so a good mage does not over-extend herself. She makes sure she always has enough magicka to keep herself safe. Failing that, she makes sure she has a sizable supply of potions at the ready. Failing that, she makes sure she always has an escape route. Not that the Great Aramril has ever fled a fight, but of course you do not necessarily share her superb natural ability. That is why you must practice.\n3. Wards can kill (you)\nThere is no question that wards are an essential tool of any aspiring mage. They can block incoming spells, negating your opponent's attack and wasting his magicka. A good mage knows, however, to not rely too heavily on her ward. Keeping a ward readied for too long will leave a caster drained of magicka, unable to retaliate, and at worst unable to maintain the ward and therefore completely defenseless.\n4. Two hands are not always better than one\nAny advanced spellcaster has learned to &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;cast spells with both hands&lt;/a&gt;, dealing more damage. There are certainly times when this is to your advantage, such as when an opponent is already weakened, or when it is likely to draw a bigger reaction from the crowd that has no doubt gathered to watch you. It is not always the best strategy, however. Concentration spells, for example, can often be used on the ground when an opponent is especially nimble. In that instance, using both hands independently can cover more ground at the same time. A mage throwing fireballs with both hands cannot immediately raise a ward to defend herself, or heal while she continues to attack.\n5. Always rise to a challenge, especially when you know you can win\nRemember that your first priority is, of course, to stay alive. Following closely behind, though, is your need to please the crowd. You are, after all, depending on their generosity to fund your adventures. Here, then, more than magic comes into play. If you can gain a sense of your opponent's ability before the duel begins, you can enter into the event with confidence. Knowing that you outclass your opponent is of great importance, as it means you can confidently give the crowd a better show. Likewise, knowing ahead of time that you could very well lose a duel, you are afforded an opportunity to suddenly find yourself engaged elsewhere, and be unable to attend the event. (By no means do I suggest that I have ever done such a thing; I simply find that my great fame occasionally means I am unable to respond to every single request for a duel)\nKeep these few things in mind, keep your wits about you, and you too can make a name for yourself by putting on great displays of magical prowess. Take care, though - for if you become successful enough, you may find yourself facing a challenge from me!"}

These halls are infested with &lt;a href=\"Arbordawn%20Cult\"&gt;Arbordawn Cult&lt;/a&gt;ists that seek to bring back the walking city, so she will ask you to go in there and get Telenger out.\nTo even get in, you need to destroy the corruption stones placed by the cultists. These can be found in the south of the area, near the skyshard. You will also find a man named &lt;a href=\"Ongalion\"&gt;Ongalion&lt;/a&gt; here, who will give you the quest &lt;a href=\"Gentle%20Gardener\"&gt;Gentle Gardener&lt;/a&gt;; that quest takes place in the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously. Once you have destroyed the stones, an apparition of Telenger will appear to you and invite you to come inside.\nHead into the Halls of Ichor and start looking for Telenger. In the southeastern corner of the first room, you will find &lt;a href=\"Fascinating%20Relics\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; saying that Telenger is deeper into the caves. Head into the western passageway and through to the room with the water and the bridge. South of the bridge, you will find Telenger; speak with him and he will tell you that there are Daedra deeper in the tunnels, and that they are a far greater threat than the Arbordawn Cult. He will ask you to come with him into the northern tunnels; head back to the main room and head north.\nYou will find Telenger again in the first room, overlooking the entrance to a Daedric temple. The entrance is sealed, but Telenger can break the spell. While he is doing so though, &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt; will attack; fend them off until Teleger is done. Once he is done, head into the Daedric temple. You will find two regular Spider Daedra inside, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Queen\"&gt;Spider Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Kill all three, then follow Telenger through the door behind the Queen into the Inner Temple. Here, &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; herself will appear to you, in the form of a Spider Daedra. Speak with her and she will reveal that she had a part in causing the Arbordawn Cult's actions, but she will not provide any answers as to what happened to the Walking City. Speak with Telenger again and he will seal the temple and prevent its influence from further corrupting the Falinesti Faithful here.\nYou will be teleported outside. Speak with Telenger again here to finish the quest."}

The library was rescued from destruction in the east, and became the cornerstone of academic life at the College.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Hitting%20the%20Books\"&gt;Hitting the Books&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeaking with Urag gro-Shub about any documents that might explain the connection between Saarthal and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, he confesses that the needed documents were recently stolen by an apprentice by the name of Orthorn, who took the books and ran off to &lt;a href=\"Fellglow%20Keep\"&gt;Fellglow Keep&lt;/a&gt; to join up with a group of mages who left the College. Urag asks the Dragonborn to retrieve\u00a0three such stolen books, \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20King%20of%20the%20Ayleids\"&gt;The Last King of the Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"\".\n&lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Insights%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Shalidor's Insights&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Urag Gro-Shub is asked to help locating any rare books, he will then ask for an assistance with locating \"&lt;a href=\"Shalidor%27s%20Insights%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Shalidor's Insights&lt;/a&gt;\", rare manuscripts scattered across Skyrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Knowledge\"&gt;Elder Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn needs to recover an Elder Scroll to travel back in time to &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat atop the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, so Urag gro-Shub is able to provide the Dragonborn with two texts on the Scrolls, \"&lt;a href=\"Effects%20of%20the%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Effects of the Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ruminations%20on%20the%20Elder%20Scrolls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\", one of which is &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt;ed by &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt;.

Note that opening the box to take the rings is counted as &lt;a href=\"stealing\"&gt;stealing&lt;/a&gt;, so one needs to avoid Urag gro-Shub's detection.

Despite Lord Vivec's Blessings, accidents continue to pile up. I have had stern words with the &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Shiralas\"&gt;Overseer&lt;/a&gt;, but she seems honestly mystified. Will send some &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Armiger&lt;/a&gt;s to investigate.\nFortieth Day of Construction\nThe Armigers can uncover no reason for the continuing delays.

I think it's time I investigate on my own.\nForty-third Day of Construction\nStanding on the construction Canton, I felt the Blessings of Lord Vivec wash over me. I marvel at the feeling of his love and protection. It is no wonder the workers strive so hard at their jobs.\nBut then, almost like a cloud passing between &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;the sun&lt;/a&gt;, it was gone. I could tell the workers and the guards felt it, too, though they certainly took it more as a sense of unease. Just as I was about to say something, I heard a crash. I looked over, and one of the lift-ropes had broken, causing two tons of stone to fall and shatter. It is a wonder no one was killed.\nAs I ran to help the injured, I swear by Vivec's mighty presence I saw a large dog scamper away. I think my suspicions are confirmed. But whether to go after the dog or report to Vivec immediately\u2014that is the choice I must make. Perhaps after a good night's sleep I will have a clearer idea of how to proceed."}

A strong gale picks up, and blows his ashes back to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nWulfharth adopts and is adopted by the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; then. Ysmir the Grey Wind, the Storm of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;. But through &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; he lost his national identity. All he wants the Nords for is to kill the Tribunal. He raises a storm, sends in his people, and is driven back by &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; forces. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; are too strong now. Wulfharth goes underground to wait and strengthen and reform his body anew. Oddly enough, it is &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; who disturbs his rest, summoning the Underking to fight alongside the Tribunal against &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, the Akaviri demon. Wulfharth disappears after &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom&lt;/a&gt; is defeated, and does not return for three hundred years.\nIt is the rumbling of the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; that wake him. Though the Empire has crumbled, there are rumors that a chosen one will come to restore it. This new Emperor will defeat the Elves and rule a united Tamriel. Naturally, Wulfharth thinks he is the figure of prophecy. He goes directly to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; to hear the Greybeards speak. When they do, Ysmir is blasted to ash again. He is not the chosen one. It is a warrior youth from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. As the Grey Wind goes to find this boy, he hears the Greybeards' warning: remember the color of betrayal, King Wulfharth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; was at war. &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; in West Cyrodiil, was in a bad situation. To make any bid at unifying the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, he needed to secure his northern border, where the Nords and &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; had been fighting for centuries. He allies with Skyrim at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;. Leading his forces was &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;. Hjalti was from the island kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, in High Rock, and would become &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the First Emperor of Tamriel.\nHjalti was a shrewd tactician, and his small band of Colovian troops and Nord berserkers broke the Reachman line, forcing them back beyond the gates of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;. A siege seemed impossible, as Hjalti could expect no reinforcements from Falkreath. That night a storm came and visited Hjalti's camp. It spoke with him in his tent. At dawn, &lt;a href=\"Hjalti\"&gt;Hjalti&lt;/a&gt; went up to the gates, and the storm followed just above his head. Arrows could not penetrate the winds around him. He shouted down the walls of Old Hrol'dan, and his men poured in. After their victory, the Nords called Hjalti &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, or Stormcrown.\nCuhlecain, with his new invincible general, unifies West &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; in under a year. No one can stand before Hjalti's storms. The Underking knows that if Hjalti is to become Emperor of Tamriel, he must first capture the Eastern &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;. Hjalti uses them both. He needs Cuhlecain in the Colovian Estates, where foreigners are mistrusted. It is obvious why he needs &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;. They march on the East, the battlemages surrender before their armies, and they take the Citadel. Before Cuhlecain can be crowned, Hjalti secretly murders him and his loyalist contingent. These assassinations are blamed on the enemies of Cuhlecain, which, for political reasons, are still the Western Reach. &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, the Grand Battlemage (not the Underking), then crowns Hjalti as Tiber Septim, new Emperor of All Cyrodiil. After he captures the Imperial Throne, Septim finds the initial administration of a fully united Cyrodiil a time-consuming task. He sends the Underking to deal with Imperial expansion into Skyrim and High Rock. Ysmir, mindful that it might seem as if Tiber Septim is in two places at once, works behind the scenes. This period of levelheaded statesmanship and diplomacy, this sudden silence, heretofore unknown in the roaring tales of Talosian conquest, are explained away later. (The assassination story is embroidered\u2014now it is popularly Talos' own throat that was cut.)\nThe human kingdoms are conquered, even &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, whose capture was figured to be an arduous task. The Underking wants a complete invasion, a chance to battle their foreign wind spirits himself, but Tiber Septim refutes him. He has already made a better plan, one that will seem to legitimize his rule. &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; supports the losing side of a civil war and are invited in. Finally, the Empire can turn its eyes onto the Elves.\nThe Underking continues to press on Tiber Septim the need to conquer &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor is not sure that it is a wise idea. He has heard of the Tribunal's power. The Underking wants his vengeance, and reminds Tiber Septim that he is fated to conquer the Elves, even the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. Arctus advises against the move but Septim covets the Ebony in Morrowind, as he sorely needs a source of capital to rebuild Cyrodiil after &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;400 years of war&lt;/a&gt;. The Underking tells him that, with the Tribunal dead, Septim might steal the Tribunal's power and use it against the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; (certainly the oldest enemies of Lorkhan, predating even the Tribunal). &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; is the farthest thing from Tiber Septim's mind. Even then, he was planning to send Zurin Arctus to the King of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; to make peace. The Ebony need wins out in the end. The Empire invades Morrowind, and the Tribunal give up. When certain conditions of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt; include not only a policy of noninterference with the Tribunal, but also, in the Underking's eyes, a validation of their religious beliefs, Ysmir is furious. He abandons the Empire completely. This was the betrayal the Greybeards spoke of. Or so he thinks.\nWithout the Underking's power, all ideas of conquering Tamriel vanish. Would've been nice, Septim thinks, but let's just worry about Cyrodiil and the human nations. Already there is a rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nPieces of &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; trickle in, though. Tiber Septim, always fascinated by the Dwarves, has Zurin Arctus research this grand artifact. In doing so, Arctus stumbles upon some of the stories of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;war at Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. He discovers the reason the Numidium was made and some of its potential. Most importantly, he learns the Underking's place in the War. But Zurin Arctus was working from incomplete plans. He thinks it is the heart of Lorkhan's body that is needed to power the Numidium.\nWhile Zurin Arctus is raving about his discovery, the prophecy finally becomes clear to Tiber Septim. This Numidium is what he needs to conquer the world. It is his destiny to have it. He contacts the Underking and says he was right all along. They should kill the Tribunal, and they need to get together and make a plan. While the Underking was away he realized the true danger of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt;. Something must to be done. But he needs an army, and his old one is available again. The trap is set.\nThe Underking arrives and is ambushed by Imperial guards. As he takes them on, Zurin Arctus uses a soulgem on him. With his last breath, the Underking's Heart roars a hole through the Battlemage's chest. In the end, everyone is dead, the Underking has reverted to ash, and Tiber Septim strolls in to take the soulgem. When the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; arrives, he tells them about the second attempt on his life, this time by his trusted battle mage, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, who was attempting a coup. He has the dead guards celebrated as heroes, even the one who was blasted to ash... He warns Cyrodiil about the dangers within, but says he has a solution to the dangers without. The &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Numidium, while not the god Tiber Septim and the Dwemer hoped for (the Underking was not exactly Lorkhan, after all), it does the job. After its work on Summerset Isle a new threat appears\u2014a rotting undead wizard who controls the skies. He blows the Numidium apart. But it pounds him into the ground with its last flailings, leaving only a black splotch. The Mantella falls into the sea, seemingly forever.\nMeanwhile, Tiber Septim crowns himself the First Emperor of Tamriel. He lives until he is 108, the richest man in history. All aspects of his early reign are rewritten. Still, there are conflicting reports of what really happened, and this is why there is such confusion over such questions as: Why does Alcaire claim to be the birthplace of Talos, while other sources say he came from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;? Why does Tiber Septim seem to be a different person after his first roaring conquests? Why does Tiber Septim betray his &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;? Is the Mantella the heart of the battlemage or is it the heart of Tiber Septim?\nTiber Septim is succeeded by his grandson, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Pelagius is just not of the same caliber. In truth, he's a little nervous with all these provinces. Then an advisor shows up.\n\u201cI was friends with your grandfather,\u201d the Underking says, \u201cHe sent me to help you run the Empire.\""}

It was an unimaginative, austere building not noted so much for its aesthetic or architectural design as for its prodigious length. If any critics wondered why such an unornamented, extended erection held such fascination for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vanech\"&gt;Lord Vanech&lt;/a&gt;, they kept it to themselves.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"3E%20398\"&gt;398th year&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"3rd%20Era\"&gt;3rd Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt; was a senior clerk at the Commission.\nIt had been a few months since the shy, middle-aged man had brought Lord Vanech the most lucrative of all contracts, granting the Commission the exclusive right to rebuild the roads of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; which had been destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;. For this, he had become the darling of the managers and the clerks, spending his days recounting his adventures, more or less faithfully... although he did omit the ending of the tale, since many of them had partaken in the celebratory Unthrappa roast provided by the Silenstri. Informing one's listeners that they've gorged on &lt;a href=\"Human%20Flesh%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;human flesh&lt;/a&gt; improves very few stories of any good taste.\nScotti was neither particularly ambitious nor hard-working, so he did not mind that Lord Vanech had not given him anything to actually do.\nWhenever the squat little gnomish man would happen upon Decumus Scotti in the offices, Lord Vanech would always say, \"You're a credit to the Commission. Keep up the good work.\"\nIn the beginning, Scotti had worried that he was supposed to be doing something, but as the months went on, he merely replied, \"Thank you. I will.\"\nThere was, on the other hand, the future to consider. He was not a young man, and though he was receiving a respectable salary for someone not doing actual work, Scotti considered that soon he might have to retire and not get paid for not doing work. It would be nice, he decided, if Lord Vanech, out of gratitude for the millions of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; the Valenwood contract was generating, might deign to make Scotti a partner. Or at least give him a small percentage of the bounty.\nDecumus Scotti was no good at asking for things like that, which was one of the reasons why, previous to his signal successes in Valenwood as a senior clerk for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Atrius\"&gt;Lord Atrius&lt;/a&gt;, he was a lousy agent. He had just about made up his mind to say something to Lord Vanech, when his lordship unexpectedly pushed things along.\n\"You're a credit to the Commission,\" the waddling little thing said, and then paused. \"Do you have a moment free on your schedule?\"\nScotti nodded eagerly, and followed his lordship to his hideously decorated and very enviable hectare of office space.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; blesses us for your presence at the Commission,\" the little fellow squeaked grandly. \"I don't know whether you know this, but we were having a bad time before you came along. We had impressive projects, for certain, but they were not successful. In &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, for example, for years we've been trying to improve the roads and other routes of travel for commerce. I put my best man, &lt;a href=\"Flesus%20Tijjo\"&gt;Flesus Tijjo&lt;/a&gt;, on it, but every year, despite staggering investments of time and money, the trade along those routes only gets slower and slower. Now, we have your very clean, very, very profitable Valenwood contract to boost the Commission's profits. I think it's time you were rewarded.\"\nScotti grinned a grin of great modesty and subtle avarice.\n\"I want you to take over the Black Marsh account from Flesus Tijjo.\"\nScotti shook as if awaking from a pleasant dream to hideous reality, \"My Lord, I - I couldn't -\"\n\"Nonsense,\" chirped Lord Vanech. \"Don't worry about Tijjo. He will be happy to retire on the money I give him, particularly as soul-wrenchingly difficult as this Black Marsh business has been. Just your sort of a challenge, my dear Decumus.\"\nScotti couldn't utter a sound, though his mouth feebly formed the word \"No\" as Lord Vanech brought out the box of documentation on Black Marsh.\n\"You're a fast reader,\" Lord Vanech guessed. \"You can read it all en route.\"\n\"En route to ...\"\n\"Black Marsh, of course,\" the tiny fellow giggled. \"You are a funny chap. Where else would you go to learn about the work that's being done, and how to improve it?\"\nThe next morning, the stack of documentation hardly touched, Decumus Scotti began the journey south-east to Black Marsh. Lord Vanech had hired an able-bodied guard, a rather taciturn &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Mailic\"&gt;Mailic&lt;/a&gt;, to protect his best agent. They rode south along the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt;, and then south-east along the &lt;a href=\"Silverfish%20River\"&gt;Silverfish&lt;/a&gt;, continuing on into the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where the river tributaries had no names and the very vegetation seemed to come from another world than the nice, civilized gardens of the northern Imperial Province.\nScotti's &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; was tied to Mailic's, so the clerk was able to read. It made it difficult to pay attention to the path they were taking, but Scotti knew he needed at least a cursory familiarity with the Commission's business dealings in Black Marsh.\nIt was a huge box of paperwork going back forty years, when the Commission had first been given several million in gold by a wealthy trader, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Xellicles%20Pinos-Revina\"&gt;Lord Xellicles Pinos-Revina&lt;/a&gt;, to improve the condition of the road from &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt; to Cyrodiil. At that time, it took three weeks, a preposterously long time, for the rice and root he was importing to arrive, half-rotten, in the Imperial Province. Pinos-Revina was long dead, but many other investors over the decades, including &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Pelagius Septim V&lt;/a&gt; himself, had hired the Commission to build roads, drain swamps, construct bridges, devise anti-smuggling systems, hire mercenaries, and, in short, do everything that the greatest &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; in history knew would work to aid trade with Black Marsh. According to the latest figures, the result of this was that it took two and a half months for goods, now thoroughly rotten, to arrive.\nScotti found that when he looked up after concentrating on what he was reading, the landscape had always changed. Always dramatically. Always for the worse.\n\"This is &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;, sir,\" said Mailic to Scotti's unspoken question. It was dark and woodsy, so Decumus Scotti thought that a very appropriate name.\nThe question he longed to ask, which in due course he did ask, was, \"What's that terrible smell?\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Slough%20Point\"&gt;Slough Point&lt;/a&gt;, sir,\" Mailic replied as they turned the next bend, where the umbrageous tunnel of tangled tree and vine opened to a clearing. There squatted a cluster of formal buildings in the dreary Imperial design favored by Lord Vanech's Commission and every &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber&lt;/a&gt;, together with a stench so eye-blindingly, stomach-wrenchingly awful that Scotti wondered, suddenly, if it were deadly poisonous. The swarms of blood-colored, sand-grain-sized insects obscuring the air did not improve the view.\nScotti and Mailic batted at the buzzing clouds as they rode their horses towards the largest of the buildings, which on approach revealed itself to be perched at the edge of a thick, black river. From its size and serious aspect, Scotti guessed it to be the census and excise office for the wide, white bridge that stretched across the burbling dark water to the reeds on the other side. It was a very nice, bright, sturdy-looking bridge, built, Scotti knew, by his Commission.\nA poxy, irritable official opened the door quickly on Scotti's first knock. \"Come in, come in, quickly! Don't let the &lt;a href=\"fleshflies\"&gt;fleshflies&lt;/a&gt; in!\"\n\"Fleshflies?\" Decumus Scotti trembled. \"You mean, they eat human flesh?\"\n\"If you're fool enough to stand around and let them,\" the soldier said, rolling his eyes. He had half an ear, and Scotti, looking around at the other soldiers in the fort noted that they all were well-chewed. One of them had no nose at all to speak of. \"Now, what's your business?\"\nScotti told them, and added that if they stood outside the fortress instead of inside, they might catch more smugglers.\n\"You better be more concerned with getting across that bridge,\" the soldier sneered. \"Tide's coming up, and if you don't get a move on, you won't get to Black Marsh for four days.\"\nThat was absurd. A bridge swamped by a rising tide on a river? Only the look in the soldier's eyes told Scotti he wasn't joking.\nUpon stepping out of the fort, he saw that the horses, evidently tired of being tortured by the fleshflies, had ripped free of their restraints and were bounding off into the woods. The oily water of the river was already lapping on the planks, oozing between the crevices. Scotti reflected that perhaps he would be more than willing to endure a wait of four days before going to Black Marsh, but Mailic was already running across.\nScotti followed him, wheezing. He was not in excellent shape, and never had been. The box of Commission materials was heavy. Halfway across, he paused to catch his breath, and then discovered he could not move. His feet were stuck.\nThe black mud that ran through the river was a thick gluey paste, and having washed over the plank Scotti was on, it held his feet fast. Panic seized him. Scotti looked up from his trap and saw Mailic leaping from plank to plank ahead of him, closing fast on the reeds on the other side.\n\"Help!\" Scotti cried. \"I'm stuck!\"\nMailic did not even turn around, but kept jumping. \"I know, sir. You need to lose weight.\"\nDecumus Scotti knew he was a few pounds over, and had meant to start eating less and exercising more, but embarking on a diet hardly seemed to promise timely aid in his current predicament. No diet on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; would have helped him just then. However, on reflection, Scotti realized that the Redguard intended that he drop the box of documents, for Mailic was no longer carrying any of the essential supplies he had had with him previously.\nWith a sigh, Scotti threw the box of Commission notes into the glop, and felt the plank under him rise a quarter of an inch, just enough to free him from the mud's clutches. With an &lt;a href=\"agility\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt; born of extreme fear, Scotti began leaping after Mailic, dropping onto every third plank, and springing up before the river gripped him.\nIn forty-six leaps, Decumus Scotti crashed through the reeds onto the solid ground behind Mailic, and found himself in Black Marsh. He could hear behind him a slurping sound as the bridge, and his container of important and official records of Commission affairs, was consumed by the rising flood of dark filth, never to be seen again."}

Looking back towards &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, he saw the bridge disappear beneath the thick black river, and he knew he was not getting back until the tide went down in a few days' time. The river also held in its adhesive depths his files on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; account. He would have to rely on his memory for his contacts in &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mailic\"&gt;Mailic&lt;/a&gt; was purposefully striding through the reeds ahead. Flailing ineffectually at the fleshflies, Scotti hurried after him.\n\"We're &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lucky&lt;/a&gt;, sir,\" said the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, which struck Scotti as an extraordinarily odd thing to say, until his eyes followed where the man's finger was pointing. \"The caravan is here.\"\nTwenty-one rusted, mud-spattered wagons with rotting wood and wobbly wheels sat half-sunk in the soft earth ahead. A crowd of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, gray-scaled and gray-eyed, the sort of sullen manual laborers that were common in Cyrodiil, pulled at one of the wagons which had been detached from the others. As Scotti and Mailic came closer, they saw it was filled with a cargo of &lt;a href=\"Blackberry\"&gt;black berries&lt;/a&gt; so decayed that they had become hardly recognizable... more a festering jelly than a wagonload of fruit.\nYes, they were going to the city of Gideon, and, yes, they said, Scotti could get a ride with them after they were finished unloading this shipment of lumberries.\n\"How long ago were they picked?\" Scotti asked, looking at the wagon's rotten produce.\n\"The harvest was in &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt;, of course,\" said the Argonian who seemed to be in charge of the wagon. It was now &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, so they had been en route from the fields for a little over two months.\nClearly, Scotti thought, there were problems with transportation. But fixing that, after all, was what he was doing here as a representative of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vanech%27s%20Building%20Commission\"&gt;Lord Vanech's Building Commission&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt took close to an hour of the berries rotting even more in the sun for the wagon to be pushed to the side, the wagons in front of it and behind it to be attached to one another, and one of the eight &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s from the front of the caravan to be brought around to the now independent wagon. The laborers moved with dispirited lethargy, and Scotti took the opportunity to inspect the rest of the caravan and talk to his fellow travelers.\nFour of the wagons had benches in them, fit for uncomfortable riders. All the rest were filled with grain, meat, and vegetation in various stages of corruption.\nThe travelers consisted of the six Argonian laborers, three &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mercantile\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; so bug-bitten that their skin looked as scaly as the Argonians themselves, and three cloaked fellows who were evidently &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, judging by the red eyes that gleamed in the shadows under their hoods. All were transporting their goods along this, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Commerce%20Road\"&gt;Imperial Commerce Road&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"This is a road?\" Scotti exclaimed, looking at the endless field of reeds that reached up to his chin or higher.\n\"It's solid ground, of a sort,\" one of the hooded Dunmer shrugged. \"The horses eat some of the reed, and sometimes we set fire to it, but it just grows right back up.\"\nFinally, the wagonmaster signaled that the caravan was ready to go, and Scotti took a seat in the third wagon with the other Imperials. He looked around, but Mailic was not on board.\n\"I agreed to get to you to Black Marsh and take you back out,\" said the Redguard, who had plumped down a rock in the sea of reeds and was munching on a hairy &lt;a href=\"carrot\"&gt;carrot&lt;/a&gt;. \"I'll be here when you get back.\"\nScotti frowned, and not only because Mailic had dropped the deferential title \"sir\" while addressing him. Now he truly knew no one in Black Marsh, but the caravan slowly grinded and bumped forward, so there was no time to argue.\nA noxious wind blew across the Commerce Road, casting patterns in the endless featureless expanse of reeds. In the distance, there seemed to be mountains, but they constantly shifted, and Scotti realized they were banks of mist and fog. Shadows flitted across the landscape, and when Scotti looked up, he saw they were being cast by giant birds with long, saw-like beaks nearly the size of the rest of their bodies.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hackwing\"&gt;Hackwing&lt;/a&gt;s,\" &lt;a href=\"Chaero%20Gemullus\"&gt;Chaero Gemullus&lt;/a&gt;, an Imperial on Scotti's left, who might have been young but looked old and beaten, muttered. \"Like everything else in this damnable place, they'll eat you if you don't keep moving. Beggars pounce down and give you a nasty chop, and then fly off and come back when you're mostly dead from blood loss.\"\nScotti shivered. He hoped they'd be in Gideon before nightfall. It was then it occurred to him that the sun was on the wrong side of the caravan.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" Scotti called to the wagonmaster. \"I thought you said we were going to Gideon?\"\n\"The wagonmaster nodded.\"\n\"Why are we going north then, when we should be going south?\"\nThere was no reply but a sigh.\nScotti confirmed with his fellow travelers that they too were going to Gideon, and none of them seemed very concerned about the circuitous route to getting there. The seats were hard on his middle-aged back and buttocks, but the bumping rhythm of the caravan, and the hypnotic waving reeds gradually had an effect on him, and Scotti drifted off to sleep.\nHe awoke in the dark some hours later, not sure where he was. The caravan was no longer moving, and he was on the floor, under the bench, next to some small boxes. There were voices, speaking a hissing, clicking language Scotti didn't understand, and he peeked out between someone's legs to see what was happening.\nThe moons barely pierced the thick mist surrounding the caravan, and Scotti did not have the best angle to see who was talking. For a moment, it looked like the gray wagonmaster was talking to himself, but the darkness had movement and moisture, in fact, glistening scales. It was hard to tell how many of these things there were, but they were big, black, and the more Scotti looked at them, the more details he could see.\nWhen one particular detail emerged, huge mouths filled with dripping needle-like fangs, Scotti slipped back under the bench. Their black little eyes had not fallen on him yet.\nThe legs in front of Scotti moved and then began to thrash, as their owner was grabbed and pulled out of the wagon. Scotti crouched further back, getting behind the little boxes. He didn't know much about concealment, but had some experience with shields. He knew that having something, anything, in between you and bad things was always good.\nA few seconds after the legs had disappeared from sight, there was a horrible scream. And then a second and a third. Different timbres, different accents, but the same inarticulate message... terror, and pain, horrible pain. Scotti remembered a long forgotten prayer to the god &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; and whispered it to himself.\nThen there was silence... ghastly silence that lasted only a few minutes, but which seemed like hours... years.\nAnd then the carriage started rolling forward again.\nScotti cautiously crawled out from under the carriage. Chaero Gemullus gave him a bemused grin.\n\"There you are,\" he said. \"I thought the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;s took you.\"\n\"Nagas?\"\n\"Nasty characters,\" Gemullus said, frowning. \"Puff adders with legs and arms, seven feet tall, eight when they're mad. Come from the inner swamp, and they don't like it here much so they're particularly peevish. You're the kind of posh Imperial they're looking for.\"\nScotti had never in his life thought of himself as posh. His mud and fleshfly-bespeckled clothing seemed eminently middle-class, at best, to him. \"What would they want me for?\"\n\"To rob, of course,\" the Imperial smiled. \"And to kill. You didn't notice what happened to the others?\" The Imperial frowned, as if struck by a thought. \"You didn't sample from those boxes down below, did you? Like the sugar, do you?\"\n\"Gods, no,\" Scotti grimaced.\nThe Imperial nodded, relieved. \"You just seem a little slow. First time to Black Marsh, I gather? Oh! Heigh ho, &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; piss!\"\nScotti was just about to ask Gemullus what that vulgar term meant when the rain began. It was an inferno of foul-smelling, yellow-brown rain that washed over the caravan, accompanied by the growl of thunder in the distance. Gemullus worked to pull the roof up over the wagon, glaring at Scotti until he helped with the laborious process.\nHe shuddered, not only from the cold damp, but from contemplation of the disgusting precipitation pouring down on the already nasty produce in the uncovered wagon.\n\"We'll be dry soon enough,\" Gemullus smiled, pointing out into the fog.\nScotti had never been to Gideon, but he knew what to expect. A large settlement more or less laid out like a &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, with more or less Imperial style architecture, and all the Imperial comforts and traditions, more or less.\nThe jumble of huts half-sunk in mud was decidedly less.\n\"Where are we?\" asked Scotti, bewildered.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hixinoag\"&gt;Hixinoag&lt;/a&gt;,\" replied Gemullus, pronouncing the queer name with confidence. \"You were right. We were going north when we should have been going south.\""}

Instead, he was in a half-submerged, rotten little village called &lt;a href=\"Hixinoag\"&gt;Hixinoag&lt;/a&gt;, where he knew no one.

Most villages in &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt; don't stay put for very long, and there's a good chance Hixinoag will drift right down to the gates of Gideon. Might take you a month or two. Probably the easiest way.\"\n\"That'd put me far behind schedule.\"\n\"Next option, you could join up with the caravan again,\" said Gemullus. \"They might be going in the right direction this time, and they might not get stuck in the mud, and they might not be all murdered by &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; highwaymen.\"\n\"Not tempting,\" Scotti frowned. \"Any other ideas?\"\n\"Ride the roots. The underground express,\" Gemullus grinned. \"Follow me.\"\nScotti followed Gemullus out of the village and into a copse of trees shrouded by veils of wispy moss. The smuggler kept his eye on the ground, poking at the viscuous mud intermittently. Finally he found a spot which triggered a mass of big oily bubbles to rise to the surface.\n\"Perfect,\" he said. \"Now, the important thing is not to panic. The express will take you due south, that's the wintertide migration, and you'll know you're near Gideon when you see a lot of red clay. Just don't panic, and when you see a mass of bubbles, that's a breathing hole you can use to get out.\"\nScotti looked at Gemullus blankly. The man was talking perfect gibberish. \"What?\"\nGemullus took Scotti by the shoulder and positioning him on top of the mass of bubbles. \"You stand right here \u2026\"\nScotti sank quickly into the mud, staring at the smuggler, horror-struck.\n\"And remember to wait 'til you see the red clay, and then the next time you see bubbles, push up \u2026\"\nThe more Scotti wriggled to get free, the faster he sunk. The mud enveloped Scotti to his neck, and he continued staring, unable to articulate anything but a noise like \"Oog.\"\n\"And don't panic at the idea that you're being digested. You could live in a &lt;a href=\"Rootworm\"&gt;rootworm's&lt;/a&gt; belly for months.\"\nScotti took one last panicked gasp of air and closed his eyes before he disappeared into the mud.\nThe clerk felt a warmth he hadn't expected all around him. When he opened his eyes, he found that he was entirely surrounded by a translucent goo, and was traveling rapidly forward, southward, gliding through the mud as if it were air, skipping along an intricate network of roots. Scotti felt confusion and euphoria in equal measures, madly rushing forward through an alien environment of darkness, spinning around and over the thick fibrous tentacles of the trees. It was if he were high in the sky at midnight, not deep beneath the swamp in the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Express\"&gt;Underground Express&lt;/a&gt;.\nLooking up slightly at the massive root structure above, Scotti saw something wriggle past. A eight-foot-long, armless, legless, colorless, boneless, eyeless, nearly shapeless creature, riding the roots. Something dark was inside of it, and as it came closer, Scotti could see it was an Argonian man. He waved, and the disgusting creature the Argonian was in flattened slightly and rushed onward.\nGemullus's words began to reappear in Scotti's mind at this sight. \"The wintertide migration,\" \"air hole,\" \"you're being digested,\"\u2014these were the phrases that danced around as if trying to find some place to live in a brain which was highly resistant to them coming in. But there was no other way to look at the situation. Scotti had gone from eating living fish to being eaten alive as a way of transport. He was in one of those worms.\nScotti made an executive decision to faint.\nHe awoke in stages, having a beautiful dream of being held in a woman's warm embrace. Smiling and opening his eyes, the reality of where he really was rushed over him.\nThe creature was still rushing madly, blindly forward, gliding over roots, but it was no longer like a flight through the night sky. Now it was like the sky at sunrise, in pinks and reds. Scotti remembered Gemullus telling him to look for the red clay, and he would be near Gideon. The next thing he had to find was the bubbles.\nThere were no bubbles anywhere. Though the inside of the worm was still warm and comfortable, Scotti felt the weight of the earth all around him. \"Just don't panic\" Gemullus had said, but it was one thing to hear that advice, and quite another to take it. He began to squirm, and the creature began to move faster at the increased pressure from within.\nSuddenly, Scotti saw it ahead of him, a slim spire of bubbles rising up through the mud from some underground stream, straight up, through the roots to the surface above him. The moment the rootworm went through it, Scotti pushed with all of his might upward, bursting through the creature's thin skin. The bubbles pushed Scotti up quickly, and before he could blink, he was popping out of the red slushy mud.\nTwo gray Argonians were standing under a tree nearby, holding a net. They looked in Scotti's direction with polite curiosity. In their net, Scotti noticed, were several squirming furry rat-like creatures. While he addressed them, another fell out of the tree. Though Scotti had not been educated in this practice, he recognized fishing when he saw it.\n\"Excuse me, lads,\" Scotti said jovially. \"I was wondering if you'd point me in the direction of Gideon?\"\nThe Argonians introduced themselves as &lt;a href=\"Drawing-Flame\"&gt;Drawing-Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Furl-Of-Fresh-Leaves\"&gt;Furl-Of-Fresh-Leaves&lt;/a&gt;, and looked at one another, puzzling over the question.\n\"Who you seek?\" asked Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves.\n\"I believe his name is,\" said Scotti, trying to remember the contents of his long gone file of Black Marsh contacts in Gideon. \"&lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Right-Foot-Rock\"&gt;Right-Foot \u2026 Rock?&lt;/a&gt;\"\nDrawing-Flame nodded, \"For five gold, show you way. Just east. Is plantation east of Gideon. Very nice.\"\nScotti thought that the best business he had heard of in two days, and handed Drawing-Flames the five septims.\nThe Argonians led Scotti onto a muddy ribbon of road that passed through the reeds, and soon revealed the bright blue expanse of &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt; far to the west. Scotti looked around at the magnificent walled estates, where bright crimson blossoms sprang forth from the very dirt of the walls, and surprised himself by thinking, \"This is very pretty.\"\nThe road ran parallel to a fast-moving stream, running eastward from Topal Bay. It was called the &lt;a href=\"Onkobra%20River\"&gt;Onkobra River&lt;/a&gt;, he was told. It ran deep into Black Marsh, to the very dark heart of the province.\nPeeking past the gates to the plantations east of Gideon, Scotti saw that few of the fields were tended. Most had rotten crops from harvests past still clinging to wilted vines, orchards of desolate, leafless trees. The Argonian serfs who worked the fields were thin, weak, near death, more like haunting spirits than creatures of life and reason.\nTwo hours later, as the three continued their trudge east, the estates were still impressive at least from a distance, the road was still solid if weedy, but Scotti was irritated, horrified by the field workers and the agricultural state, and no longer charitable towards the area. \"How much further?\"\nFurl-of-Fresh-Leaves and Drawing-Flame looked at one another, as if that question was something that hadn't occurred to them.\n\"Archein is east?\" Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves pondered. \"Near or far?\"\nDrawing-Flame shrugged noncommittally, and said to Scotti, \"For five gold, show you way. Just east. Is plantation. Very nice.\"\n\"You don't have any idea, do you?\" Scotti cried. \"Why couldn't you tell me that in the first place when I might have asked someone else?\"\nAround the bend up ahead, there was the sound of hoofbeats. A horse coming closer.\nScotti began to walk towards the sound to hail the rider, and didn't see Drawing-Flame's taloned claws flash out and cast the &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; at him. He felt it though. A kiss of ice along his spine, the muscles along his arms and legs suddenly immobile as if wrapped in rigid steel. He was paralyzed.\nThe great curse of &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt;, as the reader may be unfortunate enough to know, is that you continue to see and think even though your body does not respond. The thought that went through Scotti's mind was, \"Damn.\"\nFor Drawing-Flame and Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves were, of course, like most simple day laborers in Black Marsh, accomplished &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;ists. And no friend of the Imperial.\nThe Argonians shoved Decumus Scotti to the side of the road, just as the horse and rider came around the corner. He was an impressive figure, a nobleman in a flashing dark green cloak exactly the same color as his scaled skin, and a frilled hood that was part of his flesh and sat upon his head like a horned crown.\n\"Greetings, brothers!\" the rider said to the two.\n\"Greetings, Archein Right-Foot-Rock,\" they responded, and then Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves added. \"What is milord's business on this fine day?\"\n\"No rest, no rest,\" the Archein sighed regally. \"One of my she-workers gave birth to twins. Twins! Fortunately, there's a good trader in town for those, and she didn't put up too much of a fuss. And then there's a fool of an Imperial from Lord Vanech's Building Commission I am supposed to meet with in Gideon. I'm sure he'll want the grand tour before he opens up the treasury for me. Such a lot of fuss.\"\nDrawing-Flame and Furl-of-Fresh-Leaves sympathesized, and then, as Archein Right-Foot-Rock rode off, they went to look for their hostage.\nUnfortunately for them, gravity being the same in Black Marsh as elsewhere in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, their hostage, Decumus Scotti, had continued to roll down from where they left him, and was, at that moment, in the Onkobra River, drowning."}

He couldn't move his arms or his legs to swim because of the &lt;a href=\"paralysis\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spell\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; peasant had lobbed at him, but he wasn't quite sinking. The &lt;a href=\"Onkobra%20River\"&gt;Onkobra River&lt;/a&gt; was a crashing force of white water and currents that could carry along large rocks with ease, so Scotti tumbled head over heels, spinning, bumping, bouncing along.\nHe figured that soon enough he would be dead, and that would be better than being in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. He wasn't too panicked about it all when he felt his lungs fill with water and cold blackness fell upon him.\nFor a while, for the first time in some time, Decumus Scotti felt peace. Blessed darkness. And then pain came to him, and he felt himself coughing, spewing water up from his belly and his lungs.\nA voice said, \"Oh bother, he's alive, ain't he, now?\"\nScotti wasn't quite sure if that were true, even when he opened his eyes and looked at the face above him. It was an Argonian, but unlike any he had seen anywhere. The face was thin and long like a thick lance; the scales were ruby-red, brilliant in the sunlight. It blinked at him, its eyelids opening and closing in vertical slits.\n\"I don't suppose we should eat you, should we now?\" the creature smiled, and Scotti could tell from its teeth that it was no idle suggestion.\n\"Thank you,\" said Scotti weakly. He craned his head slightly to find out who the \"we\" were, and discovered he was on the muddy bank of the still, sludgy river, surrounded by a group of Argonians with similarly needle-like faces and a whole rainbow of scales. Bright greens and gem-like purples, blues, and oranges.\n\"Can you tell me, am I near - well, anywhere?\"\nThe ruby-colored Argonian laughed. \"No. You're in the middle of everywhere, and near nowhere.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Scotti, who grasped the idea that space did not mean much in Black Marsh. \"And what are you?\"\n\"We are &lt;a href=\"Agaceph\"&gt;Agaceph&lt;/a&gt;s,\" the ruby-colored Argonian replied. \"My name is &lt;a href=\"Nomu\"&gt;Nomu&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti introduced himself. \"I'm a senior clerk in &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vanech%27s%20Building%20Commission\"&gt;Lord Vanech's Building Commission&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. My job was to come here to try to fix the problems with commerce, but I've lost my agenda, haven't met with any of my contacts, the &lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;...\"\n\"Pompous, assimiliated, slaver kleptocrats,\" a small lemon-colored Agaceph murmured with some feeling.\n\"...And now I just want to go home.\"\nNomu smiled, his long mouth arching up like a host happy to see an unwanted guest leave a party. \"&lt;a href=\"Shehs\"&gt;Shehs&lt;/a&gt; will guide you.\"\nShehs, it seemed, was the bitter little yellow creature, and he was not at all pleased at the assignment. With surprising strength, he hoisted Scotti up, and for a moment, the clerk was reminded of &lt;a href=\"Chaero%20Gemullus\"&gt;Gemullus&lt;/a&gt; dropping him into the bubbling muck that led to the &lt;a href=\"Underground%20Express\"&gt;Underground Express&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, Shehs shoved Scotti toward a tiny little raft, razor-thin, that bobbed on the surface of the water.\n\"This is how you travel?\"\n\"We don't have the broken wagons and dying &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s of our brothers on the outside,\" Shehs replied, rolling his tiny eyes. \"We don't know better.\"\nThe Argonian sat at the back of the craft and used his whip-like tail to propel and navigate the craft. They traveled quickly around swirling pools of slime that stank of centuries of putrefaction, past pinnacled mountains that seemed sturdy but suddenly fell apart at the slightest ripple in the still water, under bridges that might have once been metal but were now purely rust.\n\"Everything in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; flows down to Black Marsh,\" Shehs said.\nAs they slid through the water, Shehs explained to Scotti that the Agacephs were one of the many Argonian tribes that lived in the interior of the province, near the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, finding little in the outside world worth seeing. He was fortunate to have been found by them. The &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;s, the toad-like &lt;a href=\"Paatru\"&gt;Paatru&lt;/a&gt;, and the winged &lt;a href=\"Sarpa\"&gt;Sarpa&lt;/a&gt; would have killed him on the spot.\nThere were other creatures too to be avoided. Though there were few natural predators in inner Black Marsh, the scavengers that rooted in the garbage seldom shied away from a living meal. &lt;a href=\"Hackwing\"&gt;Hackwing&lt;/a&gt;s circled overhead, like the ones Scotti had seen in the west.\nShehs fell silent and stopped the raft completely, waiting for something.\nScotti looked in the direction Shehs was watching, and saw nothing unusual in the filthy water. Then, he realized that the pool of green slime in front of them was actually moving, and fairly quickly, from one bank to the other. It deposited small bones behind it as it oozed up into the reeds, and disappeared.\n\"Voriplasm,\" Shehs explained, moving the boat forward again. \"Big word. It'll strip you to the bone by the second syllable.\"\nScotti, desirous to distract himself from the sights and smells that surrounded him, thought it a good time to compliment his pilot on his excellent vocabulary. It was particularly impressive, given how far from civilization they were. The Argonians in the east did, in fact, speak so well.\n\"They tried to erect a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Mara%20%28Umpholo%29\"&gt;Temple of Mara&lt;/a&gt; near here, in &lt;a href=\"Umpholo\"&gt;Umpholo&lt;/a&gt;, twenty years ago,\" Shehs explained, and Scotti nodded, remembering reading about it in the files before they were lost. \"They all perished quite dreadfully of &lt;a href=\"swamp%20rot\"&gt;swamp rot&lt;/a&gt; in the first month, but they left behind some excellent &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\nScotti was going to inquire further when he saw something so huge, so horrifying, it made him stop, frozen.\nHalf submerged in the water ahead was a mountain of spines, lying on nine-foot-long claws. White eyes stared blindly forward, and then suddenly the whole creature spasmed and lurched, the jaw of its mouth jutting out, exposing tusks clotted with gore.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Swamp%20Leviathan\"&gt;Swamp Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;,\" Shehs whistled, impressed. \"Very, very dangerous.\"\nScotti gasped, wondering why the Agaceph was so calm, and more, why he was continuing to steer the raft forward towards the beast..\n\"Of all the creatures in the world, the rats are sometimes the worst,\" said Shehs, and Scotti noticed that the huge creature was only a husk. Its movement was from the hundreds of rats that had burrowed into it, rapidly eating their way from the inside out, bursting from the skin in spots.\n\"They are indeed,\" Scotti said, and his mind went to the Black Marsh files, buried deep in the mud, and four decades of &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; work in Black Marsh.\nThe two continued westward through the heart of Black Marsh.\nShehs showed Scotti the vast complicated ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; capitals, fields of ferns and flowered grasses, quiet streams under canopies of blue moss, and the most astonishing sight of Scotti's life\u2014the great forest of full-grown Hist trees. They never saw a living soul until they arrived at the edge of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Commerce%20Road\"&gt;Imperial Commerce Road&lt;/a&gt; just east of &lt;a href=\"Slough%20Point\"&gt;Slough Point&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Mailic\"&gt;Mailic&lt;/a&gt;, Scotti's &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; guide, was waiting patiently.\n\"I was going to give you two more minutes,\" the Redguard scowled, dropping the last of his food onto the pile at his feet. \"No more, sir.\"\nThe sun was shining bright when Decumus Scotti rode into the Imperial City, and as it caught the morning dew, it lent a glisten to every building as if they had been newly polished for his arrival. It astonished him how clean the city was. And how few &lt;a href=\"beggar\"&gt;beggar&lt;/a&gt;s there were.\nThe protracted edifice of Lord Vanech's Building Commission was the same as it had always been, but still the very sight of it seemed exotic and strange. It was not covered in mud. The people within actually, generally, worked.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vanech\"&gt;Lord Vanech&lt;/a&gt; himself, though singularly squat and squinty, seemed immaculate, not only relatively clean of dirt and scabs, but also relatively uncorrupt. Scotti couldn't help but stare at him when he first caught sight of his boss. Vanech stared right back.\n\"You are a sight,\" the little fellow frowned. \"Did your horse drag you to Black Marsh and back? I would say go home and fix yourself, but there are a dozen people here to see you. I hope you have solutions for them.\"\nIt was no exaggeration. Nearly twenty of Cyrodiil's most powerful and wealthiest people were waiting for him. Scotti was given an office even larger than Lord Vanech's, and he met with each.\nFirst among the Commission's clients were five independent traders, blustering and loaded with gold, demanding to know what Scotti intended to do about improving the trade routes. Scotti summarized for them the conditions of the main roads, the state of the merchants' caravans, the sunken bridges, and all the other impediments between the frontier and the marketplace. They told him to have everything replaced and repaired, and gave him the gold necessary to do it.\nWithin three months, the bridge at Slough Point had disappeared into the muck; the great caravan had collapsed into decrepitude; and the main road from Gideon had been utterly swallowed up by swamp water. The Argonians began once again to use the old ways, their personal rafts and sometimes the Underground Express to transport the grain in small quantities. It took a third of the time, two weeks, to arrive in Cyrodiil, none of it rotten.\nThe Archbishop of Mara was the next client Scotti met with. A kindhearted man, horrified by the tales of Argonian mothers selling their children into slavery, he pointedly asked Scotti if it were true.\n\"Sadly, yes,\" Scotti replied, and the Archbishop showered him with septims, telling the clerk that food must be brought to the province to ease their suffering, and the schools must be improved so they could learn to help themselves.\nWithin five months, the last book had been stolen from the deserted Maran monastery in Umphollo. As the Archeins went bankrupt, their slaves returned to his parents' tiny farms. The backwater Argonians found that they could grow enough to feed their families provided they had enough hard workers in their enclave, and the buyers market for slaves sharply declined.\nAmbassador &lt;a href=\"Tsleeixth\"&gt;Tsleeixth&lt;/a&gt;, concerned about the rising crime in northern Black Marsh, brought with him the contributions of many other expatriate Argonians like himself. They wanted more Imperial guards on the border at Slough Point, more magically lit lanterns posted along the main roads at regular intervals, more patrol stations, and more schools built to allow young Argonians to better themselves and not turn to crime.\nWithin six months, there were no more Nagas roaming the roads, as there were no merchants traveling them to rob. The thugs returned to the fetid inner swamp, where they felt much happier, their constitutions enriched by the rot and pestilence that they loved. Tsleeixth and his constituency were so pleased by the crime rate dropping, they brought even more gold to Decumus Scotti, telling him to keep up the good work.\nBlack Marsh simply was, is, and always shall be unable to sustain a large-scale, cash-crop plantation economy. The Argonians, and anyone else, the whole of Tamriel, could live in Black Marsh on subsistence farming, just raising what they needed. That was not sad, Scotti thought; that was hopeful.\nScotti's solution to each of their dilemmas had been the same. Ten percent of the gold they gave him went to Lord Vanech's Building Commission. The rest Scotti kept for himself, and did exactly nothing about the requests.\nWithin a year, Decumus Scotti had embezzled enough to retire very comfortably, and Black Marsh was better off than it had been in forty years."}

Unless the acting is superb, the subject matter can come off flat and uninspired. Also, a play takes away from the verbal dexterity exhibited by a bard such as the legendary &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tale-Singer\"&gt;Tale-Singer&lt;/a&gt;. The feline bard described the various ploys used by the man to bring the maiden to her knees in a way that made one's pulse race and breath quicken, wondering what would come next.Indeed, much of the \"Argonian Maid\" borrows heavily from Tale-Singer's songs (uncredited, but naturally I recognized them immediately), in which the maiden helps the male with a spear, a loaf of bread, and a spilt flask of coconut milk.Fortunately, the players in the current production of \"The Lusty Argonian Maid\" are excellent, bringing this age-old tale to new heights. The reference to the Spear of the Hunter would bring laughter to the most sullen. And the wheel of cheese \u2026 well, I've never seen this variant before, but it was truly inspired!\nI foresee this play will outlive its humble beginnings as a fireside amusement to become a choice bit of frivolous entertainment for ."}

Written by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mymophonus\"&gt;Mymophonus&lt;/a&gt;, it details how the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; forces at &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; due to changes in the combat doctrine, as &lt;a href=\"Sirollus%20Saccus\"&gt;Sirollus Saccus&lt;/a&gt; shows that not even his finest armor can hope to defeat an Argonian soldier in such climates. He then left to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and since then has happily continued his trade there.\nContents.\nThree hundred years ago, when &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt; became Empress, the first and only &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; to rule all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, she faced opposition from the Imperial Council. Even after she convinced them that she would be the best regent to rule the Empire while her husband &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt; sought treatment for his madness, there was still conflict. In particular from the Duke of Vengheto, Thane Minglumire, who took a particular delight in exposing all of the Empress's lack of practical knowledge.\nIn this particular instance, Katariah and the Council were discussing the unrest in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and the massacre of Imperial troops outside the village of &lt;a href=\"Armanias\"&gt;Armanias&lt;/a&gt;. The sodden swampland and the sweltering climate, particular in summertide, would endanger the troops if they wore their usual armor.\n\"I know a very clever &lt;a href=\"armorer\"&gt;armorer&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Katariah, \"His name is &lt;a href=\"Hazadir\"&gt;Hazadir&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; who knows the environments our army will be facing. I knew him in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; where he was a slave to the master armorer there, before he moved to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; as a freedman. We should have him design armor and weaponry for the campaign.\"\nMinglumire gave a short, barking laugh: \"She wants a slave to design the armor and weaponry for our troops! &lt;a href=\"Sirollus%20Saccus\"&gt;Sirollus Saccus&lt;/a&gt; is the finest armorer in the Imperial City. Everyone knows that.\"\nAfter much debate, it was finally decided to have both armorers contend for the commission. The Council also elected two champions of equal power and prowess, Nandor Beraid and Raphalas Eul, to battle using the arms and armaments of the real competitors in the struggle. Whichever champion won, the armorer who supplied him would earn the Imperial commission. It was decided that Beraid would be outfitted by Hazadir, and Eul by Saccus.\nThe fight was scheduled to commence in seven days.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Sirollus%20Saccus\"&gt;Sirollus Saccus&lt;/a&gt; began work immediately. He would have preferred more time, but he recognized the nature of the test. The situation in Armanias was urgent. The Empire had to select their armorer quickly, and once selected, the preferred armorer had to act swiftly and produce the finest armor and weaponry for the Imperial army in Black Marsh. It wasn't just the best armorer they were looking for. It was the most efficient.\nSaccus had only begun steaming the half-inch strips of black virgin oak to bend into bands for the flanges of the armor joints when there was a knock at his door. His assistant Phandius ushered in the visitor. It was a tall reptilian of common markings, a dull, green-fringed hood, bright black eyes, and a dull brown cloak. It was &lt;a href=\"Hazadir\"&gt;Hazadir&lt;/a&gt;, Katariah's preferred armorer.\n\"I wanted to wish you the best of luck on the -- is that &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nIt was indeed. Saccus had bought the finest quality ebony weave available in the Imperial City as soon as he heard of the competition and had begun the process of smelting it. Normally it was a six month procedure refining the ore, but he hoped that a massive convection oven stoked by white flames born of magicka would shorten the operation to three days. Saccus proudly pointed out the other advancements in his armory. The acidic lime pools to sharpen the blade of the dai-katana to an unimaginable degree of sharpness. The &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; forge and tongs he would use to fold the ebony back and forth upon itself. Hazadir laughed.\n\"Have you been to my armory? It's two tiny smoke-filled rooms. The front is a shop. The back is filled with broken armor, some hammers, and a forge. That's it. That's your competition for the millions of gold pieces in Imperial commission.\"\n\"I'm sure the Empress has some reason to trust you to outfit her troops,\" said Sirollus Saccus, kindly. He had, after all, seen the shop and knew that what Hazadir said was true. It was a pathetic workshop in the slums, fit only for the lowliest of adventurers to get their iron daggers and cuirasses repaired. Saccus had decided to make the best quality regardless of the inferiority of his rival. It was his way and how he became the best armorer in the Imperial City.\nOut of kindness, and more than a bit of pride, Saccus showed Hazadir how, by contrast, things should be done in a real professional armory. The Argonian acted as an apprentice to Saccus, helping him refine the ebony ore, and to pound it and fold it when it cooled. Over the next several days, they worked together to create a beautiful dai-katana with an edge honed to a keen sharp enough to trim a mosquito's eyebrows, enchanted with flames along its length by one of the Imperial Battlemages, as well as suit of armor of bound wood, leather, silver, and ebony to resist the winds of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the day of the battle, Saccus, Hazadir, and Phandius finished polishing the armor and brought in Raphalas Eul for the fitting. Hazadir left only then, realizing that Nandor Beraid would be at his shop shortly to be outfitted.\nThe two warriors met before the Empress and Imperial Council in the arena, which had been flooded slightly to simulate the swampy conditions of Black Marsh. From the moment Saccus saw Eul in his suit of heavy ebony and blazing dai-katana and Beraid in his collection of dusty, rusted lizard-scales and spear from Hazadir's shop, he knew who would win. And he was right.\nThe first blow from the dai-katana lodged in Beraid's soft shield, as there was no metal trim to deflect it. Before Eul could pull his sword back, Beraid let go of the now-flaming shield, still stuck on the sword, and poked at the joints of Eul's ebony armor with his spear. Eul finally retrieved his sword from the ruined shield and slashed at Beraid but his light armor was scaled and angled, and the attacks rolled off into the water, extinguishing the dai-katana's flames. When Beraid struck at Eul's feet, he fell into the churned mud and was unable to move. The Empress, out of mercy, called a victor.\nHazadir received the commission and thanks to his knowledge of Argonian battle tactics and weaponry and how best to combat them, he designed implements of war that brought down the insurrection in Armanias. Katariah won the respect of Council, and even, grudgingly, that of Thane Minglumire. Sirollus Saccus went to Morrowind to learn what Hazadir learned there, and was never heard from again."}

Whether you intend to bake a pie, forge a sword, or craft and enchantment, the methodology is the same.\nIngredients.\nIn any tradecraft, you combine two or more ingredients to create a single superior product. This is not like the time you tried to smash two &lt;a href=\"pony%20guar\"&gt;pony guar&lt;/a&gt; together to make a larger &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Pack Guar&lt;/a&gt;. You must combine the correct ingredients and use the correct tools: a hammer and anvil, mortar and pestle, or cauldron and fire, depending on the craft. Only then can you succeed.\nMost crafted items require at least two ingredients. For example, a sword needs smelted iron for the blade and tanned leather for the hilt. Potions require dried flowers and pure water. Enchantments need gems and setting materials.\nYou must gather the raw ingredients from the wilderness or, knowing your approach to everything you do, find them in an unattended crate.\nNext, the raw ingredients must be refined. Smelt the ore into ingots, spin the raw cotton into cloth, and cut and polish the gems. Then, at your workbench, you can create something your father might actually be proud of.\nAdditives.\nWith basic ingredients you can craft basic items. You can create improved items by increasing the quantity and quality of ingredients. As you discovered last year, a ten-pound sledge is more effective in smashing your mother's urns than a one-pound hammer -- though, as you learned, the ten-pound sledge is also more difficult to control.\nTo solve this problem, tradecrafters infuse their ingredients with additives. Resins and oils make wood more supple and strong. A dash of Imp Stool makes a health potion more effective. (Wipe that smirk from you face. You know I was talking about the mushroom, young man.)\nAdditives also interact with each other to imbue a crafter item with magical properties. It requires three different additives for a magical effect to take hold. What combinations of additives produce what effects we shall save for another lesson.\nThe Art of Crafting: Research and Learning.\nBardus,\nYou are, no doubt, celebrating my sudden turn to ill health. I don't believe that you purposefully poisoned me with that sweet roll you made, only because I don't believe you have the skill to make anything on purpose.\nNever-the-less this brush with death has brought one element of your education to the fore. An element that I have avoided to broach because, to be frank, my lack of success in teaching you has provided me a well paying job, courtesy of your parents.\nI speak of how to improve yourself in your chosen skill.\nIn the end it is the responsibility of each crafter to train themselves. Most craftmasters just allow their apprentices to use their tools in exchange for work. They do not share their secrets. So what to do once I am gone? Well the traditional way is to make something and then test it until it falls apart. Then you see where the item failed and the next time you make it avoid that mistake.\nOf course making the same thing over and over, only to destroy it, really doesn't improve your skill very much. It also fills the store room with broken iron daggers.\nThe key is to gain examples of other's works, and see how they made them. See their points of failure and compare them to how you make the same item. And then make them better.\nThat is how you learn, both in crafting and in life. Study and research your failures and the failures of others. Take those lessons to heart and apply them the next time you craft something or solve a problem.\nAnd of course this philosophy fits in well with your own destructive personality. I am sure you will do well.\nCrafting: Tempers and Tannins.\nBardus,\nToday's lesson is about the tempers and tannins used by armorers and weaponsmiths. As you have noticed while hiding from the nightwatch in your father's armory, each race has its own style of arms and armor: for example, Redguard swords are curved, while Dunmeri leathers are smoky blue. These different styles are achieved by the use of tempers and tannins.\n&lt;a href=\"Tempers\"&gt;Tempers&lt;/a&gt; and tannins are used by the crafter to balance hardness and resilience in armor and weapons. A hardened sword can hold a sharper edge, but might shatter when struck. A flexible blade will bend rather than break but cannot hold much of an edge. Thus weaponsmiths use tempters in their quenching troughs to strike a balance between the two.\nLikewise a leather chestpiece can be treated to be as rigid as a board, able to turn an assassin's knife -- but if it is too rigid, the wearer is unable to turn his body. Thus, armorers use tannins on leathers and fabrics to strike a balance between stiffness and flexibility.\nWhat does this have to do with the look of a Redguard sword or Dunmeri leather? If only you had asked that question in your lessons rather than daydreaming about impressing the scullery maid with that wisp of a mustache.\nThe tempers and tannins used by each race also imbue them with basic properties that are characteristic of the race's gear. The flexibility that must be forge into the curve Redguard swords is achieved by adding Yokudan sands to the smith's quenching trough. Likewise the distinctive bluish sheen of Dunmeri leather is achieved by using Volcanic Ash-based tannin.\nThe only race that does not employ tempers and tannins is the Argonian. Culturally they cling to their ancient methods of crafting armor and weapons. Before they were enslaved by the Dark Elves, Argonians used flints and feathers to enhance their obsidian axes and padded armors, rather than metals and leathers. When the first Argonian flint axe shattered on the iron breastplate of a Dunmeri warrior, they started to change. Their adoption of modern methods came too late to stop the enslavement of their race, by change they eventually did.\nArgonian weapons and armor now use traditional metals, leathers and cloth as their bases. But Argonian smiths decorate them with ancient materials, such as flints and feathers, to honor their ancestors. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; also decorate their armor with bone for the same reason, but they have always used iron and other metals in their weapons and armor, which explains why their tribes avoid the enslavement visited on the Lizard-Folk."}

(Who knows what grisly dishes that lot would make with Kwama eggs? Would they stuff chickens with them? Poach them and put them in a bap? They are a disdainful people, and they make disdainful food.)\nTo cook a Kwama egg with any measure of success is to master the sharp, sour flavor, and the gummy texture. Kwama eggs are similar to &lt;a href=\"Scrib%20Jelly%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Scrib Jelly&lt;/a&gt; in this way, and many a young chef (even Dunmeri chefs whose elders should have better taught them) has attempted to mask the eggs behind other ingredients, to camouflage the perceived unpleasantness. This is an abominable practice. A chef should never apologize for a Kwama egg in her dishes by sweetening or embittering them. If the dish is properly prepared, supporting the Kwama eggs' natural qualities, a cultured diner will embrace the meal in all its pungent glory.\nBut what does that preparation entail? Only a Dunmer could tell you. Because only the Dunmer have the lifetimes of experience necessary to call ourselves culinary masters of the Kwama egg. It was we who first tamed the &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kwama&lt;/a&gt;, after all.\nI, in turn, have spent a large portion of my years (of which there are many) immersing myself in the art. I have served Kwama eggs to peasants and paupers, Grandmasters and Grandmistresses, and delighted them all. And you, dear reader, will find within these volumes the combined knowledge of my entire career. It takes a lifetime of cooking Kwama eggs to truly understand the subtle, but brilliant differences between the various methods of preparation, and I have catalogued them all here\u2014all the ones of worth, at least. Follow these recipes exactly. Just as a mage should hesitate to improvise in her spell-casting, lest she find a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; in her drawing room, the Kwama egg chef should not stray from the paths I've laid out here\u2014painstakingly crafted from years of trial and error.\nBelieve me\u2014if it works, I've found it.\nAnd put that &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt; away. You'll insult the eggs."}

He has been investigating a series of thefts targeting the Altmer in the city, and will ask for your help. He will give you his notes; these will show that the thief, named \"The Artisan,\" only steals items of personal value to the victims, and leaves them personal messages. \nThe note will further contain a list of individuals you should question about the subject: Mendreval, Rilding, Kuralit, Talqua and Zuzik. Of these, Kuralit is the closest by, down the road to the south. You can bribe or intimidate him into telling you what he knows; he caught a glimpse of a bosmer sneaking into the bank. Talqua will be close by, inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundation%20of%20Trust\"&gt;The Foundation of Trust&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that since the thefts began, a lot more Altmer have been depositing their valuables in the bank. He will further tell you that only he and his assistant &lt;a href=\"Nidras\"&gt;Nidras&lt;/a&gt; have access to the vault, which is why nothing has been stolen here so far. \nYou can also talk to Mendreval, Rilding and Zuzik in the marketplace. They will tell you .\nNidras will be upstairs; if you accuse him of being the Artisan, he will confess. His initial plan was to use the &lt;a href=\"Right%20of%20Theft\"&gt;Right of Theft&lt;/a&gt; to get the Altmer to leave Marbruk, but this failed, so he returned the items to \"let Altmer hatred do the job for [him].\" Take this information back to Cinnar and he will thank you for your help, and ask you to help clear up the mess that Nidras left behind. Nidras returned the stolen items to the wrong houses, and then framed the Altmer for theft. Your job is to retrieve all the items and bring them back. \nYou will find the items in the row of houses in the south of town, and the two houses just outside the south gate. You will find Earrastel's Heraldic Cane in the plant in Calastil's House, Laurosse's Censer among the vegetables in Cassirion's House, Quertasse's Drinking Horn beneath the bed in Earrastel's House and Calastil's Pelt behind the tapestry in Quertasse's House. Once you have all the items, a guard named Hendare will enter the house you are in; speak with him and he will accuse you of being the Artisan. When you mention working for Cinnar, he will suggest you go to him to clear things up. Speak with Cinnar to finish the quest."}

Lozruth believes he has found the tomb of the Orc hero &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, whereas his colleague Sharela believes this is the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead up the stairs and talk to Sharela. She has determined from the imagery here that this is likely Gaiden Shinji's tomb, not Baloth Bloodtusk's. They cannot get inside though. The door is locked, but there are indentations next to the door that seem to be meant for burial urns. She will ask you to look for such urns in the catacombs below but beware as these catacombs are crawling with &lt;a href=\"Winterborn\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt;. \nYou will find the catacombs below Honor's Rest; just follow the path. Once in the catacombs, examine the monument stone in the big room. It will tell you that to uncover the history of this place, you must drink from the memorial pools. There are memorial pools on both sides of this dungeon; in the east, follow the river to its end, then head through the cave to the west. Head on until you reach the pool, then drink from it to receive a vision. You will find yourself in a tent with Gaiden Shinji and some of his soldiers; they will be having a conversation about challenging Baloth Bloodtusk to a duel. Speak with Gaiden Shinji when they are done, and he will talk about how his hand is forced and he has no choice but to challenge the Orc chief. After this conversation, leave the memory and you will find the urn of Tamahl, the man whose memories you just visited, in a niche across the pool. \nIn the west wing, you must fight through waves of reachmen to get to the pool, but the path will be straightforward. When you drink from this pool, you will find yourself in the longhouse of Baloth Bloodtusk. He has just received a message from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with him and he will tell you that because of the threat King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; just sent him, he has decided to fight for Orsinium and its king. Leave the memory and recover the urn of Arakaul, the man whose memory you just visited. \nOnce you have both the urns, head back to Sharela. She will be in an argument with Lozruth and someone named &lt;a href=\"Goruz\"&gt;Goruz&lt;/a&gt; about whose tomb this is. Place the urns and the door will open. Lozruth and Sharela will proceed inside; follow them and you will find architecture associated both with the Orcs and with the Order of Diagna. Head on to the main burial chamber and you will find a statue of the final battle between Baloth Bloodtusk and Gaiden Shinji, depicting them as equals. \nThere is another memorial pool at the end of the room; drink from it and you will again find yourself in a memory. There will be a man named Rokaug here; this is the brother of Baloth Bloodtusk. He will tell you that &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt; intends to betray both Baloth Bloodtusk and Gaiden Shinji, on king Joile's orders. Proceed ahead to warn your lord, Lord Trystan of this betrayal; you will be too late. General Mercedene will launch a volley of arrows killing both Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk, ending their duel. Talk to Lord Trystan about what happened, and he will send you after General Mercedene. \nMercedene will be further up the path; kill her, then return to Trystan. He will tell you that he will bury Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk side by side, as they would have wished. When this is done, leave the memory and talk to Lozruth. He will agree that he and Sharela were both right. Talk to Sharela hereafter to finish the quest."}

If the Hero kills &lt;a href=\"Hides-His-Heart\"&gt;Hides-His-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the bonus will be forfeit.\nBackground.\nSome people want &lt;a href=\"Francois%20Motierre\"&gt;Francois Motierre&lt;/a&gt; dead because he couldn't pay back a loan, and they have hired an assassin, &lt;a href=\"Hides-His-Heart\"&gt;Hides-His-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, to do the job. However, Francois has hired the Dark Brotherhood to stage a fake assassination. Usually, the Dark Brotherhood will only accept contracts involving a death, but Francois offered them his mother.\nLucien takes care of this for the Hero. Vicente will give them the &lt;a href=\"Languorwine%20Blade\"&gt;Languorwine Blade&lt;/a&gt;, a specially poisoned blade that mimics death but does not kill (the blade is a one-time poison use). Do not kill &lt;a href=\"Hides-His-Heart\"&gt;Hides-His-Heart&lt;/a&gt; (so he can report to his boss that Motierre is dead) while doing the job.\nWalkthrough.\nBreak into the victim's house in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. Do not kill him, beat him, stab him, or hurt him in any way. He will explain what he wants to be done. When the enforcer comes, he will go into a little tirade; then when he's done, stab Motierre, and he will fall to the ground like he is dead. &lt;a href=\"Hides-His-Heart\"&gt;Hides-His-Heart&lt;/a&gt; will attack but do not fight back and kill him or the bonus will be lost.\nNot killing Hides-His-Heart can be tricky. If the Hero hits Motierre with the blade and exits fast enough, Hides-His-Heart will exit the house slightly later giving the Hero more time to run out of Chorrol and therefore secure the bonus.\nWait for 24 hours then go to the Chorrol Chapel's Undercroft and revive Motierre with Vicente's antidote. His dead family members will view this as a desecration and will come to life as zombies and try to send the Hero to their grave. Kill them and take Francois to the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Mare\"&gt;Gray Mare&lt;/a&gt;.\nReturn to Cheydinhal to get payment and, if Hides-His-Heart is not dead, another bonus, the &lt;a href=\"Cruelty%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Cruelty's Heart&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "6767", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6767", "title": "The Asylum Ball", "text": "The Asylum Ball is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nMy great great uncle was a warder at an asylum in &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt; (maybe he was my great great great uncle\u2014it was quite a long time ago), and this is the story that has been passed down in my family from his generation to mine. Perhaps it is purely apocryphal, but when I was told it, it was whispered in such a way that it was meant to be taken seriously. Not having any children of my own to whisper to, and being in need of some gold, I have elected to publish my story.\nThe asylum my great great uncle worked in was apparently very posh. Only the right class of lunatics were admitted. Eccentric dukes, mad baronesses, touched lords, and daft ladies filled the asylums tapestried and gilded halls. Still, it was a time of great excitement when the rumor began that the unhinged &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, was transferring there from a resort in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. When the rumor became a reality, the asylum went into nice, calm, restive chaos. Pelagius was given an entire wing of the asylum for his own use, for, though he was madder than a jackal, he was still His Terrible Majesty, the Emperor of Tamriel.\nThe Emperor was remarkably well behaved, my great great uncle supposedly asserted. Of course, he did not have to face the commoners who came on all sorts of pretenses to gawk at their overlord, the loon. When one of the warders (not, I have been assured, my uncle) forgot himself and let His Terrible Majesty know that people had been there to see him, the Emperor grew very excited. He made up his mind right there and then to have a ball. A huge party with musicians, dancing, and dinner, right at the lunatic asylum. Or precisely, in his wing of the asylum.\nRumors of the Emperor's interest in holding a ball spread throughout Torval and eventually it reached the ears of the Regent &lt;a href=\"Katariah\"&gt;Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, Pelagius' dear wife, in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Eager to make her husband happy, she sent a caravan laden with gold to the asylum so a ball might be held befitting the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; dignity.\nThe Emperor picked a date for the ball, and preparations began immediately. The old asylum walls were beautifully decorated, but needed cleaning. A pit had to be constructed to house the orchestra; servants for &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; and serving the &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; had to be hired; &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ore\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ore\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; and matching chandeliers were ordered; the old rugs were destroyed, and new rugs embroidered with &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gem\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt; were weaved; lists of guests had to be compiled, reconsidered and recompiled. The Emperor knew that the guest list had to be very exclusive, and he relied on his advisors to tell him who was alive, who was dead, and who was imaginary.\nThe party was set to begin at nine o'clock. At six, the hairdresser he had hired from Torval finished his Imperial coiffure. At seven, he was fully dressed in the robes he had ordered for the ball: voluminous black silk and piled velvet crusted with red &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. At eight, he walked down the newly reconstructed staircase to supervise the final preparations\u2014the lighting of the candles, the opening of the wine, the murder of the first course. At nine o'clock, he took his seat at the facsimile throne he had ordered and awaited the first guests.\nAt nine thirty, his advisor, seeing the royal eyes beginning to glaze over with madness, said, \"Your Terrible Majesty surely knows that it is not fashionable to arrive at any ball for at least an hour after the desired time, yes?\"\nThe Emperor just stared.\nAt ten thirty, the Emperor called for some food and &lt;a href=\"wine\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;, and sat at his throne, looking at the open door, . Thirty minutes later, he ordered the orchestra to begin playing. For the next three hours, they played gaily for the empty, candlelit ballroom.\nAt one o'clock, the Emperor announced his intention to retire for the evening. My uncle was one of the warders who assisted His Terrible Majesty up the staircase. Halfway to his room, Pelagius threw himself on the floor in a hysteria, screaming and laughing, ordering more wine (my mother was good at this part of the story, rolling her eyes and , \"More wine! More wine! Wine!\"), and, in short, imagining that he was possessed by all the at his party that never was.\nTwo days later, he was still not better. He had cut himself and those who tried to grapple him horribly with the red diamonds of his robe. Eventually it was decided that the Torval asylum was not equipped to deal with a lunatic of his severity, and he was sent to a more secure location in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. It was only three months later, my uncle heard that the Emperor had died.\nOne of my uncle's duties was to clear out the personal property of the inmates after their death. Being primarily landed nobility, the personal property was often quite extensive. Several years after the asylum ball, my uncle was called to clear out the apartment of a duchess whose chief eccentricity was a propensity to pilfer. Kleptomania, I believe it's called. Locked away in a secret door in her desk, protected by a trap armed with a barbed needle, was a variety of jewels, piles of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and five large stacks of beautifully engraved invitations signed in the Emperor's childlike handwriting."}

However, it also causes &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20Regen\"&gt;magicka regeneration&lt;/a&gt; to decrease by 50%.\nLocation.\nThe stone is located in the volcanic tundra between &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, just outside the mountain range between the two locations. The stone is by the river southeast of &lt;a href=\"Eldergleam%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Eldergleam Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; and a short distance east of &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThere are several ways in which the impact of the 50% reduced magicka regeneration from the Atronach stone can be reduced or even eliminated. Magicka regeneration may be increased through enchanted equipment or potions. Looted or purchased equipment of &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka regeneration&lt;/a&gt; can provide increases of up to 100% for rings, amulets, and helmets, and 150% for robes. Such items may be disenchanted to enable the player to enchant their own equipment, ordinarily by up to 60%. Potions of &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Regenerate%2520Magicka\"&gt;regenerate magicka&lt;/a&gt; provide increases of between 50% and 100% for 300 seconds. The &lt;a href=\"Recovery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Recovery&lt;/a&gt; perks increase magicka regeneration by up to 50%. As all effects are additive, magicka regeneration can be increased by up to 600% (or 550% with the Atronach stone reduction), which is far in excess of what is useful in ordinary combat, effectively eliminating the disadvantage from the Atronach stone. Such strategies however, come at the cost of equipment slots, purchasing of perks, or use of potions, so the disadvantage of the Atronach stone will always remain, although this may become irrelevant to high level characters depending on their build.\nThe benefits of the Atronach stone are also considerable. When combined with the Magic Resistance and the Atronach perks from &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; and the Elemental Protection perk from &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to build a character that is highly resilient to magic. These advantages are more prominent on races with a greater magical aptitude. As an example, the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, who possess the &lt;a href=\"Dragonskin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragonskin&lt;/a&gt; power, can stack this with the Atronach Stone, making the player immune to magic for the duration of Dragonskin. As for an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, the player can counter the reduced magicka regeneration by engaging their &lt;a href=\"Highborn%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Highborn&lt;/a&gt; power or by using equipment with the &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Regenerate Magicka&lt;/a&gt; enchantment, such as the &lt;a href=\"Morokei%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt; mask. It is also possible to possess 170 points of extra magicka for the Altmer if they elect to use this stone, owing to their initial magicka pool being higher than other races, combined with the &lt;a href=\"Miraak%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; mask. The Nahkriin mask will also provide extra magicka, although Miraak's mask gives a larger reserve should the player character be over level 60 when the latter is unlocked. \nSee the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spell Absorption page&lt;/a&gt; for more information on obtaining 100% spell absorption.\nAlso given the way the magic regeneration system works, with the more magicka a character has, the more they gain per second. So with a 50% reduction to magic regeneration, the two ways to counteract this effect is to either get another 50% regeneration effect or double the magicka capacity.\nFor another, slightly unorthodox, strategy, this stone can be used by a pure combat character who does not use spells. The slight stunt in magicka regeneration is rendered irrelevant, while gaining powerful Spell Absorption. The magicka boost, however, is similarly disregarded."}

{"id": "6201", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6201", "title": "The Axe Man", "text": "The Axe Man is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nContents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Axe%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;Axe&lt;/a&gt; Man\nA surprising way to become proficient with an axe\nOf all the members of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; I've spoken with, none disturbed me as much as Minas Torik. A quiet and reserved man who never drank, never visited a brothel or even uttered a curse, he was famous for his ability to make people disappear. Once a person was targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and Torik was sent to them, they would simply cease to be. I asked him once what his weapon of choice was, and was equally startled by his answer.\n\u201cI only likes to use axes,\u201d he said in his typical, quiet voice.\nThe image of this silent, dour fellow attacking anyone with a weapon as inherently bloody and violent as an axe so frightened and intrigued me that I questioned him about it further. This is an inherently dangerous activity, for assassins are not typically keen to give out their stories. Torik did not mind the questions, though it took some time to get the full story out of him, as naturally shy and reserved as he was.\nIt seemed that Torik had been orphaned as a very young age and sent to live with his uncle, a saltrice plantation owner in &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The man promised to show his nephew the business and eventually make him a partner when he was old enough. In the meantime, the boy was put to work as his uncle's house servant.\nIt was a grueling life as the old man was very particular about how things should be done. The boy was first required to give all the floors in the house a thorough scouring, from the attic to the cellar. Whenever the floor was not cleaned to the uncle's satisfaction, which was frequent, Torik was thrashed and forced to begin again.\nThe boy's second duty was to ring the bell that would bring the laborers into the house. This was done at least four times a day, once for each meal, but if his uncle had any news or additional instructions for the laborers -- which he frequently did -- the bell might need to be sounded a dozen times or more. It was a huge iron bell in the tower and the boy quickly discovered that he had to throw his entire body into the motion of pulling the chain in order to have it sound loud enough to bring everyone in from the field. If he was tired and did not pull the backbreaking chain hard enough, his uncle was soon at his side to beat him until he rang the bell loud and clear.\nTorik's third task was dusting all the shelves in his uncle's vast library. As deep and old as the shelves were, he was required to work with a long, heavy duster on a rod. The only way that he could reach to the back of the shelves was to hold the duster at his shoulder and then swing it out in a sweeping motion. Again, if the uncle saw any dust left over or felt that the boy was not working as hard as he ought to, the punishment was swift and severe.\nAfter several years, Minas Torik grew into a young man, but his job responsibilities were not increased. His uncle promised to teach him the business, once Torik had demonstrated his mastery of his servile assignments. Divorced from any knowledge of any work other than his own, Torik never knew how badly in debt his uncle was and how poorly the farm's yield was.\nIn his eighteenth year, Torik was called into the cellar by his uncle. He thought that he had not done a good enough job scouring the floor down there, and was frightened of the beating to come. What he found, however, was his uncle packing his goods into crates.\n\u201cI'm leaving &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe business has gone sour, so I thought I'd try my luck running a caravan in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. I understand there's good money to be made, trading fake &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; artifacts to the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt;. I wish I could take you with me, my lad, but there won't be much need for scouring, bell pulling, and dusting where I'm going.\u201d\n\u201cBut uncle,\u201d said Torik. \u201cI can't read, I knows nothing of the business you promised to teach me. What will I do on my own?\u201d\n\u201cI'm certain you can find a job in some domestic capacity,\u201d shrugged the uncle. \u201cI've done my best with you.\u201d\nTorik had never stood up to his uncle before, and felt no anger only a sort of coldness that gripped his heart. Among his uncle's possessions being packed away was an old heavy iron axe, allegedly of Dwemer manufacture. He picked it up in his hands and was surprised to find that it was not much heavier than his dusting rod. In fact, it felt very comfortable as he pulled it over his shoulder and swung it out as he had done so many times before. In this instance, however, he swung it into his uncle's right arm.\nThe old man screamed with pain and rage, but for some reason, Torik didn't feel frightened anymore. He propped the axe against his other shoulder, and swung it out again. It cut a swath across the old man's chest and he fell to the floor.\nTorik hesitated before lifting the axe above his head. It was another natural position for him, like he was ringing a bell. Over and over again, he swung down as if he was calling the laborers in from the field. Except that this time, there was no sound except for a wet thump, and no laborers came in from the field. Of course, his uncle had sent them away hours before.\nAfter a time, there was nothing left of his uncle that couldn't be washed down the cellar drain. The process of cleaning up came easily to Torik as well. Blood scrubbed up much quicker than the usual grime and &lt;a href=\"saltrice\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt; flour that littered the cellar floor.\nIt was well known that Torik's uncle was planning to leave Morrowind, so his disappearance provoked no suspicion. The house and all the belongings were sold to the debt collectors, but Torik took the axe. It seemed that his uncle had given him some worthwhile business skills after all."}

With Thrud in tow, the Nerevarine must enter the Sewers, heading to a deadend in the eastern part of the main area in order to find Dilborn. Surrounded by several bandits, Dilborn is being held captive by a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Drathas%20Nerus\"&gt;Drathas Nerus&lt;/a&gt;, to whom Dilborn owes a large sum of money. The Nerevarine is now faced with a choice.\nReduced Ransom.\nThe Nerevarine may attempt to negotiate with Nerus, who states that Dilborn holds a 3,000 debt. This figure can either be paid, or reduced through raising Nerus' disposition, although Nerus will only go as low as 1,000 . Once the debt has been paid, the Nerevarine may speak to Thrud, whom will reward them with a book, \"&lt;a href=\"Trap%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Trap&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCutting the Captors.\nAlternatively, the Nerevarine may choose to simply attack Nerus, although his two associates will immediately pounce upon the defenceless Dilborn. They will also attack Dilborn if the Nerevarine attempts to Intimidate Nerus into letting him go, with the Nerevarine needing to kill all three before Dilborn and Thrud can be reunited. Thrud will assist in the fight, and will again reward the Nerevarine with a copy of \"Trap\".\nOnce the Nerevarine has spoken to Thrud, the quest is completed."}

Haggling experience is determined by the ratio between the haggling price and the original price. This ratio, naturally enough, also determines the difficulty of haggling. However, haggling for low priced goods bought or sold in the same transaction alongside expensive ones will be difficult; the ratio between the haggling savings and the low priced goods is high.\nSelling prices can drop, along with buying prices, at high levels of mercantile and disposition. To change this, use any means of raising the ratio between the merchant's mercantile and yours, or lower the merchant's disposition. For example, offer unacceptable prices to the merchant, lower Mercantile or raise the merchant's Mercantile slightly, or use up Fatigue."}

{"id": "55659", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=55659", "title": "Mercer Frey", "text": "Mercer Frey is the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; leader of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and the primary antagonist of the Thieves Guild questline in . He is also the owner of &lt;a href=\"Riftweald%20Manor\"&gt;Riftweald Manor&lt;/a&gt; in Riften, although he is never actually found in or around this location.\nBackground.\nMercer joined the Thieves Guild at some point during the tenure of Guildmaster &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus Desidenius&lt;/a&gt;. Mercer soon began skimming funds from the guild's treasury, which was eventually discovered by Gallus.\nHe took over the position of guild leader after his predecessor Gallus Desidenius was supposedly murdered by &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt;, Mercer's former partner, until the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; discovered the truth while looking for Karliah with Mercer in tow in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Veil%20Sanctum\"&gt;Snow Veil Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Dragonborn's initiation to the guild, Mercer is usually the one that gives out tasks for them. It is noticeable from the beginning that he always acts impatient and irritated towards the Dragonborn. He shows obvious distaste towards them and becomes increasingly annoyed the more they progress in the Thieves Guild questline. He eventually tries to kill the Dragonborn during \"&lt;a href=\"Speaking%20With%20Silence\"&gt;Speaking With Silence&lt;/a&gt;\" and later in \"&lt;a href=\"Blindsighted\"&gt;Blindsighted&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMultiple followers.\nMercer Frey is one of the quest characters that can be exploited to follow the Dragonborn throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; of their choice. In the quest \"Speaking With Silence,\" after they enter Snow Veil Sanctum, they can leave and he will continue to follow them wherever they go.\nThis is a simple way to obtain a powerful follower as, whilst the mission is still available, he cannot be killed off by the Dragonborn or others. While it is not possible to converse or trade objects with him similar to an ordinary follower, he will remain an unkillable ally; at least until Karliah is found.\nPersonality.\nMercer is generally quite pessimistic, stressed, and irritable. Despite his personality, he appears to be quite sly, for example killing the previous leader of the thieves guild, Gallus and blaming it on Karliah, and using her to lure the Dragonborn to Snow Veil Sanctum. He also seems to be adept in swordsmanship, as Karliah states when talking to Mercer, \"Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence, Mercer.\"\nHe seems to be a master of sneak as he was able to silently approach &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;falmer&lt;/a&gt; and assassinate them swiftly while also sneaking past many of their &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chaurus&lt;/a&gt;. This could possibly be the result of Mercer unlocking his hidden potential with the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt;. His lockpicking skill is debatable: he is seen picking locks that are unpickable, but this is almost certainly because he uses the Skeleton Key, which was in his possession at the time. It is also possible that he has generally good knowledge of the locks themselves.\nAs the true extent of his actions is revealed, Mercer is shown to be a man utterly lacking in scruples both personal and moral, willing to betray and murder anyone who trusts him for personal profit. Over the course of more than twenty-five years, Mercer broke his sworn oath to Nocturnal and stole the Skeleton Key, robbed the Thieves Guild blind, murdered his predecessor and pinned the blame on Karliah.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Loud%20and%20Clear\"&gt;Loud and Clear&lt;/a&gt;.\nMercer will assign the Dragonborn the first job in the Thieves Guild, which requires the Dragonborn to go to the &lt;a href=\"Goldenglow%20Estate\"&gt;Goldenglow Estate&lt;/a&gt; to teach the proprietor a lesson. Before going there, the Dragonborn can optionally talk to &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt; in order to discover the location of the secret entrance to the estate.\n&lt;a href=\"Dampened%20Spirits\"&gt;Dampened Spirits&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; tasks the Dragonborn to shut down a competitor, newly opened &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew Meadery&lt;/a&gt;, and to find out how its owner &lt;a href=\"Sabjorn\"&gt;Sabjorn&lt;/a&gt; has managed so quickly to fund its opening.\n&lt;a href=\"Speaking%20With%20Silence\"&gt;Speaking With Silence&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter following Mercer inside the Snow Veil Sanctum, all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt;, he will attempt to end the Dragonborn's life. However, Karliah saves them and nurses them back to life and will then reveal Mercer's treachery to the guild.\n&lt;a href=\"Blindsighted\"&gt;Blindsighted&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn travels to &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt;, a vast dwarven ruin that supposedly contains the legendary \"Eyes of the Falmer.\" Karliah and &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; are waiting for them within. Together they hope to stop Mercer Frey from stealing the Eyes and escaping from Skyrim with the Skeleton Key of Nocturnal.\nMercer's bookcases.\nThe shelving behind Mercer's desk in the cistern slowly fills with trophies relevant to any exploits and &lt;a href=\"The%20Litany%20of%20Larceny\"&gt;larceny targets&lt;/a&gt; sold to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Left%20Eye%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;Left Eye of the Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. Those items can be taken from the cases. Upon finishing the additional jobs Delvin and Vex give the Dragonborn, trophies of recovered items begin to fill the shelves too:\nConversations.\nBrynjolf: \"Mercer? This is the one I was talking about... our new recruit.\"\nMercer Frey: \"This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources, Brynjolf. Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich. You break the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussion... you do what we say, when we say.\"\nAfter talking with Mercer:\nBrynjolf: \"Wait a moment, you're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even our little Vex couldn't get in.\"\nMercer Frey: \"You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If so, let him prove it. Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one of our largest clients. However, the owner has suddenly decided to take matters into his own hands and shut us out. He needs to be taught a lesson. Brynjolf will provide you with the details.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?\"\nMercer Frey: \"Hmm? Oh, yes. Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild.\"\nMercer Frey: \"Brynjolf, have you had a chance to speak to our contact in Whiterun?\"\nBrynjolf: \"Sorry Mercer, they no longer wish to be involved in our operation.\"\nMercer Frey: \"I trust you've applied the appropriate pressure in order to change their mind?\"\nBrynjolf: \"I have. I think we may have to turn this one over to the Dark Brotherhood.\"\nMercer Frey: \"Yes, I'm afraid you're right. Such a shame...\"\nMercer Frey: \"Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds your heart?\"\nKarliah: \"Give me a reason to try.\"\nMercer Frey: \"You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.\"\nKarliah: \"\"\"To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies.\" It was the first lesson Gallus taught us.\"\"\nMercer Frey: \"You always were a quick study.\"\nKarliah: \"Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.\"\nMercer Frey: \"Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the other way.\"\nKarliah: \"Did you forget your oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him to simply ignore your methods?\"\nMercer Frey: \"Enough of all this mindless banter! Come on, Karliah. It's time for you and Gallus to become reunited!\"\nKarliah: \"I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death sentence. But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your undoing.\"\nKarliah: \"He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.\"\nKarliah: \"Climb down that ledge and see if you can...\"\nMercer: \"Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?\"\nMercer: \"Karliah, I'll deal with you after I rid myself of your irksome companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better acquainted.\"\nBrynjolf: \"What's... what's happening... I can't stop myself.\"\nKarliah: \"Damn you, Mercer! Fight it, Brynjolf... he's taken control of you!\"\nBrynjolf: \"I'm sorry lass, I... I can't...\""}

Little more than a hub of unscrupulous merchants, thieves, and black market smugglers, the only government in Belkarth appears to be the will of the scoundrels of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragonstar&lt;/a&gt; Caravan Company.\nIn Belkarth, all manner of vices are tolerated and everything is for sale. As an example of this depravity, I need only cite the now well-known tale of Madriga. The daughter of a beloved and respected Crown, Madriga was seized from her home in Evermore as payment for debts her father's steward had incurred from agents of the Dragonstar Caravan Company. She was spirited off to the treacherous reaches of Craglorn, where she resurfaced, ten years later, as a barmaid in the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads%20Tavern\"&gt;Crossroads Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow the grown woman Madriga in no way resembled the demure and beautiful child of her father's household. Indeed, she had grown into a haughty, promiscuous woman, little better than the local strumpets with their brazen demeanors. When guards from her father's household were sent to bring her home so that she might be restored to her family and married into a noble and honorable estate, it is said that she exclaimed, \"No, thank you. The wages are better here.\"\nI relate to you this tale so you will be warned if ever you have occasion to deal with the Dragonstar Caravan Company. These so-called merchants have no regard for the noble and established orders that have so long flourished in civilized society. Their only master is gold, and they allow neither honor nor decency to intervene in their service to their master."}

They exchange for items purchased, and require for items taken from them.\nIncreasing a merchant's stock of items below their cash limit can be used to sell more expensive items to them. This is done by first selling the merchant items that are below their cash limit. Then, after the merchant's cash has restocked twenty-four hours later, the Nerevarine can sell them more expensive items by taking cash plus the smaller items back in barter to match the sale price. One can then wait until the next restock and sell the cheaper items back to the merchant. This works better for &lt;a href=\"Creeper%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Creeper&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20Merchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mudcrab Merchant&lt;/a&gt; due to their higher cash limits and the fact that they always buy and sell at exactly an item's value regardless of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; skill. As an example, a 5,000 item could be sold to Creeper. The next day, buy it back and sell a 10,000 item. The next day, one for 15,000, and so on. Then, unwind the process by selling back the barter items. \nA few of the items in a merchant's inventory may also be restocked daily and they will reappear for sale after they have been bought. However, the number of the restocking items available is not a set number, but the number they had previously plus any they were sold. So if the Nerevarine buys everything that the merchant has and returns to the shop after they have restocked and sells them back, the merchant will thereafter stock double the amount and so on. Note that with a low mercantile skill, this process is expensive, both losing money to high prices when buying and low cash paid when selling. \nNot all merchants buy and sell all items. The nature of the items bought and sold follows logically from the type of merchant, e.g., armorers buy and sell weapons and armor, alchemists buy and sell potions and ingredients and so on. There are also some traders, general goods merchants and the \"creature\" merchants described above who buy and sell all manner of goods.\nList of merchants.\nFor a complete list of merchants, see "}

Together they embark on a quest, to rid &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; of the demonic floating city of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to the situation he was called by different names, even thinking in different ways. When he spoke to &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt;-speaking people he was Mere-Glim the Argonian, which cut his thoughts into human shapes. When he spoke to his mother or siblings he was Wuthilul the Saxhleel. When he spoke with a Saxhleel from the deep forest, or even with a member of the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;, he was a Lukiul, \"assimilated,\" because his family had been living under Imperial ways for so long. When he spoke with Anna\u00efg he was Glim.\nThe Infernal City.\nMere-Glim and &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt; lived together, spending their days sharing adventures and enjoying their evenings by drinking all of her father's wine in &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. Anna\u00efg always convinced Glim to take part in dangerous activities or try her potions on him. Once, they nearly got\narrested during one of their little adventures. Glim had cousins in Lilmoth whom he occasionally spent time with when not with Anna\u00efg.\nOne day Anna\u00efg persuaded Glim to investigate someone Anna\u00efg suspected of being a werecrocodile. They investigated the werecrocodile's lair, only to get themselves caught in a &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; den. The smugglers sighted them, so they had to run. They made it to the roof, but there was a fifty-foot fall. Anna\u00efg provided Glim a flying potion. Glim didn't trust her, the last time she gave him a potion crafted by her it made his skin translucent. He finally decided to give it a try. The potion worked fairly well, and they landed on the ground. They ran as fast as they could to Anna\u00efg's home and celebrated their adventure with a bottle of wine.\nThey talked about visiting other places such as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but Glim didn't want to leave Lilmoth. Glim told her friend about a flying city that was approaching Lilmoth through the sea. Anna\u00efg was excited about the flying city.\nThey woke up with a hangover. Anna\u00efg inquired Glim about the flying city. &lt;a href=\"Taig%20Ho%C3%AFnart\"&gt;Taig Ho\u00efnart&lt;/a&gt; joined the conversation. He told them that everything had started when &lt;a href=\"Urvwen\"&gt;Urvwen&lt;/a&gt;, a crazy old &lt;a href=\"Psijic\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt; priest, said he felt something out in the deep water. After the conversation, Anna\u00efg sent Glim to discover what Urvwen had to say, while she improved her flying potion. The Psijic told him the the flying city was almost here. He revealed that it might come from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Glim wasn't very concerned about it and he went to find his cousins and procure a bottle of Theilul.\nGlim received a message from Anna\u00efg through &lt;a href=\"Coo\"&gt;Coo&lt;/a&gt;. He realized that Anna\u00efg was in trouble, so he ran to help her. Anna\u00efg told him that she had been forced to take a ship to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer father feared that the flying city could destroy Lilmoth, and he had sold their house to buy her a ticket. Glim swam until he reached the boat where Anna\u00efg was being transported.\nHe secretly saved her, and he towed her up to the shore. They talked about the possibility of returning to Lilmoth, but if Urvwen was right, there was nothing to do. Anna\u00efg thought that they could reach the flying city from a hill if they used her flying potion. They drank the potion and ended up in the flying city.\nOnce in the city, they saw how the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; instructed the Lukiul, the assimilated Argonians, not to run away from the destruction, but rather just stand there. The &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; had temporarily gone away, returning once everything was over. The dead bodies came back to life as undead. They wandered through the city until they heard some people talking in a mer dialect. Anna\u00efg, who had studied Ehlnofex, understood that they had seen them arrive to the city, and they were searching for them. They came across a man called &lt;a href=\"Wemreddle\"&gt;Wemreddle&lt;/a&gt;. He realized that they were the intruders who were being searched. However, he told them that he wasn't going to blow the whistle. He hated his life in the flying city, and he hoped that they could help him escape.\nWemreddle betrayed them, and he warned the chefs about them. The chefs saw an opportunity to progress as cooks by using the knowledge of the newcomers. They fought among them for Anna\u00efg and Glim. Finally, a chef called &lt;a href=\"Qijne\"&gt;Qijne&lt;/a&gt; won and demanded them to come with her.\nQijne ordered them to learn about the ingredients they used in her kitchen. Anna\u00efg lied her telling that Glim knew as much about cooking and ingredients as she knew, so that they remained together. It was obvious that Glim didn't know much about cooking, so he was taken from the kitchen to be interrogated. A man asked him what he was good at. Glim told him that he could swim fast and dive indefinitely. He was sent to the sump, a place where he could be useful.\nThe sump was the place where the &lt;a href=\"Umbrielian\"&gt;Umbrielians&lt;/a&gt; were born. The &lt;a href=\"skraw\"&gt;skraws&lt;/a&gt; had to look after the protoforms that later grew into the Umbrielians. &lt;a href=\"Wert\"&gt;Wert&lt;/a&gt;, one of the skraws, explained Glim what he had to do. The rest of the skraws couldn't breathe underwater, so they breath some vapors that allowed them to do so. However, they were very noxious, the skraws usually died young. Wert warned him to stay away from the bottom of the sump. &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;,\nthe device that took care of the souls that animated new Umbrielians and powered &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;,\nwas stored there.\nIn their way back, they were attacked by a &lt;a href=\"sheartooth\"&gt;sheartooth&lt;/a&gt;. Wert tried to impale the sheartooth with a lance, but he was hit by the creature. Glim managed to wound the sheartooth with his claws. Glim towed Wert into the surface, saving his life. After thanking him, he told him that the sump and the Ingenium would probably start producing Umbrielians with the body of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlim tried to find ways to contact or at least find Anna\u00efg when nobody was looking at him. He discovered a place where there were some trees very similar to the Hist. He met a girl called &lt;a href=\"Fhena\"&gt;Fhena&lt;/a&gt;. Glim talked to her about &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and how he ended up working in the sump. Glim asked her if she knew how to reach the kitchens from there. Fhena could ask a friend of hers. They agreed to meet another time in the same place. Glim return back to the sump, only to be scolded by &lt;a href=\"Eryob\"&gt;Eryob&lt;/a&gt;. He accused him of doing Wert's job. He hit Glim, who felt to the floor in pain.\nFhena revealed to Glim that Anna\u00efg had become very popular in the kitchens. She was now working in &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen. Fhena offered to ask &lt;a href=\"Kalmo\"&gt;Kalmo&lt;/a&gt; where Toel's kitchen was, but Glim feared that it could rise many questions. Glim kissed Fhena to express his gratitude, but Fhena, who wasn't used to Tamrielic traditions thought that Glim was asking her to procreate.\nThat night, Glim was awakened by other skraws. They were astonished that he had stood up to the overseer. They told him that they were tired of breathing the vapors. They wanted to change their way of life. Glim saw a chance to create a resistance, so he accepted leading them in their secret rebellion. He explained that if the sabotaged the &lt;a href=\"Fringe%20Gyre\"&gt;Fringe Gyre&lt;/a&gt;, they could draw the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20%28Novels%29\"&gt;lords&lt;/a&gt;. First of all, he asked them to make maps of Umbriel.\nGlim sent Anna\u00efg a letter through one of the skraws. He told her that he had found her, and that they could contact through the skraws. Anna\u00efg answered back telling him that she had everything ready to escape from Umbriel. They agree to meet at midnight at the dock.\nGlim and Anna\u00efg finally met again after a long time. Anna\u00efg provided him a flying potion, and they left Umbriel. After they walked away from the flying island, Anna\u00efg realized that their bodies became incorporeal. They had spent too much time in Umbriel, and now they were part of it. They returned to Umbriel thinking that they would have the chance to escape someday.\nLord of Souls.\nMere-Glim continued preparing the rebellion of the skraws. He met Anna\u00efg weekly thanks to the maps the skraws had drawn. Glim told her about the skraws and his secret revolt. He asked Anna\u00efg to craft potions that could allow the skraws breath underwater without having to use the vapors, but Anna\u00efg couldn't do it without being noticed.\nAnna\u00efg sent a letter to Glim asking him to gather detailed information concerning &lt;a href=\"Phmer\"&gt;Phmer&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen. He initially was reluctant to do it, but he remembered that they were working to save Tamriel. In addition, he tasked the skraws the first big mission of their rebellion, to sabotage some middens.\nGlim met Fhena in the usual place. He had brought her kraken barnacles. Glim proceeded to ask her about the trees in Umbriel because they reminded him of the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Fhena couldn't tell him much, but to Glim's surprise, she told him that the trees sang. Fhena took Glim's hand and pressed it to the bark. Glim didn't notice anything at first, but he recognized the same song that the Hist sang, in a bit simpler version.\nGlim told Anna\u00efg about the trees in Umbriel. They produced the proforms the Umbrielians started as. Then the Ingenium gave them a soul. Anna\u00efg proposed poisoning them, which would, in essence, destroy Umbriel, but Glim refused to do so, since it would affect all of the Umbrielians. In their next meeting, Glim demanded Anna\u00efg's weapons of sabotage for the skraws. Anna\u00efg asked him to sabotage the kitchens to attract some attention. The kitchens would blame each other, and Toel's kitchen could benefit the most from this situation.\nFhena took Glim branch riding through the trees of Umbriel. She told Glim that some Umbrielians just let it go and never came back to Umbriel. They died to be born again, just as Argonians did in Black Marsh. Glim feared that Fhena could die branch riding, so he made her promise that she wouldn't do it again.\nGlim discovered some men armed in the sump. They weren't skraws, so he followed them hidden. Those men discovered Wert sabotaging the water filters of the kitchens. Glim launched a surprise attack. Glim moved much faster than them underwater, so he didn't have much trouble fighting them. The man who seemed to be the leader opposed more resistance. He told him that he was Chef Toel, and he demanded to let him go. Glim refused to do so, so Toel used his power to make Glim's muscles clenched uncontrollably. Just then, Anna\u00efg realized it was Glim who was attacking them, so she killed Toel. Anna\u00efg and Glim arranged to clean the place and hide Toel's body near Phmer's kitchen. Nobody knew what happened besides them.\nThe lords finally discovered that the skraws were the ones responsible for the recent malfunctions of Umbriel. They sent guards to capture Glim. Wert warned Glim about the incoming guards, but he refused to escape. The guards wounded him with a spear in the face. &lt;a href=\"Oluth\"&gt;Oluth&lt;/a&gt; confessed that they had broken a tree-root feed and left their sign there. He pushed Glim to the water just when more guards poured in. An harpoon hit him, but he managed to escape.\nGlim woke up disorientated. He had swam up to where he usually met Fhena. Fhena found him severely wounded, so she healed him. Glim intended to go back to help the skraws with their rebellion, but Fhena convinced him to stay with her. After a few days, Fhena couldn't hold Glim back any longer. When Glim jumped into the water he realized his body was being paralyzed.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Umbriel\"&gt;Lord Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; had asked Anna\u00efg to kill Glim. Anna\u00efg decided to poison him. However, the drug she put in the water made his body grow a crystal, a matrix containing his soul, his thoughts, his memories. She recreated Glim as an Umbrielian. When the protoform grew Glim would be reborn conserving his thoughts and feelings. If Anna\u00efg hadn't killed Glim, someone else would have, and she wouldn't have been able to help him.\nGlim was reborn as an Umbrielian. Fhena and Anna\u00efg explained him what had happened. Glim didn't understand it at first, but when Anna\u00efg explained it to him he enraged and left for the Fringe Gyre. Fhena went after him to try to talk some sense into him. Glim realized that the trees had changed their song. Fhena told him that it had changed a pair of days after his death. Glim realized that the trees had shaped him to do something, he had to save the trees from being poisoned by Anna\u00efg.\nGlim run back to Anna\u00efg's kitchen. He begged her to stop the poison, but Attrebus had failed to defeat Lord Umbriel wielding Umbra, their only option was to poison the trees. Anna\u00efg asked Glim to go to the Skraw caves and bring Attrebus. Glim demanded her to give him the antidote. Anna\u00efg remembered a time when they had been innocent children, and there were no betrayals and heartsickness. She finally agreed to give him the antidote.\nGlim found Attrebus and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; with the skraws. The skraws informed him that they were all getting sick at once. Glim knew what he had to do, he opened the vial of the antidote and drank it all. Glim guided Attrebus and Sul back to Anna\u00efg. When they arrived, they realized that Vuhon was with her, he had discovered she was the responsible for poisoning the trees. Anna\u00efg told them that Lord Umbriel's soul was being stored in the Ingenium.\nGlim, Attrebus and Sul headed to the Ingenium. Attrebus asked Glim to use the trees to take Umbriel out of Tamriel, even if it meant being trapped forever. Glim tried to do it, but Lord Umbriel was more powerful than him, countermanding him. They had to jump to the sump to save time and arrive to the Ingenium faster. Once in the water, Glim towed Attrebus and Sul to the bottom. Once they reached the room where the Ingenium was being stored, Glim attacked Vuhon without success.\nAttrebus stabbed the Ingenium with the Umbra, Umbra (the being) was expelled from Vuhon's body and returned to the blade. Attrebus was decided to kill Vuhon, but doing so would make Umbriel collapse into the Imperial City. He told him that he would allow Glim to remove it from this plane. Attrebus and Glim returned with Anna\u00efg and Fhena. They had a sad farewell, and Anna\u00efg and Attrebus left for the Imperial City after drinking flying potions.\nGlim guided Umbriel to the tree's home, the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;Realm of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;. Fhena and Glim have a final conversation where they said that they liked the place, and that it would be their home from then on.\nStudies.\nAnnaig\u00a0is known to have studied the \"dead language\" of &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt;, which is similar to what the &lt;a href=\"Vehrumas\"&gt;Vehrumas&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; speak.\u00a0Glim could not properly communicate with the inhabitants of Umbriel until he was given\u00a0a potion of some kind by the overseer of the\u00a0sump."}

{"id": "2484", "revid": "50714989", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=2484", "title": "Merethic Era", "text": "The Merethic Era (meaning \"Era of &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Nordic\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; and also possibly spelt Merithic), also known as the Mythic Era, was the period of time immediately following the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Merethic Era was reckoned by early Nord scholars as a series of years numbered in reverse chronological order (beginning with ME2500 and counting down with each passing year) from the \"beginning of time\" to the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; homeland of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; which was recorded as Year Zero of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly Merethic Era.\nDuring the early Merethic Era, aboriginal &lt;a href=\"Betmer\"&gt;Betmer&lt;/a&gt;, or beast-peoples, of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\u2014progenitors of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;, lived in preliterate communities throughout Tamriel. Sometime during this era, or possibly the previous &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, Tamriel's &lt;a href=\"Runestones%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Runestones&lt;/a&gt; were created.\nOver many years, the mer of Tamriel, or Aldmer, began to split along cultural lines according to their new environments and on how best to spread creation and their parts in it. At first the dividing was only temperamentally but then they became physically very distinct races separate from one another. The Aldmer would thus become the various merish races: the Altmer, Ayleids, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;, and Orsimer.\nMiddle &amp; Late Merethic Era.\nSeveral groups of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; left the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; to settle across the coastlands of Tamriel, founding several tower settlements across the continent. The &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; also moved inland and established themselves in what would become known as &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. It is during this time period that the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; were built, by the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and the Ayleids respectively, and the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt; was rediscovered by the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; clan of Aldmer.\nA unified Velothi culture rose and fell during the Middle and Late Merethic Era. The Velothi Chimer gradually separated into a multitude of distinct and varied tribal cultures for the remainder of the era. From these, both the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;House Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlander clans&lt;/a&gt; would develop in later eras. \nFollowing their initial colonies, the Aldmer would become further splintered, with &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;'s exodus with the Chimer, successfully establishing themselves in what would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; in the late Merethic Era. Their schism also led to the creation of the Orcs, following &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to stop them leaving the Summerset Isles, resulting in his consumption by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. Following their transformation, the Orcs fled to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, settling near &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; for a time. \nThe first permanent settlements of men in Skyrim were founded at this time by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his family fleeing a civil war in Atmora, and bringing the Dragon Cult with them. Their initial clashes with the Orcs at this time have become part of Nordic legend, but their initial settlement of Saarthal was destroyed by the Falmer in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, which only Ysgramor and two of his sons are said to have survived. Some years later, Ysgramor and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; returned to Tamriel, and retook Saarthal. This would mark the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt;, but the Nords would not retake the entirety of Skyrim until the early First Era. During this time period, attempts were also made by the Atmorans to expand into &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, but they did not remain part of the emerging empire, and instead were absorbed into the local &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; peoples of the region, which were seemingly already the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; race. The Dragon Cult was also likely wiped out on Tamriel during this time period, although the precise timing of the Dragon War is unclear.\nIt is during this time that &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; makes his first recorded appearance as an intermittent warlord across Tamriel. However, very little is known about his precise deeds, allegiances or location during this time.\nEnd of the Era.\nThe Merethic Era came to an end with the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Eplear\"&gt;Eplear&lt;/a&gt;, which is seen as the first year of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. This is also seen as the \"beginning of time\" even by Nordic historians."}

The invocation for Meridia is 13th of &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star\"&gt;Morning Star&lt;/a&gt;. Meridia can also be summoned at her shrine, if the summoner offers something from the corpse of an undead creature at the statue. Meridia's holdings in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; are collectively known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nAppearance and personality.\nShe almost always comes in the form of a beautiful woman. Meridia has always had a hatred for all things &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. She takes great joy in rewarding mortals who purge the realms of the wretched walking-corpses, along with any &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s who have tampered with Meridia's life-giving energies. Meridia is one of the few Daedric Princes considered to be benevolent by mortals. This is attributable to her originally being a Magne-Ge, thus her interests are aligned with what would become the mortal races enough to (at least initially) agree to help create &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDawn Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;, Meridia was known as Merid-Nunda, an &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s true intentions were discovered, Merid-Nunda fled &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; and became one of the &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;Magna Ge&lt;/a&gt;. After consorting with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, Merid-Nunda was cast down, and in turn became the Daedric Prince Meridia. According to &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; mythology, Merid-Nunda is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;, the Khajiiti equivalent of Magnus, but he didn't love her as he only loved his own creations. She was supposedly created out of aether.\nFirst Era.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessia's rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s made a pact with Meridia and her minions the &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s, to help the Ayleids against the human rebellion. The Ayleids' champion, &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt;, bound his life force in the realm of Meridia. This made him have Daedra-like immortality. When he is slain in the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, his spirit will float in the Water of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and eventually return to Meridia's realm.\nThird Era.\nSometime in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Meridia was summoned by the Champion of Cyrodiil. Meridia solicited the champion to cleanse a certain cave of Necromancers and their undead. She rewarded the champion with her &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiiti\"&gt;Ring of Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt;. The same artifact was given by Meridia to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; 28 years earlier after they killed a sorcerer for her.\nFourth Era.\nSome two hundred years later, in the midst of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Malkoran\"&gt;Malkoran&lt;/a&gt; broke into a temple to Meridia situated near Mount Kilkreath in Skyrim, and proceeded to perform experiments on the casualties of the civil war, Stormcloak and Imperial alike. Meridia, infuriated, commissioned the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; with destroying Malkoran and his creations. Upon the necromancer's death, Meridia presented the Dragonborn with the legendary sword Dawnbreaker.\nArtifacts.\nRing of the Khajiit.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Khajiit\"&gt;Ring of Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; is an ancient relic, and was stolen by a thief named &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;, who made it famous. He used the powers of the ring to make himself invisible and move quickly. With it, he became the most successful burglar in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. His fate became a mystery, though it is said that the Ring betrayed him to his enemies.\nDawnbreaker.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt; is a sword given to Meridia's champion. It is a powerful weapon against the undead, sometimes releasing a blast of explosive energy that destroys all undead near it, and sends the more powerful enemies retreating in fear."}

She doesn't appreciate me. Not like the new lady in my life.\nRead over my first entry. I note I was trying to formulate a potion, but I can't for the life of me remember why. I've grown to like this place. Even the keening of the bats in the background is like a siren's song. It's all thanks to her. My lady, my love.\nMy wandering days are over! We are to be married, and live forever in our subterranean paradise! If I ever see that mage again, I'll thank him. He's changed my life!"}

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; wandered into &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow\"&gt;Cragwallow&lt;/a&gt;, a small settlement used by the &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Skald-King's&lt;/a&gt; royal work crews. After a lot of hard work maintaining the roads, they are preparing to throw a party.\nWalkthrough.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow\"&gt;Cragwallow&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige will encounter a man named &lt;a href=\"Berj%20Stoneheart\"&gt;Berj Stoneheart&lt;/a&gt;. He will invite you to join in a celebration they are planning, and tell you that the cooks are in disagreement on what to cook. He will ask you to go talk to the cooks. \nHead over to the other end of town, where you will find both cooks. &lt;a href=\"Kalogar%20Cookpot\"&gt;Kalogar Cookpot&lt;/a&gt; specializes in bear steak, and &lt;a href=\"Heggvir%20Sun-Hair\"&gt;Heggvir Sun-Hair&lt;/a&gt; specializes in Goat Stew. If you pick Kalogar's Steak, he will ask you to slay a bear so he can use its meat. If you side with Heggvir and choose her stew, she will ask you to lure one of the native goatsso she can use it.\nIf you side with Kalogar, \nThe goats needed for Heggvir's stew can be found to the northwest, in a clearing between &lt;a href=\"The%20Ritual%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Ritual Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icehammer%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Icehammer's Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Bring the goat back to Heggvir and she says she will start cooking it. She then informs you that Berj wants more mead, and asks you to speak to &lt;a href=\"Raldulf%20Wolf-Kin\"&gt;Raldulf Wolf-Kin&lt;/a&gt; by the storeroom. Head over there and talk to him. He will tell you that one of his wolf friends ate the key to the storeroom, so he no longer has it. \nYou will find the key on the body of one of the wolves north of here. Retrieve it and enter the storehouse to get the mead, then return the mead to Berj. He will thank you, and ask you to ask the bard to play a song. Head upstairs and speak with &lt;a href=\"Valding%20the%20Bard\"&gt;Valding the Bard&lt;/a&gt;. He will agree to treat the partygoers to a song. \nOnce the bard starts singing, you will black out. When you come to, you will find dead and wounded all over the place, and a man named &lt;a href=\"Arvild%20Gray-Sky\"&gt;Arvild Gray-Sky&lt;/a&gt; will ask who you are. He will tell you to speak with the other survivors and find out what happened. None of them will remember clearly, but their accounts do incidate they were attacked by some kind of creatures after the bard started playing. Head outside and tell Arvild what they told you. He will tell you to go look for the bard.\nHead out and look for clues. You should find a few northwest of town. While searching for clues, you will also be able to start another quest called &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Wish\"&gt;Dying Wish&lt;/a&gt;. That quest has you visit the same areas as this one, so it is efficient to do them simultaneously. You will find a few crude weapons, but the most significant clue is a tankard near &lt;a href=\"Cragwallow%20Cave\"&gt;Cragwallow Cave&lt;/a&gt; that indicates the bard was dragged to that area. Head near the cave and speak to &lt;a href=\"Vestrek%20Raven-Eye\"&gt;Vestrek Raven-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, who will tell you that the attacking creatures were &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rieklings&lt;/a&gt; and that they dragged the bard into the cave. Head inside and look for Valding. He will be all the way in the back, in a cage. \nTalk to him and he will admit he is not actually a bard. His lute is enchanted to make people fall asleep so he could steal their gold. He then tells you that the riekling chief seems enamored by the lute, having placed it on a pedestal. Destroy it and the riekling chief should appear. Kill him and loot the key to Valding's cell from his body, then return to Valding. You can now decide to let him out or not. \nIf you decide not to release Valding, \nIf you release him, you have to guide him out of the cave. Once outside, he will promise to turn himself in to the people of cragwallow. This will end the quest."}

According to an unknown adventurer searching for the Wrathstone and follwoing Mhuvnak's trail, Mhuvnak was not confident that Kagrenzel could withstand an attack if other were to discover the new location of the Wrathstone. To better protect it, Mhuvnak build his eponymous vault near the city, filled with numerous traps and &lt;a href=\"animunculi\"&gt;animunculi&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "19382", "revid": "25037394", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19382", "title": "Grab", "text": "The term grab is used for picking something up and moving it without putting it into your inventory.\nThe default activation key/button is:\nTo use the grab utility, the player must point at the item to be moved, then press and hold down the \"grab\" button.\nIt should be noted that grabbing an item while the hand icon is red will usually be considered \"theft,\" even though the player may not have added the item to their inventory. Merchants do not appreciate it when they attempt to move their items.\nGrab works similarly to &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to manipulate objects in the game world. However, unlike Telekinesis, they are unable to move things closer or farther away using attack or block; objects remain at a fixed distance. The distance between them and the object is set at the moment they \"grab\" the item; therefore, for more fine control, stand closer to the object before grabbing it. However, the distance can be changed by object collision (e.g. with the floor or a wall, or with a shelf or bookcase).\nThere are several uses to the grab function - a player can use it to decorate their house, drag bodies, etc. Practically anything that is affected by the physics engine can be grabbed. One of its most useful functions is using it to carry heavy items around, such as an extra cuirass or two, although attempting to move more than one object can be time-consuming. It is also useful for stealing; grabbing the item and moving to a hidden spot then stealing it will not be noticed.\nUsing grab to pick up items and place them precisely can be frustrating. The grabbed object will appear to dangle from an invisible thread. This connection point seems to be based on the location of the cursor at the moment they initiate the grab. If they pick up an object and it's not facing the correct way, try \"shaking\" it by moving rapidly in one direction and suddenly stopping. The object will swing from its \"thread\" and may rotate into the desired location.\nSee also.\n&lt;a href=\"Technical%20Information%23In-depth%20technicalities\"&gt;Technical Information&lt;/a&gt; (information on the Havok physics system)"}

Separate from the native Bosmer and Orsimer are populations of &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; in and around the city of &lt;a href=\"Southpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt; that was founded by the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; by sea and made landfall in Grahtwood, creating the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Mire\"&gt;Gray Mire&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the people of the Gray Mire initially considering attacking local Dominion forces, the Dominion tolerated their presence. &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; traders also have a presence in the north of the region at &lt;a href=\"Redfur%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;Redfur Trading Post&lt;/a&gt;, established by Khajiit from &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Southern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Grahtwood and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nGrahtwood features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Aldmeri Dominion's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Grahtwood. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Grahtwood totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Grahtwood and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker. \nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

After Nerevar's death, three of his Lieutenants from House Indoril, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, succeeded to control of the Council, which they renamed the Grand Council of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, due to their association with &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, remained the dominant party in the Grand Council right through until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.Throughout this time, the Grand Council was responsible for local governance in Morrowind, while Morrowind as a whole was ruled indirectly by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; became the dominant party after the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt; was signed by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and Vivec in 2E 896. This is because House Hlaalu were the only house to advocate accommodation throughout this period. House Hlaalu also gained more power by the mass suicide by House Indoril and the assassination of the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20High%20Councilor\"&gt;Lord High Councilor&lt;/a&gt; who in turn was an Indoril, and placed a Hlaalu in the position.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hlaalu%20Helseth%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;King Helseth&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind reformed the Grand Council, which many saw as a move to a more traditional &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; Regieam \nIn the Fourth Era, House Hlaalu was used as a scapegoat for all Dunmeri problems and was stripped of Great House status and &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt; took their place. &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, became the prominent power on the Grand council and moved the Capital to &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;."}

It sits in area disputed between &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe town of Granite Hill is located on the border in between the Falkreath Hold and the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Granite Hill is a town that thrives on agriculture, from the Falkreathian forest to the south. The town has roads that lead to the townships of &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20Hall\"&gt;Karthwasten Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the west and another one that leads to the town of &lt;a href=\"North%20Hall\"&gt;North Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Near the township is a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Mound\"&gt;Dragon Mound&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Vuljotnaak\"&gt;Vuljotnaak&lt;/a&gt;, who was slain in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town of Granite Hill was under the occupation of the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Gjalund\"&gt;Jarl Gjalund&lt;/a&gt;, whose territory expands beyond the Whiterun Hold borders in the modern age. Granite Hill served as a trading town in between two trading cities.\nRoughly around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged the province and had ended atop of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt; banished &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragon known as Vuljotnaak was defeated near the town of Granite Hill and was buried in a mound not far from the village.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Granitehall in their quest to recover the pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, the township of Granite Hill was under the occupation of the city of Falkreath, which was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Siddgeir\"&gt;Jarl Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt;. The town influenced the Court of Falkreath, by having an emissary partake in the Court. The war had affected the trade routes throughout the Hold, causing taxes from somewhere such as Granite Hill to come later than expected. Since Falkreath was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Granite Hill was likely on the side of the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;."}

House Hlaalu is the most open and modern of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;. We are the only Great House who has embraced the irresistible tides of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20law\"&gt;Imperial law&lt;/a&gt; and custom. And thus we have profited by the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s new policies, rising from obscurity as the Greatest of the Houses.\nIn the great wind of progress, tradition cannot stand.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; may surpass us on the field of battle, but when the dust clears, they will find themselves indebted to us. The &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; may know many arcane secrets, but they fight among themselves more than against each other, and they cannot adapt to the ways of the Empire. Ancient and powerful though a Telvanni wizard may be, no individual can withstand the march of history. The &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; are loved by the people for their gifts and donations, but when the money runs dry, will the people remember? The &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; know how to make money, but they have not learned how not to make enemies.\nGrasp fortune by the forelocks. When you see your chances, seize them.\nWhen you see a chance to turn a profit, take it. But do not follow money blindly. There is value in reputation, more than many young Hlaalu realize. This value must be carefully balanced against the more tangible coins in any deal. Theft and murder are bad for business. You can steal from someone, but will he trade with you after that? You can't bargain with a dead man.\nThere are many ways to do business.\nIn House Hlaalu you must be &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt;. You must be able to keep up with business and with the times. You must be able to speak quickly and convincingly. You must be able to trade with the best of merchants and make a profit. You must learn to protect your own property by securing it with hidden chests, locks, and even traps. And when confrontation is unavoidable, it is best to fight quickly in comfortable, light armors with short blades, or to fight from a distance with a marksman's weapons.\nThen, reader, would you seize this opportunity to join House Hlaalu? Would you have yourself be counted among the victors in the race for success? Then submit yourself for examination at the &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20Council%20Manor\"&gt;Balmora Council Manor&lt;/a&gt;. If you have the skills, you will be welcome. And if you have the will, you may serve House Hlaalu, and advance in the ranks, for above all things, House Hlaalu prizes initiative and ambition."}

They say that some of the miners broke through the wall in shaft three of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20Mine%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock Mine&lt;/a&gt; and found some ruins. I hope this isn't another waste of time like that fiasco they sent me to in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. I'll gather my assistant, &lt;a href=\"Millius\"&gt;Millius&lt;/a&gt; and sail back to Raven Rock at first light... it'll be nice to see the old house in &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; again.\n7 Second Seed 4E10\nFinally arrived in Raven Rock and was surprised at the number of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dark elf&lt;/a&gt; refugees living in town. They aren't really from mining stock, but I think they'll make fine workers one day. Millius and I spent a good part of the day clearing the ash off of the roof of my house. The damn &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; is still erupting almost day and night. If it wasn't for the ash covering everything it would almost look beautiful.\n8 Second Seed 4E10\nMillius and I are headed into Raven Rock Mine to have look at whatever it is the miners uncovered. I think I'll stop by the old Swing and Scoop and pick up a few supplies before we head down. Couldn't hurt to be prepared.\n9 Second Seed 4E10\nLooks like the miners broke right through the wall of &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;an old Nordic barrow&lt;/a&gt;. I've seen this sort of thing in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; before... damn &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;barrows&lt;/a&gt; dotting the landscape and almost none of them are ever marked on any maps. Looks like this barrow to something called the \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Clan\"&gt;Bloodskal Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\" I'm going to take some rubbings of the inscriptions on the tombs and see if I can't learn some more information from my history books.\n10 Second Seed 4E10\nIt's been a few days and I can't find even a single mention of this clan anywhere. Millius and I decided to proceed ahead. We've come to a dropdown point, but I can see a massive chamber below. Took the better part of the day to lower everything down and climb down the almost sheer drop.\n11 Second Seed 4E10\nIt's been an astonishing day of discovery! After exploring the large chamber beyond the dropoff, I was startled to find the strangest weapon I've ever laid eyes upon sitting on a pedestal of sorts. The blade appears to be flawless, and is emitting a faint chilling glow. Bits of parchment I found about the chamber seem to call this \"The &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodskal Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\" Not Certain if i should remove it yet, I think I'll sleep on it.\n12 Second Seed 4E10\nI've decided against my own better judgement to remove the Bloodskal Blade from its pedestal. Millius seems completely against it, but we need to bring this wondrous artifact with us when we find a way out of the barrow.\n13 Second Seed 4E10\nI should have listened to Millius. The moment the blade was lifted, we were set upon by &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;. Millius fought bravely, but he fell. I was able to destroy the remaining ones, but I was badly wounded. I can barely stand. My only chance would be finding a way out of this place. But I fear that I'm trapped.\n14? Second Seed 4E10\nExploring has been slow. I can only move for maybe a few minutes at a time before I have to rest. My supplies are running low, and I'm feeling weaker by the hour. The only progress I've made is finding a strange door with markings on it that I've never seen.\nThere appears to be something to them I'm missing, as they've confounded my attempts at getting through. I'll have to study this further in order to make any progress... barely can keep awake.\nI'm fairly certain that the key to the door involves the use of the Bloodskal Blade. When swinging the weapon, I'm noticing a ribbon of mystical energy emanating from it. I think by swinging the sword in different directions, it's possible to manipulate this ribbon and solve whatever puzzle this door presents. I hope to get well enough to put this to the test soon... each swing is a huge effort.\nLast entry\nI've lost track of time and my strength is fading. I can't even stand anymore. My wounds refuse to heal. I'm afraid this tomb will become my resting place. If anyone finds this journal, please send these notes to my superiors at the East Empire Company and tell my wife that I love her.\nMay &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; guide me to my final rest."}

Gratian had left Raven Rock before it had become a territory of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Gratian Caerellius' travels after Raven Rock, he was married and had a child named &lt;a href=\"Rellicus%20Caerellius\"&gt;Rellicus Caerellius&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom would travel with Gratian around the world. On the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2010\"&gt;4E 10&lt;/a&gt;, Gratian was given an assignment from the East Empire Company in Raven Rock about their sudden discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow\"&gt;Bloodskal Barrow&lt;/a&gt; in the Ebony Mines. A month later in &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, Gratian and his group had arrived onto the docks of Raven Rock, which is now under the occupation of the Great House Redoran, much to his surprise. Gratian and Millius had recovered the Caerellius House by it would constantly be covered in Ash. His family would take residence in the Redoran household. On the 9th of Second Seed, the two archaeologists had traversed the Bloodskal Barrow where Gratian learned about the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Clan\"&gt;Bloodskal Clan&lt;/a&gt; and discover the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodskal Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nTempted by the Blade's mystery, Gratian had pulled the Bloodskal Blade from its pedestal, much to the dismay of Millius. The moment he had picked up the blade, a group of &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the two. Millius had fought valiantly but had succumbed the power of the Undead Nords. Gratian was able to fend off the remain Draugr but was mortally wounded in the process. With the Bloodskal Blade in his hands, Gratian died in peace, accepting his fate, hoping that whoever found his journal, would show it to his superiors and to tell his wife that he loves her. He died on the Second Seed of 4E 10.\nLegacy.\nUnbeknownst to them, Gratian had died in his journey to Bloodskal Barrow. His wife and son were forced to stay on the Island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and work in the land, being the only Imperials on the island. Rellicus Caerellius had become a miner in another section of the Raven Rock Mine until he was killed by the local &lt;a href=\"Reaver\"&gt;Reaver&lt;/a&gt;s; it is likely his mother died of natural causes or the frequent ash storms. Rellicus had a son, who would then have a son of his own named, &lt;a href=\"Crescius%20Caerellius\"&gt;Crescius Caerellius&lt;/a&gt;, who would become the foreman of the Raven Rock Mine. The East Empire Company gave a false story about Gratian's death, saying he died of a rockfall. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20181\"&gt;4E 181&lt;/a&gt;, the Ebony Mines of Raven Rock were exhausted and closed down by &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the town. Crescius had strongly believed that there was still Ebony deep within the mines and had stayed in Raven Rock, becoming one of the last Imperials to live in the town.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Crescius discovered letters between Gratian and the East Empire Company, realizing that there was more to the Raven Rock Mine than meets the eye. Crescius made several attempts to explore the mine but was stopped by his wife, &lt;a href=\"Aphia%20Velothi\"&gt;Aphia Velothi&lt;/a&gt;. And so, he tasked an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; to explore the ruins, to find the remains of Gratian and his discovery. Deep into the mines, the warrior discovered the entrance to Bloodskal Barrow and both Gratian and Millius' remains. The traveler picked up the Bloodskal Blade and entered the ruins, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt; in the process. With the records needed, the traveler gave it to Crescius, who was able to reopen the mine, ushering in a new era of prosperity to Raven Rock."}

The graveyard, site of the ancient battle, is just to the south. So little is known about this battle that my research should be eagerly awaited. I hope to answer many questions today.\nWere the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s part of a strong contingent of Elves based at Variela? Or were they scouts coming from afar? And what in &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;' name were &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; doing there? Did they too have a previously unsuspected stronghold nearby, or were they a band of marauders far from home? Unearthing the graves and examining the artifacts they contain should tell me much.\nI have rested here long enough. The shadows lengthen already. I will make a pitiful camp in the graveyard and begin my excavations in the morning. Discovery awaits!"}

Because Nocturnal is revered as the \"Mistress of Shadow,\" the artifact is attributed with stealth and secrecy. Legend holds that it renders the wearer completely &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt; to mortal eyes. It is notably worn by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;, who stole it from her.\nRole in history.\nThe cowl was stolen from Nocturnal by a thief named &lt;a href=\"Emer%20Dareloth\"&gt;Emer Dareloth&lt;/a&gt;, the first grandmaster of the Thieves Guild. After the theft, Nocturnal cursed the cowl so that whomever wore it would be erased from history; all who knew that person would subsequently forget who they were. This caused &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as the Gray Fox to the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, to lose his royal ties when he came into possession of it. His wife &lt;a href=\"Millona%20Umbranox\"&gt;Millona&lt;/a&gt;'s memory of him fogged, and she suspected him of having run away, forsaking his marriage vows.\nDesperate to remove the curse from the cowl, return to his position as Count, and ultimately rekindle his marriage, he employed the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to steal an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;. Succeeding in doing so, the Count was able to break the curse, remove the cowl, and return to his wife. It is believed that the hero retained the cowl and assumed the mantle of the Gray Fox.\nEffects.\nWhile wearing the cowl, one's &lt;a href=\"fame\"&gt;fame&lt;/a&gt; drops to 0 and infamy rises to 100. Infamy can increase for every immoral action committed.\nMany characters will also have different reactions upon engaging in conversation with the wearer. Most notably, all members of the Thieves Guild, residents of &lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow%20Cove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Dunbarrow Cove&lt;/a&gt;, and all beggars will speak in awe to the wearer, with the impression that they are speaking to the Gray Fox himself. Non-member characters will also recognize and beg to be spared by the Gray Fox.\nAdditionally, wearing the cowl in public accumulates a 500 &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in an attack by all &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; in the Hero's immediate area. The wearer is given no option to pay off the bounty or yield and can only resist arrest. This bounty cannot be removed by &lt;a href=\"Armand%20Christophe\"&gt;Armand Christophe&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"S%27Krivva\"&gt;S'Krivva&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only way to remove this bounty is to either unequip the Cowl (preferably in a safe location) or to use the console command codice_1, which will change the target's bounty to 0 . When executing this second option, however, the wearer cannot speak to any guards, or else they will be treated as if they have a bounty.\nThe main advantage upon wearing the cowl is all crimes witnessed and committed are blamed on the Gray Fox persona and not on the player character. This allows even \"good\" characters to steal and murder without consequence.\nAlthough legend holds that the wearer becomes Invisible, this is not a trait garnered upon wearing it."}

It is home to all the city's Dark Elves.\nBackground.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; population of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; scattered across Tamriel. Because it was hard to breathe in Morrowind due to the ash, some of these refugees came west, to the cities of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and Windhelm in Skyrim. These Dunmer would later settle in an area known as the \"Snow Quarter,\" but the name Snow Quarter shifted to Gray Quarter in reference to Dunmer skin color. The area is impoverished and bleak, making the Gray Quarter look like a ghetto. The &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm avoid the area, arguably because they distrust &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; and other foreigners. Some Stormcloak sympathizers in Windhelm dislike the Dunmer population, as they suspect them of being Imperial spies or feeding off the Nord community. Others such as &lt;a href=\"Elda%20Early-Dawn\"&gt;Elda Early-Dawn&lt;/a&gt; also dislike the Dunmer, but their reasoning for doing so is unknown.\nWhen Windhelm rebelled against the Empire during the Skyrim Civil War, many Windhelm locals believed that they had been too lenient. The Nord populace consider providing shelter within the city and allowance of the immigrants' own individual liberties as charitable. Some claim the Dunmer contribute to the city's high crime rate, a claim which holds some merit, as a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Reaver&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; used to live in the Gray Quarter, pickpocketing the citizens of the city. Due to their neutrality in the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, some think that the Dunmer are more of a burden to Nord society than a benefit and that Ulfric should start imposing heavier taxes on them as compensation.\nThe Dunmer believe that their plight is ignored by the Jarl of Windhelm, Ulfric Stormcloak. As a result, they turn to &lt;a href=\"Brunwulf%20Free-Winter\"&gt;Brunwulf Free-Winter&lt;/a&gt;, whom they believe can help the Dunmer with their problems. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; takes the side of the Imperials during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline and Brunwulf Free-Winter becomes Jarl, he will talk with the Dragonborn about his plans to renovate the Gray Quarter. The Dunmer in Windhelm view their future as optimistic with Brunwulf Free-Winter as the new Jarl."}

The town of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; tower that governs the town of Vos from the west. The only other settlements in the Grazelands are various Ashlander camps, more specifically the &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Camp\"&gt;Ahemmusa Camp&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Camp\"&gt;Zainab Camp&lt;/a&gt;.

A Telvanni tower in the nearby Azura's Coast controlled by &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Dratha\"&gt;Mistress Dratha&lt;/a&gt; of House Telvanni. However, she had fallen ill, and a man named &lt;a href=\"Savarak%20Fels\"&gt;Savarak Fels&lt;/a&gt; took control of Vos, under a semi-dictatorial rule. Dratha's mouth, &lt;a href=\"Llayne%20Sadri\"&gt;Llayne Sadri&lt;/a&gt; thought it was suspicious that Savarek received sudden wealth after Dratha's incident. Sadri tasked an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the situation and find out about Savarak's scheme. The Vestige uncovered that Savarak was ordered by &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; to poison Dratha, to give Hlaalu a holding in Vos. The Vestige defeated Savarak Fels on &lt;a href=\"Selvil%20Island\"&gt;Selvil Island&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Snails\"&gt;Black Snails&lt;/a&gt; Mercenary group.\nAround the same time, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; was falling ill and his powers were draining. An Ashlander from &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Chodala\"&gt;Chodala&lt;/a&gt; wield a power staff created by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala believes to be the Nerevarine, thus stealing Sunna'rah to force the steps of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige needed a device to weaken the Sunna'rah and sought the aid of &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt; to build such a device. The Vestige traveled to several &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; ruins including &lt;a href=\"Nchuleft\"&gt;Nchuleft&lt;/a&gt; in the Grazelands to find the necessary pieces to build the item. The Vestige and Barilzar created the &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Inverter\"&gt;Tonal Inverter&lt;/a&gt;, and they confronted Chodala in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kaushtarari\"&gt;Kaushtarari&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Tel Vos was established and soon took control of Vos after Tel Mora did during the Second Era. The Ahemmusa Camp had moved towards the northern cape of the Grazelands from their original home of the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt;. When the Empire was given free rein in Vvardenfell, they established a holding the Grazelands which would become Tel Vos. It was implied that House Telvanni took the previous Imperial stronghold and planted one of their Mushroom towers. Around this time, the actual &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; arose and soon fulfilled the steps of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine traveled to the Ahemmusa and Zainab Camps to have the tribes recognize them as the true Nerevarine. The warrior later defeated &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; top of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and eventually ended the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;."}

Killing a &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; in front of witnesses will give an automatic 1000 bounty. The easiest strategy here is to kill a guard, flee and &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; to another hold.
