Unfortunately, your much deserved vacation will have to temporarily suspended until this matter is settled.\nI refer to your sister, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Pasipha\"&gt;Lady Pasipha&lt;/a&gt;. For years, she has been one of the most glamorous figures at the Wayrest court, the darling of all who appreciate beauty and grace. Rather recently, rumors have circulated that the gold she has spent on her gowns and jewels could not have possibly come from her husband, who is at present, impecunious. Distasteful conjectures followed, none of which worth the ink I would use for recitation.\nTo be quite blunt, a person, who must remain anonymous, postulated to me that you were borrowing funds from the royal treasury to support your sister's extravagance. Of course, I defended your honor, but copies of the Royal books were produced that seemed to support the allegation. I am thus uncertain of the best procedure to take next.\nDo not doubt, sir, that I am convinced of your integrity as senior member of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Circle\"&gt;Elder Circle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. I only wish for the matter of the financial records be straightened so if they are brought to &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;'s attention, they can be confidently defended.\nPlease send a reply with this trusted courier. I would prefer to meet with you as soon as possible, of course.\nVery truly yours,\nHelseth\nMy Dear Lord Castellian,\nSorry about the necessity of delivering this letter by the roughest possible service, but it would be unthinkable to approach you at the castle on such a delicate matter. I have long admired your loyalty to the crown and neutrality in internal affairs. Understand that I only want to save your dignity from a possibly embarrassing scenario.\nThe problem rests in your sister, the Lady Pasipha, who though she resides abroad still communicates regularly with members of court. I understand and respect the depth of your sibling love and affection for one another, for, in response to a curious inquiry of mine, Lady Pasipha sent me several touching letters penned in your hand.\n\"Have you ever espied with delight a red berry halfdrowned in cream? So I dreamed of you, my dearest love, pouring my soul into you, sweet, for your touch, dear, my soul is quite forfeit.\"\nWhile you and I know the innocence of your fondness for the lady, the more prurient minds at court, as you are aware, are inclined toward grotesque misinterpretation. Her husband, I understand, is famous for his jealous rages. I am of several minds on the matter, how to best avoid possible negative reaction, and would appreciate your response at the soonest possible opportunity. I will await you at Castle Wayrest.\nHelseth, Prince of Wayrest"}

He meant to get us on a boat to Hammerfell, but somehow we ended up on a ship making its way to &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. And that's where we are, without a spare gold piece to our name and no prospects for getting to Hammerfell in the near future.\nOh, don't worry. We'll think of something. We always do.

After the complete and total defeat of all his opponents, Septim began using Numidium to crush the neutral royal families of Tamriel so that he could enthrone only persons he knew to be loyal. His Imperial Battlemage was furious at this use of his creation, and fought to reclaim the Mantella. In the ensuing battle, both the created and the creator were vanquished: the heart they shared blown out of this reality into the netherworld they call &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. Numidium's body was scattered throughout Tamriel and the Imperial Battlemage, without his life force, went into a semi-slumber in a subterranean vault. In the centuries that followed, the Emperor's elite soldiers, for generation after generation, collected the pieces of the Numidium and became known as the Blades. Tiber Septim's Imperial Battle Mage became known as the Underking, and set his forces out to find the Mantella.\nBe warned, therefore. Those who search for the Totem of Tiber Septim are searching for the mechanism the first Emperor of Tamriel used to control Numidium.

A warehouse at the docks? Really? You must be in terrible trouble to be hiding in place like that. Then again, trouble has a way of finding you.\nYou may be wondering why your &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; is missing. And your &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. And your clothes. And that filthy pallet you were sleeping on.\nAnd if you have any conscience at all, you might be wondering about your wives back home. Why did you run away, Chief?\nBy the way, your first wife is hilarious. You remember her, don't you? That alchemist with the cruel laugh you like so much? She and I were talking the other day about the way you've been running our tribe, and I gotta say, Chief, her laugh sounds really cruel when she's talking about you.\nRemember that one time you led us on a raid into a cave full of &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;? Remember that? They were just a wretched band of Goblins, but you fumbled the ambush, and they killed three of our best warriors. I remember the screaming at their funeral. I don't remember you screaming for them, Chief.\nOr how about that time we sent a shipment of swords to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to sell to the Redguards? That was an expensive shipment, but someone didn't send enough guards with the caravan. Do you remember who that was? I'm the stealthiest scout you've got, and I could have saved that shipment, but you never sent me.\nYou did some good things, though, I must admit. You taught us about the Code of Malacath. Like the part where a tribe can't get a new chief until the cowardly old one is dead. Or the part where only the chief gets wives, and none of the rest of us get any.\nI'm really tired of that.\nBy the way, Atugol says hello. Remember her? With her cruel laugh and her extensive knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;?\nI know you're a bit slow sometimes, but I'm sure you're figuring it out. None of my brothers ever had a chance in that Goblin cave, so I don't see why you should have a chance now. Maybe that's why you ran away, Chief.\nBut don't worry. It's not like Atugol would poison you. She wouldn't kill you so close to camp. She'd do it from far, far away.\nBecause when you die, it's not going to be poison. It's going to be a nice clean sword thrust.\nAnd that's why I'm standing behind you right now, Agnor."}

These &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tall Elves&lt;/a&gt; are a pompous bunch, but gold's gold, and they pay better than most. That said, sailing around Summerset's no roll in the daisies.

A lot bigger. For most folk, the island looks downright inviting\u2014white sandy beaches, sweet-smelling blossoms, freshwater springs and the like. But what they don't see is the nest of crags and reefs just beneath the surface of the water\u2014all covered in corals. And I'm not talking about the flimsy &lt;a href=\"echatere\"&gt;echatere&lt;/a&gt;-antlers you see in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

Just one of those scarps can split a hull like a flay-knife through pig-skin, so sharp eyes and long wicks, eh? Mind your maps and draft.\nThen there are the pirates. Damned\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sea%20Elves\"&gt;Sea Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Can't go a day without spotting their serpent-banners fluttering over a sunken merchantman or whaling ship. We've only had to repel boarders twice, but we thumped them good. I doubt they'll take another swing at an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; brig for a while. You're welcome.\nKeep a close eye on your crew too. You know how superstitious sailors can be. You wouldn't believe some of the ghost stories I've heard. Giant sea serpents, ghost ships, &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;slug-men&lt;/a&gt; that can mash your brains like blood pudding. On and on. If you give the deck-grunts too long a leash, you're liable to have a mutiny on your hands.

He just said, \"Nothing you'd be interested in.\" I persisted\u2014gently, mind you! When I asked him a second time, he fixed those icy eyes on me and whispered something in the forgotten tongue of the Ublivey mystics. At the time, I thought he said \"If you ask again, you will know regret.\" But after some uncomfortable reflection, I think he might have said, \"If you ask again, you will know murder.\" It is an easy mistake to make\u2014the words are very similar. But I tell you, Cas, I do not think it was a mistake. He knows I am a linguist. I think he knew exactly what he was saying. Even now, my skin crawls at the thought. There is something very wrong with that mer, I know it. Please, be careful.\nOld Ways Guide You,Rullinalion\nPS\u2014His crates made a hollow, rattling sound as he carried them away.

Your report detailing &lt;a href=\"Ulran%20Releth\"&gt;Ulran's&lt;/a&gt; trial, while informative, did nothing to alleviate our concerns.

Contract soldiers are expected to abide by all House laws and regulations, but &lt;a href=\"Warclaw%20Ferhara\"&gt;Ferhara&lt;/a&gt;'s mercenaries tend to deviate from standard practices on a frequent basis. We especially dislike hearing reports of excessive violence with regards to the treatment of &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;. Harsh treatment, as you know, must always be authorized.\nUse your connection and personal relationship with the Releth family to urge &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Eris\"&gt;Councilor Eris&lt;/a&gt; to get his affairs in order.

I never imagined that &lt;a href=\"troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"welwas\"&gt;welwas&lt;/a&gt; could be turned into servants and soldiers. Adding their power to our forces makes the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt; undefeatable!\nYour talented armorer has crafted armor that is lighter, stronger, and literally glowing with nirncrux power. A remarkable achievement that we never would have been able to match without her skill and expertise. Not only was it a stroke of brillance to then equip trained trolls and welwas with the infused armor, but as production increases I look forward to equiping all of our forces with the special armor.\nThe artistry demonstrated by your &lt;a href=\"Runescriber%20Kulth\"&gt;runescriber&lt;/a&gt; sends tingles up my spine. His designs are hypnotic, and I could swear they seem to move as I try to study the intricate patterns. By adding &lt;a href=\"Nirncrux%20Dust\"&gt;nirncrux dust&lt;/a&gt; to the ink and brands, the magic he imbues in his subjects increases a hundredfold. Remarkable! Combined, the training, the armor, and the body runes make the trolls nearly unstoppable.\nIf I may, allow me to offer a final ritual that you can employ to make the nearly unstoppable into the virtually invincible. Try it on one of your trolls and let me know if the results are everything I promise.\n\u2014&lt;a href=\"Elska\"&gt;Elska&lt;/a&gt;, Regent of Fanged Fury"}

With a couple &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt;, a bundle of rope, and some patience, we'd have a few in no time. The trick is keeping them from exploding.\nHonestly, that's the one thing I haven't quite figured out. I know that if you leave a corpse out too long, it gasses up like a bellows. But the eruptions are so sudden, and so violent. And I'm pretty sure the bog blights do it on purpose\u2014rushing people, then popping like a pumpkin struck by a hammer. There's a lot left to figure out, sure. But that's why we need to catch a few!

Bring a warm fire and soup for our bellies, because we're cold and we're hungry and we can't walk any farther.\nWe were so proud, so confident, when we were picked for this expedition. &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;! To be the first Orcs in more than a generation to attempt the climb to the legendary summit! But how quickly confidence turns to despair when you realize Sorrow doesn't want you to climb her terrifying heights.\nThe first two teams to attempt the ascent didn't make it very far. As far as we could tell, &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; got the first set of climbers, and the terrible wind and cold took care of the second. A few of the poor &lt;a href=\"horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horkers&lt;/a&gt; actually walked off a cliff that was hidden in the icy mist!\nBut we weren't frightened or dissuaded from our course. Although, seeing how it turned out, I suppose we should have been. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Laurent\"&gt;Lady Laurent&lt;/a&gt; rallied us and &lt;a href=\"Kharsthun\"&gt;Kharsthun&lt;/a&gt; appealed to our sense of honor. With fire in our blood and glory in our dreams, we charged forward to scale the summit once more.\nWe lost &lt;a href=\"Kuhlon\"&gt;Kuhlon&lt;/a&gt; in an avalanche. Both of her legs were broken beneath the falling snow and ice. As much as I hated to do it, we left her and continued to make our way up the mountain. Any other course of action would have doomed the expedition. Of course, our own doom was closer than we expected.\nI guess you can say we accomplished something. We actually made it to the door to Torug's shrine. We found an inscription related to it and made a rubbing, just like Kharsthun taught us. We were about to go inside when a group of three ogres appeared around the bend. We knew we couldn't take on three of the beasts with any certainty of victory, so we decided to hide and wait for them to pass. But &lt;a href=\"Urgon\"&gt;Urgon&lt;/a&gt;, clumsy &lt;a href=\"skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeever&lt;/a&gt; that he is, dropped his axe. That's when we decided down was a better direction to run than up.\n&lt;a href=\"Brokuhk\"&gt;Brokuhk&lt;/a&gt; thought our best option was to make it back to the caves we passed through. Even though there were ogres living in the caves, he said we'd be able to find a corner to hide in. Probably would have worked, too, if we hadn't lost most of our supplies escaping from the shrine. And if we hadn't run out of fuel for our fire.\nAt least we have the rubbing. If Kharsthun makes it this far, he'll know that the shrine isn't that far away."}

You certainly hate what I've chosen to do to you. I don't begrudge you those feelings, but it's only right that I explain why I'm doing what I'm doing. You must know that I do not torment you needlessly. I hope that brings you some measure of solace.\nThe fact is that I need what you have. Life and vigor specifically. I cannot take it from the Pyre Watch without alerting them to our presence. I cannot take it from the bones of the Host, since they have no vigor left to give. That leaves you, Nabor. Reliable, vigorous, sturdy Nabor.\nNow, you may experience something akin to hunger\u2014an inexplicable craving that comes from somewhere other than the belly. I will be honest: that hunger will only grow, and you will struggle to bear it. What I take from you must be replenished, you see. You may strip the strength from any living creatures that stray too close. It matters little to me. Just know that I will not stop taking what I require until my work is complete\u2014until my creation walks these halls, perfected.\nThis creature\u2014our child\u2014will bring new meaning to the dark practice. No undead creature will compare to its glory. You play an instrumental role in this achievement, Nabor. When the pangs of hunger and pain become unbearable, think on that.\nYours,\n&lt;a href=\"Voria%20the%20Hearth-Thief\"&gt;Voria&lt;/a&gt;"}

The most important lesson, for me, was finally having someone tell me to be reckless. Like you, I have a curious soul. I could not have lived a normal life. You told me to let my curiosity get me killed if I had to. You gave me a list of mysteries to solve and sent me into &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. You taught me not to fear Argonia. You kept me afloat, and I had not realized it until I received word of your failing health.\nWe have shared many discoveries through our correspondence over the years. I truly believe I will complete the list one day. Assuming, that is, I can ever return to Black Marsh. Yes, Brother Septimius, even though you bade me not to worry, I have set out for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. I will be at your side through this. Until then, I will put personal matters aside and give you something to read while you are abed.\nYou placed the most difficult mystery at the top of the list, no doubt hoping it would scare me off. What is the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;?\nI do not have the answer. I do not even have many statements to make about this subject I would consider fact. I only hope you will still enjoy my conjecture.\nThey are merely trees say some skeptical people. Trees grown by the lizard folk of Black Marsh so they can drink of the sap. They all remember &lt;a href=\"Father%20of%20the%20Niben\"&gt;Topal's description&lt;/a&gt; of a fetid and evil place, and they naturally draw wary conclusions. Legions came back speaking of venomous plants, poisonous bogs, and strange defenders that attack with fury one day and ignore invaders the next. And when even the more \"civilized\" lizard folk cannot seem to provide answers that assuage their fears, well, it is no surprise these so-called learned scholars have come to fear Argonians and their strange trees.\nThose in our circle would add that these trees are sentient, and it may be that they are the ones that grew the lizard folk. I had hoped to prove or disprove this by careful study of the birth cycle of the &lt;a href=\"Saxhleel\"&gt;Saxhleel&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, as you know, every answer was another question. I can only say with certainty that every interview I have been able to conduct about this topic resulted in the conclusion that the Saxhleel cannot fathom the idea of one coming before the other. I will not digress into further discussion about the way this fascinating culture views linear events, as you have asked me not to do so every time I write.\nBut I can tell you this, old friend, the Hist are not simply trees, regardless of sentience. It is true that the trees are impressive and demand a certain respect when you stand beneath them, but I have always found the roots most fascinating. If only I could properly describe the things I have seen, Brother Septimius. Beneath the swamp the roots grow deep and spread so wide it is impossible to know which tree they originated from. In a way, I believe, the roots are the marsh. The roots hold it all together, and they determine when it changes.\nI know we have spoken of this before, and you posited that the chaotic nature of the marsh is simply a result of a type of magic similar to what we have seen from the Elves of Valenwood. I cannot refute the claim and I see the logic in it, but I do not believe it to be true.\nI have seen skilled trackers foiled by this land on a whim. I cannot say I have ever seen it move, but I have picked up a good enough sense of navigation in my time to know when I am being led in circles. And that is without going into more questionable theories of relative space. I believe like the Saxhleel change to accommodate their environment, the roots change Black Marsh in a way that it sees most fit.\nI tell you, Brother Septimius, the province of Black Marsh has never once been close to conquered. The borders can barely even be considered Argonia. The maps cannot be correct. The roots grow too deep and too wide for us to know the true Argonia.\nAll of academia has been too focused on the sap. Is it not the Wood Elves I just wrote of who call themselves the Tree-Sap People?\nThe Saxhleel are the People of the Root, and that is where I will find the answer to your most challenging mystery.\nIt will have to wait until I return. I will see you soon and we will get you on the path to healing.\nWith love,\nJunia Severa"}

If it weren't blasphemous, I might even say that the world has been slowly going sane. I can almost feel in my bones a chilling presence approaching, like a devouring emptiness. That does not bode well, but I trust in my Lord's power to keep our spirits well nourished from his bounteous showers of inspiration.\nOur child continues to destroy those pesky adventurers who come seeking treasure and glory.\nI have been sojourning here in Passwall, tutoring &lt;a href=\"Nanette%20Don\"&gt;Nanette Don&lt;/a&gt; as an apprentice. She is one of the hopefuls that I believe will bloom soon. In the meanwhile, I can visit our child -- I go see him every night around midnight, when the world is quiet. When it belongs to memory and imagination. He is strong and powerful like his father. Would that you visited us some time. It's almost cruel, the way you keep aloof from me. Sometimes I can't even bear to look at him because I can remember when we created him. Your glistening body in the pool. Lovingly blending the components of flesh that would become our child -- and afterward you tortured me in your sweet embrace. But now when I visit him I can't help but weep like a little girl. I know how unlike me it seems... I just can't help it. To make matters worse, it seems my tears burn my poor creature. It agitates that &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; soul bound in his body threatening to sever the warding magic weaved into him. I didn't realize how badly that soul would seek release from the shell I grew in my gardens. But the flesh is pure. Perfect! Perhaps it is my own tears that hold the imperfection...\nBut I shouldn't be bothering you with these petty concerns. Our child, your &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, stands guard over the Gates of Madness, mighty and powerful. No harm shall come to him.\nYours truly and forever,\nRelmyna"}

We find ourselves with little gold to our name. As you well know, gold must be spent to acquire more gold.

Even so, it's all we've got.\nAccording to Stegryr, &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Giant\"&gt;Sea Giant&lt;/a&gt;s are related to the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt; we find on the mainland, but smarter. He compared the relationship to himself and his touched cousin, Tornir. That falls in line with Ingfir's testimony. He swears he heard one of them talk. Not just the half-giants, mind. He said one of the largest of them yelled something in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;ic. If that's true, it turns what we know of Giants completely on its head. I've heard tales of ancient giants, and &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; titans, and such, but I just thought they were stories. For all Stegryr's insistence, he admitted he'd never actually seen one before now. Take that for what it's worth.\nIndeed, all the sailors admitted they'd never seen a Sea Giant. \"Anyone who sees one doesn't survive to tell the tale,\" they say. Only one of them claims to have seen a Sea Giant before now: Thengret. She's the grayest of them\u2014at least 80 years-old, I wager. She grew up in a fishing village just west of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, and her grandmother told her that Sea Giants raid the coast when \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; grows frigid as a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;'s heart, &lt;a href=\"Horker%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horkers&lt;/a&gt; freeze to death on the rocks, and &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; weep from the bitter cold.\" Well, we suffered such a winter in &lt;a href=\"2E%20532\"&gt;2E 532&lt;/a&gt;, and standing on the coast in a frosty gale, she saw one of their longships gliding through the snow and sleet. That's it. That's the story.\nI don't have to tell you that we've seen mild winters these last few years. Milder than some, anyway. So, Thengret's story just doesn't make sense\u2014until, of course, you add these &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; to it. We all know the stories about &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falgravn\"&gt;Falgravn&lt;/a&gt;; how he can twist people's minds and sink ships in frothing gyres of blood. Maybe he offered the Giants something, or bent their will to his. Either way, it's an alliance no one could have seen coming. I pray it doesn't reach the mainland. I don't know if the people of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; are strong enough to drive it back.\n&lt;a href=\"Authors%23Thunvilde\"&gt;Thunvilde&lt;/a&gt;"}

If I can aid in the efforts against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Shadows That We Hate&lt;/a&gt;, would that earn me a position at the Cathedral? There's that little &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; woman I mentioned in my last two letters. She has opened up to me about topics that would make your blood run cold, your Excellence. Perhaps I can use some of what she confided in me to weaken the Shadows and perhaps even throw them into some confusion. Yes, I'll make sure that the next time we speak, I strongly suggest a course of action that will separate her from her pack. I may even have a use for those &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Dawn\"&gt;Silver Dawn&lt;/a&gt; fanatics.\nI await the good news that you have finally found a place for me in the Cathedral.\nYour servant in Akatosh,\nChanter Nemus"}

My life, however, has not been given in vain, for I have vouchsafed you one small hope in all this tide of despair. The Great Star Galley, wrought by my own hand, still stands ready for your service. It will transport you to the High Halls and Librarium of the College.\nFeigning vile possession and fellowship with the Enemy, I have contrived to conceal it from them, by dismantling my ingenious Opening Mechanism, and hiding away the five cogs upon which its workings depend. I leave one cog here for you, the others I have cunningly secreted. Assemble the mechanism, and you shall gain entry to the Star Galley Crib.\nBeware the one that is named Methats.\nHe alone, I fear, suspects my ruse and might discover the workings.\nOne more criterion must be fulfilled before the Star Galley can convey you to the Colleges. Despite my many exertions upon the issue, the Galley requires the full puissance of all five anchors to pierce the mana streams and win free of its moorings.\nOne such anchor is here in my quarters. If but one anchor is not conjoined, the Galley will lack the power to depart this space.\nNow listen and pay heed. If you would achieve this undertaking and drive the dark ones from our Emperor's sovereign estate, seek out my remains. There you shall find the Typos Sophia, that shields any who possess it from the Taking into puppetry that is Possession. If you find me yet alive by some miracle, it shall be yours for your great purpose.\nIn Finis, when addressing the burial of those souls fallen here, I pray you remember their valour and their service in the name of Empire and forever hold high the name of Battlemage."}

Still, I suppose I had many years to grow accustomed to your former one; you must excuse me if it takes a few more to feel a similar familiarity with Alchemy.\nI\u2019m sure that you wish to hear all about my new position. As expected, there\u2019s little time to rest now that I\u2019m officially assistant to the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarch\"&gt;Sapiarch&lt;/a&gt; of Artifice. I\u2019m asked to record lectures, organize notes, so on and so forth. I won\u2019t bore you with the details, but suffice to say I\u2019ve found little difficulty with my assigned tasks.\nHowever, I will admit that I often find myself struggling to keep up with my new colleagues. I had always thought myself intelligent and well read, but now realize just how woefully ignorant I truly am. And whenever I\u2019m asked to voice an opinion, it\u2019s as if my tongue suddenly turns to lead and I\u2019m unable to utter a coherent thought. And to think that I once scoffed at anyone who was unable to keep up with my intellect. It is rather humbling, to say the least.\nMore than ever do I wish that I possessed even an ounce of your natural wit and grace. It seems you stole every bit of Mother\u2019s charm when we were born, and I was only left with Father\u2019s sullen disposition. Whereas you can dazzle crowds, I find myself barely able to stand out amongst my own peers. Normally I\u2019d hole myself in my room and simply attend to my studies, but there is no denying that a certain social etiquette must be maintained if I wish to advance beyond a mere assistant. In truth, any advice you may have on the matter would be most welcomed.\nI\u2019m rambling. You always make me ramble, even when you\u2019re not around. How do you manage it?\nNow, despite sounding like a petulant child, I do want to know how you\u2019re faring over in &lt;a href=\"Rellenthil\"&gt;Rellenthil&lt;/a&gt;. And this time I want the entire truth of it. No more secrets between sisters, agreed? If I\u2019m to bare my soul to you, I expect the same treatment in return.\nYours Always,\n&lt;a href=\"Rinyde\"&gt;Rinyde&lt;/a&gt;\nDearest Rinyde,\nMy heart aches to think of you alone in that stuffy college, surrounded by dullards who do not see you for the shining beacon of loveliness that you are. If you find yourself unnoticed, it is simply because your colleagues have their heads too firmly lodged in their rear-ends.\nMy advice? Continue to be your delightful self. If there\u2019s anyone of worth among your peers, they\u2019ll eventually see that a diamond shines among mere glass baubles. And if you do find yourself fed up with such company, as I\u2019m sure I would, make your way to Rellenthil for an evening of theater to lift your spirits. I\u2019ll always be ready with a bottle of wine and a willing ear.\nEverything is going splendidly here in the &lt;a href=\"Manor%20of%20Masques%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Manor of Masques&lt;/a&gt;. I\u2019ve been selected as the leading lady of our next production, an entirely original piece inspired by certain current events that have befallen our homeland.

Suffice to say, I do strike a lovely figure in black.\nThere is also something I\u2019d like to confess. Your letter spoke of my many talents: my wit, my charm, my ability to stand out amongst a crowd. And while I do so love your words of admiration, I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t quite fit upon your pedestal.\nI\u2019ve never had your courage. While you speak your mind with conviction and strength, I hide behind clever words. I always have. I played whatever part best suited my audience, whether that was an obedient son, a mighty mage, a studious scholar. And when I found those roles too heavy a burden to bare all I could do was run. I didn\u2019t have the courage to tell you how I truly felt, to face you when I most needed to.\nThat\u2019s your strength, Rinyde. Even if others do not wish to hear it you\u2019ll say what matters most. If you desire my wit, then I humbly request an ounce of your resolve. I believe that such an exchange would be more than fair.\nLovingly Yours,\nAlchemy\nDear Alchemy,\nI now know to read your letters in private, for your latest correspondence had me blubbering like a babe. I was luckily able to excuse myself from the \u2019s office before the tears started to fall, but still. Lesson learned.\nYou speak of my courage and conviction, but the truth is that it doesn\u2019t take much of either to do what everyone expects of you. I was happy to follow our family\u2019s laid path, thinking only where my next footstep should land. Meanwhile you were looking up at the sky, thinking of what you could be, what you wished to be. And my eyes were so firmly locked forward that I never noticed that your gaze had wandered.\nYou\u2019re far braver than I could ever hope to be. You left everything behind, faced so much hardship, worked so hard in order to start your new life. If one of us must be admired, let it be my brave sister who defied every design laid upon her to be true to herself.\nAnd here I was, plotting to take you away from all of it. I was horribly selfish, Alchemy. I\u2019m so sorry. I told myself that I was doing what was best for you, for all of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, but that wasn\u2019t true at all. I was only thinking of myself. How nervous I was to become a \u2019s apprentice, how much I wanted you by my side. And all along you were the one suffering most.\nYet you forgave me, and clasped me in your arms, and said you still loved me. And I will always be grateful for that, for I now realize more than ever that I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of losing you. Truly losing you, not just your presence by my side but the love in your heart. It may take many more letters and many more years to make up for what I\u2019ve done, but let me start by saying that I\u2019m proud to be your sister and I will always love you.\nOh, and before I forget! While I would love to attend your performance, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to make it. The don\u2019t tend to approve of time away for new apprentices. You\u2019ll have to let me know how it goes.\nYours Forever,\nRinyde\nSweetest Rinyde,\nFor once, I don\u2019t quite know what to say. I may be able to make you ramble and cry, but only you can make this actress at a loss for words. A rare gift.\nI\u2019ll admit, I was resentful of the future you saw for us. Distrustful that you would ever truly accept me. But you\u2019ve shown me nothing but love since I\u2019ve opened my heart to you, and so it\u2019s time for such feelings to come to a close. Let us not dwell on the past, dear sister. Your acceptance of who I am now means more to me than anything. And allow me to echo your sentiment; whatever you do, whoever you shall become, I will always be there for you. Short of marrying a &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;.\nI thought I would always be an outcast, but reconnecting with you has given me hope that needn\u2019t be the case. One day I shall return to our family home. Not tomorrow perhaps, but someday. Our parents may not be as readily accepting as you were, but I wish to tell the entire truth of it, just as I told you. And I hope when that day comes that you will be by my side.\nBesides, you may not always want to follow in our family\u2019s laid path. Perhaps one day you\u2019ll even wish to join me in the House of Reveries. And while it\u2019s true you could not act if the fate of Summerset depended on it, worry not. I have a feeling you\u2019d make for an amazing stagehand.\nSpeaking of my lovely troupe, I\u2019ve thought long and hard about your inability to attend our latest production. As that obviously won\u2019t do, I\u2019ve made inquiries about holding an exclusive showing within the College of . After all, the school is quite prominent in our story\u2019s plot, and I\u2019m sure such a performance would do wonders for morale after that horrible attack. Don\u2019t you agree?\nWith All the Love in My Heart,\nAlchemy\nP.S. I\u2019ve caught word of our &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mutual friend&lt;/a&gt;. It appears they\u2019ve been off slaying &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, if the rumours are to be believed! Really, I\u2019m not sure how they get themselves caught up in such adventures. Perhaps they\u2019ll visit soon and regale me with the tale."}

All hell's broken loose here, and the gate home's blocked with some sort of damn thing which hurts to touch. A lot.\nHave a look around, see if you can find anyone alive to talk to. I'm going to try to get a disguise and get out in the confusion.\nI'm trying to remember what the instructor always said - scout out the land, eliminate your threats and gather resources. Or search, slaughter and steal for short.\nSee if you can keep up.\nWe're getting a real big test, looks like!\nLetter 2 For The Battlespire Hero.\nWe are heartened by your success in &lt;a href=\"Great%20Hunt\"&gt;the Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeek &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Imago\"&gt;Lord Imago&lt;/a&gt; within his castle in the far north of &lt;a href=\"Havok%20Wellhead\"&gt;Havok Wellhead&lt;/a&gt;. He knows of your coming. But he may place obstacles in your path to test your merit and sincerity.\nThe lands of &lt;a href=\"Faydra\"&gt;Faydra&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shardai%20Clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; lie to the west. The lands of &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt;'s clan lie to the east. These places are not open to the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, and are a mystery to us. However, it may be that a cunning raider like yourself with find somethings of use there.\nTo leave this realm you must enter the gate within Imago's castle. There are three keys to this gate. One I know is in the keeping of Lord Imago. The other two keys are, I presume, in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s favorites, Faydra and Xivilai. This gate will bear you to the &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Lodge%20of%20Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Hunting Lodge of Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, where your friend is held.\nWe wish we could do more to help you. The matter rests now with you, and with the Tides of Fate.\nLetter 3 For The Battlespire Hero.\nI've heard that one of the &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s is still alive - &lt;a href=\"Clarentavious\"&gt;Clarentavious&lt;/a&gt;, I think. I haven't seen him, but then, I haven't had time to look for any secret doors or anything. They wanted him because of some machine or other that's broken.\nOh, and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Methats\"&gt;Methats&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the one who's being left in charge, if you're interested.\nStay close, you might need me!\nLetter 4 For The Battlespire Hero.\nI've found another of those damn things like the ones which are blocking the Weir Gate - and a little &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; went straight by it! I think he's got some sort of special charm or something that lets him through. I sure can't get past.\nOh, and here's another hint for you - there's a big gem thing just near here - heals you right up! Boy, was I glad to find it!\nLetter 5 For The Battlespire Hero.\nGlad you could make it.\nbad news -\n1. wizards &amp; guards dead. No prisoners I could find.\n2. Daedra everywhere. Little long-ears - weak, but sneaky pack fighters. Big eyeless things with long arms - stupid and very tough.\n3. &lt;a href=\"Paxti%20Bittor\"&gt;Paxti Bittor&lt;/a&gt; is the traitor. Daedra may have some codes and keywords, but there're plenty of rooms and passages I can't get into.\n4. &lt;a href=\"Teleport\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt;s don't work. Maybe mana locks, keywords? Look around - wizards are sloppy with security.\n5. Floating symbols are &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; sigils, and deadly! Weir gate is sealed by a REAL nasty one. Daedra wear amulets marked with same symbols. Tried to pass symbols wearing right amulets, but some work, some don't - can't figure pattern.\nGood news -\n1. I'm sticking close to a boss daedra named &lt;a href=\"Sumeer%20Jabran\"&gt;Sumeer&lt;/a&gt;. Stole a cloak, hood, &amp; amulet from a careless bodyguard. Sumeer has a mass teleportation artifact, I think. I wear the amulet, and go when he goes.\n2. My Plan A: stay close to Sumeer and improvise.\n3. My Plan B: Find an amulet with the same symbol as the one blocking the weir gate to get me back through the gate, or find something or someone else to get me through. Elseways we will never see &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; again.\n4. My Plan C: Sneak until I'm discovered, then take as many with me as I can.\n5. Don't think they know I'm here.\n6. Command and security are sloppy. Politics?\n7. Left you a pair of healing potions in this scroll. Toast my health when you quaff them.\nSuggestions - \n1. The door to the teleportal off the north corridor near the tiger rug has some sort of password protection on it. Get it working. It leads upsection to &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt; libraries, barracks, armories, and such. DON'T COUNT ON ME to get this open. I'm riding the boss daedra's coattails.\n2. Find out how daedra got here. Bittor, the traitor, was master of teleportation and &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;gates; that's the likely route.\n3. Search for codes and keys and clues and weapons. I don't think the daedra got them all by a long shot. I couldn't search the battlemages or guards without drawing attention to myself, but some of them may have had time to leave something for posterity. And this is the Battlespire, for gods sakes. Who knows what stuff they have around here?\n4. Stay with me, pal. Even if something happens to me, look for what's left. I'll make sure I pass on anything I can.\nStay with me.\nLetter 6 For The Battlespire Hero.\nSo far, so good.\nI'm with a group of Daedra with cloaks and hoods. Still careless, don't seem to expect trouble, but this disguise thing is too risky. When I get a chance, I'll slip off and follow under spell concealments.\nThis place is crawling with spooks and bones. They call this place the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt;. The chief -- heard one call him \"Lord Something-or-Other &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20Moath\"&gt;Moath&lt;/a&gt;\" -- sent troops out to scout. The report is simple: DO NOT FOOL WITH THE &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;WRAITHS&lt;/a&gt;! They cannot be killed or destroyed. Period. Sounds like a good policy. These daedra troops look pretty tough, but they aren't making a dent in the wraith things. So stay clear of them.\nOur next stop is someplace called &lt;a href=\"Shade%20Perilous\"&gt;Shade Perilous&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure after that. A couple of my Daedra companions had little accidents; I snatched their plunder. When I get a chance, I'll sort it out. Anything extra or dangerous I'll dump along the way for you. I'm leaving you two Spell Restoratives here; I got plenty extra. Keep your eyes out, and watch yourself.\nLetter 7 For The Battlespire Hero.\nSo much for the disguise. One of the big ones caught me sneaking around, and ripped into me. I knocked him through his hat, but he mussed my garments in a most thorough fashion. I think they may be on the lookout now. Be careful.\nI'm depending on silent feet and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;shadow spells&lt;/a&gt; now. You'll need two amulets to get past the warding sigils. I left an extra one here on the dock. I found the gate, many rooms on, past a graveyard, but don't know how the gate works. I'll hang around and slip through with the next courier. If I can leave the gate open, you're golden. If not, you're on your own. Maybe there's an inscription or manual hidden around somewhere.\nStay AWAY from the wraiths. I can't even scratch one. The big Daedra are tough, but dumb - either they don't know spells, or can't cast them worth a damn.\nNext is a place called Shade Perilous. It's a Daedra stronghold, not one of the Dagon holds, but a domain. Makes no sense to me - Dagon and are supposed to hate each other - but we'll see soon enough.\nKeep a'coming.\nLetter 8 For The Battlespire Hero.\nThey're on to me. I'm on the run.\nI'm low on juice, and not in the best of health. I just began to realize I might not make it.\nNo matter what happens, I'll go out with a lot of noise and fuss. If I have to make a sacrifice, just do me one last favor, and make sure the gesture isn't wasted. Sounds gloomy, but I need to say it.\nI hope we can look back on this someday as our greatest adventure. And if not, then drink a flowing glass at each occasion in remembrance of me.\nLetter 9 For The Battlespire Hero.\nOverheard this password, but no idea what it means, or who needs it.\nThe Gerent of Dagon Rules Here\nLetter 10 For The Battlespire Hero.\nThought this might come in handy."}

Seek their treasures: the Longbow of Heaven's Hail, the Boots of Peace, the Gauntlets of the Poor, and the Helmet of the Light Within. The Longbow casts arrows and spells with deadly accuracy. The Boots, once worn by a famed mortal warrior who had renounced the use of weapons, confer great skill in unarmed combat and feats of physical daring.

The Amulets of Entry for these Sigils are carried by Dagon's greatest lieutenants. They are terrible in skill and power, and protected from many weapons and magics -- but you need these amulets to approach Dagon.\nDo not hope for aid from us in this place.

She burned, braised, roasted and seared the food.\nWhen Qijne sees that a complete catfish is being sent to Lord Oroy, she inquires why they decided to do such a thing. They had cooked that fish for Oroy Mansion workers hundred of times before, but it would be too coarse for the lord's palate. Anna\u00efg explains her that she hoped it would surprise Oroy: when the lord touched it, the fish would release a series of odors viandic; the fish would liquefy and mingle with the void and fire salts there around the fish, which would then release their essences. The fish would be followed by a cold broth of tadpole\nbones garnished with live frog eggs. Finally, the white froth of Terriswort would cause his palate to vividly recall each aroma and taste\u2014but in reverse order. Qijne thought that Anna\u00efg's metagastrologics were just tricks and stunts, but she allowed her to practice them as long as she pleased Lord Oroy."}

They are centrally located in &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, laying upon the mountains between &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; but are common in other locations in Tamriel.\nOrsimer are of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; blood, but this heritage is either not recognized or is forgotten by many in Tamriel. According to some sources, \"Orsimer\" is the \"proper racial naming,\" whereas others state that their name means \"Orc,\" and others state that the closest to the translation of their name is \"Pariah Folk.\" Orcish life span is similar to that of humans.\nOrsinium.\nOrsinium, also called Nova Orsinium, is an Orcish city province located within &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. While technically being under the sovereignty of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Orsinium has in the past not been readily accepted by the other provinces of Tamriel. This changed when, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; sought to improve relationships between the Empire and Orsinium through diplomacy, increased trade, and confederacy. Orsinium was located inside the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; in the west of Tamriel, and, as such, Orcs co-inhabited the region alongside Bretons. However, the relationship between the Orcs and the Bretons would prove troublesome. Early in the 4th Era Orsinium was sacked for the second time (the exact date or by whom it was sacked is unknown). Unlike before, Orsinium was not rebuilt in the Wrothgarian mountains like the two previous incarnations of the Orc Kingdom, but re-established in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; mountains in between &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nWith skin tones ranging from light green to dark brown, a heavily muscular frame, and considerable stature the Orsimer stand apart amongst Mer and Men. They also are the only race to display tusks. Born without the magical affinity of their Mer cousins, and following in the footsteps of their revered Trinimac, the Orcs have developed a strong warrior culture that makes them highly valuable in hand-to-hand combat. They often excel as adventurers and legionnaires in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. This is not to say that they cannot wield magic, however. Certain Orsimer, such as &lt;a href=\"Urag%20gro-Shub\"&gt;Urag gro-Shub&lt;/a&gt;, have gone on to be successful mages, finding employment at such places as the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn the middle of the Merethic Era, a group of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; attempted to halt the movement of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; devoured Trinimac, corrupting his body and spirit. From the remains of Trinimac emerged the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result his followers, later known as the Orsimer, or \"Pariah Folk,\" were also changed, becoming Orcs. The early Orcish people followed a tribal and independent lifestyle. Instead of claiming one area, they would instead settle in multiple provinces that suited their lives and needs, forming small, tightly knit villages. Many of these provinces were located in modern Skyrim and High Rock.\nEventually, the Orc chieftain &lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. At first, it was merely a small collection of huts, but as word spread to the other Orcs of Tamriel about this rising civilization high in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, it soon grew to house more permanent structures. In its early stages, the other races of Tamriel deemed it a place ruled by savage law which raided its neighbors along the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. It was thought by the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; to be little more than a desolate mountain region where the Orcs scratched out a meager living off of the rocks and secretly coveted the lands and the settled livelihood of their valley-bound neighbors. Orcish historians, however, claim that this is simply Breton superstition and exaggeration. They claim Orsinium was always a peaceful land whose inhabitants made their way by simple agriculture and commerce.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, the Orsimer became little more than pests and monsters in the view of the average Tamrielic citizen, as they had no province to call their own. Many Orcs attempted to set-up new city provinces, but with no luck. These dwellings were always destroyed before they could be properly established.\nHowever, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, an Orc visionary named &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; acquired the site of the former civilization of Orsinium and began reconstructing a new city for the Orsimer of Tamriel. As it grew, many believed it would succumb to the same fate as its predecessors. Gortwog, though, proved to be a superb politician and diplomat and managed to make negotiations with Orsinium's neighbors, which saw Orsinium prosper. He negotiated with &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; in trade and social negotiations and, for the first time, the Orcs were serious political players among the other races. The Orsimer have relatively strong historical ties with the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons for this are unclear, yet the relationship most likely originated because the races are cohabiting the same region.\nReligion and culture.\nMost Orcs hold &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; as their chief deity, as he is believed to be involved in the creation of the race. As such, most Orcs uphold the \"&lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;,\" which is a religious doctrine as well as a code of law used in the Orc strongholds. Orcs like to announce great events by erecting symbolic totems. Many Orsimer tribes that live in Valenwood are referred to as Wood Orcs, while an isolated group in the Dragontail are referred to as Iron Orcs. Orcish tradition dictates for weddings to be done at midnight. Besides being renowned for their smithing skills, Orcs are also known to make delicate and beautiful arts. Vosh ball is a sport going back to the earliest days of the Orsimer people. The earliest forms of vosh ball utilized a heavy sphere made of wood or metal that was about the size of an Orc's head. Orcs also celebrate an event known as Malacath's vengeance day.\nThe Orsimer worship the Daedric Lord &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; as their main deity. Orsinium's leader, Gortwog, claimed that Malacath is a fake, and set up a priesthood dedicated to the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, who was widely believed to have been destroyed, and his remnants reanimated to form Malacath. Gortwog's belief that Trinimac still lives as a separate entity from Malacath became the official view taken by the majority of the leading priests in Orsinium. A handful of Orcs within and the vast majority of Orcs outside of Orsinium viewed Gortwog's beliefs as heresy.\nStrongholds in Skyrim.\nOrc Strongholds are scattered throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The Orcs have lived in Skyrim for centuries in tribal communities based around Strongholds. Strongholds are governed by a rigid class system. Every Orc has a specific job and is obligated to perform it. Every man, woman, and child in the fort is also trained from birth to defend it. The Strongholds are led by a chief, who killed the previous chief to prove his strength. Only the chiefs are allowed to have wives, and due to this, they often have several. This method is to ensure that the strongest Orc becomes chief, contributing his genes to the next generation of Orcs who, in theory, should be stronger than the last. Orcs in strongholds follow their own law called the &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. The will of Malacath is clarified by the stronghold's resident wise woman. The rules of the Code are simple: do not kill, do not steal, and do not attack people without reason. They do not have jails; instead, offenders are forced to pay a \"blood price,\" in which the criminal bleeds until the victim is satisfied. In cases where the victim was murdered, the chief is consulted to convey an appropriate sentence.\nIndividuals that are not Orcs are normally viewed as untrustworthy and are turned away from the strongholds. However, it is possible for an outsider to gain entrance by becoming \"blood kin.\" This is done by performing a specific task to gain the trust of the Stronghold. This task is normally very dangerous.\nCrimes committed in a stronghold are not under the jurisdiction of the province's &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;, but of the tribal orcs.\nOrc strongholds are well defended and are often situated around deposits of mineral wealth. Each one contains the infrastructure to support many families, surrounded by walls designed to repel anything but the strongest martial force. destroyed strongholds often return within a generation of their destruction.\nLanguage.\nAncient Orsimer language.\nThe following books are found in .\nThe titular Torug appears to be one Torug gro-Igron, the founder of the first Orsinium. He rode a special polar bear and built a big shrine on top of the highest Wrothgarian mountain.\nTranslations by Kharsthun, a character affiliated with the House of Orsimer Glories.\nNumbering.\nNumbers in Ancient Orsimer language:\nPersonality.\nOrcs are known to be exceptional warriors similar to &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, although their culture is sometimes thought of as overly bestial. Despite their barbaric, tribal nature, there is much to admire in their fierce tribal loyalties and generous equality of rank and respect among the sexes. Their impressive warrior qualities stem from their sets of heavy Orcish armors and racial ability to go into a &lt;a href=\"berserk\"&gt;berserk&lt;/a&gt; rage, inflicting major damage while caring little for defense.\nTraditionally, all Orsimer mothers would teach their child how to smith from a young age. If an Orc chieftain has a second wife, she is called the \"Forge-wife,\" in honor of this.\nSome orcs use a scale for weighing out blood price amounts, with different gold weights labeled \"chief, wife, warrior\". Other orcs keep a record of all of the grievances and insults their family has suffered, with dates, specifics, and planned responses.\nIf an Orc leaves the province of Orsinium or Stronghold they are from, their surname will be the Stronghold/province they are from, prefixed with gra- (female) or gro- (male), for example, &lt;a href=\"Moth%20gro-Bagol\"&gt;Moth gro-Bagol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ghorza%20gra-Bagol\"&gt;Ghorza gra-Bagol&lt;/a&gt; (both from the same province).\nRelations with other races.\nThe translation of Orsimer is \"Pariah Folk,\" as they are considered the social outcasts of the Tamrielic races. Due to this, many other Tamrielic cultures have scorned the Orcs, and treated them as no more than callous brutes. Their only redeeming quality in the eyes of the public over the past few eras has been their venerable combat skills when serving in the Imperial Legion.\nSome Mer do not consider Orcs to be their kin."}

Possessing much physical prowess, Orcs prefer to wield large two-handed . While these &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; swing very slowly and are quite heavy in weight, they are effective for staggering opponents, leaving them susceptible to additional blows. Using two-handed weapons while in &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; is inadvisable, because Orcs are extremely vulnerable while in this stage; one hit from an enemy causes significant damage and dodging incoming blows is unlikely due to the Orc's stunted &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;agility&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysique.\nThe innate &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; bonuses attributed to both male and female Orcs increases their &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;encumbrance&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to wield and carry heavier weapons and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. Widely viewed as \"unattractive\" or even \"frightening\" to others, Orcs suffer from low &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;trading&lt;/a&gt; and intelligence gathering difficult for them. To offset their abundant physical skill, Orcs make inefficient &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; and thus have reduced &lt;a href=\"Intelligence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;.\nClasses and birthsigns.\nExcelling at &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blunt\"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;, the Orc functions well as a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;. Orcish &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Knights&lt;/a&gt; do well in combat, but their &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; skills suffer due to the Orc's low Personality &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt;. Praying at a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Shrine of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, daily, can recoup the loss. Orcs could also make effective &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt;; their lack of proficiency in &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; can be offset by selecting &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;The Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady\"&gt;The Lady&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Lord\"&gt;The Lord&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsigns&lt;/a&gt;, however. &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt; sign may also be considered as a more natural fit for the Orc, as it not only increases the character's magicka reserves, but allows for the Orc to absorb and resist enemy spells as well. The only downside would be the lack of natural magic regeneration. Praying to &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wayshrine%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; can help both Knight and Crusader Orcs overcome their magical deficiencies. Most popular for Orcs is &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt; birthsign. It helps boost their &lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; for maximum starting &lt;a href=\"Fatigue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are possibly a variant of elves or &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;. Other sources state they are &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;. Following in the footsteps of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, Orcs have consistently held a standard as a race as some of Tamriel's greatest warriors and smiths.\nStrongholds.\nMost orcs are found in &lt;a href=\"Orc%20Strongholds\"&gt;strongholds&lt;/a&gt; throughout Skyrim, though some are seen in major cities such as &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may enter, but cannot have conversation with the Orcs inside. Once you are near an Orcish Stronghold, a guard will tell you to stay away. You are allowed to enter the stronghold, but the Orcs dislike it, thus making conversation impossible until you become \"Blood-Kin\" by completing the quest the guard gives you. This quest varies per Stronghold. If the Dragonborn is an Orc, they will be accepted and may enter and engage in conversations without the need for prerequisite quests, though they will still treat the Dragonborn as an \"outlander.\" However, if you are an Orc, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, then there will be a prerequisite quest. Orc strongholds tend to have a &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;blacksmith tools&lt;/a&gt;, which are usable regardless of whether the associated quest has been completed.\nHeight.\nThe Orsimer (Orcs) are the second tallest playable race in , standing slightly shorter than &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; (High Elves), at a scale of 1.0450.\nPopular usage and unique gameplay.\n\"No one bests an Orc\" is the saying when Orcs fight their enemies and this is a justified claim. Orcs excel above and beyond in warrior roles. Their natural abilities fall under the warrior banner with the exception to &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, but this isn't outside of the realm of the warrior and is a trait commonly used by the wives of chieftains. With proper training this can easily give any Orc player character a needed boost in the game. The variety and extent of their skill bonuses make Orcs arguably the best pure warriors in the game. Two popular game play roles are as Tank or Blademaster, obviously focusing on use of &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; and respectively on shields and dual wielding over an Archer, Assassin or Mage-type role. Tie this into their racial Berserker Rage, and a tidy warrior is complete.\nIt is interesting to note that Orcs are the warriors of the Mer bloodlines. They alone excel under the warrior constellation focusing more on brute strength over cunning, speed and magic like the rest of the Mer. Interestingly enough, an Orsimer is head of the Arcanaeum at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "1489", "revid": "26893431", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1489", "title": "Orsinium", "text": "Orsinium (\"&lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; for Orc-Town\"), also called Nova Orsinium, is an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; city-state located within &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. It was featured prominently in and as the Orcish capital city. While technically being under the sovereignty of the Empire, Orsinium has in the past not been readily accepted by the other provinces of Tamriel. However, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; sought to improve relationships between the Empire and Orsinium through diplomacy, increased trade, and confederacy, prior to its destruction. Orsinium has usually been located inside the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, in the western part of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and as such Orcs co-inhabit the region alongside &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;. The current Orsinium lies upon the mountains between &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst Orsinium.\nThe very First Orsinium, sometimes known as \"Torug's Folly\", was founded by Orc chieftain &lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt;, after Warlord &lt;a href=\"Thulgeg\"&gt;Thulgeg&lt;/a&gt; led a great emigration of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20874\"&gt;1E 874&lt;/a&gt;. A number of the settlers were beastmen set free by the rulers of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and permitted to settle lands north of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. At first, it was just a small collection of huts, then a camp and a village before becoming a sprawling town. Forge-wife &lt;a href=\"Mortuga\"&gt;Mortuga&lt;/a&gt;, first and greatest of King Torug's many wives, sought out a master mason to build a stone wall around the city and define its borders, choosing &lt;a href=\"Kuthbarg%20the%20Steady\"&gt;Kuthbarg the Steady&lt;/a&gt; who raised strong walls around Orsinium. As word spread to the other Orcs of Tamriel about this rising civilization high in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; it soon grew to house more permanent structures.\nIn its early stages, the other races of Tamriel deemed it a place ruled by savage law which &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;raided&lt;/a&gt; its neighbors along the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. It was thought by the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; to be little more than a desolate mountain region where Orcs scratched a meager living off rocks and secretly coveted the lands and the settled livelihood of their valley-bound neighbors. Orc historians however, claim this is simply Breton superstition and exaggeration. They claim Orsinium was always a peaceful land whose inhabitants made their way by simple agriculture and commerce. In truth however, the matter boils down to the roles of the Orsimer clans residing in the city. &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;Clan Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; committed the raids in honor of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Igron\"&gt;Clan Igron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Golkarr\"&gt;King Golkarr&lt;/a&gt;. The Orcish claim is also partially true, as clans &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Clan\"&gt;Shatul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tumnosh%20Clan\"&gt;Tumnosh&lt;/a&gt; provided the city's economy with farming and blacksmithing, respectively.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, declared war on Orsinium in response to the Bjoulsae Raids. This event became known as the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted for thirty years. The Orc clans of the city united and fought back against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; invaders vigorously, and the three gates of the city designed by Torug also made it harder for the invading armies to break into the city. The gate of Smelter fell in &lt;a href=\"1E%20960\"&gt;1E 960&lt;/a&gt;, ten years into the invasion. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20970\"&gt;1E 970&lt;/a&gt;, Diagnan leader &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; and Orcish hero &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt; had a duel, though were both assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt;. The distraction caused by this event allowed the invaders to break through the gate of Hammer. The invasion came to an end in &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, when the gate of Temper fell and King Golkarr was killed.\nWith no province to call their own, the Orsimer became little more than pests and monsters in the view of the average Tamrielic citizen. The Orcs attempted to establish at least two new Orsiniums, but they were always destroyed before they could become sustainable settlements. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of the first Orsinium still remain. The inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; refer to it as \"\"&lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;Old Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nSecond Orsinium.\nFollowing the city's destruction, the land briefly became a territory of &lt;a href=\"the%20Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;the Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, though this ended with the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Savirien%20Chorak\"&gt;Savirien Chorak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the lands were later sacked by Baron Fulvert Guimard in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;, and at some point &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; later went under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Emeric\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; sent emissaries to the Wrothgarian Mountains with the offer that if they attacked the city of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; and provided aid to annihilate &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, the lands of Wrothgar would once again be theirs. They later did so under the command of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;, who later became the king of Orsinium, and the Orcish representative of the Daggerfall Covenant.\nThe Second Orsinium existed during the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, where it was undergoing construction. The city was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, who united it with the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Kurog did not control the entirety of Wrothgar, and sought to unite the Orc clans under one faction. This did not prove easy, as Kurog's support for the worship of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; did not sit well with the other chieftains. Kurog later invited many of the Orcish chiefs to a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt;, though it was revealed that this was in fact a trap, and Kurog attempted to assassinate the chiefs. His plans were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Bazrag%20gro-Fharun\"&gt;Bazrag gro-Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and Kurog was later slain by the Vestige in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;. Bazrag then held a funeral for Kurog on the city's Castle Overlook, saying that Kurog was influenced by &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;his mother&lt;/a&gt; to take such dire actions. After pressure from the Orc community, Bazrag took the title of the &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; of Orsinium. After these events, Orsinium's alliance with the Daggerfall Covenant was put into question, as the accord was struck with Kurog and Emeric, resulting in Bazrag to consult the Orsimer community on the matter. It is unknown when it was destroyed, though in &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt; the Orsimer petitioned &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to grant them the status of an Imperial Territory once more.\nThird Orsinium.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; visionary named &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; acquired the site of the former civilization of Orsinium and began reconstructing a new city for the Orsimer of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. As it grew, many believed it would succumb to the same fate as its predecessor. Gortwog though, proved to be a superb politician and diplomat and managed to make negotiations with Orsinium's neighbors which saw the Third Orsinium prosper.\nOrsinium had asked the Imperial authorities to raise it to Provincial status, making it recognized as a fully-fledged Province of Tamriel. Its request was under review and given the likelihood of a stable future with its previous rival &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, many believed Orsinium had a very good chance of succeeding in its goal. It is unknown if it became a province prior to its sacking in the early Fourth Era.\nThere is however, a religious conflict in Orsinium which shows signs of becoming a major problem. In accordance with tradition, the Orsimer have always worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; as their &lt;a href=\"deity\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt;. Orsinium's current leader, Gortwog, however, has controversially claimed that Malacath is in fact a fake and has set up a priesthood dedicated to the worship of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; hero, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. This had caused controversy as Trinimac was said to have been devoured by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and afterwards became Malacath.\nFourth Orsinium.\nSome time in the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, Orsinium was once again sacked, this time by a combined Breton-Redguard force. During the sack two Imperial Legions, the &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion\"&gt;Seventh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fifteenth%20Legion\"&gt;Fifteenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;s, intervened. It is unknown if they fought the besiegers, however they did rescue Orc survivors and brought them to Skyrim.\nLike before, it was rebuilt, but this time not in the Wrothgarian mountains like the three previous incarnations of the Orc kingdom. The Fourth Orsinium was instead built in the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in between the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Reach\"&gt;Eastern Reach&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nMalacath.\n&lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt; was said to have had a strong relationship with &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, with the Orc-Father granting the &lt;a href=\"Coldwind%27s%20Den\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Coldwind\"&gt;Torug's bear&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; guardians. When the tomb became accessible in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, this guardians had remained there since Torug's death. His successor King &lt;a href=\"Golkarr\"&gt;Golkarr&lt;/a&gt; was said to have been a zealot over Malacath, and prayed to the deity &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; for strength before he was killed.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Bazrag%20gro-Fharun\"&gt;Bazrag gro-Fharun&lt;/a&gt; came in command of the Second Orsinium, he himself was very lenient towards the worship of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. After it was revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt; were working with Kurog, the statue of Trinimac in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Temple of Ire&lt;/a&gt; was torn down, and the new deity to be depicted in stone later came under discussion.\nTrinimac.\nThough a minority, some residents of the First Orsinium privately worshiped Trinimac in their homes, commemorating him with small gold statues. &lt;a href=\"Paragon%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Paragon's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt; was an ancient site for Trinimac worship from the same era as the First Orsinium.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; had established a temple of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; within the Orcish city, which later suffered from a surprise attack. While he did not ban worship of the &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, he did show distaste of the practice. Due to many Orsimer still favoring Malacath, Kurog's vision to unite the Orc clans of Tamriel was affected as many chieftans did not wish to join him over this. The &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Trinimac radicalists, also grew in power during his reign.\nGortwog's belief that &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; still lives and that &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; is a mere &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; was the official view taken by the majority of the leading priests of the Third Orsinium. A handful of Orcs within Orsinium and the majority of Orcs outside of it viewed Gortwog's beliefs as heresy. Many of Gortwog's supporters feared that turning their back on Malacath could prove to be a terrible mistake."}

He and fellow senior vampire &lt;a href=\"Vingalmo\"&gt;Vingalmo&lt;/a&gt; are embroiled in a feud over the throne, and can be often heard making cutting remarks towards one another.\nBackground.\nUpon first meeting with Orthjolf, he and Vingalmo will be arguing in the dining room. Once their exchange is complete he will warn the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; not to trust Vingalmo or get involved in any of his schemes.

These Mages had taken a liking to him, and made him feel included, so when they left the college to continue their illegal research at &lt;a href=\"Fellglow%20Keep\"&gt;Fellglow Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Orthorn stole some books from &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt; and took off after them, using the books as a peace offering to ingratiate himself into the clan.\nOne of the books he stole had references to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, relating a theory that there may have been something the ancient Nords were hiding under Saarthal that provoked the Elves to attack, entitled &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Caller\"&gt;The Caller&lt;/a&gt;, a zealous &lt;a href=\"conjurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;conjurer&lt;/a&gt;, and leader of the rogue group of mages, was very interested in the books, in particular one of the volumes, but instead of allowing Orthorn's acceptance into the group, had him imprisoned for use in further experiments.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Hitting%20the%20Books\"&gt;Hitting the Books&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen initially found, Orthorn is being held captive in a cell and begs the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; for assistance.

He owns a large group of slaves who work at his plantation.\nBackground.\nThe younger brother of Vedam Dren has nothing of the Duke's cosmopolitan attitude nor does he approve of the abolitionist efforts of his niece Ilmeni Dren. Orvas Dren is the highest-ranking member of the xenophobic criminal organization called the \"Camonna Tong.\" He wields significant influence in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;'s politics through threatening and blackmailing major House Hlaalu members. Dren has two of the House Hlaalu Councilors, &lt;a href=\"Nevena%20Ules\"&gt;Nevena Ules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velanda%20Omani\"&gt;Velanda Omani&lt;/a&gt;,\" in his pocket. They are unwilling to come to any decision without his approval, fearing to enrage their \"patron.\"\nOrvas Dren's political ambitions go even further, however. An &lt;a href=\"Dren%27s%20Note\"&gt;incriminating note&lt;/a&gt; reveals that Dren is thinking about getting his older brother killed, as the Duke has been interfering with his business, thus cutting profits. He already has plans for his brother's succession, too. Combining support from House Hlaalu with his aforementioned wide-reaching political influence, he is sure he would be able to consolidate his power as his brother's successor.\nThe xenophobic demeanor of Orvas Dren does not end with his leadership of the Camonna Tong, either. In the hope of driving outlanders and, above all, the Empire from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, Dren even accepted a deal offered to him by the Devil &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; himself. With his help he hopes to \"crush the Empire and those smug hypocrites in the Tribunal.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dealing%20with%20Orvas%20Dren\"&gt;Dealing with Orvas Dren&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the close of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20Quests\"&gt;House Hlaalu questline&lt;/a&gt;, Duke Vedam Dren tasks the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; with diminishing the baleful influence of the Camonna Tong, headed by his brother Orvas Dren. They are to visit and persuade the influential criminal to cooperate peacefully with House Hlaalu. A high enough disposition or carrying \"&lt;a href=\"Dren%27s%20Note\"&gt;Dren's Note&lt;/a&gt;\" may result in dialogue options with a positive outcome. However, the Nerevarine should be prepared to fight.\nAccomplishing this last House Hlaalu quest will guarantee the Nerevarine the position of Grandmaster within the Great House Hlaalu.\n&lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Hortator\"&gt;Hlaalu Hortator&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to become the \"Hortator and Nerevarine\" the Nerevarine seeks amongst other things to be named \"Hortator\" by House Hlaalu. The votes of all House Hlaalu Councilors are needed to accomplish that feat. Orvas Dren is not one of the Councilors. However, he exerts a dominating influence over two of the Councilors, Nevena Ules and Velanda Omani. The two women refuse to give their votes without the consent of their \"patron\" Orvas Dren.\nOrvas Dren is not very inclined to grant the Nerevarine the honor to support him as Hlaalu Hortator. Having already finished the quest \"Dealing with Orvas Dren\" is helpful, as in that case he has already agreed to cooperate with the Nerevarine. Otherwise, the ways of completing the quest are the same as in \"Dealing with Orvas Dren.\"\nDialogue.\n\"What do you want?\"\nAs Hortator:\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"What do you want?\"\nDuring \"Dealing with Orvas Dren\":\n\"What do you want?\"\nAfter becoming the Hortator:\nHlaalu Hortator \"You're the Hortator of House Hlaalu. What do you need from me?\"\nAfter the quest \"Dealing with Orvas Dren\":\nHlaalu Hortator \"I thought we agreed you'd take over for me. You can name yourself Hortator now. Be strict and uncompromising. Nevena Ules and Velanda Omani will fall in line. What influence I still have, I will use.\""}

He and Endarre later figured out that the red crystals contained within the animunculi could power the crystals to open the doors. The constructs later broke through, and Endarre sacrificed his life defending against the animunculi so that Ostarand could hide the crystal in the deepest part of the ruins.

Initially, he was believed to have been a benevolent ruler and highly successful in battle, but his mind was corrupted by unknown forces that drove him to insanity. Otar became a Dragon Priest and subjected his people to great cruelty until two Nordic heroes named &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Saerek\"&gt;Saerek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Torsten\"&gt;Torsten&lt;/a&gt; were sent to stop his tyranny.\nOwing to Otar's immense power, both heroes were unable to defeat him despite their most valiant efforts, so they instead resorted to permanently sealing him in a large sarcophagus in Ragnvald and locked it with two skull keys that each of them kept. They pledged to defend the keys with their lives so that Otar would never escape his imprisonment. The city of Ragnvald was eventually abandoned, but Saerek and Torsten remained as his guardians.\nInteractions.\nOtar can be encountered within the Nordic ruin of Ragnvald in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;. He is sealed in a large, locked sarcophagus in the main chamber of the ruin. Opening the sarcophagus is only possible by defeating the guardians, Torsten and Saerek, who each hold a &lt;a href=\"Torsten%27s%20Skull%20Key\"&gt;Skull Key&lt;/a&gt;.

I hid my transformed self in a woodshed where I tore the bark from the lumber, bewailed my fate, and cursed the rest of the world.\nFor a season thereafter I sought a means to control my affliction, purchasing ill-smelling nostrums from alchemists, mystic talismans from arcanists, and blessings from priests of &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;, demigods, even &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;daemons&lt;/a&gt;. To no avail. Despite all my would-be benefactors' assurances, the Change still came upon me when it would\u2014and seemed, indeed, stronger every time.\nFinally it was too strong: I killed, and killed again. Unworthy to abide among decent people, I fled, putting civilization behind me. I plunged into the forests, forded rivers and climbed mountains, until I was far from any innocents I might injure. There, with naught but brute beasts for companions, I gave in to the urge to hunt, and to slay, and to feed.\nBut I found to my sorrow that, though the beasts had neither minds nor souls, still they had hearts. They felt fear, pain, loss, sadness, and to slaughter them out of hand was no less a sin than to slaughter &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThereafter I lived upon nuts, fruits, buds, roots, and animals freshly dead. And this I could easily do for, when the Change was upon me, my senses were so acute that I could always detect food of all sorts.\nMore than that: with my hunger assuaged, I found that when in beast-form I could see things, hear things, smell things I was never aware of when in my \"natural\" body. I could sense every living creature in the mountain hollow where I'd made my home, hear every sound they made blend with the songs of the flowing streams and the music of the wind in the trees, until all combined into a glorious and never-ending choral symphony. I would stand in a glade, enraptured, intoxicated, sometimes for days at a time.\nWhen I returned to my ordinary mortal form, I would try to write of what I had experienced as a Beast of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, but human words could never capture it. It could only be shared by others who could sense what I sensed, who might learn how to tame the lusts of the Change as I had. And I knew then that I had a sacred mission to share what I had found, to find others who had been stricken by this curse and bring them to my hollow, where I could teach them the truth, that their curse was, in fact, their glory. This change we fear so much at first is not an affliction, but a gift.\nThis sacred mission has been my purpose ever since, a purpose I hope someday to see passed on to future generations. Here, right here, in my little vale of &lt;a href=\"Kerbol%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Querbol's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;."}

Upon finding the key and entering Stormy-Eyes's house, the Vestige will discover a stranger inside rummaging through the bookcase talking to himself. Surprised, the stranger, named Asmalah, claims it is his house and that he's here to gather his belongings. When the Vestige tells them it is Stormy-Eyes's house they are in, he gives in and explains Stormy-Eyes is a murderer who doesn't understand the magic he uses. After exiting the conversation, Asmalah will exit the house in a hurry.

After confronting and almost defeating Asmalah, he will open a portal to the other side of the river. Using the portal, the Vestige can follow him and confront him one last time. Here, he will explain Stormy-Eyes is reponsible for the death of his wife. For this reason, he put blood around the village that lured the local trolls to it, who subsequently destroyed the place. The Vestige has the option to either spare Asmalah's life or kill him. When sparing him, he will reveal the location of the reagents Stormy-Eyes is after. After acquiring the reagents, the Vestige must return to Stormy-Eyes. He performs the ritual and saves the life of Sister-of-Wind. When telling him what Asmalah has done, he will express regret for the loss of Asmalah's wife and says he forgives him for what he's done.

I've been given special Tuning gloves that I'll need to wear in order to cleanse the focal points. Drevis has warned that there may be side-effects to performing this task.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAsk Drevis Neloren about College business, and he tells the Dragonborn that the various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted. Agree to help with their cleansing, and he hands off the &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Tuning%20Gloves\"&gt;Mystic Tuning Gloves&lt;/a&gt; which allow the Dragonborn to delve into these focal points. These gloves will be removed once the quest is finished.\nThe Mystic Focal Points are the pillars of light with a strange blue glow that were visible before taking the quest. There is one in the courtyard\u2019s center in front of the mage statue, one in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt;, and one in the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Countenance\"&gt;Hall of Countenance&lt;/a&gt;. Just approach the beam of light wearing the gloves, and cleanse them.\nAfter each one is purified, the Dragonborn will receive a random empty &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;, a magic boosting buff, or a minor harmful discharge. Return to &lt;a href=\"Drevis%20Neloren\"&gt;Drevis Neloren&lt;/a&gt; to complete the quest and have the gloves removed."}

This organization called the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt; has asked me to record my thoughts about the Clockwork City? Apparently I'm the latest person to show up in about a hundred or some such years. I told them, \"Wow, not a big tourist town huh?\" They didn't really laugh at that one. Or any of the jokes I've told so far, if I'm being honest. But hey, rambling on about something I barely know about? Now that's something I can do.\nThey suggested I start with observations. Said that was the most \"objective\" viewpoint I could give. Huh, well, not really sure what they're getting at there, but I'm going to ignore that bit of advice because I think that I should start with myself. After all, who gives a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; arse about what I have to think if you don't know who I am? That's what I always thought, you know, reading stories.\nWell, a little about myself. I'm your typical mage, I suppose, in how typical the ability to summon fireballs and teleport around is. Not particularly powerful or anything, which the Apostles sure were disappointed about, let me tell you. I get the feeling that they only care about folks who have a real hand at magic, or good with the contraptions they've cooked up here. I already know a few apostles who told me that they were simply very, very skilled at working the machines here, and that was sort of an in for them. Not that I really want to join a bunch of Dark Elves who worship &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, mind you.\nHow did I end up here? Now, I'd really like to know that myself. See, I was apprenticed with a &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; mage just recently, an unconventional character who had a tough time keeping apprentices around. Now this &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt;, I'll tell you, real big Clockwork City aficionado. Really big on getting here too. I mean, talk about an obsession, he would just lecture us all nonstop about the \"wonders of the omni-axle\" and all that. Not that he really knew what exactly those wonders were, but hey, he knew they were here.\nLong story short though, he wasn't wrong. And he would have gotten his wish, had I not been a beef-wit and stepped into the portal first. Well, I mean, more like tripped. I keep hoping he'll show up, but from what I could tell it was a one way trip? Something about the movements of the planes or something like that. Prime conditions that aren't likely to pop up again. Just my luck, that.\nNow that I'm here though, well, not so sure my old boss would be particularly keen on this place. I mean first off, it's pretty much a wasteland. Smells like I'm trapped in a tin cup. Heck, everything is metal. The trees, the creatures, the people! They have metal limbs, and from what I can gather they just do it for some sort of fashion trend. Gives me goosebumps.\nAll right, my caretakers here are telling me I'm out of time. They're going to perform some more tests on me, I think. Take bits of my hair and spit for \"analysis.\" I'm guessing they'll keep asking me to write down my thoughts though. Unless one of the factotums can read my mind? Huh. Wouldn't be surprised."}

If I had to hazard a guess, the Clockwork Apostles weren't too keen on my last report. But you know, I don't think they're really keen on me period. So to keep in their good graces, and out of the Radius, I thought I'd share some more \"objective\" observations.\nI'm currently living in this city called the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. It really does look like a fortress from the outside, with high walls and big gates. There is no getting in unless you're invited, but it isn't really needed for things like war parties or bandits. There's no one here that isn't registered. I mean, perhaps there's some poor souls lost in the wastelands that surround the Brass Fortress, known as the Radius. I'm guessing they're not registered or anything, but I'm not rightfully sure. Least I'm safe here.\nWell, all right, truthfully? Not everywhere in Brass Fortress is safe. In fact there are quite a few \"off-limits\" areas here filled with rather nasty &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fabricants&lt;/a&gt; and these rather testy factotums. Fabricants by the way are these strange creatures that are a mixture of metal and flesh. Gave me nightmares the first time I saw one. From what I can understand they were created by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;? Not sure why. They scare the ever living daylights out of me though.\nAnd the &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;factotums&lt;/a&gt;, well, they're like metal people. They got heads and arms and everything, but they're simpler than living folk. They have tasks they do and they just do them. They'll answer questions sometimes? It's odd, because they act like people. Well, like very devoted servants. Who only think and talk about serving. And they're very keen on completing whatever task they've been set to do. They're interesting enough, I suppose.\nYou know, the Clockwork Apostles are pretty simple too in their interests. They really enjoy inventing oddities and discovering odd bits of information. They're real keen on Sotha Sil and everything he does. Got a giant statue of him right in the square. They quote his sermons a whole awful lot to. Doesn't make much sense to me, but at least they're not cultists or anything.\nNow here's a funny thing that I'm still wrapping my head around. These seemingly very reason driven individuals believe that the Princes and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; don't rightfully exist. Right. I mean, I've seen a &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;clannfear&lt;/a&gt; rip men apart. Pretty sure it was real. I guess it's a little easier to believe that though, given that there doesn't seem to be any Daedra here. Not sure why? I guess Sotha Sil is just particularly vigilant about keeping them out.\nNow it isn't all Apostles this and Sotha Sil that here in Brass Fortress. In fact, most of the citizens are just normal folk like myself. Well, as normal as anyone can be growing up in this strange land. There's the merchants and the craftsmen, blacksmiths and chefs. They even have their own slums, though that came as a surprise. They call the folks there Tarnished, unwanted vagabonds and whatnot. I've talked to a few though and they seem a decent lot. Then again, most of the poor folk I've met are.\nI can tell you that no matter your lot in this city you never go hungry. You see they got this gruel here called nutriment paste. Consistency of porridge, and taste of \u2026 well, not much taste to speak of. You can add spices or toppings to make it a bit more palatable, but given that everything is made of metal here, that's a bit hard to come by.\nGot to cut it short here. More tests. Hopefully they won't make me run so much in this one. I'll make sure to keep writing down my thoughts. Helps me make sense of everything that's happening."}

I suppose is the way I'd put it. I guess after growing up in a world that's just different shades of brown, a bit of color can be confusing. Still, they told me to write my observations, and I'll be damned if I can do that any way but how I know how. So they'll just have to \"analyze\" a bit harder.\nI thought I'd write about other places in Clockwork City that I've visited so far. I've talked about the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and the general Radius, but there are some other locations around here that I've been taken to. Some of them seemed a tad more practical than others, but then again, I'm not really sure I can compare my definition of practical with the God of Mystery's.\nFirst they took me to the &lt;a href=\"Mnemonic%20Planisphere\"&gt;Mnemonic Planisphere&lt;/a&gt;. Well, more like we walked by it, because I wasn't allowed to go inside. I was told it was sort of like a storehouse for &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;'s memories. Yeah, you read right. His memories! He's apparently got so many of them that he likes to keep them all organized in a giant building. I tell you, it's almost as big as a castle. And they look like stars? How you turn memories into stars, I'm not sure, but then again I'm not a god.\nThe next stop was far more practical of a place, called the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Regulation\"&gt;Halls of Regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I had been wondering where all the fresh water came from, because the rivers and lakes here are filled with oil of all things! Apparently this place somehow cleans it all up. Sure, they tried to explain it to me. Talked about the water cycle and evaporation and all these fancy terms. But hey, it gives me fresh water, so I can't complain even if I barely understand it.\nThe inside was a bit less spruced up than I expected. A lot of pipes, a lot of steam, and a lot of factotums. Couldn't help but feel nervous around them all. I was told that they help maintain the Halls of Regulation, all by themselves. I was shocked, since the whole operation sounded a bit high maintenance. Wasn't there an apostle there to give them orders and make sure everything was running smoothly? And then they started talking about Sotha Sil and how he sets everything in \"perfect regulation\" and honestly I started to lose track of the conversation from then on.\nWe then went up north to the &lt;a href=\"Everwound%20Wellspring\"&gt;Everwound Wellspring&lt;/a&gt;, which was my favorite stop because they had actual food there! I've never been more happy to eat an apple in my life. After weeks of tasteless gruel, it was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. Ma was right, hunger is truly the best seasoning. And all the plants were green! I never thought I'd miss green as much as I do.\nDespite my excitement though, I couldn't help but feel that something was off about the place. The &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; running it was nice enough, but after talking to him I could tell he had a few screws loose. All that stress really must have really gotten to him. I suppose he's under a lot of pressure though, especially since he took up the project after Sotha Sil got bored of it.\nWell, they're telling me to complete this observation report best I can now. I don't think they need any more observations from me, so I guess this is it. Right, so my overall impression is that Clockwork City\u2026 well, it's one of the most dangerous places I've ever set foot in. I can't really believe someone who calls himself a god would really let his followers live here. It's more made for machines than any living creature.\nStill, it has an odd beauty about it. The metal leaves in the trees that glitter in the sun are particularly nice. Guess I'll just have to get use to it, since this seems to be a one way trip. No one but Sotha Sil gets to leave Clockwork City. Honestly, I hope I'm the last beef-wit who gets stuck here. I wouldn't wish this life on anyone else."}

We've traveled together for so long, and you're the only one I trust with the ring and my story.\nI knew climbing into the window of that wizard's house was a mistake, but the bounty on the ring was just too enticing to pass up. They said it was worth thousands of drakes... enough to keep me comfortable for a while as I lay low. They also said Ortharzel was out of town at some meeting of wizards or some such.\nThey were wrong on both counts. You'd think I'd be used to this by now, dealing with the unpredictable in our line of work. But after trying to fence the ring all over &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, no one would touch it. Worse still, Ortharzel was pursuing me the entire time. I had to call in many favors to stay one step ahead of him.\nI decided to strike north and make for &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. As I was crossing the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jeralls&lt;/a&gt;, he finally caught up to me. Two fireballs later, I found myself tumbling down a steep snowy slope into a valley. Don't know where I am, but there are ruins of some old fort here. Luckily, that fetcher didn't follow me down; I assume he gave me up for dead.\nI think I'm going to stash the ring in this valley, make for Skyrim, and return later when I feel it's safe. I've used some old &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; I found in the ruins to make sure nobody stumbles across the ring by mistake; you know, the old key to a key thing like we used to do. If I don't make it back here, and you're reading this message, then the ring is all yours, my friend. Use it well and remember me.\nG.S."}

A Crusader protects themselves with a wall of steel and is skilled at healing whatever wounds they take in battle.\nDescription and Use.\nThe Crusader is like a &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, but with a small twist. Unlike Warriors and Knights who usually focus on using healing potions and other methods of healing, Crusaders can fully utilize &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; to heal themselves in or out of battle.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt;, the Crusader can dish out heavy damage in close range, and what the Crusader chooses to use will influence his style of fighting. With Blunt, the Crusader will be more powerful physically, yet will suffer from the slow attack speed and will have to get closer in combat. With Blade, the Crusader will be more agile and can cope with the fewer burdens from blade &lt;a href=\"weaponry\"&gt;weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, as well as also gain a longer reach in combat, but of course will suffer from the damage deduction, thus they won't be the most \"powerful\" type of fighter. Although Crusaders have the great defensive advantage of &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, they unfortunately aren't skilled with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, and will miss out on the great &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; increase shields deliver. Since a Crusader lacks skill in Block, they may want to use two-handed weapons to maximize their combat reach and damage to compensate for their defensive shortcomings. The Crusaders don't always have to focus on weapons in combat, as the Crusader is &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;ed in the school of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, which will definitely be a great help in combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt; is good to use when the Crusader has no weapon (or if the used weapon is broken), so they will have at least some sort of way to fight back in combat. &lt;a href=\"Athletics\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; is for &lt;a href=\"Fatigue\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; while fighting close-range, or for using distance Destruction &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; without the need of having to drink a lot of &lt;a href=\"Restore\"&gt;Restore&lt;/a&gt; Fatigue &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, the Crusader is a well-balanced fighter, with a slight combination of &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;. However, if the Crusader &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; had the &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; attribute, it would make fighting much easier."}

They would send members to areas throughout Tamriel, to quell danger for the good of the people. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Crusaders had sent &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Dalamar\"&gt;Crusader Dalamar&lt;/a&gt; to the region of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; had been the source of legends and myths throughout Craglorn, most of which have been revealed to be true. Dalamar was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Skyreach%20Catacombs\"&gt;Skyreach Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;, when news came of dark magic had spewed from the area, the Crusaders took action. Dalamar was unable to control the tomb, prompting him to call upon the help of adventurers in the area. Eventually, the Skyreach Catacombs was secured, but Crusader Dalamar remained in the tomb, to ensure no further disturbances.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Crusaders were active throughout the third era, having a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. They can be seen throughout the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Phrygias\"&gt;Barony of Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, typically in the jurisdiction of the Temple of Stendarr, doing what they do best. Not much can be said about the Crusaders at this point. It was likely present during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against the Daedric Invasion. After the event, another group had arrived called the &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, which served as a militant order that fought against Daedra. This group had dispersed sometime in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whether the Vigilants and the Crusaders were related, though there is a possibility. It is most likely that the Crusaders had remained active along with the worship of Stendarr."}

There are just so many choices!\" Why, yes, my less-battle-savvy little friends, there are! But not to worry; you don't need to choose just one. In fact, if you're anything like me, you'll have much more fun with two!\nEven narrowing it down to two can be tough, but you should try out everything to see what calls to you. You have to be comfortable with your weapons, and they have to fit your own style. I've known soldiers and mercenaries who go their whole lives just using, say, a sword, and never trying anything else. Well, when I get them to lift a hammer for the first time, it's like a whole new world. And even better, they don't have to abandon that sword they know so well, just the shield. That's as it should be; shields are really a sign of fear and weakness, so don't even start using one.\nWeapons have their pros and cons, so you should know a little about each of them. Axes are great for folks with exceptional arm strength, but you need to be careful about getting the pointed parts stuck on or in your foes. Hammers are another good choice for the strong, and they're useful against &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;, crushing into the body beneath. They tend to be heavy, though, and may slow you down. Swords are a typical choice for beginners, but it takes work to maintain them in good shape and they take a bit of &lt;a href=\"finesse\"&gt;finesse&lt;/a&gt; to wield. I haven't used daggers much, but get in close enough using something else and they can help you seal the deal.\nFor me, it's axe and hammer all the way. With my axe, &lt;a href=\"Grimdeath\"&gt;Grimdeath&lt;/a&gt;, in my right hand, I can deliver powerful, targeted strikes on anyone without heavy armor. When faced with a more protected foe, here comes my hammer, &lt;a href=\"Skullcrash\"&gt;Skullcrash&lt;/a&gt;, using my signature jaw-wallop to knock 'em out cold and send their helms flying. Then it's right back to the axe!\nBy the way, you definitely need to name your weapons once you've picked them out. You can shout the names to scare your foes, and it'll help you develop a good, healthy relationship based on mayhem and the thrill of battle!\nNow, you're going to have to put in a good deal of training time to come anywhere near my expertise, but don't worry; every fight is just a new chance to learn. So get out there, grab a weapon, and then grab another. A whole world is waiting for you to crush, slash, bash, and stab the treasure and glory out of it!"}

Originally a school of &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic, the Crypt of Hearts is a place surrounded in mystery and legend, seemingly non-existant to the populous of High Rock.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Crypt of Hearts is situated in the region of Rivenspire, specifically in the &lt;a href=\"Westmark%20Moor\"&gt;Westmark Moor&lt;/a&gt; region, in an area where Rivenspire would meet the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. It is entirely isolated, with the closest settlement being the minor village of &lt;a href=\"Moira%27s%20Hope\"&gt;Moira's Hope&lt;/a&gt; and the trading town of &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost%20Downs\"&gt;Hoarfrost Downs&lt;/a&gt;. The castle is rather large, looming over Westmark Moor. There are five large towers and several smaller ones around the main entrance. The castle door has a demonic skull face on top of it, which emphasizes the Crypt's otherworldly and foreboding atmosphere. After the castle was overtaken by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, the castle halls would be riddled with bookcases and Daedric caves reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. The beginning room was once the lobby and continuing onward would be the library. Eventually, the end of the dungeon is the balcony, looking towards the Wrothgarian Mountains and Rivenspire.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; ruin called Agea Relle, the Crypt of Hearts was founded by an adventuring couple named &lt;a href=\"Nerien%27eth\"&gt;Nerien'eth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alanwe\"&gt;Alanwe&lt;/a&gt;. The two converted it into a school of various skills, including destruction magic and sword-fighting. The Altmer couple were talented warriors, with expertise in magic and other forms of combat, taking on several students. At one point, Alanwe discovered the seven &lt;a href=\"Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt; deep in the ancient caves of Agea Relle, recording the fundamentals of these crystals. As things were going fine, it would change when Nerien'eth came into possession of the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifact\"&gt;Daedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Sin. The Ebony Blade is powered whenever the wielder kills those they are close to and so, the possessed Nerien'eth killed the students and Alanwe. To keep her away, Nerien'eth had sealed Alanwe's soul away, splitting it into three pieces in what would later become the Crypt of Hearts. Nerien'eth disappeared, along with the Ebony Blade. As time went on, the Crypt of Hearts fell into obscurity and legend to the people of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; and Rivenspire.\nCrypt of Hearts has become a legend through High Rock, beckoning for the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt;, a group of dungeon explorers. A group of four &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Crypt of Hearts where they encountered one of the shards of Alanwe. The adventurers fought through the Daedra inhabiting the ruins, gathering the three phylacteries needed to restore Alanwe, so that she can finally rest. When they found all three, they were encountered by the &lt;a href=\"Ilambris%20Twins\"&gt;Ilambris Twins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ilambris-Athor\"&gt;Athor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ilambris-Zaven\"&gt;Zaven&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Alanwe was freed, but Nerien'eth still roamed Tamriel. Knowing this, Alanwe decided to remain in Tamriel until Nerien'eth was ultimately defeated. And so enough, Nerien'eth returned, determined to deal with Alanwe and his students, but the Undaunted appeared, and four adventurers delved into the Crypt of Hearts. Eventually, confronting Nerien'eth and the Ebony Blade in what can be a pocket of the &lt;a href=\"Spiral%20Skein\"&gt;Spiral Skein&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Nerien'eth was defeated, and Alanwe took the Ebony Blade, never to be seen again. The spirits of the dead students ascended into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, while Alanwe's fate is unknown. But eventually, the Ebony Blade resurfaced, one way or the other.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the Crypt of Hearts in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion had retrieved the fifth piece of the staff from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, continuing their quest throughout Tamriel. In their sleep, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; came to the warrior through a dream, telling them where the next piece is, which was the Crypt of Hearts in High Rock. The Champion had then traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, to get an idea on the Crypt of Hearts' location, and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Halfas%20Varn\"&gt;Halfas Varn&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Seth\"&gt;Brotherhood of Seth&lt;/a&gt;. Before they were given the whereabouts of the Crypt of Hearts, the priest gave the Champion a proposition, if they retrieved a parchment taken by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Barnabas\"&gt;Brother Barnabas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mines%20of%20Khuras\"&gt;Mines of Khuras&lt;/a&gt;; then he will give them what they need. And so, the Champion was able to get the coordinates for the Crypt of Hearts and retrieved the sixth piece of the Staff of Chaos. The Champion would then set their sites for the province of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmidst the Imperial Simulacrum in &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; had left the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; in constant warfare. Jagar Tharn and his associate, &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt; created a creature of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt;, deep within the Crypt of Hearts. Tharn and Asuul wanted to use the Umbra' Keth for their own purposes, using the war as fuel for the creature. The Crypt Keepers in the Crypt of Hearts fled amidst the conflict except for one, who stayed to protect the archives. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skelos%20Undriel\"&gt;Skelos Undriel&lt;/a&gt;, a hero called the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Soul of Conflict&lt;/a&gt; gathered seven &lt;a href=\"Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the creature. In the end, the Umbra' Keth and Pergan Asuul were defeated and everyone was saved, though the War of Bend'r-Mahk continued on, into the fourth era."}

In this quest, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; finds the sixth piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nCrypt of Hearts.\nRecommended effects:\nThe Crypt of Hearts is a medium\u2014but seriously dangerous\u2014dungeon which contains four levels. The first level is the largest area, while the other three are smaller. The following creatures are encountered inside the ruins: &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Homonculi\"&gt;Homonculi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daemon\"&gt;Fire Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirst Level.\nImmediately after entering the Crypt, the door to the Second Level will be located exactly west of the front door. Using the map on the right, it is possible to break the right walls with the spell &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt;, making the First Level shorter and much safer. Non-magic users can walk through safer ways in the northeast area of the dungeon, since it is not necessary to explore the whole First Level to reach the lower level. However, the corridors in this zone, beyond creatures, contain valuable treasures and loot.\nSecond Level.\nThe Second Level is considerably smaller than the first one, and also has streams of lava in the east area and abysses in the west, sheltering Homonculi and Ghosts. The door to the Third Level is located south of the entrance, and the path is moderately dangerous, especially in abysses. To reach the Third Level, the Eternal Champion must take the upper corridors upon entering the Second Level and then hike to the southwest, where they will encounter large abysses which surround the room where the door to the Second Level is located.\nThird Level.\nIt is notable the presence of Hell Hounds in the Third Level, as the description says, \"screams from far way can be heard.\" The door to the Fourth Level is right behind the entrance door, so the spell Passwall can easily be used again to make the quest much shorter. The path to the door is simple\u2014go to the east and take the great corridor to the south until the path ends, then go to the east again. The Eternal Champion will encounter lava if they walk through the corridors, and more lava exploring the whole area.\nFourth Level.\nThe Fourth Level is the final level, and the most dangerous too. The central room where the Sixth Piece of the Staff of Chaos remains is surrounded by a giant abyss protected by Homunculi. The Eternal Champion would have to walk around the abyss until they reach the opening, but alternatively it is possible to use the spell Passwall. Approaching the great abyss, the Eternal Champion will be attacked by Homonculi standing above the platforms. To reach the central room, they can either jump through these platforms or walk on the underground. The door of the central room will give a riddle in order to be opened.\n\"\"Few have gained these hallowed halls,\"\n\"Brave fools who wouldst face the puzzle...\"\n\"There is a thing, which nothing is,\"\n\"Yet it has a name.\"\n\"It's sometimes tall\"\n\"And sometimes short\"\n\"It tumbles when we fall\"\n\"It joins our sport,\"\n\"And plays at every game...\"\n\"What then, doth I speak of?\"\"\"\nThe answer is \"Shadow.\"\nTwo Fire Daemons will be inside the central room; these are one of the strongest creatures in . Their physical attacks are devastating and at long range they use lethal Fireballs\u2014as such, the effect Resist Fire shall be useful during confrontation with said entities.\nAfter defeating the two Fire Daemons, the Eternal Champion must conquer the Sixth Piece of the Staff of Chaos and exit the Crypt of Hearts.\nAmbush.\nAfter conquering the Sixth Piece, the usurper &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; will again appear in vision threatening the Eternal Champion and sending his servants to retrieve the reunited pieces."}

Like the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Rose\"&gt;Knights of the Rose&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, many serve as royal guardians and protectors of the realm. It is through their defense of king and country that their fame resounds.\nYet others swear an oath of a different kind. Not bound by the walls of their kingdom, they scour the hills in search of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, witches, and &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, pledging to deliver justice where chaos and savagery rule.\nOne such group refers to themselves as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Crypt\"&gt;Order of the Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. At first glance, the name might seem ironic, but the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt; they swore to protect went beyond the underground chamber in Snornlhelm. The knights pledged to protect the hearts entombed in all of us, lest they be replaced with the briars of the unholy.\nYet despite the air of nobility they carried, in the Reach these knights were known by a different name; the War Mages of Snornlhelm. For they gave no mercy to the wicked, and the land they tread was riven with scars made of fire and sword.\nWhy the knights chose to extend beyond the kingdom is a matter of debate. Much of it can be traced to a blood feud, and the death of a knight named &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Rodayne\"&gt;Simon Rodayne&lt;/a&gt;. Tricked by the witch &lt;a href=\"Daenella\"&gt;Daenella&lt;/a&gt;, a Sister of the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Coven\"&gt;Beldama Coven&lt;/a&gt; his heart was stolen and replaced with a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;briarheart&lt;/a&gt;. In retaliation, his acolytes drove the coven further and further east, killing any Reachmen who would dare give them quarter.\nYet in huts small and muddy with smoke, the oral histories tell a different story. They say Simon gave his heart willingly to the witch, and together they fled the wrath of blood in their clans, knowing they would receive neither understanding nor forgiveness.\nWhen Simon died, Daenella returned his heart to him, and buried him at the altar where they wed. Such was the pain of her loss that she wept from the Morning to Evening Star, until her tears flooded the canyon below, and became one with the &lt;a href=\"River%20Karth\"&gt;River Karth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo this day, Simon's ghost is said to haunt the pass below his grave, watching over the river that bears his beloved's tears.\nWhether any of that is true or simply the embellishments of history, none can say with certainty. However, it is worth noting that the grave itself exists. Whether the heart inside belongs to Simon or another, is a question for its keeper."}

It was built by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; as a monument to the spirit of the elves, living and dead. The Crystal Tower was the pinnacle of &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; education until the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Crystal Tower is situated on the northern end of the Isle of Summerset, overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the land. The nearest settlement to the Tower is the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;. The Crystal Tower is exceptionally large with a slender build, being able to see the southern tip of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragon's Teeth Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, which extends all the way to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The halls are reflecting white, with light radiating throughout the windows. Along the halls are fountains with water flowing through it. The Crystal Tower holds various private collections and treasury, filled with relics of the past. Around the area is a large forest.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"High%20Lord%20Torinaan\"&gt;High Lord Torinaan&lt;/a&gt; had arrived onto &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; expanded their holdings and colonized the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, building small settlements throughout the landscape. The Aldmer created the Crystal Tower as a memorial to the spirit of the elven people, not the kings and gods, but the people. Deep within the walls the ancient remains of the original Aldmer settlers. The Crystal Tower remained, as the Aldmer villages grew into wondrous cities. As time went on, the Crystal Tower began to house records that Aldmer colonials created, including information about the creatures living on the land prior. Throughout the eras, the Crystal Tower has been held sacred to the Altmer.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Breton that was in the Crystal Tower was the Archmagister, &lt;a href=\"I%27ric%20Harad%20Egun\"&gt;I'ric Harad Egun&lt;/a&gt;, who was well acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;House Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Edward\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt;, King of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. I'ric knew Edward since the latter was a child, a Prince of Daggerfall, and he knew Moraelyn even more, knowing his connection with Edward. When they visited I'ric in the Crystal Tower, Edward was presented a Mithril Staff, and Moraelyn trained Edward with his Ebony dagger called &lt;a href=\"Tooth\"&gt;Tooth&lt;/a&gt;. Before this, Moraelyn was a student at the Crystal Tower, one of the very few non-Altmer students. He brought his &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn%27s%20Companions\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; along with him to learn more about Spellcasting, but unfortunately, Moraelyn was the only one allowed in the Tower. He stayed for two weeks while his friends were waiting for him in distant &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. When reunited with them, he took his friend &lt;a href=\"Mith\"&gt;Mith&lt;/a&gt; to the Crystal Tower to study along with him.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThroughout the years, many notable figures have studied from the Crystal Tower, and learning from the vast archive. Hailing from the minor village of &lt;a href=\"Moonguard\"&gt;Moonguard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gyron%20Vardengroet\"&gt;Gyron Vardengroet&lt;/a&gt; was born with extraordinary talent in magic, more so than the average &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;. He had taken lessons from his local wizard to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;hall in &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, where he was taught by &lt;a href=\"Morkledder\"&gt;Morkledder&lt;/a&gt;, the Guildmaster. Eventually, Gyron had learned all he can from Morkledder and was sent to the Crystal Tower, where he would be trained even further. At that point, he was well-known in the magic community, and when he arrived at the Crystal Tower, the mages were given him their undying attention. It was there Gyron was taught by &lt;a href=\"Esthlainder\"&gt;Esthlainder&lt;/a&gt;, the Elder of the Council of Wizards. Finally, the Elder admitted Gyron from the Crystal Tower; he emerged with immense and boundless knowledge. With everything he had, Gyron returned to Moonguard, where he lived out the rest of his life in a cottage, until his parents had died, from there he returned to the Crystal Tower, to learn about prolonging his life. And so he remains to this day, deep within the &lt;a href=\"Kurallian%20Mountains\"&gt;Kurallian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock, in a magical fortress.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayrenn%20Arana%20Aldmeri\"&gt;Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri&lt;/a&gt; was accepted to the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs%27%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Sapiarchs' Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;. Which is an esteemed school that was required for Ayrenn's ascension to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; and the Summerset Isles. It was there, Ayrenn was to study &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Regal%20Praxis\"&gt;Altmeri Regal Praxis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;Ceremoniarchy&lt;/a&gt; for thirty-five hundred and fifty-five, coincidentally playing into Ayrenn's birthdate. And so the royal family gathered at the Crystal Tower to celebrate this momentous event, but Ayrenn disappeared from the Isles, even the Thalmor Justiciers were unable to find the Princess. It was on that day, Ayrenn left the Summerset Isles, to experience the world and its people. On that day, an eaglet had landed on a statue of &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt;, prophesizing the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Ayrenn would return when her father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hidellith\"&gt;King Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; had passed away.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, as the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the Crystal Tower in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion had retrieved the fourth piece of the staff from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"the%20Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;the Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, continuing their quest throughout Tamriel. In their sleep, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; came to the warrior through a dream, telling them where the next piece is, which was Crystal Tower in the Summerset Isles. The Champion had then traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Lillandril\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;, to get an idea on the Crystal Tower's location, and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Corim%20Ashlen\"&gt;Corim Ashlen&lt;/a&gt;, the Loremaster of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Before they were given the whereabouts of the Crystal Tower, the mage gave the Champion a proposition, if they defeated the priests from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Mad%20God%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Temple of the Mad God&lt;/a&gt;, then he will give them what they need. And so, the Champion was able to get the coordinates for the Crystal Tower and retrieve the fifth piece of the Staff of Chaos. The Champion then set their sights for the province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the youthful Altmer took a critical view of the High Elves' xenophobia and hierarchy, calling for social change. Before this, those who are not conformant with this would be exiled from the Isles, but this time things were different. There were times when such dissent was constructive, such as when they accepted &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt; as the Queen of Firsthold. However, there was a darker side in the form of &lt;a href=\"the%20Beautiful\"&gt;the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group that took a more extreme initiative, by attacking the greatest monuments in Altmer history, beginning with the Crystal Tower. There were several attempts on the tower, but they were all failures, only leaving vandalized ancient sculptures and emblems. From there, they took to more living representations, for example, they committed a successful assassination attempt on the Princess of &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene\"&gt;Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt;, horrifying the public.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the province of the Summerset Isles was under serious attack from the invading &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedric Force&lt;/a&gt;. The cities were ransacked and so the Crystal Tower served as a beacon of hope for the Altmeri, being filled to the brim with refugees and Daedra surrounding the Crystal Tower. The Daedric forces hesitated in their attack, and the Altmer had hope, thinking that the Daedra feared them. As the refugees slept, the Daedra brought Altmer prisoners to the outside of the Crystal Tower before they attacked. Everyone in the Tower woke up to the screams of bloody murder, as the Daedra carved and ate them alive. The wizards of the Crystal Tower fought back with powerful fire magic and Altmer warriors charged with vigor, but it was not enough. Many refugees fled the Tower and out of the province, looking back and seeing that the Crystal Tower had fallen to the Daedra, a great loss for the Altmer. Many refugees fled to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, some left for &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; had risen from the ashes and established the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. A survivor and hero at the siege, &lt;a href=\"Rynandor\"&gt;Rynandor&lt;/a&gt; had his name besmirched by the Thalmor, even when he saved the lives of Altmer, he was exiled from the Isles."}

Then, go on the left and follow the way up to the north without going back. However, if the Eternal Champion possesses the spell &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to break the slender wall which divides the corridor and the door to the Third Level.\nThird level.\nThe Third Level is unique, and perhaps one of the most interesting areas in the Main Quest as a whole. This level is a bestiary which includes many creatures and information about them. The &lt;a href=\"Bestiary\"&gt;Bestiary&lt;/a&gt; contains &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and their snowy variant, &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s, Homonculi, the three elemental &lt;a href=\"Golem\"&gt;Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, Trolls, and one &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daemon\"&gt;Fire Daemon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014however, they are locked in cages and fighting is unnecessary, with the exception of the Trolls and the Fire Daemon. The door to the Fourth Level is directly south of the entrance, but to reach it, the Eternal Champion is required to find the Diamond Key. The key can be looted from a random troll defeated on the same level. Alternatively, it can be found on the west-most cage, which is connected to the underground passages. Use these subterranean corridors to reach the cage and take the key. It should be noted, however, that trolls will appear in the corridors.\nBefore going to the last area, it is possible to fight and collect experience points from some of the most dangerous creatures who appear in the Main Quest: there are three &lt;a href=\"Medusa%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Medusas&lt;/a&gt; (40000 points) on the south corridor and one &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt; (25000 points) on the large room located to the northwest. The entrance to the Fourth Level is located on the southeast room, which is surrounded by unbreakable walls, but the door which opens the room can be unlocked using the Diamond Key. A Fire Daemon, one of the strongest creatures in Crystal Tower and in the game, will be guarding the entrance. It uses fireballs to attack from long range and at close range attacks using a pickaxe. After defeating the creature, the Eternal Champion can enter the fourth and final area.\nFourth level.\nThe Fourth Level does not require as much caution as the previous levels, as the only enemies encountered in this levels are &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Wolf%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Snow Wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Golem\"&gt;Ice Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;. The Fifth Piece of the Staff of Chaos remains on a large room surrounded by unbreakable walls which occupy the southwest space of the Level, and the only door to this room is locked by a riddle. There is a Steel Key in a little room close to the entrance; while this key is not the only way to reach the piece of the Staff of Chaos, it will unlock a faster way to do so. Upon reaching the door to the room where the Fifth Piece remains, a riddle will be given to gain access:\n\"To enter within, thou must find,\"\n\"The meaning of this passage...\"\n\"In a marble hall as white as milk,\"\n\"Lined with skin as soft as silk,\"\n\"Within a fountain crystal clear,\"\n\"A golden apple, doth appear,\"\n\"No doors there are to this stronghold\"\n\"Yet thieves break in to steal the gold...\"\n\"What is thy answer?\"\nThe answer is \"Egg.\"\nThe door will open, however upon approaching the Fifth Piece, two Wraiths will appear. After taking the Staff's Piece, the Eternal Champion must then get out of the Crystal Tower.\nAmbush.\nAfter obtaining the Fifth Piece of the Staff of Chaos, &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; will ambush the Eternal Champion again, sending his servants to recover the conquered pieces of the Staff."}

He appointed &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Hjalti Early-Beard or Talos, as the general of his armies.\nBackground.\nAs King of Falkreath, Cuhlecain was in a bad situation. Wishing to unite the Colovian Estates, he needed to secure his northern border with the &lt;a href=\"Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; who had been fighting with their &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; neighbords for centuries.\nMilitary Campaigns.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking to secure his northern border before uniting Colovia, Cuhlecain allies with &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; during the Battle of Old Hroldan. The Colovian forces of Cuhlecain, supported by Nord berserkers, managed to break the Reachman line and force them back through the gates of Old Hroldan. Unable to besiege the settlement due to the distance from Falkreath, general Hjalti used the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to break down the walls, allowing the soldiers to rush in and defeat the Reachmen foe.\nConquest of Colovia.\nA year after appointing Talos as the commander of his legions, more than half of Cyrodiil had been conquered or consolidated by the forces of Cuhlecain, including the entirety of Colovia. With his success, Cuhlecain aimed at invading the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt;, conquer the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and name himself emperor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E 852&lt;/a&gt;, Skyrim and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, learning of the endeavors of Cuhlecain, united in an alliance. Bitterly opposed to Imperial rule, they gathered their armies to invade &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, taking hold of passes and settlements in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the citadel of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was brief, with Talos distracting the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; forces with a token force near the citadel to draw out its defenders, while attacking it himself with his main army. Whether by the prowess of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; or mistrust of their Breton allies, the Nords surrendered and joined with the forces of Cuhlecain, while the Breton command was executed and the remaining Bretons were either sold into slavery, imprisoned, or sent back to High Rock with the news of their defeat.\nConquest of the Nibenay Valley.\nBolstered by the Nord veterans of Sancre Tor, the army of Cuhlecain was able to continue in its campaigns to consolidate Colovia and Nibenay under his rule. When they marched east, the battlemages of the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; surrendered before his armies and the Imperial City is conquered. Before Cuhlecain can be crowned Emperor, however, he is murdered by either his ambitious general or a Reachman assassin. Following his death, his general is crowned Emperor in his stead, naming himself Tiber Septim."}

They are tasked with reading the Elder Scrolls.\nRanking.\nNew members of the Cult of the Ancestor Moth. These are the members which take care of the Blind Moth Priests at the Monastery of the Ancestor Moths. They are also trained for the reading of the Elder Scrolls.\nScroll Drudges are initiates tasked with retrieving Elder Scrolls from the library for Librarians.\nAdepts are those who have been gifted with the ability to read the Elder Scrolls.\nLibrarians are the Moth Priests in charge of the library housing the Elder Scrolls.\nLeaders of monasteries of the Ancestor Moth.\nAugurs are Moth Priests who are able to attract the Ancestor Moths.\nTraditions and beliefs.\nThe Order of the Ancestor Moth believes that the Ancestor Moths are manifested by the spirits of their ancestors. As such, the Priests nurture and celebrate them. The Cult believes every moth carries the \"fjyron\" of a spirit, which is loosely translated to the \"will to peace\". This \"fjyron\" can be sung into the silk produced by the ancestor moths, which can then be spun into clothing. Given the genealogy of the ancestor is correct, when the silk is spun into cloth and then embroidered, powerful clothing could be made. It is said that when a person has died on Nirn, the Monks believe a kind of dissipation begins, and the Ancestor Moths learn the song of a soul's fjyrons, which in turn are shepherded by the monks and protected for generations. The reason why this fjyron is sung into silk is because it must retain a connection to the fabric of creation. Through this link, alongside patient care, guidance from beyond the present, past, and the known world is received, where time is irrelevant. As such, the moths neither capture nor devour the souls of the ancestors, instead repeating what they filtered from the dead.\nThe Order has the sacred duty to study the Elder Scrolls, the knowledge of which they use to aid the Emperor. On occassions priests are sent out to collect more Scrolls for their library in the White-Gold Tower, where the Moth Priests occupy the Middle Floors. Adepts to the Order are gifted with prescient powers, as the wisdom of the ancestors can show the future while in the present. As a result of this, the Order of the Ancestor Moth is given the sole privilege to interpet the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, artifacts which exceed both &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Reading of an Elder Scroll comes at a price, however. Every reading of an Elder Scroll is more profound than the last, and every reading leaves the priest blind for longer periods of time than before. The last Elder Scroll a Moth Priest reads is the Scroll which leaves him permanently blinded. During the last reading, the priest achieves a nearly sublime understanding of the contents of the Scroll. After being blinded, the Moth Priest loses his ability to read a new Elder Scroll.\nThose who have become blinded are brought to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moths\"&gt;Temple of the Ancestor Moths&lt;/a&gt;, which is located within the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil. The monastery is dedicated to serving these members of the order, which are considered noble. At the monastery, the blinded priests live out their lives among the Ancestor Moths which they so loved. Underneath the Monastery, the priests are often found, as these conditions are well suited to the moths. While the priests are blinded, they still raise and nurture the fragile moths, singing to them constantly. They still harvest the silk and spin it into bolts of cloth. This cloth they then also weave, embroidering it with the genealogies and histories of the moth which spun the silk.\nAs the blind monks tend the ancestor moths, so do the monks of the monastery tend to the blind monks, providing them with food, water, tools, furniture, secrecy, anonymity, and purveryors to sell the fruit of their labors. The novitates of the Cult also provided protection. Once upon a time, a monk known as Gudrun came to the monastery, being blinded of visions of what was to come she brought new teachings. Her visions had provided her with the foresight that the monks needed to defend themselves. Since then, the priests train and practice her teachings constantly, which would be known as the way of the peaceful fist.\nThe Elder Scrolls.\nThe Monks keep the Elder Scrolls in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Library%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Imperial Library&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the scrolls were sorted based on a variety of categories, such as scrolls related to specific prophesies, or scrolls related to particular periods of history. Attempting to categorize the Scrolls, however, fails. As whenever they are attempted to be categorized, areas would overlap or contradict one another. Different Monks are even said to have claimed the same scroll to be located in a different section of the tower. When one attempts to count the Elder Scrolls, they are often tricked as well, as the Scrolls do not exist in countable form. Whenever a specific number of Scrolls is counted, this number changes when they are counted again, though a contradicting account by Moth Priestess &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Terran%20Arminus\"&gt;Terran Arminus&lt;/a&gt; states that the notion of the Elder Scrolls moving on their own is false, having personally served as a Scroll Drudge.\nThere are four groups of effects of the Elder Scrolls, each belonging to different individuals.\nThe first group, known as the Naifs, cannot learn a prophecy or gather knowledge from the Scrolls, when they look at the scroll, it is awash in odd lettering and symbols.\nThe second group, known as the Unguarded Intellects, do learn from the Elder Scrolls. They possess knowledge to actually read what is inscribed in the Scroll. However, they have not developed adequate discipline to prevent the mind-shattering effect of reading the Scroll. When these people read an Elder Scroll, they are permanently blinded. This blindness is not without a reward, however, as a fragment of the hidden knowledge is achieved.\nThe final two groups are the Mediated Understanding and the Illuminated Understanding, both of which have only been achieved by the Cult of the Ancestor Moth, as only the Cult has found the discipline required to protect one's mind when reading the scrolls. Novitiates of the Cult must undergo rigorous mental cultivation, often spending a decade or more at their monastery before being permitted to read their first Elder Scrolls. During this time, it is not uncommon for the initiates to suffer from nightmares, even more so as they learn more of the Elder Scrolls and the Ancestors that grant the Cult the wisdom to approach their infinite mysteries. The monks claim this time of cultivation is for the initiates' own protection, as they must have witnessed a number of Unguarded Intellects among their more eager ranks. With the proper training, these cultivated initiates still achieve blindness, though at a far lesser magnitude compared to the Unguarded Intellects. Their vision is fogged slightly, but they retain shape, color, and enough acuity to continue reading normal texts. The information provided by the scroll is also somewhat tempered, and the initiates require both meditation and reflection to fully understand and appreciate what they saw. Monks have often attempted to translate the runes they find on the Elder Scroll after a reading, only to conclude what they wrote down is gibberish, as the messages of the scroll are only written on one's spirit and soul.\nThe Monks of the Ancestor Moth achieve the Illuminated Understanding. Through the continued readings of the Elder Scrolls, these monks become gradually more and more blind, but also receive greater and more detailed knowledge from their readings. Spending their days thinking about their visions, they also receive a stronger mental fortitude. As every Priest slowly loses their vision, the text in the Elder Scrolls gradually takes on characters of the language which is most familiar to the reader, making them more legible. Every monk also has a day of Penultimate Reading, when only knowledge an Elder Scroll provides is that the monk's next reading shall also be his last. When this Penultimate Reading comes is unknowable, as each monk encounters theirs at a different time, though attempts have been made to discover its origins, sufficient evidence lacks.\nBefore the Ultimate Reading, the monks often withdraw to seclusion to reflect upon a lifetime of revelations and dedicate their minds for revealing the last. Following this Ultimate Reading, the monk is permanently blinded. The new blinded monk retains his understanding over a lifetime, and is often able to describe what has been revealed to him in great detail. The Monks also acknowledge that every prophecy recorded within the Elder Scroll may or may not come to pass. No prophecies found within the Scrolls are stuck in the Scroll until they have actually come to pass.\nRitual of the Ancestor Moth.\nThe Ritual of the Ancestor Moth is a ritual performed within Ancestor Glades found across Tamriel, one of which is located within Skyrim. At these glades, Canticle Trees are located. The bark of the trees must be carefully removed using a &lt;a href=\"Draw%20Knife\"&gt;Draw Knife&lt;/a&gt;, a ritual every Moth Priest is taught, but few get the chance to perform. Through this ritual, one can attract Ancestor Moths to themselves. These Ancestor Moths have a connection with ancient magic, which allow Moth Priests to decipher the Scrolls.\nThe higher ranking monks of the Cult have the ability to forego the ritual necessary to enchant the ancestor silk, and prefer to instead wear the moths around the neck and face. Through finely grounding the bark of the &lt;a href=\"Canticle%20Bark\"&gt;Canticle&lt;/a&gt; tree, these monks were able to apply the bark-dust to their bodies. By doing this, and sub-vocalization of certain mantras, ancestor moths would be attracted to the monks. The mantras had to be repeated constantly in order to maintain the skin contact with the moths, an effort the monks had to endure for the sake of cosmic balance. When a monk interrupts these mantras, such as in conversation, the moths burst from his body in a remarkable fashion every time he speaks, only to return to his skin when he resums the, inaudible, chant. Within the Imperial City, moth priests could often be seen walking around surrounded by a cloud of ancestor moths.\nHistory.\nDuring the time of the Cyro-Nordics, the people of Cyrodiil had exported ancestor-silks to the rest of Tamriel, which were silks woven from the native gypsy moth known as the &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt;. When the Cult of the Ancestor Moth came into existence, ancestor and moth became one and the same. In a special, ritualistic, gathering of ancestor silk the singing and hymnal spirits of a person's forebears were caught. The resource is then used to create a variety of costumes or robes.\nThe swishing of this ancestor silk during movement produced an ancestral chorus which was contained within the material during the gathering. This quickly became a sacred custom among the early &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt;, a custom which continued to exist for many years after. The Colovians considered the Cult of the Ancestor Moth bizarre, much like they did with the other Nibenese cults.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance War, each of the tree Alliances had sent out Generals and Legates demanding custody of the Elder Scrolls. The Moth Priests refused, stating the notion that possession of the Scrolls would provide any sort of benefit was absurd. Following this, the Cult of the Ancestor Moth was raided of some of its Elder Scrolls by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. One of the Monks of the Cult studied the war after the Scrolls were stolen, and did notice a pattern between the victories of each of the Alliances and the Scrolls in their possession. This Monk, Brother Euclidius, theorized that the soldiers in an army which possessed an Elder Scroll are open, on an unconscious level, to a collective absorption of the prophecies in the Scrolls. Because of this, the Monk argues that as far as the goal of the soldiers' all align toward victory over their enemies, they also collectively make choices which allign with the prophecies said in the Scrolls. An army with a Scroll is therefore somewhat more likely to make decisions that coincide with the probability of events, leading to victories. Though these tests were based on a rather small scale, leaving room for doubt. Elaborate Temples were created to house the Elder Scrolls. These temples housed the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Chim\"&gt;Elder Scroll of Chim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Ghartok\"&gt;Ghartok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Alma%20Ruma\"&gt;Alma Ruma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Mnem\"&gt;Mnem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Ni-Mohk\"&gt;Ni-Mohk&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20of%20Altadoon\"&gt;Alatadoon&lt;/a&gt;. One priest pointed out that, ironically, one of the Scrolls might show how the War would come to an end, but that with the scrolls stolen, no such reading could be done by an Augur of the Ancestor Moths. The priest also pointed out how the power of the Scrolls had blinded the Alliances of the knowledge they held.\nEntering the Temple of the Ancestor Moths, forces from each of the three alliances cut down any priests who attempted to defend the Scrolls, and took them with them back to the Alliances. Each Alliance had managed to capture two Scrolls from the Cult's hiding places. The Cult tried to retrieve the Scrolls by sending out emisarries, but these were denied the Scrolls. Each of the protectors of the Alliances had their own opinion on returning the scroll. The Covenant acknowledged that the scrolls were needed for the war, and that handing them over would only result in the Pact or Dominion acquiring the Scrolls. The Pact responded with disdain, believing the Priests could not expect them to hand over the Elder Scrolls they worked so hard to obtain. Ordering their guards to deny the emissary henceforth, and waiting for the Grand Warlord to permit a more severe beating whenever the priest showed up. Only the protector of the Aldmeri Dominion was uneasy with denying the emissary the Scrolls, but acknowledged that the Dominion soldiers needed the boons that the Scrolls provided. The Protector revered the scrolls and honored the Moth Priests for their dedication and study, but still made temple guards escort the emissary away.\nThe last Moth Priest within the Imperial City, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Terran%20Arminus\"&gt;Sister Terran Arminus&lt;/a&gt;, had also left an Elder Scroll within the White-Gold Tower. As such, when &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; attempted to reclaim the Tower, the Moth Priest offered her aid. When the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; further came to support the assault, the attack on the Tower took place. While the Tower was reclaimed, it would become clear that Clivia Tharn had not been present, and instead been replaced by a Daedric minion of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. This had been indirectly prophesied within the Elder Scroll, which had said that the Empress Regent would be a shadow of herself, and turn into an enemy to her own people. What was strange about this particular scroll was that, no matter how often it was read the outcome always remained the same, with a blank ending.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the late-Third Era, the Cult of the Ancestor Moth would be used by the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; within Cyrodiil. The &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Fox\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; desired &lt;a href=\"Savilla%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Savilla's Stone&lt;/a&gt; from the catacombs of the Temple of the Ancestor Moth, which was said to be an artifact with magical powers. The Moth Priest had managed to keep the stone secret from the Emperor, who would have had it destroyed or kept locked in the Palace. This did not prevent the theft of the stone, however, which would be used by the Gray Fox for its ability to see past the defenses of the White-Gold Tower.\nOne of the things the Stone revealed to the Gray Fox was a need for a special arrow, known as the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Extrication\"&gt;Arrow of Extrication&lt;/a&gt;, which was in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Fathis%20Aren\"&gt;Fathis Aren&lt;/a&gt;, the court wizard of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;. Only the arrowhead would be obtained, however, as this was the only part in possession of Fathis Aren.\nWhile the arrowhead was being repaired, the Gray Fox used the stone once more, and discovered he needed the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Springheel%20Jak\"&gt;Boots of Springheel Jak&lt;/a&gt; in order to go through with his plans. After acquiring the boots, the Gray Fox needed to spend a little more time with Savilla's Stone before he would be ready to finish planning the raid.\nThe final heist would be the theft of an Elder Scroll from the Imperial Library, a raid which the Gray Fox had been working on for eleven years. Through his final usage of Savilla's Stone, the Gray Fox discovered a way around the locked entrance to the Elder Scrolls, through the sewers of the Imperial City. With the power of the Elder Scroll, the Gray Fox was able to alter history, and named the thief of &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; as Emer Dareloth. As such, the true identity of the Gray Fox was also revealed once more, &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Umbranox\"&gt;Corvus Umbranox&lt;/a&gt;, who would take up his position as Count once more after awarding the Gray Cowl to the thief who helped him in the final heist.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the Elder Scrolls disappeared from the White-Gold Tower, leaving the Imperial Library empty. Later, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;, would attempt to bring about the prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Harkon's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, had been locked away with an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Sun%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; which Lord Harkon sought to obtain in order to bring about the prophecy. After having been given the Scroll, he would spread the word of an Elder Scroll having been found to catch the attention of a Moth Priest. &lt;a href=\"Dexion%20Evicus\"&gt;Dexion Evicus&lt;/a&gt; would be sent to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; escort to find the Scroll. Along the way, he was ambushed by a unit of vampires, who took him to &lt;a href=\"Forebears%27%20Holdout\"&gt;Forebears' Holdout&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he was turned into a thrall to the Vampire &lt;a href=\"Malkus\"&gt;Malkus&lt;/a&gt;, until being killed by Dawnguard forces.\nAfter being taken from Forebears' Hideout, Dexion would read the Elder Scroll to the faction of his liberator, providing them with the knowledge about the Tyranny of the Sun. However, not the entire prophecy could be known, as the Moth Priest needed two other Elder Scrolls to add to the information. To find these Scrolls, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; had to go around Skyrim to retrieve them. Upon returning with the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll of Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Blood%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll of Blood&lt;/a&gt; however, Dexion would have been permanently blinded. In order to read the Elder Scrolls, Dexion taught the Dragonborn the ritual revolving around the Canticle Tree and the Ancestor Moths. With this knowledge, the Dragonborn was able to read the Elder Scrolls in &lt;a href=\"Ancestor%20Glade\"&gt;Ancestor Glade&lt;/a&gt;, after which the Dragonborn would obtain &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, and defeat &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if the Dragonborn made the prophecy of the Tyranny of the Sun come true or not."}

Khartag created the Ropefish as a way to free slaves from the Dark Elves of House Telvanni in Vvardenfell. The word about the Ropefish Gang began to spread around the plantations of Vvardenfell, many of the slaves had contacted the Ropefish, leading to many successful escapes at the hands of the Ropefish. The group would then get attention for the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;, who saw a business opportunity in the form of the Ropefish. &lt;a href=\"Avrusa%20Duleri\"&gt;Avrusa Duleri&lt;/a&gt; had talked with Khartag to discuss business but Khartag had denied the offer but had also told them off, not realizing the repercussions from messing with the Camonna. In retaliation, Duleri had the Camonna Tong raid the Ropefish base, killing the slaves and the abolitionist residing in the area. In the end, Khartag was stabbed by a poisoned dagger, leaving him on the cold ground of the Khartag Cavern. The Camonna Tong was terminated in Khartag Point with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, a traveler wandering Tamriel.\nLegacy.\nOn his deathbed, Khartag would name his subordinate, &lt;a href=\"Nakhul\"&gt;Nakhul&lt;/a&gt;, the next leader of the Ropefish, continuing their operation throughout Vvardenfell. Unfortunately, the Ropefish Gang had disbanded before &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, while the Camonna Tong still worked throughout Vvardenfell. Even though the Ropefish had died out, Khartag himself would not be forgotten by his people. The area the Ropefish operated out of was renamed to &lt;a href=\"Khartag%20Point\"&gt;Khartag Point&lt;/a&gt;, in his honor. At one point, an Orcish warrior had traveled to Khartag Point and was dared by his peers to jump off the cliff, which led to their demise. As time went on, many Orsimer would make pilgrimages to Khartag Point to pay their respects. A Shrine to &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; had sunken in the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; and a new one needed to be constructed. &lt;a href=\"Duma%20gro-Lag\"&gt;Duma gro-Lag&lt;/a&gt; was an Orcish worshipper of Boethiah and decided to build a new shrine atop of Khartag Point.

A year earlier, the Covenant led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Serien\"&gt;General Serien&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign in Morrowind. They besieged the province from as far as &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; at the city of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Isle of Bleakrock&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. By 2E 583, Khartag had abandoned the Covenant and established a group called the &lt;a href=\"Ropefish%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Ropefish&lt;/a&gt;. Khartag was approached by the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;, a group of gangsters prominent in Vvardenfell, with a deal that made freeing slaves more profitable, and risky for the slaves. Khartag denied this deal and insulted the Camonna Tong; this resulted in the gang raiding Khartag Point and fighting the Ropefish Warriors. An outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; entered the cave and defeated the Camonna Tong as well as the Dreughs inhabiting the cave. Khartag died from a poisoned blade, but the Ropefish lived on and continued to free slaves across the Inner Sea.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the tale of Khartag would spread across the island; another legend surrounded the area when an Orc was dared to jump off the point.

A new statue to Boethiah was built on top of Khartag Point; it was one of the few recorded locations of &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;."}

Native Khajiit fish in the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Sea\"&gt;Topal Sea&lt;/a&gt; here and tend marshy bamboo farms. Cultists with the power to command the fury of the sea lurk in the island's hidden caves and tide-swept grottoes. The nearby waters are patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; \"enforcers\" who are known to interrupt trading ships, while enforcing a treaty they made with the Khajiit many years ago.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Kingdom of Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; was outraged by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to win over the locals of Khenarthi's Roost, citing an ancient treaty that gives them ownership of the island. Any trading ships carrying cargo in violation of one of the treaty provisions must hand over their cargo to the Maormer or be taken prisoner. Despite the Dominion's attempts to find a peaceful solution, negotiations failed, bringing both sides closer to conflict. By working with the sea-cultists, the Maormer planned to use their command of the sea to expel the Dominion from Khenarthi's Roost.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Khenarthi's Roost and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nKhenarthi's Roost features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests.

It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Khenarthi's Roost. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another. &lt;a href=\"Repeatable%20quests\"&gt;Repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards.\nSkyshards.\nSix Skyshards can be found in Khenarthi's Roost totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

One story claims Khunzar-ri manifested out of moonlight by Jone and Jode. A second story claims he was found inside a box at a shrine to &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;. A third story claims &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheggorath&lt;/a&gt; caused Khunzar-ri's birth when he cheered up a grumpy Alkosh, and from a tear of joy from Alkosh, Khunzar-ri was born.\nAdventures.\nMany tales speak of Khunzar-ri's adventures and teachings. One tale claims Khunzar-ri outwitted a dozen Ogres, while another claimed he had adopted a lost female &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt;. This Alfiq would go on to serve as Khunzar-ri's scribe and become enemies with Khunzar-ri's lover, &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime in the Merethic Era, &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; and his horde of dragons came to dominate the land. Kaalgrontiid hoped to claim the Moon's power and become &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;'s equal. To stop them, Khunzar-ri recruited four companions, &lt;a href=\"Nurarion%20the%20Perfect\"&gt;Nurarion the Perfect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flinthild%20Demon-Hunter\"&gt;Flinthild Demon-Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, Anequina Sharp-Tongue, and &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;. Following the suggestion of Cadwell, Khunzar-ri presented Jode's Core to the dragons. However, he tricked them into storing their energy within it in the guise that they would combine the lunar power with their own. The dragons were subsequently weakened, and Khunzar-ri managed to seal them away in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCadwell betrayed Khunzar-ri shortly after by killing him with a backstab, as he hoped to acquire the power sealed away in Jode's Core. Khunzar-ri was buried within the &lt;a href=\"Moonlit%20Cove\"&gt;Moonlit Cove&lt;/a&gt;."}

Its treasures and even the moons above will be ours!\"\n\"I do not think so, foul demon,\" Khunzar-ri said. \"Elsweyr and all it contains, even the moons above, are under my protection.\"\nThe demon laughed. \"You cannot stop us, little cat-thing! You are nothing but soft flesh and fur, while we are scales and teeth and claws!\"\nKhunzar-ri thought for a moment. \"Perhaps you are right, oh massive demon. You are certainly too much for even my prodigious strength.\" Then he thought to himself, \"That is why I shall gather a Kra'Jun, a company of heroes. Together, we will find a way to stop you, foul demon!\"\nSo, while the demons ravaged Elsweyr and chased the moons through the sky, Khunzar-ri went on a quest to form his Kra'Jun. He gathered the greatest champions of the age and convinced them to do what they had never done before\u2014work together. He called to his side the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, Nurarion the Perfect, who wielded the Subtle Blade. He coerced Flinthild Demon-Hunter to leave her castle in the far north. He used sweet words and flattered &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharp-Tongue\"&gt;Anequina Sharp-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, queen and moon-priest of the &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Ne Quin-al&lt;/a&gt; pride, until she agreed to stand beside him. Finally, Khunzar-ri asked he who would become the &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%20the%20Betrayer%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; to lend him his sword, for there was no finer warrior in all the land.\nWith the Kra'Jun assembled, Khunzar-ri and his companions set forth to defeat Kaalgrontiid and his demon brothers. For forty-one days and forty-one nights, great and terrible battles raged across Elsweyr. The Kra'Jun won some of these battles and they lost some of these battles, but they could not find a way to kill or drive off the demons. It was he who would become the Betrayer who eventually made the suggestion. \"The demons seek to consume the moons. Why not let them have them? Or, to be more precise, let them think we have surrendered and acquiesced to their plans.\"\n\"A brilliant idea!\" Khunzar-ri concurred. \"But instead of consuming the moons, we let the moons steal the life from them!\"\nAnequina the moon-priest nodded in understanding. \"This one can do that. This one can talk to &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; and ask them to consume the demons.\"\nThen, Khunzar-ri used every bit of guile and charm he possessed to convince the demons that the Kra'Jun was now willing to help them. He told them where to meet, at a moon temple of renown, and waited while Anequina communed with the moons. \"It is not in the nature of Jone and Jode to fully consume the demons,\" Anequina said, \"but Jode will take enough of their life force to weaken them. That should allow us to contain them.\"\n\"I know just the place,\" proclaimed Nurarion the Perfect. \"An ancient place of power, forgotten and long abandoned. We can trap the demons there.\"\nKhunzar-ri was proud of the wisdom of his Kra'Jun, but he needed a way to lure the weakened demons into the trap. They had to enter the place of their own accord, for even weakened demons were too dangerous for the Kra'Jun to deal with. So Anequina and Flinthild put their heads together and devised a plan. They told Khunzar-ri, and he smiled and twitched his tail. \"Fragrant!\" he said.\nSo the demons arrived at the moon temple and Anequina, acting as moon-priest instead of queen, opened a connection between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and Jode in the form of a shaft of moonlight. The demons, greedy and hungry for lunar power, eagerly stepped into the moonlight, but immediately realized they had been tricked. They roared in pain as a portion of their life force was drawn away by Jode. It took Kaalgrontiid every bit of his remaining strength, but he resisted and rallied his brothers. They broke free of the shaft of treacherous moonlight and fled into the wilderness.\nAnequina then deposited a sliver of the demon-infused moonlight in an urn and gave it to Flinthild. Flinthild and the Kra'Jun took the urn to the ancient place of power, while Khunzar-ri went to do what he did best: convince the demons to follow the lure and walk into the trap of their own free will. And that is what he did, before the Betrayer earned his name. As you shall hear.\nThese are the words, and the words are true."}

I'm found!\"\nAnd indeed the little &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt; was found. Khunzar-ri examined the quivering handful, seeing burrs, bits of twig, and more stuck in her matted fur. \"You have traveled far?\"\n\"Yes. I wanted to see the world before I was sent to the temple.\"\n\"This I can respect, little one. But why do you lament leaving your home?\"\n\"Well, because I'm lost and hungry.\"\n\"Ah, the hunger we can fix right away.\" And Khunzar-ri set some scrumptious fish cakes down in front of the young Alfiq. \"As for being lost, consider this. Are you not exactly where you need to be right now?\"\nBetween bites, she said, \"I don't think so. Wouldn't I know where I was if this is where I need to be?\"\n\"Not necessarily, my friend. Lost can be a point of view you adopt when fear or confusion overtakes you. If you instead think about how you wanted to see the world ... well, here you are seeing it.\"\n\"Are you saying that I'm lost only because I think I'm lost? But because I'm doing what I wanted to do, I'm not lost?\"\n\"Only if you say so and mean it!\"\n\"Then I'm not lost!\"\nKhunzar-ri chuckled. \"Good, my not-lost friend. Would you care to join me on my travels for a time? I, too, would love to see the world right now.\"\nAnd so the young Alfiq joined Khunzar-ri, and the two enjoyed many adventures together."}

{"id": "9990", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9990", "title": "Kill Camera", "text": "Kill Cameras are a game mechanic and featured in that allow players to kill enemies with a final, deadly, and cinematically delivered strike. Kill Cameras can be done on almost every foe in the game. Characters are capable of performing cinematic kills on the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; or on other characters as well.\nMechanics.\nWhile performing a Kill Camera, a short animation is played, making the Dragonborn vulnerable to attack and unable to carry out any other task for a couple of seconds until the animation has played through. Kill Cameras also depend on the position of the enemy in relation to the player character, upon attacking. For instance, striking an enemy from the flank or behind produces different finishers than a strike met head-on. If an &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted weapon&lt;/a&gt; is used, its enchantment will be displayed during the killcam as well. Likewise, poisoned weapons and &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound weapons&lt;/a&gt; can also be used with similar results. While a kill camera is being performed both characters are immune to damage during the animation.\nCombat conditions.\nKill Cameras will only be performed if killing the enemy will take the player out of the combat mode. This does not mean only the last enemy. Killing an enemy while sneaking and remaining undetected will allow a Kill Camera, even if there are more enemies present.\nWeapon conditions.\nKill Cameras can be performed with almost all &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and even bare fists. In addition, Werewolf or Vampire Lord finishers can also be executed. Wielding a &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon and a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; does not void one's ability to perform a Kill Camera. Certain One-Handed Kill Cameras cannot be performed while dual-wielding. In addition, certain One-Handed Kill Cameras can only be performed if a &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; is equipped. Some Kill Cameras can only be performed if certain patches or DLCs are installed.\nOne-move finishers.\nIt is possible to use a Kill Camera on a person with full health, but requires the opponent to be vastly outclassed in comparison to the player. A backstab attack with the &lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20Blade%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Assassin's Blade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; will often produce full-health finishers.\nActivating Kill Cameras.\nKill Cameras are random most of the time, but some particular conditions will enable them:\nDisabling Slow Motion Kill Cameras.\nThe Kill Camera has disadvantages, especially if the Dragonborn prefers sneaking and ranged attacks. For example, if one enemy in a group is sneak-killed with a bow, the others are alerted and react in normal speed, while the Dragonborn is stuck in a slow movement animation. Moreover, missiles (including magical bolt attacks) may miss the target, that simply moves out of position while the animation is played, resulting in a Miss Camera rather than a kill one.\nIt is possible to disable the Kill Camera on PC by adding the following two lines to the Skyrim.ini file located by default in the Documents/Mygames/Skyrim folder:\ncodice_1\ncodice_2"}

A grove of trees in the tundra opens to a small campsite. At night, there may be vampires milling about the exterior camp. In the day the creatures will be inside the cave.\nThe entrance to the cave opens to a passage down to the north. This leads to a roughly square room with two wolves. Another passage at the north end jogs right (east) and opens to the southwest corner of another room. The room contains what appears to be a place for watching ceremonies, with a raised platform against the north wall holding a table with bloody bones arranged in a bowl, and benches arranged in front. There are several vampires, including the leader. The vampires all use &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lightning bolt&lt;/a&gt; attacks, which, when combined, can do significant damage.\nAfter the leader is slain, the rest of the small cave can be explored. Next to the table is a novice-locked chest. Another raised area against the south wall has a table on top of which is the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the left wall is an opening that leads to a smaller room. An empty cage is against the left (east) wall, while a table next to the cage holds the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Incident%20in%20Necrom\"&gt;Incident in Necrom&lt;/a&gt;\".

I've been a trainer of the warrior arts for many spans - cut from the cloth of a great lineage of knights, &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and even a distant sellsword or two.\nIt's with this knowledge that I'll try to pen a brief treatise on the subtle art of war. Not mage fire, not archery or criminal throat-slitting. But war. Man on man with nothing but a fine bit of steel between them.\nThe first thing you'll need to learn is how to block. The best way not to get killed is not to let the other man hit you. Use a shield, use it well. Now, you'll get tired from this. You may even get a little hurt. But a blocked blow is much better than a landed one. Over time you'll get better, eventually shrugging off even the mightiest of hits.\nBut beware - your foes, if they're not base cur bandits, will know how to counter you. They'll hit you with everything they've got in, order to open you up, and keep on hitting. So watch for these powerful attacks. While it's still better to absorb the impact with a quarter inch of steel, it's best to try to just step out of the way.\nRemember, against spells your blocking is useless until you're trained. So get up on mages quickly and let them eat steel. Deserves them right for using a witch weapon.\nYou can also block without a shield as well - just cross that blow with your sword, though this isn't nearly as effective. And if you decide you're fancy and want to wield two blades, you can't block at all, so don't even try. Without both hands on the hilt you just won't have the strength to counter blows.\nBut, with a weapon in each hand you are much more likely to take your opponent down quickly. The best defense, some say.\nTo wield the blade there are some fundamentals. Quick strikes are always good, but can be repelled, so watch for your opponent's own defensive postures. Wait for an opening, or create one with your own heavy attacks. Hammers hit hardest but are slow. Same with maces and all blunt weaponry. Axes are a nice middle ground, while swords are the quickest but won't stagger your opponent as efficiently with the hard hits.\nKeep an eye not to get too exhausted - always try to save a little of your strength to counter blows, or even run! Never let yourself get cornered or surrounded. Pick your threats - weak spellcasters that can hurt you quick are the first things I fell.\nThe shield is not only a defensive tool. Put your shoulder into it and bash your opponent. This sends them flying and opens them up for quick counter assaults. Even better, put extra weight into it and power bash your opponent. If they're small this will put them on their knees.\nBigger opponents cannot be staggered by heavy attacks. Only the power bash will really knock them around and create openings for you to exploit.\nSo again - block, counter, bash! Hit them when they're down! They'll show no mercy, so why should you? Battle is about the offense, about catching your foe early and never relenting. Keep moving, keep swinging. If you consider yourself overly powerful, pick up a two-handed weapon and see your foes fall before you like wheat stalks. They're slow and unwieldy, but they shatter bones and cleave flesh better than anything.\nThe graves are filled with many a mediocre swordsman. If you don't have the stomach for war, try a monk's work. But if you do travel the path of the warrior, learn the basics and keep your head firmly planted on your shoulders - or someone's bound to lob it off."}

The stages of the quest vary slightly depending upon what faction has been joined back in \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nPreparing the attack.\nDawnguard alignment.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; questline has been followed, instructions are received from &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; to return to &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt; to formulate a plan of attack. After speaking to Isran, he will agree that now is the time to strike the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; and will call all the members of the Dawnguard into the main lobby for a rousing speech:\nIsran: \"For too long we've allowed these vampires to poison the night and kill our people! Now we finally have the means to strike back! We now have Auriel's Bow. The gods themselves have favored us and we must answer with action!The time has come to finally put an end to Harkon and his unholy prophecy! We will march on their lair and destroy those wretched abominations so they can no longer corrupt our world.! This is our fight, and this is our fate. This is the time of the Dawnguard!\"\"\nAfter the speech, Isran, &lt;a href=\"Sorine%20Jurard\"&gt;Sorine Jurard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Celann\"&gt;Celann&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agmaer\"&gt;Agmaer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gunmar\"&gt;Gunmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florentius%20Baenius\"&gt;Florentius Baenius&lt;/a&gt; if \"&lt;a href=\"Bolstering%20the%20Ranks\"&gt;Bolstering the Ranks&lt;/a&gt;\" was completed, &lt;a href=\"Ingjard\"&gt;Ingjard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Beleval\"&gt;Beleval&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Troll\"&gt;Armored Troll&lt;/a&gt; will leave the fort and begin their long trek towards &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt; to join in the final battle. Upon reaching the shores of the island, they will wait for the Dragonborn before storming the castle once the Dragonborn speaks to Isran.\nHeading across the bridge will cause the &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; statues that line the bridge to animate and attack. Several vampires will pour out of the castle, including &lt;a href=\"Rargal%20Thrallmaster\"&gt;Rargal Thrallmaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Modhna\"&gt;Modhna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Namasur\"&gt;Namasur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stalf\"&gt;Stalf&lt;/a&gt;, and the Death Hound &lt;a href=\"Garmr\"&gt;Garmr&lt;/a&gt;. These are the court's lesser members and can be challenging in groups but pose little threat on their own. This is one of the few opportunities where firing &lt;a href=\"Sunhallowed%20Arrow\"&gt;Sunhallowed Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s into the sun with Auriel's Bow will provide additional help, provided that it is daytime.\nOnce these foes are dead, Castle Volkihar can be entered. Florentius remains behind to guard the entrance and Ingjard the boat leading back to the mainland, while the others head in. Inside, the remaining vampires will attack, namely &lt;a href=\"Hestla\"&gt;Hestla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salonia%20Caelia\"&gt;Salonia Caelia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fura%20Bloodmouth\"&gt;Fura Bloodmouth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orthjolf\"&gt;Orthjolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vingalmo\"&gt;Vingalmo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garan%20Marethi\"&gt;Garan Marethi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ronthil\"&gt;Ronthil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feran%20Sadri\"&gt;Feran Sadri&lt;/a&gt;, along with the remaining Death Hound, &lt;a href=\"CuSith\"&gt;CuSith&lt;/a&gt;. These vampires are the higher-ranked members and are very dangerous, but tend not to congregate. Fura, Hestla, Orthjolf and Salonia all wield leveled weapons along with their Vampiric Drain spells and tend to stay in the main hall. Vingalmo, Garan Marethi, and Feran Sadri are all powerful spellcasters and prefer to run along the upper balconies while hosing the area with powerful Destruction spells and Ronthil will take refuge in the room full of coffins and use a leveled bow and arrows if confronted. The Dragonborn may choose to join their Dawnguard allies in cleansing the castle of its vampire presence, or hide and watch instead.\nAlternatively, it is possible to ignore the vampires and rush into the cathedral directly, skipping the entire fight until the final confrontation with Harkon. Once Harkon is killed, all the vampires outside will be found dead afterward. Some of the Dawnguard members may be found perished too unless they were aided, as they can be overwhelmed if several of the vampires focused on them.\nEither way, proceed to the door to the Volkihar Cathedral, where Lord Harkon waits.\nVampire alignment.\nIf the Volkihar Vampires have been sided with, then after speaking with Serana head directly to Castle Volkihar. Several members of the court will be loitering around the castle as usual, each with some additional dialogue relating to the finding Auriel's bow. Follow the objective marker and enter the castle's cathedral.\nConfrontation with Harkon.\nUpon entering the cathedral, Harkon will be waiting in his &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; form and will initiate a conversation with Serana:\nHarkon: \"So, you've returned. Is your... pet keeping you entertained?\"\nSerana: \"You know why we're here.\"\nHarkon: \"Of course I do. You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I provided for you and thrown it all away for this... pathetic being/half-breed vampire.\"\nSerana: \"Provided for me? Are you insane? You've destroyed our family. You've killed other vampires. All over some prophecy that we barely understand. No more. I'm done with you. You will not touch him/her.\"\nHarkon: \"\"So, I see this dragon has fangs. Your voice drips with the venom of your mother's influence. How alike you've become.\nSerana: \"No...Because unlike her, I'm not afraid of you. Not anymore.\"\nHarkon: \"\"And you...\nAt this point he turns to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. The following conversation between Harkon and the Dragonborn will vary slightly depending upon what faction has been joined:\nDawnguard alignment.\n\"It appears I have you to thank for turning my daughter against me. I knew it was only a matter of time before she'd return with hatred in her heart.\"\nHatred born of your neglect: \"A small price to pay for the betterment of our kind.\"\nThis in turn leads to three options to choose from:\nI would never harm Serana. She's too important to me: \"Then my daughter is truly lost. She died the moment she accepted a mortal into her life.\"\nI'm only here to kill you: \"I see. Interesting that you can set aside your morals when it suits you.\"\nThis is about more than killing vampires: \"Ah, of course. The prophecy. You've come here to stop me from taking Auriel's Bow and shrouding the world in darkness.\"\nVampire alignment.\n\"It appears I have you to thank for turning my daughter against me. I knew it was only a matter of time before your ambition outgrew your loyalty.\"\nLoyalty? You never intended to let me live: \"A small price to pay for the betterment of our kind.\"\nYou're an insult to our kind: \"Oh, come now... spare me your notions of kinship. You've simply used Serana in an attempt to take away what should rightfully be mine.\"\nThis in turn leads to three options to choose from:\nI would never use Serana like that: \"The vampire is eternal, and with immortality comes the revelation that these bonds never endure... it's fleeting, momentary at best.\"\nNo, I'm here to prevent our annihilation: \"Ah, I see you've been speaking to Valerica and she's convinced you that eternal night will plunge us into war with daytime dwellers. If only it were so. With the world in shadow, we would never tire, never weaken... more than a match for their pitiful armies.\"\nThe bow belongs to me now: \"Finally, a trace of honesty in our little conversation. How does it feel to hold the fate of the vampire in your grasp. Exhilarating, isn't it? \"\nFinally, the last set of options is the same for both alignments and they end in having to choose between giving him the bow or refusing. Both options result in him becoming hostile.\nEnough of this!: \"Yes, quite. I'm growing weary of speaking to you and my traitorous daughter. I'll give you a single chance to turn over the bow to me. There will not be a second.\"\nFinal battle.\nLord Harkon uses the Bats Night Power when damaged enough and begins attacking from above on the balcony. After his health is depleted, he will retreat to the blood fountain and cast a unique, complexly scripted spell called \"Shadow Shield,\" which uses the same mechanics as the &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Masters&lt;/a&gt; drain effect. This scripted spell makes Harkon invincible and acts as a mass vampiric drain spell absorbing 4 points of Health, Magicka and Stamina from a huge area, healing him. Using Auriel's Bow, however, will cause his barrier to vanish. He will summon Gargoyles, which will necessitate close range combat. The process repeats itself until he dies with a unique death sequence of an explosion of bats and his final words calling out to his daughter: \"No... Serana... your own father...\"\nIf the bow was given to him, it can be looted off his body along with his &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Royal%20Armor\"&gt;Vampire Royal Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harkon%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Harkon's Sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpilogue.\nOnce the battle is over, Isran or Garan Marethi, depending upon alignment, will walk into the cathedral and congratulate the Dragonborn for ending Harkon's plans.\nIsran.\nIsran: \"It's over. He's dead, and the prophecy dies with him. I... I suppose this is difficult for you.\"\nSerana: \"I think my father died a long time ago. This was just... the end of something else. I did what needed to be done. Nothing more.\"\nIsran: \"\"I think perhaps... I think you did more than that. You have my thanks.\"\"So, the beast is destroyed. Not only that, but Auriel's Bow is in safe hands. The Dawnguard will now be dedicated to safeguarding it, making sure that the prophecy will never come to pass. You've served Skyrim well. Even with these vampires gone, the fight still isn't completely over. Once we're settled in back at the fort, there will be more work to do. We'd be honored to have you join us.\"\"\nGaran Marethi.\nGaran Marethi: \"Lord Harkon defeated. I never imagined I'd see the day. My congratulations on defeating Harkon. Clearly, you are the superior vampire. You are the new Master; we bow to your power. A power which, I note, includes Auriel's Bow. My lady, you have my deepest sympathies. I am sure this was not easy for you.\"\nSerana: \"He was out of control Garan. It had to be done. I'm not happy about this. He... he was still my father. But I suppose my father really died a long time ago. This was just the end of something else.\"\nGaran Marethi: \"Of course my dear. All will be well now.\"\nIf the Dragonborn is a member of the Volkihar Vampires, Castle Volkihar becomes a &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;, with every item there belonging to the Dragonborn. The quest ends with Serana saying a few words about her father and asking if she can come along on future adventures, with the Dragonborn's permission.\nIf the Dragonborn returns to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; after slaying Harkon, they can speak to Valerica and inform her of her husband's demise. She will thank the Dragonborn and will be in her laboratory on arrival to Castle Volkihar. She will offer an explanation of how the Dragonborn can survive return trips to the Soul Cairn and offer any potions or ingredients in her freshly restocked lab for free. She will decline to provide blood for &lt;a href=\"Bloodcursed%20Elven%20Arrow\"&gt;Bloodcursed Elven Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s."}

King's Guard itself borders the &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Hills\"&gt;Cambray Hills&lt;/a&gt; region to the southwest while it borders the &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; area to the east. King's Guard is very mountainous, the shores of King's Guard are located far down below the central plains of the area. Large escarpments are in between the region and the beaches. The northwestern hills of the mountains has large deposits of &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; located in them; this was one of the reasons why the town Crosswych was founded.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Cath Bedraud; The Foothills.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; to destroy and corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to do his bidding. The war so moved northwards to the King's Guard region after &lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Reborn\"&gt;Faolchu the Reborn&lt;/a&gt; was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Camlorn\"&gt;Siege of Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; constructed a redoubt on the southwestern foothills of King's Guard that was known as the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard%20Redoubt\"&gt;Lion Guard Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. The Redoubt was used as the base of the army in the Battle, and it managed to secure the surrounding locations. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Merovec%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Merovec's Folly&lt;/a&gt; were captured by the Lion Guard and the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Talisman\"&gt;Midnight Talisman&lt;/a&gt; was used to enter the ruins of Cath Bedraud. &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Bloodthorn Cult, used Zombies and Bloodthorn Warriors to defeat the Lion Guard but it proved to be in vain. The battle continued to Cath Bedraud.\nBattle of Cath Bedraud; The Crypt.\nThe inner sanctum was blocked by a powerful ward that required the Midnight Talisman to enter the crypt. The Lion Guard had help in the form of a mysterious warrior known in legends as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige defeated the battalion on the surface and opened Bedraud, letting the Lion Guard swarm in the inner catacombs. Angof was in the inner sanctum and prepared to reawaken the Ancient Kings of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt;, so he could unleash his wrath into Glenumbra and eventually High Rock. The Vestige encountered him and defeated his foul Bloodthorn &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. The entire Glenumbra region was saved and the conflict had finally ended.

I encourage you to seek them out at your favorite bookseller.\nWe last left Eslaf Erol fleeing for his life, which was a common enough for him. He had stolen a lot of gold, and one particularly large gem, from a rich man in Jallenheim named Suoibud. The thief fled north, spending the gold wildly, as thieves generally do, for all sorts of illicit pleasures, which would no doubt disturb the gentleman or lady reading this, so I will not go into detail.\nThe one thing he held onto was the gem.\nHe didn't keep it because of any particular attachment, but because he did not know anyone rich enough to buy it from him. And so he found himself in the ironic situation of being penniless and having in his possession a gem worth millions.\n\"Will you give me a room, some bread, and a flagon of beer in exchange for this?\" he asked a tavernkeep in the little village of Kravenswold, which was so far north, it was half situated on the Sea of Ghosts.\nThe tavernkeep looked at it suspiciously.\n\"It's just crystal,\" Eslaf said quickly. \"But isn't it pretty?\"\nLet me see that,' said a young armor-clad woman at the end of the bar. Without waiting permission, she picked up the gem, studied it, and smiled not very sweetly at Eslaf. 'Would you join me at my table?\n\"I'm actually in a bit of a hurry,\" replied Eslaf, holding out his hand for the stone. 'Another time?'\n'Out of respect for my friend, the tavernkeep here, my men and I leave our weapons behind when we come in here,' the woman said casually, not handing the gem back, but picking up a broom that was sitting against the bar. 'I can assure you, however, that I can use this quite effectively as a blunt instrument. Not a weapon, of course, but an instrument to stun, medicinally crush a bone or two, and then - once it is on the inside \u2026'\n'Which table?' asked Eslaf quickly.\nThe young woman led him to a large table in the back of the tavern where ten of the biggest Nord brutes Eslaf had ever seen were sitting. They looked at him with polite disinterest, as if he were a strange insect, worth briefly studying before crushing.\n'My name is Laicifitra,' she said, and Eslaf blinked. That was the name Suoibud had uttered before Eslaf had made his escape. 'And these are my lieutenants. I am the commander of a very large independent army of noble knights. The very best in Skyrim. Most recently we were given a job to attack a vineyard in The Aalto to force its owner, a man named Laernu, to sell to our employer, a man named Suoibud. Our payment was to be a gem of surpassing size and quality, quite famous and unmistakable.\"\n\"We did as we were asked, and when we went to Suoibud to collect our fee, he told us he was unable to pay, due to a recent burglary. In the end, though, he saw things our way, and paid us an amount of gold almost equal to the worth of the prize jewel \u2026 It did not empty out his treasury entirely, but it meant he was unable to buy the land in the Aalto after all. So we were not paid enough, Suoibud has taken a heavy financial blow, and Laernu's prize crop of Jazbay has been temporarily destroyed for naught,\" Laicifitra took a long, slow drink of her mead before continuing. \"Now, I wonder, could you tell me, how came you in the possession of the gem we were promised?\"\nEslaf did not answer at once.\nInstead, he took a piece of bread from the plate of the savage bearded barbarian on his left and ate it.\n'I'm sorry,' he said, his mouth full. 'May I? Of course, I couldn't stop you from taking the gem even if I wanted to, and as a matter of fact, I don't mind at all. It's also useless to deny how it came into my possession. I stole it from your employer. I certainly didn't mean you or your noble knights any harm by it, but I can understand why the word of a thief is not suitable for one such as yourself.'\n'No,' replied Laicifitra, frowning, but her eyes showing amusement. 'Not suitable at all.'\n'But before you kill me,' Eslaf said, grabbing another piece of bread. 'Tell me, how suitable is it for noble knights such as yourself to be paid twice for one job? I have no honor myself, but I would have thought that since Suoibud took a profit loss to pay you, and now you have the gem, your handsome profit is not entirely honorable.'\nLaicifitra picked up the broom and looked at Eslaf. Then she laughed, 'What is your name, thief?'\n'Eslaf,' said the thief.\n'We will take the gem, as it was promised to us. But you are right. We should not be paid twice for the same job. So,' said the warrior woman, putting down the broomstick. 'You are our new employer. What would you have your own army do for you?\"\nMany people could find quite a few good uses for their own army, but Eslaf was not among them. He searched his brain, and finally it was decided that it was a debt to be paid later. For all her brutality, Laicifitra was an simple woman, raised, he learned, by the very army she commanded. Fighting and honor were the only things she knew.\nWhen Eslaf left Kravenswold, he had an army at his beck and call, but not a coin to his name. He knew he would have to steal something soon.\nAs he wandered the woods, scrounging for food, he was beset with a strange feeling of familiarity. These were the very woods he had been in as a child, also starving, also scrounging. When he came out on the road, he found that he had come back on the kingdom where he had been raised by the dear, stupid, shy maid Drusba.\nHe was in Erolgard.\nIt had fallen even deeper into despair since his youth. The shops that had refused him food were boarded up, abandoned. The only people left were hollow, hopeless figures, so ravaged by taxation, despotism, and barbaric raids that they were too weak to flee. Eslaf realized how lucky he was to have gotten out in his youth.\nThere was, however, a castle and a king. Eslaf immediately made plans to raid the treasury. As usual, he watched the place carefully, taking note of the security and the habits of the guards. This took some time. In the end, he realized there was no security and no guards.\nHe walked in the front door, and down the empty corridors to the treasury. It was full of precisely nothing, except one man. He was Eslaf's age, but looked much older.\n'There's nothing to steal,' he said. 'Would that there was.'\nKing Ynohp, though prematurely aged, had the same white blond hair and blue eyes like broken glass that Eslaf had. In fact, he resembled Suoibud and Laicifitra as well. And though Eslaf had never met the ruined landlord of the Aalto, Laernu, he looked him too. Not surprisingly, since they were quintuplets.\n'So, you have nothing?' asked Eslaf, gently.\n'Nothing except my poor kingdom, curse it,' the King grumbled. 'Before I came to the throne, it was powerful and rich, but I inherited none of that, only the title. For my entire life, I've had responsibility thrust on my shoulders, but never had the means to handle it properly. I look over the desolation which is my birthright, and I hate it. If it were possible to steal a kingdom, I would not lift a finger to stop you.\"\nIt was, it turned out, quite possible to steal a kingdom. Eslaf became known as Ynohp, a deception easily done given their physical similarities. The real Ynohp, taking the name of Ylekilnu, happily left his demesne, becoming eventually a simple worker in the vineyards of The Aalto. For the first time free of responsibility, he fell into his new life with gusto, the years melting off him.\nThe new Ynohp called in his favor with Laicifitra, using her army to restore peace to the kingdom of Erolgard. Now that it was safe, business and commerce began to return to the land, and Eslaf reduced the tyrannical taxes to encourage it to grow. Upon hearing that, Suoibud, ever nervous about losing his money, elected to return to the land of his birth. When he died years later, out of greed, he had refused to name someone an heir, so the kingdom received its entire fortune.\nEslaf used part of the gold to buy the vineyards of The Aalto, after hearing great things of it from Ynohp.\nAnd so it was that Erolgard was returned to its previous prosperity by the fifth born child of King Ytluaf - Eslaf Erol, beggar, thief, warrior (of sorts), and king."}

He was the father of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malyon\"&gt;Prince Malyon&lt;/a&gt; and husband to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Palolel\"&gt;Queen Palolel&lt;/a&gt;. During his reign the city was at war with the city of &lt;a href=\"Delodiil\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt;, whose citizens worshipped &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. Abagarlas's forces included Molag Bal's &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Close to the end of the war, Anumaril has made preparations to activate the relic called &lt;a href=\"Mortuum%20Vivicus\"&gt;Mortuum Vivicus&lt;/a&gt; which would drain all the life from Delodiil. This plan wasn't implemented as a group of warriors from Delodiil, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Weapon\"&gt;Prismatic Weapon&lt;/a&gt; imbued with Meridia's power, managed to enter the city and stop the ritual. During the final battle of the war, the entire royal family of Abagarlas was put to the sword and the city itself was destroyed by Meridia.\nHe is also known as the powerful archmage who created the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Towers\"&gt;Staff of Towers&lt;/a&gt;, which is said to be able to bend and shape the time itself. It was created by him sometime during or shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The staff consisted of eight segments, each being a semblance of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt; in its Dance. Seven fragments were later borne by White-Gold Knights to distant Fold-Places, where they were hidden. The last segment, also known as Segment One, remained with Anumaril.\nAfter the Rebellion Anumaril fled along with other Ayleids to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. They were welcomed by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Green-Sap's Elves&lt;/a&gt; as long as they agreed not to dissonate the greensong and all the Heartland High Elves agreed to this except for Anumaril. He asked the Great &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran&lt;/a&gt; to show him the &lt;a href=\"Green-Sap\"&gt;Green-Sap&lt;/a&gt;. Within the great graht he found his desire \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Perchance%20Acorn\"&gt;Perchance Acorn&lt;/a&gt;. He then attempted to convert the region into a new home for the Ayleids by plunging Segment One into the acorn. This resulted in stopping the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Tree\"&gt;Elden Tree&lt;/a&gt; from moving by turning its perchance acorn into a definite acorn, but it was not enough to convert the tree.\nHe is then said to use his dentition as &lt;a href=\"tonal\"&gt;tonal&lt;/a&gt; instruments, dismantle his bones and build of them a Mundus-machine that mirrored &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and its planets. When he had used all his substance in fangling this orrery, he placed the segment-scepter within, hiding it between the Moons. And then he started to wait.\nKing Anumaril later built the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Reliquary of Stars&lt;/a&gt; and hid his heart there. The heart has immense magical properties, and can be used to run &lt;a href=\"The%20Orrery\"&gt;The Orrery&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, which is also a construction of his."}

The constant autumn fog of Daggerfall had blown away for the nonce and the sky was a deep endless blue. Moments like this were rare for young Prince Edward; this afternoon was the result of days of scheming, for he craved solitude as the other nobles he knew craved companionship. Now his tutor believed him engaged in extra arms practice, the master of arms believed him to be chasing deer with the huntmaster, who thought he was studying &lt;a href=\"Elvish\"&gt;Elvish&lt;/a&gt;. His father had no idea where he was and didn't care, being occupied with his young wife and their sons and other pleasures of noble life.\nAt the plop of an apple barely missing his head, he opened his pale grey eyes; there was a sweet rotten smell in his nostrils. He sighed and stared up into the blue. Why should things fall down instead of up? If you stared at the sky long enough you could feel as if you were falling into it his eyes glazed and the pupils grew huge as the dark-ringed irises dilated. He was weightless, drifting another apple fell, grazing his ear, and he thudded to earth, crying out as first his rump struck and then his head. A silvery laugh sounded. Edward sat up abruptly and stared around, jaw hanging slack.\nTwo mounted men stood ten feet away, still as if they were carved from stone, regarding him intently. Princes are not easily intimidated, not even the gentle souled kind, but Edward had never seen or imagined anything like this pair. One had golden skin and eyes, was clad in white cloth trimmed with gold and rode a (Edward blinked. It is was still there) a &lt;a href=\"unicorn\"&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt;! Beside the unicorn was a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;golden dragon&lt;/a&gt;, wings neatly folded. And on his back was a man clad in dark chain mail, a long sword at his side. He was bareheaded; his eyes glowed red in his dark face and his pointed ears \"You're &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;! What!\"\n\"He's a clever child.\" The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;dark elf's&lt;/a&gt; voice was sardonic. He spoke perfect &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bretic\"&gt;Bretic&lt;/a&gt;, Edward noticed, his mind still working, although something seemed to have gone wrong with the rest of him.\n\"So it would seem. He did that mostly of himself. Remarkable for an untrained child. I merely helped him to concentrate.\" The &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; also spoke Bretic, but hesitantly and with a slight singing accent. Edward's tutor said that elves were incapable of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; speech.\nEdward's gaze shifted rapidly over the four beings in front of him, unable to find a comfortable resting place. He hoped briefly, fervently, that he was dreaming. His mind seethed with questions and demands, then quite suddenly his tongue came unstuck. \"But I wasn't concentrating at all! My masters all say I'm incapable.\" Edward clamped his jaw down hard, suddenly realizing that it might be unwise to argue with beings such as these.\nBut the golden elf smiled broadly, showing perfect white teeth, \"Exactly.\" He radiated such warm approval, that Edward felt his skin tingle pleasantly. It was a feeling that he'd only known with his long-gone mother. But the other elf's face was expressionless; the red eyes bored into Edward as if they would pierce his soul.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;! You're Moraelyn! The witch-king!\" He jumped to his feet and faced the dark elf. \"You stole my mother! My father will kill you.\"\n\"I am. I did. Will he? Shall we call him and find out?\" The dark elf straightened and his eyes glowed deeper. A tiny puff of steam escaped the dragon's nostrils. A glowing aura appeared around his companion. Edward knew he wasn't going to call the guard. Why should they be slaughtered? These two looked capable of anything. Quite suddenly he was no longer afraid. If they were here to hurt him, they'd have done it by now. But a feeling of impotent rage remained. They'd taken his mother. And now.\n\"Why are you here?\" he demanded.\n\"Edward, will you come with us?\" The high elf spoke. Hearing him was like hearing a harp, cool as a breeze, warm as a fireside.\nThe boy stood very still. He wanted very much to say yes, to his own amazement. He wanted to ask if he would see his mother, but instead: \"My father...\" he croaked.\n\"Will miss you no doubt.\" The irony was back in Moraelyn's voice, a voice that make Edward think of icicles sparkling and dripping in winter sun. But there was a sort of hunger in his glowing eyes, a longing?\nHis father wouldn't miss him and he knew it. Shame ran through the boy, but he looked up at the broad-shouldered elf defiantly. \"Are you my father?\" Edward had meant the question to match the elf's sarcasm, but his hand crept to his ear as if of itself. He wasn't anything like his short-tempered, hearty, red-haired father and Roane often said he had an elfin look.\nThere was a heavy silence and Edward sensed that Moraelyn was taking the question at face value but that truth had nothing to do with what Moraelyn would say next. He would give the expedient answer. Still.\n\"No.\" It came reluctantly. He might be lying, of course, but Edward felt a deep wave of relief.\n\"Does my mother have other sons?\" Suddenly Edward knew she did not and that the question would hurt the dark elf. And was glad.\n\"Your mother might be dead, for all you know. Or care, it seems.\" The dark elf's narrow nostrils twitched as if Edward stank, and the lines around his mouth deepened. She was not dead. Edward would have known. The bitter injustice of Moraelyn's contempt stung. \"Did she send you to me?\"\n\"Do you take me for an errand boy!\" he snapped, and spoke to his companion: \"Let us take him now and be gone; we may discuss it at leisure.\"\nThe golden elf held up his hand, \"Patience, my cousin.\" and, to Edward, \"Well, youngling, will you come?\"\nDark tales were told of human children kidnapped by elves, who hungered for young humans\n\"I don't know your name,\" Edward temporized.\n\"Do you love your life here so much?\"\nEdward looked at the palace in the distance, the banners floating lazily above the town below, the sparkling bay, the distant mountains. \"I love Daggerfall.\"\n\"Ah. And you shall return to hold it, Prince Edward. I, I'ric Harad Egun the &lt;a href=\"Archmagister\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt;, swear it to you.\" Moraelyn swung about, protesting sharply in Elvish. The dragon spat a bit of flame, but the unicorn did not move; its golden eyes regarded Edward steadily. \"Unicorns do not abide any sort of falsity.\" The words floated through his mind in his mother's voice.\n\"I'ric Harad Egun the Archmagister, I will come with you.\"\n\"You must ride with Moraelyn. The Lord &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; has consented to this--necessity. The elf made a sweeping gesture toward the dragon.\"\nHe wasn't fit to touch a unicorn, of course. \"Very well, then. I...I don't suppose I could bring my dog?\" Where was he? Shag was always with him. Asleep in the grass! Shag, the ever-alert? Edward knelt to touch him. A heated discussion in Elvish ensued, during which the dragon scorched the grass. Moraelyn swung down and picked Shag up with distaste. \"Very well, then, but I warn you that Akatosh is at the limit of his patience. Mount, then.\"\n\"Lord Akatosh, I am most deeply obliged by your indulgence. If ever I may repay it.\"\n\"You will,\" Moraelyn interrupted; he seized Edward by the belt and tossed him up onto the dragon. Edward settled himself between the dragon's neck and wings and the sleeping Shag was draped limply in front of him. \"There isn't room for...\" Edward began, and jerked in astonishment as the dragon shifted beneath him and grew larger. Much, much, much larger. Moraelyn vaulted up behind with a prodigious leap for one in armor. The unicorn jumped the nine foot wall, clearing it neatly. The dragon's great wings stretched; he crouched, then leapt into the air. His riders swayed wildly. The dark elf muttered something Edward couldn't understand in elvish and they steadied. The wings beat strongly and the dragon circled low over the Keep, gaining altitude slowly. People were running about now, shouting and pointing. Edward saw his old nurse and waved and shouted, \"Goodbye! Goodbye! I'll be back sometime...\" Arrows flew through the air as bowmen shot, while the nurse screamed and clutched at the arms of those nearest. King Corcyr ran naked onto the battlements, screaming and waving his fists. \"Child of a demon, come back and I'll thrash you within an inch of your worthless life. Moraelyn, come down and fight, like the man you aren't.\"\nMoraelyn's loud laughter rang clear as temple bells, cascading over the Keep. He shouted, \"Be glad I don't, little King of the Small Cock!\" The dragon circled almost lazily and let out a huge gout of flame. Arrows clinked harmlessly off his golden scales. \"I'm off to see my mother!\" Edward screamed down, noting the upturned faces of his stepmother and her red-haired sons. Roane had a fur-trimmed robe clutched round her, but her long hair floated wildly. Four pairs of eyes fastened on him, not Moraelyn, glittering with fury and hatred. Edward stopped waving and clutched Shag tightly with both hands. Moraelyn's mail clad arm was securely about his waist. Edward slumped against him, feeling quite safe for the first time in a very long while. The bowmen had stopped shooting; most of them were looking at the royal family. The king danced with rage. The great dragon's wings beat harder now and they headed due south out over the water.\n\"Aren't we going to &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;?\" the boy twisted round and looked up at Moraelyn. \"Your mother awaits you at &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sumurset\"&gt;Sumurset&lt;/a&gt;, little Prince.\"\n\"Why did you wait so long to fetch me?\"\n\"Querulous child, do you think dragons and unicorns do the bidding of elves or men? Your mother came to me full willing, but she could not bring you; you were too closely guarded by your father's men. Would you have had us lay waste your land to take you by force? She thought you would be safe and cared for and she was desperate. No, this was the dragon's plan.\"\nOf all the astonishing events of the afternoon, this was the most surprising: the notion that a dragon should take an interest in him, when not even his own family did. But, willing, the elf said, full willing!\n\"You are the focus of large events, youngling. Your task is to prepare yourself to be a king; a king such as your people have never known. Our task is to aid you. Sleep now.\"\nWaves of sleep assaulted Edward's mind, one after another. \"But...\" he meant to ask Moraelyn about his mother, but the last wave was too big; it crashed right over him and he slipped into dark fireshot dreams."}
