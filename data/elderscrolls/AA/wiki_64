It is possible to kill the four &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; in this room while sneaking, before picking up the Claw, while they are asleep. There is an Iron Door on the left of this room with minor loot. This is also where the Dragonborn ends up after defeating King Olaf One-Eye and collecting the loot from his treasure room.\nDown the hall, there is a burial chamber and this part of the tomb is a puzzle as there are rotating doorways activated by a pull chain. Activating the pull chain will change the doors, opening some and closing others.\nContinuing further in, there is a room with two circular grates in the floor. Two &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; will drop from the ceiling. To the left there is an urn behind a spider's web and an apprentice chest. Open the floor grate on the far side of the room by activating the chain to the right of the entrance. Behind is a watery passage to a large, two-story room. Walking up the wooden ramp on the right will lead to a cage-like door which is rigged with an adept-level trap. Activate it in the bottom right corner of the door to avoid the pendulum axes. The trap may be disabled by pulling the chain on the pillar once past it. Up the stairs is an iron door.\nPast the iron door is an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; and a sealed door that is currently inaccessible due to a magical seal. To the right of this and down the slope there is a powerful draugr that may use the Disarm shout. There are more rooms with draugr, but only one will be hostile until passing through again on the way back out. They may be killed before they wake on the first walk through. The leveled Draugr Warlord will attack as soon as one enters the room.\nThe left side of the room he is found in has a floor trap switch, a draugr body, a Grand Soul Gem, a Common Soul Gem, a stamina potion and several Scrolls. Going through the right side will lead to a room with another circular grate in the floor. An expert locked door with a master locked chest behind it can be found on the way.\nIn the room with the circular grate, cage doors will open and about six Restless Draugr will attack. A trapped chest in one of the back rooms contains some minor loot. Pull the chain to open the grate and proceed down the spiral staircase. At the bottom, pull the handle to open a secret doorway.\nNext is a room with &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;'s ghost, as well as his corpse. The corpse clutches \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;King Olaf's Verse&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must take the book to continue the quest. Behind the magic-sealed door will be a Dragon Claw puzzle door and the Dragonborn must arrange the pictures on the door to match the symbols on the ruby dragon claw collected earlier in order to enter the next room. (Wolf, Hawk, Wolf).\nPast the door is King Olaf's burial room with draugrs sitting on thrones around the oval middle. At the end, on the way up the stairs to Olaf's coffin are leveled draugr. At the end of the room is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt;.

The thrall follows and defends its master until &lt;a href=\"Banish%20%28Effect%29\"&gt;banished&lt;/a&gt;, killed, or turned.\nOccasionally, the thralls will vanish, even if within eyesight, or when entering certain areas they may not follow, but they may show up again later, even if on the other side of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike other reanimation spells, thralls that die will not turn to ash and may be raised again if so desired. If the conjurer has the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Souls\"&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt; perk, the thrall will be raised with an extra 100 hit points; however, once these are spent they are not recoverable unless the thrall dies and is re-enthralled. If the Dragonborn has the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Souls\"&gt;Twin Souls&lt;/a&gt; perk, two Dead Thralls may be summoned at one time, or a Dead Thrall and an atronach or &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;.\nEquipment.\nUpgrading the thrall's equipment may increase its effectiveness.\nThralls will use any weapon given to them as long as the weapon matches its proficiencies. For instance, mages will prefer to continue using their spells and wielding staves rather than equipping powerful melee weapons. Most thralls, regardless of proficiencies, will also use the shields given to them, provided they have a free hand available. However, thralls are much more picky about the armor/clothing they will wear.\nNotable thralls.\nThe characters listed below are thralls that have been deemed exceptional in some way by the community. The first three sections deal with thralls of different class, and the final covers thralls that retain their vocal clips upon death. All thralls listed here are able to be thralled at any level unless otherwise noted. Some of the named characters listed have unique abilities, while others are effective and easy to find.\nMages.\nThese thralls will use destruction spells and readily wield staves you give them. Some will even conjure allies using their own spells.\nMelee.\nThese thralls generally have good armor and use melee weapons effectively. They will also use ranged weapons given them when fighting at a distance.\nArcher.\nThese thralls use ranged weapons more effectively. They will switch to melee weapons in close quarters.\nRetain vocal clips.\nThese thralls do not switch to the standard moans and groans of reanimated corpses. They instead continue to use the unique vocal clips they had in life.\n\"*Levels with (max) mean the thrall will scale with the Dragonborn up to a maximum of that level. Levels without (max) mean the thrall is set at that level.\"\n\"**Vampires can be thralled above the level 40 cap of Dead Thrall if the Dragonborn has taken the &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt; perk found in the Restoration tree. This perk affects all spells that target vampires including Dead Thrall. With this perk all versions of vampires found in the game are thrallable except &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Volkihar Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s (level 53). Of note are &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Vampire\"&gt;Volkihar Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s (level 48) and &lt;a href=\"Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt;s (level 42), the two highest level natural candidates for thralls in the game.\""}

I do not know whether hunger or poor health or one of the creatures who share this dank hole with me will kill me first -- I only know that I will soon be dead, and not even my bones with remain. My hope is that in the years that come, this letter will be read and the sad story of &lt;a href=\"Arthago\"&gt;Arthago&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; will be told.\nI am &lt;a href=\"3E%20385\"&gt;fifteen&lt;/a&gt; years old at the time of this writing, and have been plagued with bad health for most of my life, to the frustration of my hearthy parents. The finest healers and apothecaries in western &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; have labored over my every cough and fever, but while they could save my life time and time again, they could not improve my sickly constitution. In retrospect, I received little real affection from the king and queen, embarrassed as they were about begetting such a cripple as the heir of the kingdom. I cannot say I missed the love; I received much attention from the doctors, priests, and herbalists constantly at court. Certainly I was not to be the sort of warrior that King Cameron was, but one of my dearest friends, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; said that I might be the first scholar-king in the history of Sentinel.\nMy younger sister &lt;a href=\"Aubk-i\"&gt;Aubk-i&lt;/a&gt; was the true favorite of my parents: athletic, beautiful, and charming. It is hard to think of an uncomplimentary word for her. I am resigned to my imminent death, and yet, I would like to see her once again. For &lt;a href=\"3E%20386\"&gt;six&lt;/a&gt; years, Aubk-i and I were the only children of Sentinel. &lt;a href=\"3E%20392\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; years ago, the queen had a boy child and named him &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt;, after the ancient &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; word for Strong King. Few speak that tongue any longer, but all the scholars and nobles of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; understood. And Greklith is a strong boy indeed -- I have never seen so much as seen him cough. The Queen's next child, born only a &lt;a href=\"3E%20393\"&gt;year&lt;/a&gt; after Greklith, had an even more ominous birthname -- &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;. Second Boy. Perhaps had I been less sheltered, more suspicious by nature, I might have read into these nominations. Lhotun and Greklith are common enough names in our family, I reasoned. Now I know that even then, I was disinherited -- even if it was not official yet. For several months before Lhotun's birth and over three years afterward, I was in the throes of a very serious fever. The doctors despaired of me, but somehow and very, very gradually, I recovered. For the first time, and the last, I read an expression on my father, the King's face that was not indifference. It was disgust.\nThat was a fortnight ago. Three nights ago, I was seized by men I had never seen while I was having a walk. My norsemaid stood by watching placidly as I was gagged and tied and thrown roughly into a sack. I do not know how long they rode with me, but I was eventually left here. When I finally freed myself from my bonds, I found that I was alone. My wanders have gotten me nowhere. This place is filled with &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;undead creatures&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0that prevent me from finding any exit.\nI have no hope left, but no fear either. A few regrets. Perhaps had I studied &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; instead of history and science I could free myself of this place. One of my tutors told the story of &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt;, how he had placed his lifeforce in the body of a powerful being and had thus conquered all &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; long, long ago. Had I only had the strength of a more powerful body like that.\nBut I did not study magic. I studied history, so I leave this letter -- not to revenge myself but as an historic document."}

All death hounds wear heavy iron &lt;a href=\"Death%20Hound%20Collar\"&gt;collars&lt;/a&gt; around their necks.\nCombat.\nA death hound's primary form of attack is its bite, which deals &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0However, they also emit a permanent &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost cloak&lt;/a&gt; that drains &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; from any enemy of theirs in melee range during &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon death, a &lt;a href=\"death%20hound%20collar\"&gt;death hound collar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dog%20meat\"&gt;dog meat&lt;/a&gt; and, occasionally, small amounts of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or other minor treasures may be on their bodies."}

After what was supposed to be the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest contract in centuries, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; learns that it was all a setup so that &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt; could attack the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn must rescue any surviving members and ensure that the Brotherhood lives on. The quest begins once the quest \"&lt;a href=\"To%20Kill%20an%20Empire\"&gt;To Kill an Empire&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed.\nBackground.\n\"I have returned to the Sanctuary in the midst of the Penitus Occulatus' assault. I must assist my fellow Family members any way I can.\"\nWalkthrough.\nCommander Maro's men have located the Sanctuary and are currently raiding it. When the Dragonborn arrives, several &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0agents will be encountered at the entrance. &lt;a href=\"Festus%20Krex\"&gt;Festus&lt;/a&gt; can be found dead, pinned to a tree by a barrage of arrows outside the door. Kill the agents and enter the Black Door.\nSanctuary Assault.\nInside the Sanctuary, explosions can be heard from deeper within. Where &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; would normally be located, there are two Penitus Oculatus Agents. Eavesdropping on their conversation reveals that the Sanctuary is being set alight and an agent named &lt;a href=\"Arcturus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcturus&lt;/a&gt; has led some other men deeper into the Sanctuary. The Dragonborn should kill the agents and move on. Fire magic works well in this area due to the large amounts of oil on the ground. The body of &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the ground here.\nAfter proceeding deeper into the Sanctuary, the death of &lt;a href=\"Arnbjorn\"&gt;Arnbjorn&lt;/a&gt; will be witnessed; he attacks a group of agents in his &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Beast Form&lt;/a&gt; before being slain. His death is scripted, so nothing can be done to save him. When proceeding forward, the dead bodies of &lt;a href=\"Gabriella\"&gt;Gabriella&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lis\"&gt;Lis&lt;/a&gt; will be found. In the dining hall, &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt; will be seen battling several agents, along with their leader, Arcturus. After defeating Arcturus and any other agents nearby, the Dragonborn should talk to Nazir and follow him, killing any more agents that are encountered.\nEmbrace the Night Mother.\nNazir will run into the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s room, only to discover that it is a dead end and they are trapped. The Night Mother communicates to the Dragonborn, telling them to embrace her, as it is the only way to survive. Open her sarcophagus and step inside. The screen will go black, and she will tell the Dragonborn to sleep. Nazir and &lt;a href=\"Babette\"&gt;Babette&lt;/a&gt; will free the Dragonborn some time later, after the fires have died. Just before the coffin doors open, the Night Mother will tell the Dragonborn to speak to Astrid, somewhere inside the Sanctuary.\nThe Dread Lord Beckons.\nOutside the coffin, head out of the grotto and up the stone stairs to Astrid's usual location. Continue into the room on the right, and into a new room beyond that. Astrid is there, burned beyond recognition, lying in the center of a ring of candles in the configuration of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe explains that she betrayed the Dragonborn to the Penitus Oculatus in return for their promise to spare the Dark Brotherhood. She says that her action was unforgivable and that &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; will judge her accordingly as punishment for her defiance of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Tenets\"&gt;Five Tenets&lt;/a&gt;. She asks the Dragonborn to rebuild the Dark Brotherhood, and gives the Dragonborn her &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt; and demands that she be killed, as she has enacted the Black Sacrament on herself.\nAfter Astrid is killed, the quest log indicates that the Dragonborn should return to the Night Mother. She says that the contract to assassinate the true Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;, must still be carried out. She commands the Dragonborn to speak to &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre\"&gt;Amaund Motierre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, as he will know the true Emperor's real location. This completes the quest and begins the next quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Hail%20Sithis%21\"&gt;Hail Sithis!&lt;/a&gt;\""}

Catches it off-guard.\"\n\"Is that how you managed to find this &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Claws\"&gt;claw&lt;/a&gt;?\" I asked, brandishing the small carving as if it were a weapon. I had found it among his possessions, which I was helping him to divvy amongst his beneficiaries. \"Should it also go to your cousin? Dives-From-Below?\"\nAt this, his mouth widened, exposing his fangs. If I hadn't known him as long as I had I would think he was snarling, but I knew that to be a smile. He croaked a few times to attempt laughter, but ended up wheezing and coughing, his rancid blood spraying across the bedsheets.\n\"Do you know what that is?\" he asked between coughing fits.\n\"I've heard stories,\" I answered, \"the same as you. Looks like one of the claws, for opening the sealing-doors in the ancient crypts. I've never seen one myself, before.\"\n\"Then you know I would only wish that thing upon a mortal enemy. Giving it to my cousin would just be encouraging him to run into one of those barrows and get split by a &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Swords\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"So you want me to have it, then?\" I joked. \"Where did you even get this?\"\n\"My kind can find things that your people assumed were gone. Drop something to the bottom of a lake, and a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; will never see it again. Amazing what you can find along the bottoms.\"\nHe was staring at the ceiling now, and but the way his fogged eyes darted around, I could tell he was seeing his memories instead of the cracked stone above us.\n\"Did you ever try to use it?\" I whispered to him, hoping he could hear me through his fog.\n\"Of course!\" he snapped, suddenly lucid. His eyes widened and fixed on me. \"Where do you think I got this?\" he barked, tearing his tunic open to show a white scar forming a large star-shaped knot in the scales beneath his right shoulder. \"Blasted Draugr got the drop on me. Just too many of them.\"\nI felt awful, since I knew how much he hated talking about the battles he had been in. To him, it was enough that he had survived, and any stories would amount to boasting. We both sat quietly for several minutes, his labored breathing the only sound.\nHe was the one to break the silence. \"You know what always bothered me?\" he asked. \"Why they even bothered with the symbols.\"\n\"The what?\"\n\"The symbols, you fool, look at the claw.\"\nI turned it over in my hand. Sure enough, etched into the face were three animals. A bear, an owl, and some kind of insect.\n\"What do the symbols mean, Deerkaza?\"\n\"The sealing-doors. It's not enough to just have the claw. They're made of massive stone wheels that must align with the claw's symbols before they'll open. It's a sort of lock, I suppose. But I didn't know why they bothered with them. If you had the claw, you also had the symbols to open the door. So why...\"\nHe was broken up by a coughing fit. It was the most I had heard him speak in months, but I could tell how much of a struggle it was. I knew his mind, though, and helped the thought along.\n\"Why even have a combination if you're going to write it on the key?\"\n\"Exactly. But as I lay bleeding on that floor, I figured it out. The Draugr are relentless, but far from clever. Once I was downed, they continued shuffling about. To no aim. No direction. Bumping against one another, the walls.\"\n\"So?\"\n\"So the symbols on the doors weren't meant to be another lock. Just a way of ensuring the person entering was actually alive and had a functioning mind.\"\n\"Then the doors...\"\n\"Were never meant to keep people out. They were meant to keep the Draugr in.\"\nAnd with that, he fell back asleep. When he awoke several days later, he refused to talk about the Draugr at all, and would only wince and clutch his shoulder if I tried to bring them up."}

His grandfather had served under Haknir, nigh on sixty years before, and even then he was a legend among pirates of the north. \"The King of Ghosts,\" they called him, as eternal and pitiless as the sea he sailed. To Garuk, who had seen him charge into battle, clad in armor of gleaming &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; like the kings of old, his &lt;a href=\"Bloodscythe\"&gt;twin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soulrender\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; scything men like grass, Haknir was practically a god.\nBut none feared Haknir more than his own crew. They knew his rages, his fits of madness, how he delighted in torture and murder for its own sake. And there were even darker rumors: Some said he fed upon the blood and souls of those he killed to extend his unnatural life. Some thought him a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, loosed upon the mortal world. And others said he owed his life and power, &lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20Armor\"&gt;his armor&lt;/a&gt; and swords, to a pact with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;prince&lt;/a&gt; of destruction. And the seal of that pact was the terrible wound that scarred his face, never to heal - the Deathbrand, which no man could look upon without flinching.\nAll these things ran through Garuk's mind as he took his place on deck at the head of the crew, exchanging a curt nod with &lt;a href=\"Thalin%20Ebonhand\"&gt;Thalin&lt;/a&gt;, the ship's helmsman and his chief rival. By sundown, he thought, one of them would be captain. The other would be dead.\nWhen Haknir finally emerged from his cabin, the crew fell silent. He looked frail, his voice raspy. But even so, he had a presence about him. As he looked over his men, the most brutal murderers ever to ply the northern seas, not one could meet his gaze. At last he sighed.\n\"You wish to know who will by my successor, and how my share of the treasure shall be divided.\"\nThat was the question, but even so, there were murmurs of protest. Haknir cut them off.\n\"All these years, I have looked for one who was worthy to take my place, or strong enough to take it from me. Not one of your even comes close. And so none of you shall have it.\"\nHe extended his hand. \"In Dagon's name, I place a curse upon &lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20Armor\"&gt;my armor&lt;/a&gt;, and my swords. This ship, and all it carries. Until the day when one of you can best me in combat, you shall have not a single coin.\" He looked up at them. \"Be grateful I have left you with your lives.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Garuk%20Windrime\"&gt;Garuk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalin%20Ebonhand\"&gt;Thalin&lt;/a&gt; shared a single glance. Had anyone else said such a thing, there would have been mutiny. A hundred treasure-mad pirates against one old man. But this was Haknir. The crew was silent.\nHaknir threw a map at Garuk's feet. \"Garuk, take a longboat, and bury my armor in the places I have marked. Thalin, we sail to &lt;a href=\"Gyldenhul%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;my tomb&lt;/a&gt;, where you shall leave me with my gold. Then burn your ships, and do as you will. I am your captain no more.\" And with that, he turned and stalked back to his quarters.\nAt daybreak, Garuk took his leave, and set out in a longboat with three of his men. They landed on &lt;a href=\"Haknir%27s%20Shoal\"&gt;a shoal to the north&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, at the place Haknir had marked, made camp, and began to dig.\nBut already, greed stirred in Garuk's heart. Time and again, he glanced at the iron-bound chest they had brought with them. The old man was gone, perhaps already dead. His orders, foolish.\nThat night, Garuk pried open the chest and drew out &lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20Helm\"&gt;the helm&lt;/a&gt; within. The Stalhrim shimmered in the moonlight. It was time. Time for a new King of Ghosts to rise. He placed the helmet on his head.\nAnd he screamed.\nAnd it is said you can hear that screaming still, on moonlit nights, on a rocky shoal off the northern coast of Solstheim.\nPostscript- This story is one of the last in the \"Haknir Saga,\" the tales surrounding the life and adventures of the legendary pirate king Haknir Death-Brand. How much of it is actually true, if indeed any of it is true, I leave to the reader's discretion.\n- Artise Dralen\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; Scribe"}

By following the map, perhaps I can find the rest of the treasure they sought.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest can be started after finding and reading a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Deathbrand&lt;/a&gt;\" at level 36 or higher. Reading it before level 36 will not activate the quest. A copy can be found in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, there is an alternate way to activate the quest at level 36 or higher without the book having to be read. If the &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;pirates&lt;/a&gt; guarding the ancient chest at &lt;a href=\"Haknir%27s%20Shoal\"&gt;Haknir's Shoal&lt;/a&gt; are killed, the &lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20helm\"&gt;Deathbrand helm&lt;/a&gt; will spawn in the chest and the quest will be activated. The dead &lt;a href=\"Pirate%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;pirate captain&lt;/a&gt; will also have the map to the other locations, as well as the book.\nLocations of the armor pieces are as follows:\nThe key to &lt;a href=\"Gyldenhul%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Gyldenhul Barrow&lt;/a&gt; will be in the last chest when the final piece of armor is found.\nGyldenhul Barrow.\nTo the left of the entrance to Gyldenhul Barrow, near the water, is a &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quicksilver&lt;/a&gt; vein. Just inside lies a dead adventurer, and a &lt;a href=\"Torn%20Note%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; can be found on his corpse. Two sarcophagi containing &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; are on either side of him. The sarcophagus on the left contains a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; with some minor loot.\nTo proceed any further, an &lt;a href=\"ancient%20Nordic%20pickaxe\"&gt;ancient Nordic pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; is required to mine through the Stalhrim in the sarcophagi on the right, which will reveal a secret passage to a lower chamber. This area is a treasure trove, containing many piles of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; (around 75, each with an average 100 pieces, some as few as 75, others as high as 150). Assorted &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29%23Poisons\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Urn\"&gt;burial urns&lt;/a&gt; containing &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; and gold are located here. As soon as an item is picked up, the gate behind will close. The iron door at the south end of the room opens to a set of steps down that turn left (east) to a large chamber, and the resting place of &lt;a href=\"Haknir%20Death-Brand\"&gt;Haknir Death-Brand&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaknir Death-Brand.\nHis skeletal remains can be found in the lower chamber against the east wall. Up the stairs to the right of him is a chest containing leveled loot. Located directly behind him is a unique &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bloodscythe\"&gt;Bloodscythe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Bloodscythe is taken, the ghost of Haknir Death-Brand will appear and turn hostile. During battle he will periodically disappear once he begins to take damage, and will summon several members of &lt;a href=\"Haknir%27s%20Crew\"&gt;his crew&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Garuk%20Windrime\"&gt;Garuk Windrime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalin%20Ebonhand\"&gt;Thalin Ebonhand&lt;/a&gt;, to aid him.\nUpon his defeat, another unique scimitar named &lt;a href=\"Soulrender\"&gt;Soulrender&lt;/a&gt; can be looted from his remains. The remains of his crew, including Garuk and Thalin, can also be looted."}

His plan is for the Dragonborn to go to a hold capital and kill a resident in public while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Armor\"&gt;Dawnguard Armor&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Incriminating%20Letter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; must be planted on the body that frames the Dawnguard for the act.\nAn optional caveat is that the person should be someone of importance, such as a merchant, bard, or member of the Jarl's court. Feran will give the Dragonborn a mixed set of Dawnguard Armor to perform the task.\n\"You are to make a public show of murdering someone. Do it in the streets for all to see. The higher the profile the better. Make it seem you are a member of the Dawnguard, thus sowing confusion among the herd. Wear this armor and plant this note on the victim.\"\nWalkthrough.\nSimply kill someone in the requested city and plant the \"&lt;a href=\"Incriminating%20Letter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Incriminating Letter&lt;/a&gt;\" on the victim. The murder must take place on the streets of the city for it to count, so if choosing a member of the Jarl's court, they must have left their respective palaces for the kill to qualify. Similarly, merchants and bards must be outdoors when killed, if choosing a high-profile target.\nIn order for the murder to register as a public kill while wearing Dawnguard Armor, it must be witnessed by a guard or citizen. This will however incur a 1000 bounty. If a stealth kill is performed, the murder will be registered, but it will fail both optional objectives.\nTo avoid killing any citizens, a guard may be murdered or, if the city is being attacked by vampires, killing one will count as a victim, but this will fail the high-profile objective. The best exploit to complete this quest without killing anyone, is by using the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Thrall\"&gt;Dead Thrall&lt;/a&gt; spell on a &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s body and killing it in any town, which counts as a high-profile target. If a citizen is killed in public, it is possible to get around jail time or a bounty if the player has become the &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt; of the assigned hold before starting this quest, as the guards can be convinced to look the other way if they witness the crime.\nPotential high profile targets.\nRaven Rock.\nIt has been noted that if both the and add-ons have been downloaded and this quest is begun, then &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; may end up being a location for the quest. All high-profile targets there are merchants (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Milore%20Ienth\"&gt;Milore Ienth&lt;/a&gt;, alchemist; &lt;a href=\"Glover%20Mallory\"&gt;Glover Mallory&lt;/a&gt;, blacksmith; &lt;a href=\"Garyn%20Ienth\"&gt;Garyn Ienth&lt;/a&gt;, grocer; and &lt;a href=\"Fethis%20Alor\"&gt;Fethis Alor&lt;/a&gt;, general goods. The best bet is to kill Garyn Ienth because he doesn't offer much in the way of trading.)"}

This orphan and outcast is called in legend the \"&lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;,\" and is supposed to be a reincarnation of the long-dead Dunmer General and &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;or, Lord &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"[PC Name]\" has the appearance of meeting the conditions of this local superstition. Therefore it is his Majesty's desire that \"[PC Name]\" shall, insofar as is possible, satisfy the conditions of this ancient prophecy, and shall become the Nerevarine.\nThough this prophecy is indeed only an ancient local superstition, his Majesty has taken counsel on this matter with his most expert informants and confidants, and his Majesty is persuaded that the prophecy is genuine and significant, either in its entirety, or in its several parts, and he earnestly demands you treat this matter with the utmost seriousness.\nCertain aspects of this ancient superstition are described at the end of this document, and further materials will be forthcoming by courier at the earliest occasion. It will, of course, be necessary that you acquaint yourself better with the details of this ancient superstition from your local sources. Since this matter intimately concerns \"[PC Name]\", it is expected that you will employ him to gather information on this subject. His Majesty has taken a great personal interest in the legends and prophecies of the Nerevarine, and eagerly awaits reports your reports.

Scotti was a cowardly man who worked as a clerk at the &lt;a href=\"Atrius%20Building%20Commission\"&gt;Atrius Building Commission&lt;/a&gt; until 3E 397, and later for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vanech%27s%20Building%20Commission\"&gt;Lord Vanech's Building Commission&lt;/a&gt;. He is the protagonist in the &lt;a href=\"A%20Dance%20in%20Fire\"&gt;A Dance in Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Argonian%20Account\"&gt;The Argonian Account&lt;/a&gt; novel series.\nWaughin Jarth claimed that Scotti was based on a real person, with their name changed. Jarth also claimed that a third story featuring Scotti is nearly complete.\nBackground.\nA Dance in Fire.\nAfter being let go from the Atrius Building Commission in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the novels, Scotti receives a badly written letter from his former business colleague, Liodus Jurus that urges him to travel to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; with blank contracts and timber to bid on the reconstruction efforts following a recent war with the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. His wagon is ambushed by Khajiit \"en route \"and the contracts destroyed.\nScotti arrives in Valenwood to find his contact has moved on, and Scotti follows a trail of notes and skirmishes of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; to a fellow clerk named Reglius who Jurus also invited down, who claimed Jurus was is dead. He ultimately dies himself and Scotti takes his contracts from Lord Vanech before meeting Jurus again.\nThe two arrange for Scotti to negotiate contracts with the &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, and Scotti gets Lord Vanech's contracts signed and returns with them to Cyrodiil. This begins a bidding war between the two building commissions, both of which trying to bribe Scotti into giving them the contracts. These were ultimately won by Lord Vanech, after the unfortunate and sudden death of Lord Atrius, which Scotti suspects was the work of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. The contracts were celebrated by a banquet of meats sent by the Silvenar, which were the bodies of the other building commissioners left behind in Valenwood.\nThe Argonian Account.\nFollowing Scotti's success in Valenwood, Lord Vanech sends\nhim to supervise and overhaul the company's failing infrastructure projects in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of meeting the Commission's contacts in &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;, Scotti ends up in a small village called Hixnoag, far from Imperial domains. Here he is taken captive before falling into the river and being found by an Argonian rafter, who takes him through Black Marsh, whereupon Scotti promptly\nleaves and reports on the sorry state of Imperial holdings in the province to various stakeholders. They are all horrified and provide him with lots of money to fix the problems, which Scotti embezzles and does nothing. Meanwhile, without any outside interference,\nnatural trade resumes in Black Marsh, improving results for all concerned."}

It has two entrances (main entrance pictured) and comprises four sections. There are also four leveled caches in the form of sacks that the previous owner left behind hidden throughout the cave.\nSublocations.\nDeepscorn Hollow.\nThe main entrance leads to the first section known as Deepscorn Hollow and is made up of three rooms. The middle room, once upgraded, serves as a garden, which will include the deadly &lt;a href=\"chokeberry\"&gt;chokeberry&lt;/a&gt; vines of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe room to the east of the entrance contains an empty chest titled \"Victim's Loot Chest.\" Once the \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Minion\"&gt;Dark Minion&lt;/a&gt;\" upgrade has been purchased this room will house the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero's&lt;/a&gt; Dark Minion when he hasn't been sent out to \"murder in the name of Sithis\". When he returns from his murderous mission he will deposit the loot of his victims in the aforementioned chest.\nThe last room, to the west of the entrance, will contain chests, crates, and barrels for storage once upgraded. There is a concealed chest in the room called Greywyn's Poison Supply. It contains a few Weak Poisons, and many Strong Poisons. The first of \"Greywyn's caches\" can be found next to the cave wall almost straight across the garden room from the main entrance.\nDeepscorn Cloister.\nThe second section of Deepscorn Hollow contains three rooms once again, as well as the secondary entrance to Deepscorn Hollow. The first room is less of a room and more of a \"hub,\" but contains two shelves and two benches.\nThe second room to the south is the &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Font of Renewal&lt;/a&gt;, containing an altar in the middle inside a pool of water, and in the northeast corner of the room three &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Veins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;veins&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"purgeblood%20salts\"&gt;purgeblood salts&lt;/a&gt;\". The last room, to the west, is a small cave structure that will serve as the \"Cattle Cell\" once upgraded, where &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampiric&lt;/a&gt; players may feed on a sleeping prisoner.\nTwo of \"Greywyn's caches\" can be found in the Cloister, one just behind the bars of the cattle cell, and the other inside the water next to the base of the font of renewal.\nDeepscorn Bastion.\nThe Bastion comprises a study room, a bedroom, and a dining room. When upgraded, the study room will house over a dozen books, including three or four skill books.\nThe bedroom will be given a coffin (for sleeping), two drawers, a jewelry box, a desk and a shelf when upgraded. The desk has a respawning sprig of &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;. Once all upgrades have been purchased from &lt;a href=\"Rowley%20Eardwulf\"&gt;Rowley Eardwulf&lt;/a&gt;, \"Greywyn's Armoire\" will be placed in the bedroom as well. It contains the &lt;a href=\"Raiment%20of%20the%20Crimson%20Scar\"&gt;Raiment of the Crimson Scar&lt;/a&gt;. The dining room can also be upgraded.\nDeepscorn Shrine.\nThe pinnacle of Deepscorn Hollow, the last section contains the only &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Sithis\"&gt;Shrine of Sithis&lt;/a&gt; in the game. The shrine is activated by purchasing the \"Ichor of Sithis\" and filling the basin at the base of the shrine with it.\nThose whose nature is dark and infamous can pray at the shrine and be blessed by &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;the Dread Father&lt;/a&gt;. There are two treasures located in the shrine, a jewelry box on the base of the Shrine contains a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Dagger%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric dagger&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Eviscerator\"&gt;Crimson Eviscerator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second is tricky to find. Stop on the flat area in the middle of the stairs and turn left. You should see a bag lying on top of the small waterfall. This is \"Greywyn's Final Cache\", which usually contains a magic ring and some gold and jewels based on your character's level."}

The Prisoner is primarily designed as a safe and easy way for a &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampiric&lt;/a&gt; character to feed. Since he is essentially what one paid for, the \"cattle\" is in an eternal slumber within the cell. He cannot wake up, nor can he be killed. This affords the opportunity to utilize him in other ways.\nTaking advantage of his immortality.\nIncreasing in certain &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; within the game are a lot more difficult than others, more specifically the combat skills\u00a0and combative magic spells. Unlike some others that the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; can do whenever they like (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skills that one can constantly apply to oneself), combative ones require to successfully land a blow on another being.\nSince the prisoner is immortal, one can attack him without fear of killing him, while improving on these skills much more quickly.\nIn reference to the above it is possible to make him \"stand\" (though he's still considered sleeping) up if one depleted his health enough times and make him faint, the exact number of times is unknown but this occurs even when one have a low damage weapon and a high difficulty slider (referring to his apparent health regeneration). Be wary of this for \"auto\" levelling spells and attacks as he can sometimes faint and stand outside of your target range (even going through the wall).\nHe also seems prone to the same \"0 gold\" assault charges the worshippers of Peryites' shrine are.\nAttacking.\nWhen attacking him with conventional means such as &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brawling\"&gt;fists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, etc., his life bar cannot be depleted. However, due to the fact that &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells usually have much more power than that of more conventional means, the prisoner's health bar can be fully depleted.\nOnce this happens, the body will be thrown off of the bedroll, because of the rag doll effect. The prisoner's response to this is similar to that of any NPC that cannot be killed, in which he will stand up. Since there is not an adequate amount of room for him to do so, he can be sucked right up into the ceiling.\nThis glitch can be avoided by character placement. Utilizing destruction spells while standing with his back against the rock wall will force his body deeper into the Cattle Cell. The prisoner will successfully stand up, and training can resume. To reset his position to the bedroll, wait for one hour while standing anywhere inside the &lt;a href=\"Deepscorn%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%20Location%29\"&gt;Deepscorn Cloister&lt;/a&gt;. This is also effective to correct the \"morph\" glitch, if that situation arises."}

It is a heavily trapped &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; tomb infested with &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; due to being on the border with &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;; the tomb leads through a mountain to Deepwood Vale, an unmarked sub area of the area, which eventually leads to &lt;a href=\"Hag%27s%20End\"&gt;Hag's End&lt;/a&gt;. Deepwood Redoubt is located near the mountain, and can be reached from &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; quite quickly.\nWalkthrough.\nOutside are several Forsworn guarding the entrance to the cave.\nDeepwood Redoubt.\nInside the door is a path leading up to a gate. Past it is a crypt and a path to the southwest. The path turns left (southeast), where several Forsworn are found, including two in a caged bridge. There are some rock ledges behind the player character. It is possible to jump on these and hop from each one to a hidden platform with a locked chest and a dead adventurer with a random potion. The ledge also offers excellent sniping opportunities (via magic or archery) if sneaking, as the Forsworn on the ground cannot reach the player here. After dealing with the Forsworn, the path leads to the right (southwest). One of the Forsworn may flee and try to activate the swinging blade trap in the hallway. This hallway leads to a room with &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt; traps.\nThe door to the left is a &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Master-locked&lt;/a&gt; door (unlocking leads to covered bridge and a path straight to the Deepwood Vale door). The room next to that door (in the south corner) has an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; in it, as well as another room with a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Pillager\"&gt;Forsworn Pillager&lt;/a&gt; by the bed. In the Enchanter room, there is a table to the right of the enchanter with the \"&lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Missive\"&gt;Forsworn Missive&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Red%20Eagle%20%28Book%29\"&gt;The Legend of Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;\" (which will open a miscellaneous quest if read). A key is on the floor next to a bucket in the bedroom. Also, the Forsworn should have another key. Either key will open the Master-locked door.\nStraight through the door just unlocked is a random sword that may be hard to see. To the left (northeast) is a pressure plate to a swinging spiked gate. Beyond that is the caged bridge from before, with two Forsworn on it (if not previously killed). Continuing forward, another Forsworn is seated at a table. A coin purse is by the first step of the stairs to the right (southeast). A random potion is on one of the shelves on the book case at the top of the steps before entering the door to Deepwood Vale.\nDeepwood Vale.\nThe fort and more Forsworn can be seen to the left under the archway. There are many of them, including a Shaman. If the stream in front of the fort to the right is followed, at the very end is a locked chest with some random loot. The &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill book &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Witness\"&gt;Sacred Witness&lt;/a&gt; is in the tent that has an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;. Over the stream, to the right of the bridge, is a Master locked door that leads to an alternate route into the Forsworn camp. Under a bridge inside the camp and below a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; is another locked chest with random loot. The entrance to &lt;a href=\"Hag%27s%20End\"&gt;Hag's End&lt;/a&gt; is at the top of the stairs to the northeast.\nRight next to the entrance to Hag's End is a small waterfall; beside that is a climbable mountain. By climbing up the mountain, the Dragonborn will find a locked chest with some random loot inside at the top, &lt;a href=\"Predator%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Predator's Grace&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quicksilver ore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Veins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vein&lt;/a&gt;. Climbing up the mountain is one way to access the chest and the boots. Alternatively, using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; from the exit point of &lt;a href=\"Hag%27s%20End\"&gt;Hag's End&lt;/a&gt; where the altar with &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn\"&gt;Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; is found, is another way to reach this place."}

However, if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; succeeds in attacking one without killing it, it will flee rather than fight back, which can often be achieved by using a weak ranged spell or low level bow/arrows.\nIf the Dragonborn is careful and does not disturb the deer, they can be found grazing or slowly wandering around. The moment the deer spots the Dragonborn, they will attempt to run regardless as to whether or not the one is acting aggressively. They can then be easily picked off with a well-placed arrow.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frenzy&lt;/a&gt; spells can be used to make it hostile. If this is done, the deer will attack, but\u00a0they deal very little damage."}

He plays a role in the final quests of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; questline, seeking the assassination of the current &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nAmaund appears calm and confident when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; first approaches him in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Silence%20Has%20Been%20Broken\"&gt;The Silence Has Been Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\" As the questline progresses, he becomes more and more stressed.\nLocations.\nMotierre hides at &lt;a href=\"Volunruud\"&gt;Volunruud&lt;/a&gt; with his bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Rexus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rexus&lt;/a&gt;. After the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Death%20Incarnate\"&gt;Death Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;,\" he goes to &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Whispers in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; mentions a man named Amaund Motierre, who hides out at Volunruud, performing the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Black Sacrament&lt;/a&gt;. She asks her new Listener to seek out Motierre. Threatened by the Night Mother's authority, &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; asks the Dragonborn not to speak with Motierre, sending them on another contract instead.\nIt is possible for the Dragonborn to speak with Motierre before Astrid gives the next objective. If the player travels to Volunruud right after the Night Mother is first spoken to, rather than have Astrid tell the Dragonborn to get quests from &lt;a href=\"Nazir\"&gt;Nazir&lt;/a&gt;, Motierre will be waiting for the player as if the next quest has begun. Rexus will give the &lt;a href=\"Amaund%20Motierre%27s%20Sealed%20Letter\"&gt;sealed letter&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Amulet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;valuable amulet&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dragonborn can choose to keep it or give it to Astrid to continue with the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Silence%20Has%20Been%20Broken\"&gt;The Silence Has Been Broken&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn chose to do the side contracts rather than listen to the Night Mother, then eventually, Astrid changes her mind and sends the Dragonborn to meet Motierre, who states that he wants the Emperor killed. Rexus will give the Dragonborn the sealed letter and the amulet, the same way that would occur in \"Whispers in the Dark\" if the Dragonborn went to Motierre first. The Dragonborn reports back to Astrid, who takes the letter and instructs them to speak to &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; to appraise the amulet.\n&lt;a href=\"Hail%20Sithis%21\"&gt;Hail Sithis!&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a failed assassination attempt on Titus Mede II and the near destruction of the Dark Brotherhood, the Dragonborn follows the Night Mother's instructions to find Amaund Motierre, who has relocated to the The Bannered Mare, and discover the location of the Emperor to complete the contract. Motierre sends the Dragonborn to &lt;a href=\"The%20Katariah\"&gt;The Katariah&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor's personal ship, still anchored in Solitude Harbor. He will also mention that &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt; is located at the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Warehouse\"&gt;East Empire Company Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn kills the Emperor, whose final wish is to have whoever set up the contract killed. After returning to Motierre, he will instruct the Dragonborn to return to Volunruud to pick up their reward: 20,000 , which is located in an urn in the original chamber that Motierre and Rexus were in. This reward is not in the urn when you initially meet Motierre and Rexus. \nAfter collecting the reward, the Dragonborn has the option to kill Motierre. Doing so gives the advantage of collecting a few rare gems from his corpse, as well as possibly receiving an &lt;a href=\"Letter%20of%20Inheritance\"&gt;inheritance&lt;/a&gt; from him."}

All of this, of course, would culminate in a historic meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Leader&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nIn order to secure an audience with the Leader, some secondary meetings must first take place. They have been outlined below.\n&lt;a href=\"Bound%20Until%20Death\"&gt;1.)&lt;/a&gt; You must attend the upcoming wedding at the Temple of the Divines in Solitude. The &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;bride&lt;/a&gt; must be given a gift she will never forget, one that will get all of Solitude to talking and which will, undoubtedly, reach the ears of the Leader himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Breaching%20Security\"&gt;2.)&lt;/a&gt; A certain high-ranking military &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;officer&lt;/a&gt;, permanently stationed in Skyrim, is responsible for securing the Leader's safety should he choose to schedule a visit. When this officer learns of the Leader's journey, he will begin the necessary security arrangements. You must learn this officer's plans, and meet with his people, to ensure appropriate security for your eventual audience with the Leader.\n&lt;a href=\"Recipe%20for%20Disaster\"&gt;3.)&lt;/a&gt; Several months ago, the Leader planned a visit to Skyrim that was canceled unexpectedly. In that time, a world renowned &lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;chef&lt;/a&gt; was contacted, and brought to Skyrim in order to prepare a lavish meal. That chef remains in Skyrim on retainer. You must meet with him, and convince him that it would be your honor to cook for the Leader in his place.\nI realize these instructions are a bit non-specific, and do apologize, but I feel the vagueness is necessary to ensure security. Surely an organization as esteemed as your own has the means and resources to obtain all the essential information before each meeting can take place.\nWhen the final part of our arrangement has been carried out - that is, when you have secured an audience with the Leader himself, and brought such business to a close - I will contact you about final payment.\nMost sincerely,\nA friend"}

There they will meet up with the Battlemages and while speaking to &lt;a href=\"Thalfin\"&gt;Thalfin&lt;/a&gt;, they will hear the progress of the mission. The group needs to be instructed on which positions to take during the ambush on the Necromancers as they exit Silorn, the first step to gaining entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero positions the three Battlemages either up close, or at a distance. Each of the group specializes in certain &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; and expresses where they may be best used. &lt;a href=\"Thafin\"&gt;Thafin&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is best at close range, as is &lt;a href=\"Iver\"&gt;Iver&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Merete\"&gt;Merete&lt;/a&gt; is best deployed further back.\nThe Necromancers emerge and are shortly defeated. When &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt; retreats back into the ruins the Hero tracks him. The ruins are fairly large and labyrinthine; they can be quite confusing. The halls are littered with more Necromancers. Each carries various &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;leveled weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Robes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt; and .\nAlternate stealth strategy.\nIf the Hero swims across the lake and climbs the hill west of the entrance, they will encounter the two outside mages before encountering the battlemages. Note that Silorn is very close to the edge of the map, so crossing by the waterfall is not possible, nor is proceeding very much south or west of the lake. Killing the two outside mages opens the door and the Hero can enter by themselves, which may be preferable for those that emphasize stealth.\nSilorn Sedorseli.\nThere is a hidden switch on a balcony up above that requires going through Silorn Sedorseli to reach. Upon finding the switch, hit it, and the gates on the bridge open, allowing access to Falcar. Having a high &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; one can make the jump between the floor and the bridge doable.\nFight with Falcar.\nFalcar is fought during this part. He wields a leveled dagger &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;. He may &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;conjure&lt;/a&gt; constructs to aid him in battle, such as &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternate stealth strategy.\nIf the Hero is following the stealth strategy, there is a brief period of time where Falcar walks towards the Hero before engaging in conversation. During this window of time, he can be shot with an arrow from stealth, possibly killing him outright before the fight even begins.\nOnce Falcar is defeated, the Hero will find the &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Black%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Colossal Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; on his body. Continuing forward, there is another room with more undead and a frost ball trap that leads to the passage back to Silorn. From there, exit the ruin and head back to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;University&lt;/a&gt; to give the gem to Traven to complete the quest."}

Travel to Water's Edge and find Biene in her house or outside. She has inherited a debt (1000 ) from her father who was dragged from the house in relation to the debt.\nShe wants the Hero to obtain her grandfather's ceremonial sword and cuirass: &lt;a href=\"Brusef%20Amelion%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Brusef Amelion's Sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brusef%20Amelion%27s%20Cuirass\"&gt;Brusef Amelion's Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;, which are enchanted with &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Shield%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Shield&lt;/a&gt; respectively, from the family tomb nearby, so she can sell them to pay off the debt. At this point, the quest can be finished in one of two ways:\nOption 1: Pay the debt.\nIf one has the courtesy and the gold, give Biene the money necessary to pay the debt. After that, she will give them permission to keep her grandfather's armor, should they run across them later on, or loot the cave directly. Biene will also mark the location of her ancestor's tomb on the map for their convenience. One should choose this option if the sword and armor has already been sold, as it does not respawn ever again.\nThe two items that Biene wants them to obtain from Amelion Tomb have a base value of 1037 gold (Biene only wants the cuirass and the sword, not the other five pieces of armor that can also be retrieved from the tomb).\nOption 2: Loot the tomb.\nLeave for Amelion's Tomb and loot it, as Biene has been kind enough to mark it on the map. It's located across the Lower Niben, southeast of Water's Edge. Once they've looted the tomb thoroughly and obtained the sword and cuirass return to Biene. Once again the Hero is given the opportunity to give her the money to pay the debt and keep the items for themselves.\nGoing back to Cheydinhal.\nReturn to Burz gro-Khash in Cheydinhal to receive the usual level-dependent gold reward and a one-point Fame increase. If the \"&lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Thieves\"&gt;Den of Thieves&lt;/a&gt;\" quest has already been completed, Burz will also be willing to bestow upon the Hero the rank of Protector. They will then have to go to &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt; in Chorrol for the next quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Master%27s%20Son\"&gt;The Master's Son&lt;/a&gt;.

In &lt;a href=\"1E%20372\"&gt;1E 372&lt;/a&gt;, an Ultimatum was issued by the Emperor (possibly Ami-el) forcing the last remaining &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s out of Cyrodiil, including those that sided with &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt; such as Laloriaran Dynar and his subjects in &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt;. Ami-El would later pass away when he was poisoned, supposedly by his own daughter."}

He later died in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20864\"&gt;2E 864&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; rebel, &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nAmiel Richton was born on &lt;a href=\"2E%20816\"&gt;2E 816&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;. He grew up raised by a minor noble family.\nService to Cuhlecain.\nAmiel, like Tiber Septim, also began his service under &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, the last emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;. His family also supported Cuhlecain, and Richton himself was very loyal. After being overthrown, Amiel became in service of Tiber Septim.\nCaptain of the New West Navy.\nTiber Septim employed Richton to be become the commander of the New West Navy, a navy responsible for battles west of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. He led a campaign against the pirates of the Abecean, and commanded a squadron at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bjoulsae\"&gt;Battle of Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt; that put &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; under control of the Empire. After &lt;a href=\"Vasi%20Hadrach\"&gt;Vasi Hadrach&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by a &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, Richton succeeded him and became the new Admiral.\nBattle of Hunding Bay.\nRichton's crowning moment came during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Richton employed the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; to shoot Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; during the battle. After destroying many fleets, Richton finished off Prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; remaining forces and &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; by calling on the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt; to kill any remaining members as well as destroy the old quarter of Port Hunding.\nBecoming Provisional Governor of Stros M'kai.\nAfter the battle Richton became the Provisional Governor of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, which became one of the biggest supply ports for the navy. His job was clear the island and waters around of any Abacean pirates or Crowns and guard the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt;. Richton moved into Prince A'Tor's former palace and made it the base of operations of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; on the island. Richton's rule was found to have been dictatorial and oppressive by the inhabitants of Stros M'kai.\nCyrus and the Restless League.\nRichton hired Cyrus to deliver &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;'s amulet to him. When Cyrus arrived and gave him the amulet, he asked for information on his sister. Richton lied claiming he knew nothing, causing Cyrus to threaten him. Cyrus killed three of his guards before being thrown in the catacombs by Dram. Cyrus had then later escaped.\nRichton then employed Dram to hunt down Cyrus, though all attempts proved to be a failure. Cyrus plotted against Richton with the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;Restless League&lt;/a&gt; to overthrow Richton. Cyrus then killed Nafaalilargus who was guarding A'Tor's soul gem and used it to create the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nCyrus then invaded the palace. He used the Soul Sword to guide him and managed to kill many of the guards. Cyrus then reached Richton on the Dwemer Airship stationed on the palace courtyard. As the Airship began to fly, he dueled in sword combat and Richton was defeated, but managed to use his last moments to distract Cyrus. Cyrus was forced to surrender by Dram who held a dagger to his throat and dropped his sword. The sword then flew up and killed Richton by stabbing him in the chest, and later sliced Dram in two halves. Cyrus then jumped down from the airship and cut open the fabric, causing it to crash.\nCyrus and the Restless League remained victorious and freed Stros M'kai from Richton's rule, after which the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; was signed.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Retrieve%20N%27Gasta%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Retrieve N'Gasta's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon retrieving the amulet and returning it to the palace, a cutscene will commence. Cyrus will threaten Richton for not giving any information on his sister and is thrown in the catacombs.\n&lt;a href=\"Escape%20the%20Catacombs\"&gt;Escape the Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Cyrus escapes a cutscene will show Richton telling Dram to hunt down the rebel.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20the%20Palace\"&gt;Attack on the Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nCyrus will defeat the guards and eventually duel Richton, resulting in his death."}

Bantien notes that she spent several months observing the draugr, carefully describing their hostility, language, and worship of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priests&lt;/a&gt;.\nContents.\nIt wasn't until my seventh month with the creatures that they seemed to accept me. Well, \"accept\" isn't really the proper word, but they seemed to have decided that I posed no threat to them and gradually ceased their attacks. Though more than capable of fending them off (a combination of fire and turning spells are generally sufficient), I admit that I tired of having to be ever vigilant in their presence.\nI'll never know whether there was some sort of agreement communicated among them, for the only utterances they make seem to be in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;that heathen tongue&lt;/a&gt; that I can't even pronounce, much less transcribe. In time, I learned more of their intentions towards me from their general movements and tones rather than specific words. Hostility in any creature is easily read, but in these most peculiar of the living dead, with such variations in gait and speed, what amounts to a hostile charge in one may simply be casual movement in another. The eyes seem to be key to their intent, and I will confess to more than one dream haunted by the glowing pinpoints in the darkness.\nI had always wondered why the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20cult\"&gt;dragon cult&lt;/a&gt; insisted that their followers be buried with them. It seems the height of pagan vanity to drag your conscripts to their death along with you, but as I integrated into their presence, I began to observe the reasons. Every day, a different set of draugr would awaken, shamble their way to the sarcophagus of their priest, and prostrate themselves before it. Several hours of this, followed by a meticulous cleaning of the area. It would appear that the adherents of the dragon priest continue their worship of him in death, which would also explain the ferocity with which they defend his chambers.\nIt took several weeks before I felt comfortable approaching the dragon priest's resting place, myself. Inch by inch, until the snarling &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; around me seemed to tire of fending off my timid presence. I was able to set some simple scrying spells around the tomb, that I might get a sense of what magical energies resided there. When the next group of draugr came to pay homage to the priest, I noted a sort of transferral happening. A distinct flow of life force between the adherents and the master.\nIt was here that I finally understood the dragon cult's notion of resurrection. The second eternal life was only promised to those who ascended to the priesthood, but the lesser functionaries contributed their life force to sustaining them for eternity. I don't know what sort of eternal wellspring they draw from, but it's clear that each draugr carries only the barest whisper of life in it, and rekindles it nightly while resting in its niche. I now believe that the grotesque forms that we see in the barrows were, in fact, buried fully as men and women, and only over the thousands of years that have passed withered into the wretched things we know. If we had visited a barrow directly after its construction, we might not have even known any of its inhabitants were dead!\nThese discoveries and extrapolations excite me, and my mind aches to return to the barrows. I have only paused here at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College&lt;/a&gt; to transcribe these notes and gather further supplies for a more extended stay. My new hope is to learn some rudimentary way of speaking to them, for imagining what they could tell us of the early mists of time is staggering."}

Once you arrive, you will find &lt;a href=\"Talia%20at-Marimah\"&gt;Talia at-Marimah&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance; speak with her and she will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Shiri\"&gt;Shiri&lt;/a&gt; is here and is raising some of the most evil people to ever come out of the Alik'r. Talia went in to stop her alongside Prince Azah and &lt;a href=\"Throne%20Keeper%20Farvad\"&gt;Throne Keeper Farvad&lt;/a&gt;, but they were overpowered; Talia is not sure whether the others are still alive.\nHead inside and start looking for Prince Azah. Talia will accompany you here. Take the path to the north, then head east once you get to the bridge. There, you will find the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20the%20Virtuous%20Maidens\"&gt;Crypt of the Virtuous Maidens&lt;/a&gt;; Azah will be inside. You will notice him to your left once you enter; dispatch the enemies and then talk to him. He will tell you that Shiri now has all three of the &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Wards\"&gt;Ansei Wards&lt;/a&gt;; she took the wards you recovered previously from Azah and Farvad. He will say that &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Maja\"&gt;Ansei Maja&lt;/a&gt;'s ward is in the next room; Shiri performed some kind of ritual and then left it there. Head through the door to your north; you will find the ward with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alasan\"&gt;Alasan&lt;/a&gt; floating above it; Shiri apparently freed him from the ward. Kill him, then take the ward. \nOnce you have Ansei Maja's Ward, it is time to go looking for Throne Keeper Farvad. Head outside and across the bridge, then continue along the path until you have crossed a second bridge. East of there, you will find the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Blessed%20Interment\"&gt;Tomb of Blessed Interment&lt;/a&gt;; head in and you will see Farvad to your left. Speak with him and he will tell you that Shiri has corrupted the Ward, but that he will be able to cleanse it if you protect him during the ritual. Head over to the next room and you will find the ward there. Farvad will start cleansing it; your task is to defend him from the several waves of consecrated dead that will attack you during the process. Once the dead are dead again and Farvad has finished the ritual, te will tell you to meet him at the central tomb so you can confront Shiri. \nProceed onward and exit the Ward Chamber, then head straight ahead to the central tomb. You will meet Azah and Farvad there; speak with Farvad and he will tell you that Shiri is trying to resurrect her father &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt;. Shiri has sealed the door though, but Farvad will tell you that by wielding the power of the two wards you have, they can break the seal and open the door. This does mean that two of your companions bust stay behind; you must now choose which of Farvad, Azah and Talia will accompany you. Once you have made your choice, the other two will unseal the door and you can head inside to confront Shiri. \nShiri will be down the path in the center of the big room. She will attack you on sight, but once she is at low health, she will sacrifice herself to raise her father from the dead. Suturah is quite a bit stronger than Shiri, so be prepared. After you have killed him, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Halelah\"&gt;Ansei Halelah&lt;/a&gt; will appear and tell you to take her Ward; take it, then meet up with your friends outside. Ansei Halelah has opened a portal to Sentinel there, but will request to speak with you before you head through.

The symbol of the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Diamond\"&gt;Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; (Chim-El Adabal), stemmed from the amulet and became the royal seal of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; much later. Only those with &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon Blood&lt;/a&gt; could wear the amulet; otherwise it would slip from the wearer's neck. Many theories exist as to its origin, the most commonly believed being that it is a crystalized drop of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s blood following his defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. Others believe that Akatosh formed the gem from his blood and gave it to Saint Alessia as a token of his willingness to keep &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt; safe from the wrath of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;. Other theories report that the amulet is, in fact, a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; origin.\nIn , it is a central item during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; delivered the amulet to &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the last heir of the late Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;. With it, he invoked the avatar of Akatosh and battled &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the amulet in the process and sealing the bridge between &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; forever. It also played a major role during the events of where it was used in an unsuccessful ritual to make Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; Dragonborn and later to imbue the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; with extreme powers to defeat &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nCreation.\nWhen Akatosh and Trinimac slew Lorkhan and flung &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;his heart&lt;/a&gt; across Tamriel, a droplet of blood fell as it flew over &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and landed in an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Well\"&gt;Ayleid Well&lt;/a&gt;. The blood was fused with a red crystal, and retrieved by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshipping Ayleids. They then polished and cut it into the shape of a diamond, titling it the \"Chim-el Adabal.\" Other theories say that it was Akatosh's own blood, drawn from his heart which he used to bless Saint Alessia, making the Covenant with her that so long as her descendants are true to the Dragon Blood, the Dragonfires would burn and Tamriel would be safe from the Daedra.\n&lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant with Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Ayleids &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; native to the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic continent, a commoner named &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, the matriarch of the Cyrodilic Royal Line from which renowned rulers such as &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; came, rose up among them and led &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;a rebellion&lt;/a&gt; against the Ayleids, divinely inspired by the apparition of Akatosh.\nThe Dragon God of Time and ruler of the noble &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, Akatosh, looking with pity upon the plight of men, drew blood from his own heart, and blessed Alessia with this blood of Dragons. With her, he forged a covenant that so long as Alessia's bloodline remained pure to its dragon blood, Akatosh would seal the veils between &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;the mortal plane&lt;/a&gt;. Akatosh then gave her the crystal as a reward for her conquering of Cyrod. The amulet became a soul gem containing Alessia's soul after she died, and was worn by her son &lt;a href=\"Belharza\"&gt;Belharza&lt;/a&gt; after she became a saint, and presumably by his successors.\n&lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;, the Amulet was lost. However, it was later found when &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was born with the Chim-el Adabal on his forehead. As of his rule of the Empire, it became tradition that upon the crowning of each emperor, the Amulet of Kings is taken to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Ceremoniously, the Dragonfires were lit with the amulet and the pact with Akatosh lived on. The emperor would be \"soul-linked\" to the amulet, and the fires would remain burning until the monarch's death.\nSecond Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; Emperor Varen Aquilarios sought out to find the Amulet in order to make himself a Dragonborn so that he could legitimize his claim to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and formed the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;. After two years of searching, they managed to recover the amulet, and began a ritual involving the lighting of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;. However, one of the companions, &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, revealed that he set up the ritual as a trick, and immobilized the companions. He then manipulated the Amulet and Dragonfires and used their power to rip a tear between Oblivion and Mundus, causing an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; that would allow for Molag Bal and his Daedra to invade Tamriel, leaving &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; \"adrift in the Mundus.\" One of the companions, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, took the amulet and hid it within &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of the Planemeld and &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, a prisoner later known as the Vestige was captured by Mannimarco and sacrificed to Molag Bal. They were later rescued by &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Five Companions, and came in contact with Varen. Following a series of tasks, the Vestige journeyed to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt;, where Sai Sahan was held prisoner for two years by Mannimarco, who sought to extract the knowledge of the amulet's location by torturing Sai. Sai was rescued and took the companions to the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Valley of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, where his mentor &lt;a href=\"Kasura\"&gt;Kasura&lt;/a&gt; held a ring bearing the sigil of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; that was keeping the amulet safe from Bal's clutches.\nWith the ring, the companions journeyed to Sancre Tor to retrieve the amulet. However, Mannimarco was observing Sai's actions secretly, and attempted to defeat them with hordes of undead. Mannimarco later fought the Vestige and was killed, with his spirit taken to &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; by Molag Bal. The companions then retrieved the amulet and set up a plan to invade Bal's realm. At &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Grief\"&gt;Heart's Grief&lt;/a&gt;, Abnur Tharn needed to sacrifice either Varen, Lyris, or Sai in order to imbue the Vestige with Akatosh's blessing. After the ritual, the Vestige was granted with temporary extreme power, and defeated Molag Bal. Abnur Tharn later escaped with the amulet, and fled to Cyrodiil. He attempted to use it, though his attempts were fruitless as the amulet's power had been expended for at least a generation to come.\nThird Era.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies later, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; recovered the amulet from Reman III's tomb in Sancre Tor during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; after fending off the Nord and Breton armies. Later on, the amulet would come to be passed on to Septim's successors.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;a prisoner&lt;/a&gt; accompanied &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, the then bearer of the Amulet. After an attack by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel was assassinated, and the prisoner was tasked with delivering the amulet to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt;. Jauffre then kept the amulet hidden, but after Uriel's illegitimate son &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; was escorted to the priory, the artifact was found to be stolen by the Mythic Dawn.\nThe prisoner, later known as the Hero of Kvatch and Champion of Cyrodiil, journeyed into &lt;a href=\"Gaiar%20Alata\"&gt;Gaiar Alata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s paradise in Oblivion. Camoran was found to be wearing the amulet, and after being slain by the hero, the amulet was returned to its rightful owner Martin.\nMartin then began to make preparations at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; for his coronation as the new emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the lighting of the Dragonfires, but before this could be done, the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the imminent threat facing Tamriel and the Empire, Martin crushed the amulet at the temple during his coronation to defeat &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; and close shut the jaws of Oblivion forever. The destruction of the Amulet of Kings and the end of the Oblivion Crisis marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nCraftsmanship.\nKnown as \"Chim-El Adabal,\" the Amulet of Kings is, according to one source, a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; of Ayleid origin, imbued with the soul of &lt;a href=\"Empress\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20266\"&gt;2E 266&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The gem is the red diamond in the middle of the Amulet, the symbol of the Empire and later taken as the symbol of the Septim line. It is surrounded by eight other gems, one for each of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;divines&lt;/a&gt;."}

After stealing it, Amusei tried to sell it back to Alessia, who had him thrown into jail.\nIn order to find out the location of the ring, the Hero must go into the prison and speak to Amusei. Amusei will be less than excited for the visit and will ask why he should offer any help when he is stuck in prison and awaiting his execution. Three options will be possible to this question.\nTwo options will be met in swift rejection, due to lack of trust and freedom. Helping him by slipping him a lockpick is the only way to get his help. He will explain his story about how he was unable to fence the ring due to the inscription inside, and how the countess \"tricked him\" and locked him up. He will add that the countess rarely leaves the castle, so he himself doesn't see how they Hero will be able to get the ring.\nAfter escaping, he will leave the city to continue his life elsewhere as a freelance thief.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Histories\"&gt;Lost Histories&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile searching for &lt;a href=\"Theranis\"&gt;Theranis&lt;/a&gt;, a missing guild member, the Hero will discover he was captured and put in the prisons inside &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Skingrad\"&gt;Castle Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;.

Theranis has been missing for a few days, and the lady had just taken Amusei for the third time within the last hour.\nFollowing the trail of blood and the hidden passages, the Hero will find a hidden room with Amusei and the Pale lady, who has been draining blood from her prisoners. After freeing Amusei and getting him out of the castle, he will tell the Hero what happened.\nAfter being locked up, he was put into the same cell as Theranis, and the two began to talk. Before Theranis was taken for the third time, he explained that before he was arrested, he hid the book and wanted Amusei to get it to the guild, as he knew that he would die. Amusei will tell the Hero the book's location as thanks, and head out to attempt to join the guild again, seeing the perks of being a part of it.\nMember of the Guild.\nAfter this, he will join the guild and become the personal messenger to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;.

Very little is known about them, other than the fact that they rebuffed &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe An-Xileel were largely responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequent occupation, of southern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. They stopped their advance in Morrowind decades ago after being driven back by &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and have not showed the slightest interest in doing anything since then. They have, however, prevented the Empire from reclaiming their territory.\nAccording to the Imperial perspective, the An-Xileel \"were entirely nativistic in their views, interested only in purging the former colonial influences and returning Black Marsh to whatever state they imagined it had been in before it was ruled by foreign powers.\"\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; attempted to conquer Tamriel in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The An-Xileel rallied the natives of Black Marsh and &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel%20Daedric%20resistance\"&gt;pushed back Daedric forces&lt;/a&gt; with a ferocity unmatched in Tamriel save &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; itself. Argonians poured into the Gates \"with such fury and might, Dagon's Lieutenants had to close them.\" Following the Crisis, the An-Xileel remained the most dominant political force in Black Marsh. \nMany cities in Black Marsh have been known to be under the party's control, such as &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. They defeated Imperial forces there and looted the Old Imperial Quarter. They forbade all foreigners from entering the city, only letting those who were licensed enter. The An-Xileel and wild Argonians have complete access to the city-tree, and only An-Xileel are allowed to talk with it. \nAn-Xileel warriors participated in the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%206\"&gt;4E 6&lt;/a&gt; that had been incited by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, capturing parts of southern Morrowind and sacking &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. They only stopped their advance due to being pushed back in a &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; led defense force. However, the An-Xileel have not displayed any interest in doing anything further.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2048\"&gt;4E 48&lt;/a&gt;, the An-Xileel allowed &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; to summon the flying city of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, using the \"rogue\" Hist tree in Lilmoth to contact its \"cousins\" aboard the city, as long as it exterminated all foreign taint and \"assimilated\" Argonians in Black Marsh. The city did this for them, but soon started pursuing its own agenda after the An-Xileel lost control of it. The city then went on a northwestern path to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, raising those it killed from the dead. The city was ultimately stopped when a group led by &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; destroyed it.\nThe party's history after the &lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt; remains unknown. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20150\"&gt;4E 150&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Argonians sailed to &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of wreaking havoc, but were repelled. \nStructure.\nThe exact structure is unknown, but it is known that they were led by an Archwarden by the name of Qajalil in &lt;a href=\"4E%2048\"&gt;4E 48&lt;/a&gt;. They are also led by a ruling council known as the Organism, which is based in &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. They are presumed to be based in &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;, Black Marsh, and are most likely comprised entirely of Argonians. The few non-Argonian advisors are poorly paid."}

The Argonian forces apparently managed to break into Oblivion itself, fighting and winning against the Daedra. The &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; lieutenants were forced to close their own Gates to prevent being overrun, something unheard of anywhere else. The An-Xileel and their resistance managed to hold Black Marsh until Martin defeated Dagon in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and closed all the Gates forever.\nFollowing the Crisis, the An-Xileel emerged as the dominant political force in Black Marsh, and managed to restore the province's independence in the following years due to the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; inciting an uprising. The Argonians remained a force to be reckoned with, nearly destroying the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, as well as suppressing any remnants of the Empire in the region. This event was known as the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt;. By 4E 40, Black Marsh was still independent of the new empire under &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede&lt;/a&gt;."}

I've spoken to &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, and everyone agrees that cults of &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; (and thus werewolves, who are his children) are on the rise across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. I've even heard reports that some madmen have been actively seeking out the curse of &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;!\nI do not think I should need to remind anyone, especially any Nord, of the evil of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;\u2014even of one who claims the joy of hunting as his realm. There may be some draw to the wild power of werewolves, but you'd better remember that you'll never see the halls of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; when Hircine claims your soul. Lycanthropes spend eternity in &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hircine's Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, slaves to his unending thirst for blood and the chase, instead of drinking mead and brawling with the heroes of legend.\nYsgramor taught us to know our enemy through blood on our hands, and to scrawl our runes of conquest on the corpses in our wake. Our warriors have faced many werewolves, and while I don't have any corpses handy at the moment (and because they would pollute the rather pleasant library we have), I will preserve their knowledge here:\n&lt;a href=\"Thonarcal%20Ice-Fist\"&gt;Thonarcal Ice-Fist&lt;/a&gt; recalls his revulsion: \u201cI saw one of them turn right before my eyes, and my blood ran cold. He got the jump on me, so stunned was I at the grotesque display. Be wary if your target is not already in its fearsome beast-form.\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Irmgarde%20the%20Bootbarren\"&gt;Irmgarde the Bootbarren&lt;/a&gt; knows a secret of the beast: \u201cAlways keep a poisoned blade or arrow-tips handy when you hunt them. Even poisons that aren't all that strong seem to ravage the monsters.\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Hallveig%20God-Hater\"&gt;Hallveig God-Hater&lt;/a&gt; has read the tale of their hides: \u201cIt seems to me that their pelts say something about them. The ones with darker fur use fast strikes and ragged claws to tear into you. Every now and then I've glimpsed a white one. They're usually surrounded by a pack, howling and driving them into a frenzy in combat.\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Agdis%20Bearblood\"&gt;Agdis Bearblood&lt;/a&gt; prays to &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;: \u201cDon't get bitten or cut up by them. If you do, you'd better get yourself to a priest right away. The disease can be cured, but don\u2019t risk letting it get into your blood.\u201d"}

My studies have already added much to my knowledge of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and death &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Why my fascination with the dead? I believe it goes back to my early childhood, when I would watch the sick and dying &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; in their pens, marveling at their pain and suffering.\nThere was one slave in particular, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who went by the name of &lt;a href=\"Abilar\"&gt;Abilar&lt;/a&gt;. Abilar was ancient when I was young. He was kind to the children of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a teacher and guardian for the youngest among us. I was one of his students. He always had stories to tell and sweets to hand out. I found him to be \u2026 interesting. For a slave.\nOne day, Abilar did not show up to teach and watch over us. Instead, an &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; whose name I don't recall came in his stead. When I asked about the Khajiit, the Argonian said that Abilar was ill and would not be returning. This intrigued me, as illness always did, and as soon as the opportunity arose I went in search of the ancient Khajiit.\nI found Abilar in the slave pens, lying on one of the hard platforms that served as beds for the household thralls. His eyes were closed, but he tossed and turned as though terrible dreams plagued him. I found a stool and sat beside Abilar, determined to watch and record every moment of his slide into death. My mother passed by and decided I was keeping a favored servant company until his end. I made no attempt to otherwise explain my actions.\nIt took Abilar three days to expire. He went in and out of consciousness along the way. Sometimes he was completely coherent and seemed genuinely touched that I was by his side. Other times he was delirious, speaking of places and people I knew nothing of. These periods of nonsense, I determined, were really glimpses of the border between life and death. Abilar's mind was bemused by the increasingly frequent trips his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was making back and forth across the border.\nWhen the end finally approached, I moved closer and stared directly into Abilar's eyes. I saw the fear within them, and the acceptance. I saw the dawning understanding as his mind finally began to comprehend the mysteries and strangeness of the borderland. I asked him to tell me what he saw, what he knew, what he was experiencing. He started to form the words, started to reveal his secret to me. And then I watched as the light in his eyes dimmed and the breath rattled out of him. He died without so much as uttering a final word.\nThat was the day. That was when my affair with death and its mysteries began. I have devoted my life to discovering the secrets of death and dying. I have learned to harness the power of necromancy. But still a few vital secrets elude me. I shall never stop searching, even if it means a million slaves must die. After all, what's more important than knowledge? Abilar taught me that, and I shall always honor his lesson."}

She will ask you to speak with the priestess here if you wish to help. \nYou will find Priestess Marcella up the road, near the Skyshard. She will tell you that the bandits stole four holy relics, one of which is said to have divine mystical properties. They have sent four soldiers into the fort to try and reclaim the relics, but they have yet to return. Your job now is to head into the ruins, find the missing soldiers and retrieve the relics. The first relic, the Phylactery of Mara, can be found in the first room you enter after going through the hallway. It will be on the top floor, in the northwest of the room.

The Dagger of Mara will be in the southwest of this area, in a tower across the river. It will be guarded by &lt;a href=\"Engannas\"&gt;Engannas&lt;/a&gt;, so you will have to kill her to get it. Finally, head north into the Inner Court. The bandit leader &lt;a href=\"Accalia\"&gt;Accalia&lt;/a&gt; is in this room, but it is possible to get past without fighting him. Kill him or sneak past, then head into the room to the west to find the final relic, the Chalice of Mara. You will have to use the lever to get into the room. Take the Chalice, then head out of the fort and return the items to Marcella Ammianus to finish the quest."}

This isn't you!\"\nFurther down the path, the third stone is found, showing Marzula-jo trying to fix his mistake by resurrecting Zaorir, although it appears that he had also been suffering from the same aftereffects as Sugarsnout.\nMarzula-jo: \"Now, this is a little unorthodox, but I just felt horrible about what happened. Bringing you back to life is an imperfect solution, I know, but I am confident you'll get used to this ... new beginning?\"\nThe last memory stone is of Zaorir eating from a corpse of a Khajiit he supposedly killed. After Marzula-jo pleads for him to stop, Zaorir sits up and runs towards him, attacking him.\nMarzula-jo: \"Zaorir, no! Stop it this instant! Please? No, no, no! Don't do that. Don't\u2014\"\nAfter viewing all four stones, as well as reading Marzula-jo's notes, head towards the exit of the cave and report your findings to Narama-ko. She will be elated with the news and thank you, despite the warnings about the drawbacks of the technique.\n\"Bright moons, you're back! Not that I had any doubts, mind you. So? Success? Did you find Marzula-jo's notes and memory stones?\""}

When I set out to travel Tamriel in search of new techniques, some already called me a master of the &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. I knew this wasn't true. I'd heard tales from distant lands about hunters who could sit motionless for days stalking elusive prey, of bowmen who could fire two and three arrows at a time and still hit their marks, and other, similar stories everyone assured me were just legends and hearsay. Every legend starts somewhere.\nThe Wood Elves are renowned archers, so I traveled first to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The journey into the heart of the forest itself was long and fraught with perils I had never known. I spent months searching for a teacher, challenging every Elf with a bow I could find. Finally, I met a &lt;a href=\"Jaqspur\"&gt;Jaqspur&lt;/a&gt;, an unerringly accurate long-distance archer. He never spoke a word, but accepted my challenge and split my own arrows mid-flight. He tolerated my company, and we hunted beasts deep in the heart of the woods, stalking creatures that I had never seen nor heard of. I learned how to quiet my mind and slow my breathing, and how to lie in wait unmoving, waiting for the perfect shot, no matter how long it took.\nAfter we parted ways (the Jaqspur was simply gone one morning), I tried in vain to gain passage on ships headed for the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, desperate to discover if High Elves could truly create physical arrows out of nothing but concentrated magicka. I'd heard tales of their potent &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, rumors of a potion that can sharpen a man's vision to be like that of an eagle. No ship would have me, though, and I couldn't bribe, beg, or connive my way in.\nUndaunted, I continued to the east and into &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, longing to obtain an authentic &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; shortbow. There are many roaming bands of Khajiit in the northern grasslands, and I've been told since that I was fortunate indeed to encounter a group that found me entertaining instead of just an easy mark. Perhaps I was still a bit green, but it was worth the risk to learn their method of rapid shooting from horseback, and how they craft their barbed arrowheads to puncture even tough leather.\nNow, I will set out for &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, that dread swamp. My Khajiiti companions find my intent to venture there a source of great hilarity, but I won't be turned away. Who knows what the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; have learned to do with a bow deep in the bogs? What unique approach might they have? I leave this record with the Khajiit to donate to any bookseller in hopes that someone might draw inspiration or knowledge from my efforts.\nMy journey is not yet over, though I have been away from home for many years. I have learned much since setting out, but most importantly, I have learned that there is far more that I do not know than I ever could have believed."}

According to family traditions, this text was written by his ancestor Uruld. The exact date is unknown.\nA wave of insipid rumors have been filling the minds of our youth with flights of fancy. We cannot tolerate this. Ours is a life of cold and survival. A constant struggle to hunt, to forage enough food to fill our bellies. To find wood to keep our fires lit overnight. We cannot allow the young folk to become distracted by these fanciful tales of &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt;! \nTherefore, I have made it my duty to disprove all these rumors with the well of logic gifted to me by the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; and great age. If, after reading this, you still believe in Fauns and Lamia and such, then I apologize. There is no more I can do for you. I hope you remember my fervent attempt to save you when your daydreaming results in a lean season and a rumbling belly. \nARGONIANS AND KHAJIIT \nWe start of course with the beastfolk that do exist. These distant travelers, so different from our ways, are why the children think these others might walk or fly or swim through the world. Khajiiti traders carry stories from afar to fill the minds of our young with strange and flighty ideas. Argonians speak of their talking trees and lands so warm the soil weeps with water. They are real, do not think me close minded. But they have brought trouble to our villages with their stories and songs. Real! But trouble. \nLILMOTHIIT \nLet's start with these stories of fox folk. Utter hogs wallop. Recall that large Khajiit woman who said she was a Pahmar? Her head scraped the underside of the cabins and she could lift a wagon on her own! If she is a Khajiit, then surely Khajiit can look all kinds of ways. I refuse to be deceived by those who wish to prank me by making up new things when the real world is so fanciful. Not real. \nLAMIA \nMore tall tales based on real folk. Tell me, you saw a scaled lizard person who lived near water? Sounds exactly like an Argonian to me. Perhaps you just could not see their legs, did not think to call out and say hello? Let us not be so ready to perceive slight differences in one folk and decide they are now two. Unwise and unkind, if you ask me. Not real. \nCENTAURS AND FAUNS \nHorsefolk have tainted the tales in the local tavern and childrens' games as well. I must deal with talk of centaurs! Half-man, half horse? Mounted riders seen through aging eyes, mark my words. Fauns are the same. Tales of their existence spread by the unreliable. There is nothing in the tales of fauns that could convince me that they are not goats as seen by inebriated druids. Not real. \nBIRDFOLK \nOne of those Elsweyr traders I mentioned could not stop telling stories about these feathered folk. Avian men and women with talons and the capacity for speech? Shor's bones! If birds are beastfolk, then I will eat a boar's droppings! We all know the birds featured in the traveling shows, colorful creatures that can mimic speech. Surely these birdfolk stories comes from the mouths of less thoughtful people seeing these chatty birds. Not real. \nSLOAD, DREUGH, HADOLIDS, AND WHAT ALL \nWherever sailors and fisherfolk come together to tell tales, we hear of fanciful beastfolk roaming far and wide. I've been down to the edge of the water, so you cannot fool me. The sea is constantly in motion. What one sailor sees out of the corner of their eye may look to be a dreaded great toad beast or a crab man. But in truth? Nothing more than a rock or figment of their imagination. If nothing else, just look to how many of these supposed sea folk the sailors like to regale us with. Seems quite suspect, as if these ship hands just cannot help but top one another with taller and taller tales. Not real! \nIMGA \nAs for the last classifications of beastfolk, we have rude descriptions of folk unknown in the wider world. Remember, my age and the Divines allow me great insight. Have you ever seen a person from Valenwood? They dress quite strangely and smell of the distant forests. These \"Imga,\" ape folk, don't you see? Wood Elves seen by people without my expansive mind. Imagine being so wrong, so close-minded that you see a person from another land and decide to imagine them as a fanciful creature. To immortalize their appearance and vilify them. Needless to say! Not real! \nConsider this, young people. Think of my words. I hope my pleas will dissuade and preserve the minds of the youth. I have done all I can. I only hope that they see the sense in my logic and desist with these fanciful tales. Focus on the now, young ones. Lest the winter take you."}

When interacted with, the Armiger will tell them the following:\n\"Be wary, traveler. Pilgrims have been attacked on these roads. Should you encounter violence, don't hesitate to call on us. We're here to protect you.\"\nThe Vestige will now have to find Captain Naros and speak to her. She can be found inside &lt;a href=\"The%20Penitent%20Pilgrim%20Inn\"&gt;The Penitent Pilgrim Inn&lt;/a&gt; of Molag Mar, directly right upon entering, overlooking some maps. When spoken to, she will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"\"If you're passing through, pay attention. I'll say this once: \"Pilgrims who ignore me vanish from the roads, vanish from the roads by morning, whether you're from near or far, best keep your arse at Molag Mar.\"\nYou're a Buoyant Armiger? \"\"&lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec's&lt;/a&gt; finest: fleet and fit, besting heretic by sword and Ordinator by wit. Sworn to live a life of noble grace, except to laugh in danger's face. And sometimes we kwama-wrangle groups of pilgrims. Warrior-poets are quite versatile.\"\"\nThe Vestige has to travel to an Ashlander camp southeast of Molag Mar to search for any evidence incriminating the Ashlanders living there. Note that entering the camp counts as trespassing, and one can receive a bounty upon being noticed. The first piece of evidence can be found near a large campfire in the northern part of the camp, it explains how multiple Ashlanders have gone missing while searching for offerings. They question why their gods would allow this, and all this while the \"slaves of false gods erect their blasphemous temples.\" The second piece of evidence can be found in the northeastern part of the camp, in an area closed off by some big pillars. This piece describes the \"&lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Appeasement\"&gt;Ritual of Appeasement&lt;/a&gt;,\" a ritual used to please &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20princes\"&gt;Daedric princes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter gathering all the evidence, the Vestige must investigate the Ashlanders' ritual site to find out what sort of rituals have taken place there. Once there, they will discover a large stone alter with a fresh pile of blood and entrails covering it, indicating that something died there recently. The Vestige is, however, surprised by &lt;a href=\"Ibaal\"&gt;Ibaal&lt;/a&gt;, an Ashlander who noticed them sneaking around the camp:\n\"Is this why you sneak through our camp, to desecrate our sacred rites? Do the slaves of the false gods fear us so much they won't even face us themselves? Why are you here, Outlander? Answer truthfully and I may only hobble you.\"\nThe Vestige must now make their way to the three campsites north of the Ashlander camp Ibaal described. When arriving at the first campsite, they will discover a pile of mutilated remains containing \"worried bones.\" At the second campsite, a deceased pilgrim and Armiger can be found. At the third campsite, the Vestige will encounter a corpse, completely picked clean, making it impossible to identify whoever this was. They must now return to Ibaal at the Helan Ancestral Tomb and explore it on their own, because Ibaal refuses to enter an ancestral tomb explaining that they are \"unclean and treacherous\". His are proven right; the tomb has several pressure plate-activated traps. At the very end of the tomb is Baren Maloren, a frightened &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; convinced that the \"Ruddy Man\" is hunting him. Explaining that it tore his companions' head clean off, making him hide in the tomb. Balen tells the Vestige that the Rudy Man attacked his party near the Dreudurai Glass Mine, and after escorting him to safety, the Vestige must search for the Rudy Man there.\nUpon inspection, however, the Rudy Man appears to just be a large Dreugh. Ibaal has the following to say:\n\"\"Was that the creature the pilgrims fear? This \"Rudy Man\" of legend? It is skulking vermin inflated by the lies of a false god, nothing more.\"\"\nVery well, I'll find and kill this thing. Ruddy Man or not. \"If this creature is of the dreugh, it may share their weaknesses. I will consult our Wise Woman, they may know something that will aid you in this hunt. Convince the pawns of the Three of what you have found. I will meet you at the mine's entrance.\"\nThe Vestige must now make their way to the glass mine, and once there, speak to Captain Naros. Her forces are still scarce, and she cannot spare anyone. When the Vestige tells her of their discoveries, she will be sceptical, but is willing to hear them out. After showing her the helmet of her deceased comrade, she is willing to let the Vestige enter the mine to kill the \"Ruddy Man\" and save any unaccounted for miners.\nBefore descending into the mine, however, the Vestige must speak to Ibaal. He will offer them a potion made by the Ashlanders' wise woman; it will lure the dreugh into the open, allowing the Vestige to kill it.\nFollowing the path through the mine will lead the Vestige past several dreugh who they will have to defeat. Eventually, they will reach a mud pile containing one of the lost miners; &lt;a href=\"Dalnorea%20Lladri\"&gt;Dalnorea Lladri&lt;/a&gt;. After crossing the suspension bridge, the Vestige will be able to rescue the second miner; &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Rotheran\"&gt;Athyn Rotheran&lt;/a&gt;. The third mud pile is located on a platform directly behind the \"Ruddy Man's\" lair. There, the Vestige can rescue &lt;a href=\"Maeli%20Sasamsi\"&gt;Maeli Sasamsi&lt;/a&gt;, an Ashlander of Ibaal's tribe.\nAfter returning to the supposed Ruddy Man's lair, the Vestige must use the potion the lure it out. Moments later, the monster will emerge and the Vestige will have to defeat it. After besting it, it appears the monster is not actually the Ruddy Man at all, but rather a &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Broodmother\"&gt;Ruddy Broodmother&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaptain Naros will thank the Vestige for ridding the mine of the monster and avoiding a feud with the Ashlanders. After speaking to Ibaal, they will receive their reward."}

These &lt;a href=\"Elytra%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt; -- a most gentle creature if ever there were a gentle creature - they have welcomed me among their brood as one of their own. I have made my life and home in their tunnels as if they were my own humble cabin, and indeed, I have been invited into their warm family unit.\nMany who encounter the Elytra are initially set to unrest by their appearance. Their size alone is sufficient to unsettle most of the humanoid races. The enlarged thorax can grow to be as large as a human male and nearly a full span in girth. When I first encountered my insectoid friends, I believed the enlarged thorax to be a method to manufacture the ichor that is vital to the lives of the Elytra. In truth, the thorax is the precious womb where their noble lives begin.\nHowever, one cannot discount the significance of the ichor that gathers at the spike near the base of the thorax. This precious substance emits a smell that most will describe as acidic and sour (although I find it to be a delight). The ichor serves the most brilliant purpose of the Elytra. It is used to paralyze living tissue of other creatures, rendering them unable to resist the advances of the Elytra. Here is where the true brilliance takes place.\nWhen choosing a suitable host, the Elytra will impose itself on the creature. Any creature that draws breath seems to be biologically suitable for this purpose. I myself have witnessed &lt;a href=\"Elytra%20Matron\"&gt;Elytra Matron&lt;/a&gt;s choose creatures that range from simple &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; to a brilliant &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Character%20Classes%20%28Oblivion%29%23Alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;. Each time, the host is chosen carefully. Oh, I know that the superstitious farmers of the Isles will say that the Elytra will attack any creature, but after what I've seen, I know that they approach each host with the utmost care.\nThe host is injected and their body becomes enriched with the flowing sweetness of the ichor. They relax and quickly expire as the magical nature of the Elytra's sting takes ahold of the host in its gentle grasp. After the host moves on, the Elytra nests its eggs in the still warm shell of the host. There, the eggs warm and grow over a period of mere days, feeding on the giving flesh of the host. Soon after, the hatchlings emerge and stumble forward into the world."}

To be sure, this coarse, uncivilized province is far from hospitable, but it is also a place of fierce, wild beauty, with grand vistas and inspiring natural wonders awaiting those with the will to seek them out and the refinement to truly appreciate them. If you are of a mind to see Skyrim for yourself, I recommend beginning your adventure as I did, by seeking out Stones of Fate.\nNo doubt you are taken aback by the name, as I once was. The provincials and village folk have all manner of dark tales about these ancient monuments. Stories of necromantic rituals and fell spirits, of great and terrible powers conferred on any who dare to touch them.\nThe stories are, as &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; Igrof once told me, \"A load of &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; dung.\" A bit uncouth, but you get the point.\nTo be sure, keep your guards with you at all times - brigands and wild animals are never to be taken lightly. But the stones themselves are nothing to fear. Quite the contrary, their proximity to cities and roads makes them ideal destinations for the novice explorer, and many boast spectacular views that made the journey well worth the effort.\nTo whet your appetite, here are four such locations:\nMost travelers enter Skyrim by way of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, \"Gateway to the North.\" If you find yourself in this backwater hovel, consider taking an afternoon's ride to the north, keeping to the road as it winds down the cliffs at the eastern end of Lake Ilinalta. Just off the path, on a small bluff, lie the three &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Stones\"&gt;Guardian Stones&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest concentration of standing stones in all Skyrim. The view of the lake here at sunset is simply sublime.\nVisitors from &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; will pass through &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, city of intrigue and larceny since &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s day. If you seek adventure in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;, leave the city by the southern gate and cast your gaze upon the bluff that rises to the south. Atop it sits the &lt;a href=\"The%20Shadow%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shadow Stone&lt;/a&gt;, a fitting symbol for the city of thieves.\n&lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; is the heart of Skyrim, its towering palace rivaling even the great castles of Cyrodiil. But should you tire of the Jarl's hospitality, another adventure awaits a few hours east of the city, along the road that rises above White River Gorge. &lt;a href=\"The%20Ritual%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Ritual Stone&lt;/a&gt; can be found atop the lone hill that rises on the north side of the road, set into an ancient monument. Take time to soak in the incredible view of Whiterun, the tundra, and the gorge from this unique spot.\nMore seasoned explorers may wish to visit &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient city of stone far to the west. The recent &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; Rebellion has made travel in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; perilous, but for those determined to seek adventure no matter the cost, another stone can be found to the east of the city, perched on the mountain above &lt;a href=\"Kolskeggr%20Mine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Kolskeggr Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Though the climb is difficult, reaching the summit is a milestone any explorer could be proud of.\nThere are other Stones of Fate to be found in Skyrim - I myself have seen several more, perched on the most remote mountains peaks, or wreathed in fog amid the northern marshes. But the true joy of exploration is in the discovery, and so I leave the rest to you. May &lt;a href=\"the%20Eight\"&gt;the Eight&lt;/a&gt; guide your steps."}

In a sense, my very purpose for being there at all helped me adjust to any homesickness I might have had.\nMarkarth has always been a place that looms over its inhabitants with a kind of ancient superiority that both fascinates and unnerves. The Reach has a reputation for being wild and unruly, but Markarth still has the methodical touch of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Orderly and precise, yet over time it filled with people who are anything but.\nIf someone had told me that I'd fall in love with the place enough to stay here after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; fell, I would have laughed in their face. But that's precisely what happened. It helped too that once Caddach became Ard Caddach, he personally requested that I stay. He is a difficult man to say no to, and I've always had a soft spot for anyone who appreciates my administrative skills.\nPerhaps that's why I've grown to like the &lt;a href=\"Reachfolk\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; so much. Many of them cannot read or write, and have no care to learn. That makes me rather invaluable to them, which is a position I won't deny that I've grown to relish.\nNot to say that life in Markarth as an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; hasn't been rife with challenges. Not everyone appreciates my work. There are clans that arrive who barely trust their own, much less those who are different from them. It's my duty to keep records, to speak with them and help solve disputes, but I must work at a severe disadvantage. I have been threatened, humiliated, and hated. No matter how long I serve here, there are still those among the Reach who don't trust an Imperial meddling in their affairs.\nBut I love this place. I love the strange mix of personalities and clans that Markarth has become. I enjoy working with Ard Caddach, and I enjoy feeling needed. There is no difficulty too great that I couldn't overcome for my devotion to this place and its people."}

The Agent must seek them out in a nearby town, whereupon the bloodline vampire will outline their 'potential problem.' It would appear that a 'vampiric ancient' from 'a tribe inferior' to the Agent's bloodline has moved into their territory, and must be destroyed on principle alone.\nWhite Skin Boots.\nThe bloodline vampire reveals the last known location of the vampire ancient, a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in the same &lt;a href=\"Regions%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt; as the bloodline vampire's town. The Agent is therefore sent to slay the ancient, and take their signature &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, of which the ancient is said to be 'overly proud', as proof. These boots are reportedly made 'from the skin of his victims.'\nWith that, the Agent must journey to and enter the dungeon, searching for the ancient vampire as they do so. There may be other vampire ancients in the dungeon, randomly generated alongside other &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the Agent will have to slay all vampires they come across. The Agent will know that they have found the correct ancient when a slain ancient shouts:\n\"I have returned from the dead once. I shall do so again. And when I do I will hunt you and [Ancient vampire's name] down like the pale worms you are!\"\"\nThe Agent must loot the boots from the vampire ancient's corpse, escape the dungeon, and return to the bloodline vampire before the time limit expires to complete the quest.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will not receive any kind of reward for completing the quest successfully, although there will be a change to their reputation with other factions. Interestingly, there will be no change in reputation with the Agent's vampiric bloodline, regardless of success or failure.\nThe changes in reputation, based on success or failure, are shown below:"}

On the &lt;a href=\"Calendar%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;10th of Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt; the Prince of Nightmares Vaernima may be summoned, if the Agent agrees to pay a summoner of either a &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Coven\"&gt;Witch Coven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Temples%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Agent may approach a summoner at either the Mages Guild, a Temple, or a Witch Coven to summon one of the Daedric Princes. If the summoning occurs on the 10th of Sun's Height, the Agent may receive a vision of Vaernima, Prince of Nightmares, whom immediately offers them a quest. Indeed, Vaernima is keen to spread the corruption of power, if the Agent can tolerate \"murdering an innocent.\"\nA Cadaverous Presence.\nAccepting Vaernima's task reveals that this \"innocent\" is a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;, whom has taken the Prince of Nightmare's powers, only to subsequently betray them. As such, the Agent is required to destroy said lich in its lair in Vaernima's name, before speaking with an apostle of the Prince. This apostle, located in another town, will then hand the Agent their prize, the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith that the Agent should head to and enter the \"innocent\" lich's lair, a &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; located in the same region in which Vaernima was summoned. Inside, the Agent may face a number of liches, and so will have to keep killing the undead creatures until they receive the following notification:\n\"You have slain the lich, fulfilling your part of the bargain with Lady Vaernima.\"\"\nUpon the lich's destruction, the Agent must escape the dungeon and meet with Vaernima's apostle, residing in a nearby town. Should the Agent arrive before the time limit expires the apostle will hand the agent their reward, and a promise to \"embellish\" the Agent's tales of \"outrageous sins\" to the Prince. This conversation will complete the quest.\nRewards.\nCompleting the quest successfully within the time limit will see the Agent rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; by the Prince's apostle. The Agent will also receive a boost in reputation with the faction whom summoned the Prince for them, as well as the faction's associates.

The book's date is unknown, but first appears in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting it was written during the Third Era. Its outline is still broadly applicable, but there are some differences in the later games. These will be discussed in the sections following the list.\nOutline of the Pantheons.\nAll pantheons share some representation of the creator/trickster deity most commonly called Lorkhan, and the dragon god of time, most commonly called Akatosh. Others contain obvious references to certain other spirits, with different emphases.\nCyrodiilic Pantheon.\n\"Main articles: &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVariously the Eight or Nine Divines throughout its history, the Cyrodiilic Pantheon is a synthesis of merish and mannish gods, with the Eight Divines created initially by &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; as a compromise between the Aldmeri-leaning slaves she had liberated, the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; who submitted to her, and her Nordic allies.\nAkatosh is the head of the pantheon. The pantheon contains several deified cultural heroes, Tiber Septim (or Talos), Reman and Morihaus. Shezarr is a less anti-mer version of Shor, designed to not alienate those who venerated the Aldmeri gods. Apart from the creation of the world, the deeds attributed to him would seem to equate him with &lt;a href=\"Pelinal\"&gt;Pelinal&lt;/a&gt;, who is not acknowledged as part of the Pantheon.\nWorship in the Cyrodilic Pantheon is considered formalized and the gods are distant. However, individual gods have their own cults, which emphasize a more charismatic style of worship.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Princes&lt;/a&gt; are not formally worshiped in the Cyrodiilic Pantheon, but they are acknowledged as the 16 Acceptable Blasphemies.\nNordic Pantheon.\nThe Nordic pantheon of Skyrim has many similar gods to that of Cyrodiil, with obvious name similarities between the two pantheons. However, the Nordic representations are almost always more warlike than their Cyrodiilic counterparts.\nUnlike most pantheons, the Nordic gods are not led by the Dragon God of Time. Instead, Alduin is seen as the \"wellspring\" of the pantheon, rather than its leader. Some consider Kyne to be the head of the pantheon, who is one of the \"hearth gods.\" This term is only seen in one in-game text, but is referenced in a design document published by Michael Kirkbride, which explains it more fully.\nShor, the Nordic equivalent to Lorkhan, is seen less as a creator god and more as a champion of men and, following his death at the hands of mer, god of the underworld. Along with Tsun, he is considered to be one of two Nordic gods that are dead.\nThe Nordic pantheon gives a totemic representation to each of its main deities, as follows:\nThe Nordic pantheon only gives particular significance to 2 of the Daedric Princes, and even then not in their entirety. The pantheon contains Orkey, a version of Malacath heavily associated with death (and, as a result, Arkay). The other is Herma-Mora, the Woodland Man, who according to Nordic myth nearly tricked the Nords into becoming &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. He is called the Demon of Knowledge, but otherwise does not bear any significant relation to Hermaeus Mora. The Nords also make reference to Maloch, whom they call \"Mountain Fart.\"\nAltmeri Pantheon.\nMerish religion is more focused towards their ancestors than other pantheons, evidenced by the use of the term &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; (\"our ancestors\") to describe them. These Aldmeri ancestor-heroes include Trinimac,\u00a0Syrabane, Phynaster\u00a0and Auri-El, the head of the pantheon. In the Altmeri tradition, Lorkhan is thought of as an evil figure who tricked the gods into creating the material world as a place of limitation and death.\nBosmeri Pantheon.\nAlthough Bosmeri religion technically revere Auri-El as the head of their pantheon, it is Y'ffre who holds the most meaning for them. In Bosmeri cosmology, Y'ffre gifted the Bosmer with a fixed form, through the institution of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, which informs much of Bosmeri culture.\nBosmer also revere Jone, Jode and Baan Dar, which are most commonly associated with the Khajiit. This may give some truth to the Khajiits' assertion that they and the Bosmer share a common lineage.\nDunmer Pantheon.\n\"Main articles: &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Dunmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;\"\nAlmost uniquely of all the cultures on Tamriel, the Dunmer have never worshipped the Aedra. Their deities have either been the Daedra, or the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec. The original Chimer, or Velothi, worshipped Boethiah, Mephala and Azura as saving them from the decadence of their life in Summerset, and traveled to Dwemereth, now Morrowind, under the guidance of the Prophet, and later Saint, &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the Tribunal replaced this faith with worship of themselves as god-kings of the Dunmer, banning the worship of the Daedra, although they were still held in reverence. The original Good Daedra became &lt;a href=\"the%20Anticipations\"&gt;the Anticipations&lt;/a&gt;, reflections of the various aspects of the Tribunal. Molag Bal, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon and Sheogorath are regarded as \"Bad Daedra,\" the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Daedra who did not accept this. These Daedra are acknowledged sent to test the faith of the Velothi.\nIn addition to these gods, the Tribunal faith had an array of saints, of which &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; was the first. Many of these saints exemplify ideal virtues for the Dunmer, and provide a model for them to live by.\nFollowing the events of \"Morrowind\", the Tribunal were either dead or reduced in power. This and the events of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; caused a crisis of faith for the Dunmer, who then returned to their original daedra worship, now styled as the Reclamations, while the Tribunal were reduced to the status of saints within the new faith.\nKhajiiti Pantheon.\nThe Khajiiti pantheon has some obvious stand-ins from other pantheons (Alkosh as Akatosh, for example). However, Khajiit still revere Jone and Jode, Aldmeri moon deities forgotten by most other cultures on Tamriel. These are considered to be Tamriel's two moons, who in Khajiit belief form part of the ja-Kha'jay, the Lunar Lattice. However, it also appears that the moons are referred to by some Khajiit as &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, their more common names.\nThe Khajiit follow the pattern of Aedra and Daedra, believing them to be distinct \"litters\" of Et'ada, birthed by Ahnurr and Fadomai. However, they also hold Nirni to be a child of these beings too, on an equal footing with the other two. Indeed, Nirni and Azurah have a rivalry. Azurah is credited with making the Khajiit as they currently are, in order that they may be \"Nirni's secret defenders,\" and stabilizing their form. Y'ffer also took some and made the Bosmer.\nTo the Khajiit, Lorkhaj is a troublesome figure, distinct from both litters of Ahnurr and Fadomai. He is associated with the Dark, which to the Khajiit is &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;, and his Heart corrupts Khajiit spirits, turning them to dro-m'Athra, a form of Khajiiti demon.\nOrcish Pantheon.\nOrcs typically worship Malacath, the changed remnant of Trinimac, and his code informs much of their law and practices. Malacath is occasionally also called &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;, in this context. In the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; the orc chief Gortwog established a separate priesthood for Trinimac directly in his Orsinium. This was viewed as heresy by most orcs outside Orsinium and a minority within it, and a bad omen for orcs as a whole.\nRedguard Pantheon (Yokudan Pantheon).\nThe Reguard pantheon is very different to most others, although again comparisons can be drawn between some gods, most notably Sep and Lorkhan. Where most cultures start with Anu and Padomay, Yokudan faith starts with one, Satakal, the World-Skin. They also believe their gods were tricked into becoming mortal, in the same way to most merish belief, and consider it their birthright to return to the &lt;a href=\"Far%20Shores\"&gt;Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;, the world beyond Mundus. Yokudan belief holds special reverence to the stars, believing them to be the way back to the Far Shores, although they do not acknowledge the Magna-Ge as distinct from the rest of their pantheon, and it is Tu'Wacca, their god of death, who helps them get there, not any kind of equivalent to Magnus.\nWhere Imperial culture has Shezarr, and the Nords have Shor, the Yokudans have the Hoon'Ding, the Make Way God, who comes at a time of crisis to make way for his people. He has historically materialized as a variety of things, such as a sword, a crown or both."}

He will open the portal when the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; is ready.\nParadise Savage Garden.\nInside Gaiar Alata, first entering the Savage Garden, the Hero will find some ancient representation of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; walking about and chasing people. Slay the Daedra, and then proceed along the path or as one enter, turn right instead of left and walk along the shoreline until reaching a large island. Use the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; ruin steps to get to the top and they'll see a &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Mud%20Crab\"&gt;Spectral Mud Crab&lt;/a&gt;, which holds a leveled Glass item and an Ayleid Reliquary.\nThe Hero cannot reach Camoran's palace, &lt;a href=\"Carac%20Agaialor\"&gt;Carac Agaialor&lt;/a&gt;, without leaving the Savage Garden. However, one cannot leave the Savage Garden without the &lt;a href=\"Bands%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Bands of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero will soon be confronted by a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kathutet%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kathutet&lt;/a&gt;. He will most likely be found at the Flooded Grotto entrance or inside beside the entrance to the Forbidden Grotto. One can either kill him (difficult depending on level), or serve him to obtain the Bands of the Chosen.\nIf one chooses to serve him, he'll ask the Hero to release the &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anaxes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anaxes&lt;/a&gt;. Anaxes is a Xivilai who had tortured the &lt;a href=\"Ascended%20Immortal\"&gt;Ascended Immortal&lt;/a&gt;s, but was trapped by the Immortals in a cave. If one releases him, they'll complete the request and receive the Bands of the Chosen. The Hero must then equip them to gain entry to the Grotto.\nFrom there, the Hero can enter the Forgotten Grotto, with a catch. They can't exit the Forgotten Grotto with the Bands of the Chosen on and cannot remove the bands from the inventory or unequip them.\nFlooded Grotto.\nOnce in the Grotto, go ahead on the path to the entrance to the Forbidden Grotto and when inside a &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Eldamil\"&gt;Eldamil&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for opening the Great Gate in &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, will confront them and inform them that he has changed his mind after seeing this \"paradise.\" If the Hero agrees to help Eldamil, he will remove the Bands of the Chosen from them.\nThis is important since one cannot leave while wearing them, and one cannot unequip them themselves. Enter the cage as Eldamil instructs and they'll be transported to the other side. Once there, slay any &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; in the way. It is important to read the map because the grotto is quite a maze. Once they get to the next door, they'll meet up with Eldamil again. He'll help to kill the Daedra along the way. Don't worry if he dies because he dies easily and doesn't contribute to the quest. If he survives, he will assist in the battle against the Camorans.\nParadise Carac Agaialor.\nHead up the path to Carac Agaialor. There they'll be confronted with Mankar's children, &lt;a href=\"Ruma%20Camoran\"&gt;Ruma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Camoran\"&gt;Raven Camoran&lt;/a&gt;. They will escort the Hero to their father, Mankar Camoran. They can be followed or slain before entering the building.\nMankar will address the Hero with a speech and will not part with the Amulet of Kings. After this he will attack along with his children if they are still alive. Kill Ruma and Raven first and loot their bodies before they respawn and then go after Mankar. He can be difficult to kill for a lower leveled but it's easier with the help of Eldamil. As soon as he is dead, loot his body for the Amulet and suddenly the whole of Paradise starts to collapse.

Despite this, the &lt;a href=\"Mage%27s%20Staff%20%28Custom%29\"&gt;Mage's Staff&lt;/a&gt; obtained from &lt;a href=\"Wellspring%20Cave\"&gt;Wellspring Cave&lt;/a&gt; during the \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Mage%27s%20Staff\"&gt;A Mage's Staff&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt; upon achieving the rank of &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk%23Magic%20Arts\"&gt;Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; can be chosen to have Paralysis as its effect. Pre-made &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;beverages&lt;/a&gt; that inflict the status ailment on foes and self exist.\nAs with other effects, Paralyze can be crafted into custom spells via an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt; once one &lt;a href=\"Join%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; from each &lt;a href=\"county\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; has been earned. Along with &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, Paralysis is one of the most expensive spells to craft and cast.\nUsefulness.\nAdvantages.\nParalyzed individuals cannot resist &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;s, making the success rate 100%. One common tactic is to craft a spell that paralyzes and inflicts element damage, so the target cannot defend themselves or inflict damage while suffering magical damage per second or additional weapon blows. This is especially useful for &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; lacking &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;endurance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;hit point&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor class&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksmen&lt;/a&gt; and other ranged combatants benefit from paralysis spells, as it provides opportunities to flee when overwhelmed by hordes or physically superior single opponents. Fleeing opens the opportunity for a ranged attacker to gain higher ground, recharge magical weapons, drink health or &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; potions to gain the upper hand.\nAs with other effects, Paralyze can be crafted into custom spells via an Altar of Spellmaking once one &lt;a href=\"Join%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; from each &lt;a href=\"county\"&gt;county&lt;/a&gt; has been earned. Master-level offensive combat skills gain a &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; that permits a small percentage of attacks to immobilize foes on strike. Blade wielders, pugilists, archers, and character playstyles of every walk can benefit.\nDisadvantages.\nAlthough entirely inert, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; cannot sate their thirst as a direct result of the paralysis charm.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, Paralysis is one of the most expensive spells to craft and cast.\nParalysis can also be caused by a Power attack from a Master of &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt;, or by a regular bow attack from a Master &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells.\nPre-made spells.\nStarting at 7:00 AM, paralysis spells can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Ita%20Rienus\"&gt;Ita Rienus&lt;/a&gt; in the basement of the &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Bravil Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Once access to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; is obtained, &lt;a href=\"Borissean\"&gt;Borissean&lt;/a&gt; sells high-level paralysis spells at the &lt;a href=\"Praxographical%20center\"&gt;Praxographical center&lt;/a&gt;.\nCustom spells.\nParalysis spells cannot be inflicted on the self through Illusion, although direct consumption of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; specimen or draught can.\nIngredients.\nUnless the &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; has one of the following paralysis-related effects as its first effect, the ingredient must be combined with related ingredients via &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; to make a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; with that effect."}

With the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stability&lt;/a&gt; perk in the alteration tree, duration increases to 15 seconds.\nAs an Enchantment.\nOn weapons, Paralyze has a chance on-hit to cause paralysis on the target. The duration of the effect is determined by the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; skill. Even a low-duration effect will force an affected enemy to fall to the ground and stand back up, providing a decent window to attack. It can be extremely useful at low levels when fighting higher-level enemies, as it prevents them from attacking briefly. However, certain enemies are immune to the effect entirely.\nWeapons with this enchantment may be randomly acquired in dungeons, or sold by blacksmiths. It can be found on the sword &lt;a href=\"Chillrend%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chillrend&lt;/a&gt;, which can be acquired during the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; questline.

The player can also receive this as an enchantment from the leveled weapon received from completing the quest \"Drowning Her Sorrows\" from &lt;a href=\"Bralsa%20Drel\"&gt;Bralsa Drel&lt;/a&gt; in Raven Rock."}

Glarthir will tell them to meet him behind the chapel at midnight.\nIf they ask someone in town about Glarthir, Captain &lt;a href=\"Dion\"&gt;Dion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20Guard\"&gt;Skingrad Guard&lt;/a&gt; will approach them and tell them that Glarthir is crazy and to report to him any strange things Glarthir may suggest.\nWalkthrough.\nWait until midnight and Glarthir will meet the Hero and discuss his paranoia in the first meeting. He tells them that he is fearful that certain people around town are following him. He asks the Hero to follow them.\nBernadette Peneles.\nThe first person he asks them to follow is &lt;a href=\"Bernadette%20Peneles\"&gt;Bernadette Peneles&lt;/a&gt;. She lives in the house directly across from Glarthir. To catch her when she leaves her house one will need to be there by 6:00 am. First thing in the morning she goes to the chapel and sits in a pew.\nAround mid-morning she leaves and heads to work at the grape fields outside the city. She eats lunch at about 12:00 pm, and then heads to the back of her house and works some more there. Eventually she will stop working and will just hang around there until 8:00 pm. Then she goes inside her house to sleep. If it is raining heavily, she will return home for the day after going to the chapel.\nOne might try talking to her as well. If they are able to raise her &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; high enough, she will tell them that she has been watching Glarthir because she thinks he is rather sweet. She says that lately though, Glarthir has been acting weird, following her and pretending he can't hear her when she talks to him.\nToutius Sextius.\nThe next person Glarthir wants them to follow is &lt;a href=\"Toutius%20Sextius\"&gt;Toutius Sextius&lt;/a&gt;. They will need to find him at his house, between the Low Gate and the East Bridge. This time Glarthir does not give them a time, but waiting until 9:00 am works. Following him, he leaves the city via the gate nearest his house. When Toutius Sextius leaves the city he goes to the castle, stays in the main hall until afternoon, then goes back to Skingrad. After that he goes to the stables, and rides his &lt;a href=\"Bay%20Horse\"&gt;Bay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; to the nearby lake. Then, close to 8:00 pm he returns to his house to sleep. Once again, if one talk to Toutius about Glarthir, they will find that Glarthir is following him as well.\nDavide Surilie.\nThe last person to follow is &lt;a href=\"Davide%20Surilie\"&gt;Davide Surilie&lt;/a&gt;, of the Surilie Brothers wine makers. He leaves his house at 8 am. (6:45 on the Game of the Year Edition for Xbox 360) Increasing Davide's disposition high enough yields that he actually likes Glarthir because he's a good neighbor. He spends his day in the wine fields outside of town. His schedule seems to be weather-dependent. He stays at home all day if it is raining heavily.\nOptions.\nThe amount of gold that Glarthir gives the Hero for telling him that a person is spying on him or not varies.\nOption one.\nIf the Hero tells Glarthir that all three people are not following him, he assumes that Hero is in on the deal and attacks.\nOption two.\nIf the Hero tells him at least one of the people is following him, he gives a list to kill that person(s). Regardless of how many are killed (whether just one or all three), Glarthir will give a reward of 1000 . He will be extremely overjoyed, and the quest is done.\nOption three.\nIf the Hero refuses to kill someone on his list, he will be disgusted and take matters into his own hand. Depending on if he has his axe with him or not, he can actually be followed, watch him walk all the way to his house, grab his axe from cupboards, then head to the house of the person reported and attack them. Usually, the guards will kill Glarthir after he has killed at least one person, or if the battle has spilled onto the streets.\nOption four.\nAlternatively, the Hero can give the &lt;a href=\"List%20of%20Death\"&gt;Death List&lt;/a&gt; to a guard and the guards will kill Glarthir. Follow them, and when Glarthir dies, the Hero may grab the key to his house and loot it. There are weapons and gold throughout.\nOption five.\nThe Hero can tell Davide or Gaston Surilie and they will take matters into their own hands and beat Glarthir to death. City guards will join in as well if they see the fight.\nOption six.\nThe Hero can kill Glarthir themselves at any point after gaining the quest. On dying, he will say, \"And here I trusted you.\" There will be no rewards other than looting his person and his house with the key obtained from his person. Done carefully at night behind the Chapel, the killing may not incur a bounty.\nThe end.\nChoose any option, kill Glarthir, report him to Dion if possible or talk to the suspects and they will end it and the quest is done."}

Once in Fulstrom territory, the Vestige is considered &lt;a href=\"Trespassing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trespassing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige can utilize Hiding Spots to evade guards or citizens who attack for engaging in criminal activity and can be utilized even when under attack. When crouched, Hiding spots have a yellow glow around them.\nSome guards in this area have lanterns. Lanterns prevent the Vestige from crouching and reveal even the invisible. Their area of effect can be seen as a blue glowing circle when the Vestige is crouched outside of the affected area or inside of a hiding spot.\nAs with the area before it, Fulstrom Manor is under heavy guard. The Vestige must inspect the suspicious bookshelf. Doing so will cause the bookshelf to slide over and reveal three dials. Atop the bookshelf is a horn, a candle, and a skull, and the dials should be set to those items in that order accordingly. This will unlock the secret room. The Vestige steals the skull.\nFollow Quen's Lead.\n&lt;a href=\"Chief%20Inspector%20Rhanbiq\"&gt;Chief Inspector Rhanbiq&lt;/a&gt; and his guards, referred to as his &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, demand the return the Giovessen Skull and suggest Quen might also be behind the theft of &lt;a href=\"Magnifica%20Falorah\"&gt;Magnifica Falorah&lt;/a&gt;'s dowry. Quen claims to have no idea what Rhanbiq is talking about. The Vestige must return the skull or fight three guards of the Iron Wheel. After they have been defeated the Vestige must speak to Quen in the Cellar.\n\"Who was that? What was all that about, with the dowries and iron wheels?\"\nEnter the Catacombs.\n&lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt;, an Argonian who implies he is from Abah's Landing Thieves Guild, appears to help Quen escape. He provides her with a Windhelm Guard uniform and states that the manor guards will not detain a Windhelm guard. He has only brought one uniform. Quen reluctantly agrees to meet back up with the Vestige and Walks-Softly at the exit of the Catacombs. Walks-Softly tells the Vestige they will have to take the dangerous way around.\nIf the Vestige speaks to Walks-Softly, the following conversation insures.\n\"Didn't realize there were two of you. Next time the Iron Wheel springs a trap, I'll bring another uniform.\"\nThe catacombs contain various &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;, and one giant unique spider, the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Dweller%20Drusilla\"&gt;Crypt Dweller Drusilla&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping the homestead, the Vestige must speak with Walks-Softly.\n\"Could've lived my entire life without running through a spider pit. But we made it through. You'll make a real impression in Abah's Landing.\"\nTalk to the Guildmaster in the Thieves Den.\nAbah's Landing is a city on the coast of the peninsula region of &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige must speak with Walks-Softly.\n\"Always a pleasant journey to Abah's Landing. Head to our Thieves Den - the guildmaster awaits.

Speak with him, and he will ask for your help in finding an ancient sword. This sword used to belong to a legendary &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singer%20Navid\"&gt;Sword-Singer Navid&lt;/a&gt;, and Herminius thinks it belongs in an Imperial museum. This sword is unique because unlike most &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singers\"&gt;Sword-Singer&lt;/a&gt; blades, it stayed in this world after Navid used it to slay his comrade &lt;a href=\"Ihlqub\"&gt;Ihlqub&lt;/a&gt; and then himself. He will direct you to speak with his assistant &lt;a href=\"Azei%20at-Owynok\"&gt;Azei at-Owynok&lt;/a&gt; about where to find the sword. Talk to Azei and he will tell you that you will probably have the most luck searching along the coast. \nHead west, to &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Na-Totambu's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, past the ruined gate, you will find a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Redguards%2C%20History%20and%20Heroes%2C%20V.%201\"&gt;Redguards, History and Heroes, V. 1&lt;/a&gt;\" guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lamias&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to pick that up. Just past where you find the book, you will run into the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singer%20Navid\"&gt;Sword-Singer Navid&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to the ghost and he will warn you that the blade you seek is cursed. If you pick it up, you will be attacked by the spirits of those who tried to pick it up before. These spirits cannot be killed permanently, only temporarily defeated, and they will continue to hunt whoever owns the blade. \nContinue down the path and you will find the sword; once you pick it up, you will indeed be attacked by several waves of hostile spirits, culminating in a battle with the spirit of Ihlqub. Once you have defeated them all, head back east and you will run into Azei. Speak with him and he will tell you that he is not as ignorant of Hammerfell's history as he let on; he is mainly trying to prevent Herminius from plundering all of Hammerfell's treasures. He knows of the blade's curse, but will also tell you that only &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;someone without a soul&lt;/a&gt; can lift it. He will ask you to return the sword to Sword-Singer Navid so that no one else will have to deal with its curse again. \nAt this point, you can choose whether to give the sword to Herminius or to return it to Navid. If you choose to give Herminius the sword, . If you wish to return the sword to Navid, you will find his spirit near a tombstone to the northeast.

In this patch, we've added &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Ambrosia\"&gt;Psijic Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 a craftable &lt;a href=\"Experience\"&gt;Experience&lt;/a&gt; Point booster \u2013 and limited scaling and battle leveling consumables. You can read more about these additions below. We've also implemented a new, easier way to add friends and invite other player characters to your &lt;a href=\"Guilds%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, we've fixed a number of issues involving gameplay, crafting, UI, and quests, including the quest Prisoner of Jathsogur in Malabal Tor. The size of this patch is approximately 1.6 GB.\nNEW FEATURES / UPDATES / BIG CHANGES\nScaled Consumables\nIn this patch, we've implemented limited scaling on all consumables that affect your Health, Magicka, or Stamina.\nScaling will occur across level ranges, and is determined by the base level of the item up to the next viable level of a crafted item.\nFor example, crafted potions are made at levels ending in 0 starting at level 10 (until you reach &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Ranks\"&gt;Veteran Ranks&lt;/a&gt;). If you create a level 10 potion, it will scale with you as you level, until level 19. At level 19, it will \"lock\" at that strength and never get any better. It will still be good at level 20, but not the best thing for you at your level. This behavior applies to foods and drinks as well.\nNote that Crown Store potions and foods have always scaled with your level. With this new system, crafted and dropped consumable items do too, and so at no point will there be a moment in which a Crown Store potion is ever directly stronger than one that is crafted.\nBattle Leveled Consumables\nIn order for lower-level player characters to have a better chance of survival in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, we're introducing a way for items to scale their health or buff based on whether or not you are battle leveled. Battle leveling is a system that applies when you enter Cyrodiil. When you enter a campaign in Cyrodiil, regardless of whether that campaign is Veteran or non-Veteran, you are always treated as level 50 at a minimum.\nIf you go to Cyrodiil at level 10, for example, you will be battle leveled to 50; your potions will be battle leveled too, and heal as though they were level 50 potions. If you level up while in Cyrodill, you would technically be level 11, but still effectively level 50 through battle leveling. Your potions would still heal as though they were level 50 potions.\nIf you gain enough experience to make it to level 20 (hitting the next level bracket), you would still be battle leveled to 50. However, your potions would then be ten levels out of date and become slightly less effective as you move into the next level bracket. Rather than healing you as though they were level 50 potions, they would heal you at a reduced rate \u2013 still decent, but not as good as a level 20 potion.\nPsijic Ambrosia\nWhen can you use these?\nPsijic Ambrosia can be used at any level or Veteran Rank. The boost applies towards advancing your level, advancing your Veteran Rank, and for advancing your &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Points\"&gt;Champion Points&lt;/a&gt;. It does not apply towards things that don't work off of Experience Points, like the Mages Guild and crafting skill lines.\nWhat stacks with what?\nPsijic Ambrosia does not stack with itself. If you attempt to use one right after the other, you'll fail to use the second item (but will still exist in your inventory). You can only have one consumable Experience Point Booster active at a time \u2013 if you've just consumed a Psijic Ambrosia, you cannot consume another Psijic Ambrosia until the first Psijic Ambrosia's duration runs out.\nPsijic Ambrosia WILL stack with all other sources of Experience Point boosting such as the Rings of Mara, ESO Plus, your Alliance owning enemy keeps, or being in a group.\nNote that although Psijic Ambrosia is considered a drink for the purposes of &lt;a href=\"Provisioning\"&gt;Provisioning&lt;/a&gt;, it does NOT prevent you from also having a food or drink buff active. This means you can drink a Psijic Ambrosia, and immediately drink some Red Rye Beer, and you will have both effects active on you.\nIf you have the &lt;a href=\"Brewer%20%28Skill%29\"&gt;Brewer&lt;/a&gt; passive, you'll make more units of Psijic Ambrosia per crafting attempt. This means that, at maximum Brewer rank, you'll make four units of Psijic Ambrosia every time you craft that &lt;a href=\"Recipes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you have the &lt;a href=\"Connoisseur\"&gt;Connoisseur&lt;/a&gt; passive, the duration of any Psijic Ambrosia you drink will be increased. This means that, at maximum Connoisseur rank, each unit of Psijic Ambrosia you drink will last 50 minutes, rather than the listed 30 minutes.\nTaken together, someone who is both a fully-ranked Brewer and Connoisseur creating Psijic Ambrosia for their own use will get a total of three hours and twenty minutes of Experience boost from a single crafting of the recipe.\nHow do you make Psijic Ambrosia?\nThe recipe for Psijic Ambrosia cannot be found whole. Rather, it comes in seven parts, each distinct from the other. These recipe fragments can be found by completing &lt;a href=\"Provisioner%20Writs\"&gt;Provisioner Writs&lt;/a&gt;; the higher ranked Writ you complete, the more likely you are to find a fragment of the recipe. Recipe fragments can be traded or sold to other players, however, so an industrious Provisioner who has two fragments could trade or sell one of them to get a fragment they do not have.\nOnce you have all seven fragments, simply use any single fragment from either your inventory or the quickslot. This will consume all seven fragments, and will produce one complete and usable Psijic Ambrosia Recipe. This, too, can be sold or traded to other players. Consuming the recipe itself will finally endow you with the knowledge to craft Psijic Ambrosia!\nPsijic Ambrosia has three ingredients required to make it: &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Mirriam\"&gt;Frost Mirriam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bervez%20Juice\"&gt;Bervez Juice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20Roe\"&gt;Perfect Roe&lt;/a&gt;. Frost Mirriam and Bervez Juice are both existing ingredients used in a variety of high-end purple foods and drinks; they can only be found by completing Provisioner Writs or by receiving them from your Hireling. Perfect Roe is brand-new, however, and (at least for the moment) used only in the crafting of Psijic Ambrosia.\nPerfect Roe can be found by &lt;a href=\"Fishing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;. Every time you skin a non-trophy &lt;a href=\"Fish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, you obtain fish meat. However, you will now also have a small chance to obtain Perfect Roe.\nNote that this chance is not affected by any passives, Champion abilities, or anything else.\nFinally, to craft Psijic Ambrosia, you must have your Recipe Quality passive at Rank 4 (which is a new Rank for this patch) and your Recipe Improvement passive at Rank 6; that is, both must be maxed out. With Perfect Roe, Bervez Juice, and Frost Mirriam in-hand, you can go to any cooking fire and craft Psijic Ambrosia!\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS\nArt &amp; Animation\nAudio\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nJustice System\nMiscellaneous\nQuests &amp; Zones\nUI\nArt &amp; Animation\nGeneral\nAudio\nGeneral\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Nightblade%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Assassination\"&gt;Assassination&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Assault\"&gt;Assault&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mounts&lt;/a&gt;\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nGeneral\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nVeteran Dungeons\n&lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts%20II%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Veteran Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Spindleclutch%20II\"&gt;Veteran Spindleclutch&lt;/a&gt;\nExploration &amp; Itemization\n&lt;a href=\"Achievements%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Achievements&lt;/a&gt;\nJustice System\nGeneral\nMiscellaneous\nGeneral\nQuests &amp; Zones\n&lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;\nUI\nGeneral\nAchievements\nCharacter Creation &amp; Select\nLeaderboards\nMail\nMenus &amp; Icons\nVOIP"}

You can also gather a group and try to conquer the White-Gold Tower and Imperial City Prison; both are 4-player instanced dungeons. We've also added almost two dozen new item sets, a number of fun, new collectibles, and have introduced two new motifs: Xivkyn and Glass!\nIn addition to Imperial City, we have made many improvements to Cyrodiil, its campaigns, and rewards which you can read more about below.\nDue to the Veteran Rank increase with this update, every dungeon will now scale to the maximum Veteran Rank - VR16 - and we have also added three new Undaunted Pledges for you to complete.\nAlong with all the new content and systems, we have made many improvements and fixes to existing content including combat, gameplay, crafting, dungeons, quests, game performance, and more.

You will need to be at least level 10 in order to enter the Imperial City, but you will be battle leveled according to the rules of your particular campaign. This new PvP space includes the Imperial City Districts and the extensive Imperial Sewers network. Fight the elite Xivkyn forces of Molag Bal, and increase your might by spending new Tel Var Stones on items more powerful than anywhere in Tamriel! Be on your guard as enemy alliance members lurk around every corner throughout the Imperial City Districts and Imperial Sewers to take those very stones from you in their own quest for glory! The Imperial City and the Imperial Sewers are aimed at small groups, but if you're highly skilled, you can try going through alone.\nOpen the Player Menu and navigate to the Social Menu, then Group Menu to access the Alliance War menu. Next, travel to your home campaign, or guest in a campaign of your choosing.\nIn Cyrodiil, travel to one of your alliance's two home gates and talk to one of your alliance's Imperial City captains to obtain the quest to go to the Imperial City. You can also obtain the quest from one of your alliance's generals in the Imperial Sewers.\nThere are three dragon icons on your map around Lake Rumare. These icons correspond with gates that lead to the Imperial Sewers. Use your keep transport network to travel as close to Lake Rumare as you're able, then ride to the door and enter the Sewers via one of the gates.\nWhen you enter the Imperial City, you'll arrive in your alliance's home base location\u2014a safe area within the Imperial Sewers. If you've taken the quest from one of your alliance captains in Cyrodiil, you can advance the story by speaking to the general in this area. If you haven't taken the quest, the general will also offer you the questline.\nTalk to the Drake of Blades in your alliance's home base to complete the quest, and begin your Imperial City adventure!\nImperial Sewers\nThe Imperial Sewers are a large PvP public dungeon that also contains the home base \u2013 a safe area \u2013 for each alliance.\nMerchants and crafting stations are housed in each alliance home base.\nEach alliance home base also includes the transit hub, a collection of ladders that each lead to one of the Imperial Districts above ground.\nThe Imperial Sewer network contains many perils including new Xivkyn Elite Guard, bosses, Trove and Cunning Scamps, trapped chests and Coldharbour portals.\nWithin the Imperial Sewers, there are six ladders that also lead to the districts. These are not as safe as the ladders accessible from your alliance's home base.\nResurrecting within the Imperial Sewers will take you back to your alliance's Imperial City home base.\nThere are two ways you can leave the Imperial City: by way of the Imperial City Prison or White-Gold Tower, and through your alliance's home base in the Imperial Sewers.\nIf you leave the Imperial City by way of exiting the Imperial City Prison or White-Gold Tower dungeons, you will return to your alliance's capital city.\nTo leave the Imperial City, you go through your alliance's home base in the Imperial Sewers, the same way you came in. This will return you to your home base in Cyrodiil (the same campaign you entered through.)\nImperial City Districts\nThe Imperial City Districts are an open PvP area that contains the entrenched forces of Molag Bal, his elite Xivkyn army, and the corrupted Imperial Legion, \u201cLegion Zero.\"\nEach Imperial District has a unique story which, once completed, unlocks repeatable daily quests.\nEach of the six Imperial Districts features a Trophy Vault. The doors to these vaults are magically sealed by forces unknown, and you must collect 60 trophy items by killing monsters in the Imperial City in order to enter the vault. Inside, you'll find a chest full of valuable items.\nBe on your guard for large roaming bosses that patrol the streets!\nResurrecting within the Imperial Districts will take you to an elevated platform within the District for your alliance.\nYou can find unique crafting stations safely nestled within the Imperial Districts as well.\nTel Var Stones\nEvery monster has a chance to drop a new currency called Tel Var Stones.\nThis currency can be spent on new armor, lock boxes, and general equipment in your alliance home base in the Imperial Sewers, as well as deposited in your bank.\nBosses and more challenging monsters will drop a greater number of Tel Var Stones than regular monsters.\nAs you pass certain thresholds of Tel Var Stones that you are carrying, you'll gain a multiplier to all future Tel Var Stones you collect from monster kills.\nIf you die to another player character, they will get 80% of the Tel Var Stones you currently have on your character.\nThe amount of Tel Var Stones will be split amongst all player characters that contributed to your demise.\nWhite-Gold Tower\nRace to the top of the White-Gold Tower in pursuit of a stolen Elder Scroll\u2014but is the top of the tower even in Tamriel anymore? What secrets does Regent Clivia Tharn have up her Imperial sleeves?\nThe White-Gold Tower is a standard 4-player PvE dungeon.\nThe minimum level requirement for White-Gold Tower is level 10, but the recommended level is 25.\nTo enter the White-Gold Tower:\nYou can queue for this dungeon outside of the Imperial City, but you must have the DLC game pack.\nYou can teleport directly to the dungeons via your Point of Interest map icons for the dungeons, as long as you are not in Cyrodiil or the Imperial City.\nYou can also use each dungeon's front door from within the Imperial City.\nThere is one Trophy Vault located in the White-Gold Tower that requires 150 trophy items only found off Veteran bosses in the White-Gold Tower, in order to open it.\nImperial City Prison\nEven before the Planemeld, this grim complex just outside the walls of the Imperial City was never the happiest site in Cyrodiil. Since Molag Bal ceded it to the worst of his Daedra, it's become a place out of a horrific nightmare.\nThe Imperial City Prison is a standard 4-player PvE dungeon.\nThe minimum level requirement for the Imperial City Prison is level 10, but the recommended level is 35.\nTo enter the Imperial City Prison:\nYou can queue for this dungeon outside of the Imperial City, but you must have the DLC game pack.\nYou can teleport directly to the dungeons via your Point of Interest map icons for the dungeons, as long as you are not in Cyrodiil or the Imperial City.\nYou can also use each dungeon's front door from within the Imperial City.\nThere is one Trophy Vault located in the Imperial City Prison that requires 150 trophy items only found off Veteran bosses in the Imperial City Prison, in order to open it.\nFishing in Imperial City\nAdventurers will find the moats of Imperial City particularly rife with fish, more so than elsewhere in Tamriel. However, the groundskeepers normally responsible for tending to these piscine communities are, unfortunately, dead and/or Daedra. Be warned!\nNew Item Sets\nThis update includes approximately two dozen new item sets to seek out and acquire! These can be crafted at special locations within the Imperial City, purchased from Tel Var Armorer and Tel Var Greater Armorer merchants, or obtained from the White-Gold Tower and Imperial City Prison dungeons.\nXivkyn Style Motif\nMolag Bal's personal guard, the Xivkyn, have brought their intimidating Daedric style from Coldharbour to the Imperial City.You can learn to craft in the Xivkyn style by finding the Chapters for it, which are sometimes kept in certain well-warded chests in Imperial City.\nThese chests require items that drop from many Daedra and their servants to open.\nOnce you've found a Chapter, you must be at least Rank 9 in the Metalworking, Tailoring, or Woodworking passives to permanently learn the style.\nTo actually craft Xivkyn-styled gear, you'll also need some Charcoal of Remorse, which can be purchased at Tel Var General merchants in your alliance's base in the Imperial Sewers.\nOnce you know the style and have the materials, you can craft the Xivkyn style at any equipment crafting bench, both in and out of the Imperial City.\nNew Achievements\nWe have added a number of new achievements to the game, all tied to the Imperial City. These can be found under the Alliance War or Dungeon and Group Dungeon achievement categories.\nNew Collectibles\nWe have added new Collectibles that you can permanently add to your collection:\nThe Necrotic Hoarvor Pet can be acquired by completing the achievement \u201cImperial City Challenger.\" This achievement is the ultimate test of your skills in the new Veteran Dungeons found in the Imperial City.\nThe Soul Shriven skin and the Stonefire Scamp Pet can rarely be obtained by defeating the elite Daedric forces and their master in the darkest depths of the Imperial Sewers.\nThe Xivkyn Dreadguard, Xivkyn Tormentor, and Xivkyn Augur Polymorphs can very rarely be found in Imperial Reward containers, purchasable from Tel Var Lockbox merchants and Tel Var Greater Lockbox merchants who are found in your alliance's base in the Imperial City Sewers.\nBASE-GAME PATCH\nCyrodiil Updates\nSeveral major updates are going into Cyrodiil this patch which will include reinforcement to Scroll Temples, Campaign changes, and quality of life adjustments.\nThe Former Emperor buffs are being removed from the game.\nYou will only get Emperor buffs while you are actively Emperor.\nYou will be granted the Emperor skill line and abilities upon earning Emperorship, without the need to spend skill points.\nAnyone that has spent points in the Emperor skill line will be refunded those skill points.\nElder Scroll Temples now have a barrier around Scrolls which are up when their corresponding gates are closed. This barrier will drop only when the gates are open.\nThe Battle Spirit buff has been adjusted and now has 50% more damage reduction, 50% less healing received, and 50% less damage shield strength.\nIncreased the under population Alliance Point bonus that alliances receive to 20% from 10%.\nUnder population scoring bonuses will now apply quadruple the scoring points earned.\nReduced the minimum amount of player characters needed to qualify for the under population bonus to 20 player characters per evaluation interval, which is 30 minutes.\nIncreased the underdog scoring Alliance Point bonuses that alliances receive to 20% from 10%.\nReduced the underdog scoring evaluation and application periods to 30 minutes.\nUnderdog scoring bonuses will now apply triple the scoring points earned.\nReduced the cost of Full Grand Soul gems sold by vendors to 750 AP from 3600 AP.\nIncreased the Alliance Points received when resurrecting other player characters to 50 AP from 20 AP.\nAdjusted the Line of Sight checks on ranged guards to aid in \u201cstuck in combat\" issues.\nThe Keep Wall upgrade now gives 25% more hit points to walls and towers per upgrade level.\nIncreased the amount of stone, food, and ore gathered at resources based on the \u201cGathered Amount\" upgrade by 25%.\nIncreased the amount of stone, food, and ore generated at resources based on the \u201cBase Resources Increased\" upgrade by 40%.\nYou can no longer travel to another player character that's in a PvP zone.\nCampaign buffs will now be applied only in PvP zones.\nCyrodiil Campaign Changes\nCampaigns are undergoing rule changes for encouraging different styles of gameplay within the campaigns, including non-veteran campaigns now lasting 7 days instead of 5 days. In addition, all campaigns will be reset, and you will get a free home campaign reassignment.\nNorth American megaserver\nAzura: Ownership of keeps, resources, Elder Scrolls, and outposts will generate one point each per scoring cycle, and lasts 30 days.\nScourge: Ownership of keeps, resources, Elder Scrolls, and outposts will generate one point each per scoring cycle, and lasts 30 days.\nBlackwater Blade (non-Veteran only): Ownership of keeps, resources, Elder Scrolls, and outposts will generate one point each per scoring cycle, and lasts 7 days.\nChillrend: Keeps, outposts, and resources will generate zero points.

In addition, we've made some adjustments so you can progress through Veteran Ranks more rapidly:\n15% decrease in the amount of XP it takes to gain a Veteran Rank\n100% more XP for all public dungeons\n50% more XP for all Veteran Rank quests\n20% more XP in Craglorn\nDungeon Scaling\nEvery Dungeon now scales up to Veteran Rank 16 which will allow items, such as Monster Masks, to drop at the highest achievable level.\nUndaunted Pledges\nThree new Undaunted Pledges have been added for Veteran Ranked player characters:\nVeteran City of Ash Pledge\nWhite-Gold Tower Pledge\nImperial City Prison Pledge\nThe main objectives for each pledge in the White-Gold Tower and Imperial City Prison can be completed in either Normal or Veteran Mode. However, the optional Gold Key Challenge can only be completed in Veteran Mode.\nGlass Style Motif\nThe secrets to crafting Glass arms and armor have begun to be revealed!\nYou can learn to craft in the Glass style by finding the Chapters or the Book for it. These Chapters have been torn into unreadable Fragments by the ravages of time and travel, but can occasionally be found slipped into the Writ rewards for Blacksmiths, Clothiers, and Woodworkers.\nOnce you've gathered ten Fragments, you can reconstitute them into a readable Chapter (or, if you're exceptionally lucky, the whole Book) with some Merethic Restorative Resin.\nThis Resin is sold by Mystics around the world for a hefty price.\nYou must be Rank 10 in the Metalworking, Tailoring, or Woodworking passives to understand the style's intricacies and learn it permanently.\nYou'll also need some Malachite to actually craft an item in the Glass style.\nMalachite Shards can be found in Treasure Chests around the world. Chests with more durable and difficult locks are more likely to contain them, but the chests that require a Treasure Map to find have the best chance by a wide margin.\nOnce you've collected ten Malachite Shards, you can refine them into a single chunk of Malachite at any equipment crafting bench, but know that this will bind the Malachite to your account, making it untradeable.\nOnce you know the style and have the materials, you can craft Glass gear at any equipment crafting bench.\nNew Crafting Tiers, Materials, and Recipes\nAdded new solvents for Alchemy.\nVeteran Rank 10 waters can be found in Craglorn.\nVeteran Rank 15 waters can be found within the Imperial City.\nAdded new base crafting materials for Blacksmithing, Woodworking, and Clothier.\nThese can be found by deconstructing the equipment items found in the Imperial City, or from Tel Var vendors.\nAdded new Potency runes for Veteran Ranks 15 and 16.\nThese can only be found within the Imperial City.\nAdded a new Essence rune, and its associated new enchantments.\nThis Essence rune can be acquired by completing particularly dangerous content within the Imperial City.\nAdded new recipes for Provisioning.\nThese will produce Veteran Rank 15 foods and drinks, and can be found anywhere recipes would normally be found, including the Imperial City.\nAdded new ranks to the Metalworking, Solvent Proficiency, Tailoring, Potency Improvement, and Woodworking passives, reflecting the higher-level objects created.\nThese ranks require their respective trade skills to be at Level 50.\nInventory Upgrades\nWe've added three ranks of bag upgrades, bringing the maximum possible inventory size up to 200 (this includes your Riding Capacity skill). These new bag upgrades can be purchased at any bag vendor with a gold cost that follows the existing pattern for bag upgrades.\nBattle-leveling for Veteran Ranks\nPlayer characters of Veteran Rank 1-13 will now be battle-leveled to VR14 in Cyrodiil if you have the battle leveling option toggled on in the Options menu. Previously, battle-leveling only applied up to level 50.\nHome Campaign Reassignment Updates\nReduced the cooldown on home campaign reassignments to 12 hours from 3 days.\nIncreased the cost to switch campaigns to 150,000 AP from 15,000 AP.\nReduced the cost to switch home campaigns at the end of a campaign period to 50 AP from 5,000 AP.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS\nAlliance War\nGeneral\nYou will now receive a 5-star symbol when earning Rank 49 or Rank 50.\nAmended the Milegates at Fort Ash and Chalman Keep to allow you to venture onto the third level via scaffolding and other makeshift stairs.\nFixed an issue where the Campaign Reward Tier bar would briefly appear full when first viewing the Alliance War Scoring.\nFixed an issue where all Elder Scroll and Emperorship bonus tooltips displayed the incorrect bonus text.\nYou will no longer become stuck in a falling animation when moving into the corners of certain keep towers.\nAdjusted the note next to Aldmeri bounty boards to allow easier interaction with the bounty board.\nAdjusted various tradeskill nodes, books and gatherable objects to be interactable once again.\nMelee guards will no longer stun themselves when bashing with their shields.\nArcher guards will no longer stun themselves when performing power shots.\nThe Release Ownership text will now correctly display Keep names.\nYou can no longer get to an Elder Scroll unless you've broken through the Scroll Keep Gate.\nThoron's Orders have again been moved further away from the bounty board.\nYou can now wear the Emperor's Regalia at any time after receiving it.\nFixed an issue where you could no longer control a siege weapon if it was initially placed on top of fire.\nFixed an issue where the bosses in Cyrodiil's many caves were dropping level 50 gear, even when you were Veteran Ranked. They will now drop gear up to VR14.\nRemoved the counter for Siege NPCs on the Cyrodiil map as Mercenaries are no longer used.\nFixed an issue where Coldharbour siege weaponry would not consistently display their effects, animations, or landing indicator.\nItemization\nAdded a selection of useful potions, food, and drink to the Siege vendors in Cyrodiil.\nThese items can only be purchased with Alliance Points.\nThough better than the consumables found from monsters, vendors, and treasure chests elsewhere in the game, they are still inferior to consumables crafted by other player characters.\nUpdated the Rewards for the Worthy so the set items in those mails will now only come in blue or purple qualities.\nNote: The overall chance to get a set item has not changed, but the chance to get a blue or a purple has each increased.\nThe Rewards for the Worthy set items are now all Bind on Equip.\nSiege Repair Kits can now be purchased with gold from Daggerfall and Ebonheart merchants in Cyrodiil, matching their Aldmeri counterparts.\nFixed an issue where Scattershot Catapults were more expensive from Aldmeri vendors than from Daggerfall or Ebonheart vendors.

We think you'll really enjoy the contents of this latest update.\nOrsinium, similar to our previous update, comes in two parts\u2014the DLC game pack, and the base-game patch. The base-game patch will be available to everyone who owns The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, and the DLC game pack will automatically download with it, allowing you instant access to the new content when you purchase it, or activate an ESO Plus\u2122 membership.\nAnyone who owns ESO and has an active ESO Plus\u2122 membership will also automatically have access to the Orsinium DLC game pack. If your ESO Plus\u2122 membership ends or lapses, you will no longer have access to the Orsinium DLC game pack content and areas, but you will still have any items you earned while you had access. If you do not have an active ESO Plus\u2122 membership you can purchase the DLC game pack for 3,000 crowns via the in-game Crown Store.\nFor the first time in The Elder Scrolls series since Daggerfall, you can visit the majestic ancestral home of the Orcs located deep within the mountains of Wrothgar. There, you can find over 20 hours of story content and quests available to you at any level, plus two new public dungeons. You can also choose to tackle our new single-player progressive challenge, the Maelstrom Arena, where you can receive special rewards and see where you stack on the new class-specific leaderboards.\nWe also have some exciting things available in our base-game patch including updates to the Champion and battle leveling systems, improvements to our grouping tool, controller support for PC, subtitles, shield dyeing, and new crafting motifs.\nIn addition to all the new features and major updates, we have made many improvements to the Imperial City and its dungeons, overall combat and gameplay, itemization, UI, and more. Due to many of the changes and new features, we will be resetting all leaderboards with this update.\nWe hope you enjoy our latest update, which will be approximately 9GB in size, and look forward to seeing you in Orsinium!\nNew Features / Updates / Big Changes\nDLC Game Pack\nBase-Game Patch\nFixes &amp; Improvements, DLC Game Packs\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nImperial City\nFixes &amp; Improvements, Base-Game Patch\nAlliance War\nArt &amp; Animation\nAudio\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nCrown Store\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nJustice System\nMiscellaneous\nQuests &amp; Zones\nUI\nNEW FEATURES / UPDATES / BIG CHANGES\nDLC Game Pack\nOrsinium\nAnswer King Kurog's call and help rebuild the city of Orsinium! In Wrothgar - the mountainous, ancestral home of the Orcs - you'll find a nation divided as clan chiefs, Reach marauders, and religious cults all conspire to destroy Kurog's dream of a united Orc kingdom before it can be fully realized.\nTo start your adventures in Wrothgar, go to the starting city of your alliance \u2013 Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, or Vulkhel Guard. In the city, you will be approached by an Orc messenger who will deliver a letter from Forge-Mother Alga. Finish speaking to the Orc messenger to begin the \"Invitation to Wrothgar\" quest.\nSeek out Ambassador Lazgara in Daggerfall, Davon's Watch, or Vulkhel Guard. Talk to her to progress the Wrothgar questline and travel to the Merchant's Gate in Wrothgar.\nYou can also enter Wrothgar through the gates in the neighboring territories of Stormhaven and Bangkorai, or using the Wayshrine network to fast travel to Orsinium.\nMaelstrom Arena\nJourney into the churning void of Oblivion to do battle in the legendary Maelstrom Arena! Designed by the eccentric Demiprince Fa-Nuit-Hen, this bizarre Daedric crucible will push even the most powerful adventurers to their limits. It is a contest without allies and without mercy. In the Maelstrom, only the strong survive.\nMaelstrom Arena is a single-player progressive challenge located in the northeastern mountains of Wrothgar.\nThere are new item sets available specifically to Maelstrom Arena that you can receive in both the normal and Veteran versions.\nWe also offer unique weapon and jewelry sets in Veteran Maelstrom Arena, similar to Dragonstar Arena.\nThere are four Sigils that will aid you with your battles in the arena. To use a Sigil, simply walk near it and the Synergy prompt will appear. Press your Synergy key, and the Sigil will be activated. Sigils will re-spawn between each round within an arena, so liberal use is encouraged. These Sigils include:\nWhen you reach Veteran Rank 16, you will qualify for the Veteran Maelstrom Arena leaderboards. There are leaderboards for every class, and at the end of each week the top 100 players of each class will be granted special rewards via in-game mail.\nPoints for the Maelstrom Arena leaderboards are earned in multiple ways.\nNew Item Sets\nThere are new item sets available from a variety of sources\nNew Public Dungeons\nWe're introducing two new public dungeons in the zone of Wrothgar.\nCrafting Node Scaling\nAncient Orc Crafting Motif\nThe pages of the Ancient Orc Crafting Motif are split between the enemies in Old Orsinium and Rkindaleft, with each Public Dungeon having the chapters that the other does not. Defeating these foes will rarely grant a chapter of the Motif \u2013 or, if one proves exceptionally lucky, the entire Motif book.\nCassiterite Sand, the Raw Style Item needed to craft in the Ancient Orc Style, can be found in resource nodes all throughout Orsinium. The greater your knowledge of the Ancient Orc Style, the more likely you are to find Cassiterite Sand.\nYour knowledge of Metalworking, Tailoring, and Woodworking do not alter your chances.\nOnce you have ten units of Cassiterite Sand, you can refine them at any equipment-crafting bench into Cassiterite, used to make Ancient Orc items. This refining process does not bind the Cassiterite to your account.\nNew Collectibles\nWe have added new collectibles that you can permanently add to your collection:\nRegalia of the Orsimer King: Acquired by completing the main quest line in Wrothgar.\nMaelstrom Baron Polymorph: Acquired by completing Maelstrom Arena on Veteran Mode.\nVosh Rakh Ceremonial Mask: Acquired by successfully uncovering the Vosh Rakh plot.\nCavalier of the Sworn Oath, Trinimac's Penitent Knight, and Old Orsinium Sentry: Acquired by filling the House of Orsimer Glories with historic relics.\nNew Provisioner Recipes\nDine in style with many new Provisioner recipes, four of which revive the true spirit of Orcish cooking as revealed through a series of quests.\nNew Achievements\nWe have added a number of new achievements to the game, all tied to Wrothgar. These can be found under the new Orsinium subcategory within the DLC category.\nBase-Game Patch\nChampion System Updates\nWe have reduced the XP required to earn Champion Points for those with smaller amounts in order to create a fairer gameplay experience. We are also capping the total number of Champion Points that can be spent.\nAt this time, you will not be able to allocate more than 501 Champion Points.\nAnyone that has over 501 Champion Points when the Orsinium DLC game pack is published will have all their Champion Points reset, and will only be able to allocate 501 Champion Points.\nYou will not lose any points over 501, you just won't be able to spend them.\nYou can continue to earn Champion Points over the cap, but won't be able to spend them until the next time the cap is raised.\nThe amount of XP required to gain a Champion Point now scales with the number of total Champion Points you have.\nIf you don't have any Champion Points, you will earn them very quickly.\nIf you have a lot of Champion Points, you will earn them slower.\nGrouping Tool Improvements\nWe have performed a significant mechanical overhaul of the Grouping Tool. It will now find groups more rapidly and reliably when looking for any available group. Below are the first steps on the road to making the Grouping Tool an adventurer's best friend \u2013 look for additional improvements in a future update.\nGroups formed for dungeons will always be teleported directly to the dungeon once formed, and will always be scaled to a level ceiling.\nAfter a group is formed, you can either teleport immediately, or wait up to 30 seconds before you are sent to the dungeon so you can complete your current activity.\nDungeon groups formed through the Grouping Tool will receive a moderate buff to their stats while inside that dungeon.\nLoot will be contextualized to your level.\nWhile everyone will be scaled up to VR15, you will always get loot drops appropriate for your level. For example, if you are VR2, you will still get VR2 loot drops.\nGroups can now be formed across all three alliances. It is entirely possible for two Aldmeri characters to team up with an Ebonheart and Daggerfall duo through the Grouping Tool to complete a dungeon.\nIn order to form a group for Cyrodiil or the Imperial City, you must queue from within that location.\nTo help consolidate the tool, we've removed the ability to queue for individual quests. That said, we do still want to encourage you to work together to defeat difficult world bosses and quests!\nGroups may still be formed as normal. If any group formed normally within the game world enters a dungeon, it will follow normal dungeon rules. Groups formed via the Grouping Tool operate differently to ensure a rapid cadence of group formation.\nFor example, if you walk into a dungeon with three VR16 player characters and the group leader is VR2, all monsters will be VR2.\nBattle Leveling Updates\nInstead of every battle leveled character having the exact same stats, you will now be able to mold a battle leveled character however you choose.\nBattle leveling now takes into account how you have allocated your attribute points.\nItems matter!\nHaving stronger items means your battle leveled stats will be stronger. For example, equipping a purple level 34 sword will give more damage than a green level 34 sword.\nRunning around naked in Cyrodiil is no longer advisable. Lower-level player characters will be given bonus stats to help make up for the lack of optimized gear, skills, and passive abilities. The bonus will scale to your level, so lower-level player characters will receive a larger bonus.\nSubtitles\nShield Dyeing\nAkaviri Crafting Style\nThe secrets of the Akaviri crafting style have been uncovered by scholars on the front lines of the Alliance War!\nSiege merchants in Cyrodiil will sell chapters of the Akaviri Style for large amounts of Alliance Points.\nTo learn an Akaviri style chapter, you must have at least Rank 9 in at least one of the Metalworking, Tailoring, or Woodworking passives.\nThe merchants will also sell the raw style material needed to craft Akaviri items, Ancient Scale, for a modicum of Alliance Points.\nYou must refine ten Ancient Scales together into one Goldscale in order to use it in crafting Akaviri arms and armor.\nOnce refined together into a Goldscale, the item is immediately bound to your account. If you wish to trade them, you must do so in their unrefined form!\nMercenary Motif\nThe mysteries of the Mercenary Motif have been unearthed by the Undaunted!\nThe Mercenary Motif is a brand new crafting style, available only through Undaunted activities.\nTo earn the Chapters of the Mercenary style, you must complete Undaunted Pledges and open their reward chests.\nBronze, Silver, and Gold chests all have a good chance to grant a Chapter of the Mercenary style, with Silver having a better chance than Bronze, and Gold having a better chance than Silver.\nAll three chests have a small chance to drop the full Book of the style, as well.\nThe Style Item for Mercenary, Laurel, is found by killing the final boss of Normal and Veteran dungeons, with Veteran dungeons' final bosses having a better chance than Normal final bosses.\nThis chance is also modified by your knowledge of the Mercenary style: If you know zero Chapters of the style, you will never receive a Laurel from any source. If you know all 14 Chapters, you will always receive a Laurel from Veteran dungeon final bosses, every time you kill one.\nLaurels are Bind on Pickup - they cannot be sold, traded, or mailed.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, DLC GAME PACKS\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nDungeons\nGeneral\nImperial City Prison (Normal &amp; Veteran)\nWhite-Gold Tower (Normal &amp; Veteran)\nMolag Kena's Storm Wall will no longer disappear due to damage from area of effect abilities.\nVeteran Dungeons\nVeteran Imperial City Prison\nVeteran White-Gold Tower\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nAchievements\nImperial City\nGeneral\nItemization\nItem Sets\nMonsters\nMonster Abilities\nDevourer\nDredaza the Ringmaster\nGeneral Kryozote\nGeneral Nazenaechar\nOtholug gro-Goldfolly\nSecundinus the Despoiler\nTitan\nUzuruz\nXivkyn Elite\nPatrolling Horrors\nBaron Thirsk\nGlorgoloch the Destroyer\nKing Khrogo\nMazaluhad\nThe Screeching Matron\nQuests\nSublime Brazier:\nTel Var Stones\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS, BASE-GAME PATCH\nAlliance War\nGeneral\nArt &amp; Animation\nGeneral\nAudio\nGeneral\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nGeneral\nDragonknight\nArdent Flame\nDraconic Power\nNightblade\nAssassination\nSiphoning\nSorcerer\nStorm Calling\nDaedric Summoning\nTemplar\nAedric Spear\nDawn's Wrath\nRestoring Light\nWeapon\nBow\nTwo Handed\nDestruction Staff\nDual Wield\nRestoration Staff\nWorld\nVampire\nDrain Essence:\nWerewolf\nWerewolf Transformation: Using this ability will now consistently override any active costumes.\nGuild\nFighters Guild\nMages Guild\nUndaunted\nAlliance War\nAssault\nSupport\nEmperor\nRacial\nArgonian\nDark Elf\nOrc\nChampion System\nIncreased the bonus you receive at 100 points to 16% from 15.8% for the following passives:\nApprentice\nAtronach\nRitual\nLover\nShadow\nSteed\nTower\nMundus Stones\nThe Steed\nThe Thief\nMonsters\nMonster Abilities\nArcher\nAlliance War Faction Border Guard\nAssassin Beetle\nBear\nBerserker\nBone Lord\nDaedra Synergy\nDuneripper\nDwarven Ice Centurion (Dragonstar Arena 8)\nimmediate recast.\nFlesh Atronach\nGargoyle\nGiant Spider\nHarpy\nHarvester\nHruzizolk\nKnight\nNightblade (monster)\nOmen of Blood (Stormhaven)\nOgre\nOgrim\nPet Ranger\nShaman\nSpirit Mage\nThunderbug\nTitan\nTroll\nWamasu\nWerewolf\nWispmother\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nAlchemy\nConsumables\nEnchanting\nHarvesting\nCrown Store\nGeneral\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nDungeons\nArx Corinium\nBlessed Crucible\nCity of Ash\nCrypt of Hearts\nDarkshade Caverns\nDirefrost Keep\nFungal Grotto\nSelene's Web\nSpindleclutch\nTempest Island\nVaults of Madness\nWayrest Sewers\nVeteran Dungeons\nVeteran Banished Cells\nVeteran Crypt of Hearts\nVeteran Fungal Grotto\nVeteran Spindleclutch\nExploration &amp; Itemization\nGeneral\nMalachite shards now correctly appear when searching the raw material filters for Blacksmithing, Woodworking, and Clothing within Guild Stores.\nAchievements\nCollectibles\nWe have increased the stack size of all collectible trophies to 200.\nItem Sets\nJustice System\nGeneral\nUI\nMiscellaneous\nGeneral\nQuests &amp; Zones\nGeneral\nAlik'r Desert\nAuridon\nBangkorai\nColdharbour\nCraglorn\nDeshaan\nEastmarch\nGlenumbra\nGrahtwood\nMages Guild\nMalabal Tor\nReaper's March\nRivenspire\nShadowfen\nStonefalls\nThe Rift\nWerewolf\nUI\nGeneral\nAlliance War\nCharacter Creation &amp; Select\nController\nGameplay\nGrouping Tools\nLeaderboards\nGuild Bank &amp; Traders\nMaps"}

We have implemented some small performance improvements that may result in better FPS for some. Please note that is part of an ongoing effort to resolve client performance issues, and we are working on additional improvements and fixes as well. We understand how much frustration this causes, and it remains our number one priority.\nBIG CHANGES / UPDATES / NEW FEATURES\nVeteran Rank Changes\nPhase 1 of our Veteran gameplay changes begins with this patch, the first in a series of changes we'll be making to improve the post-50 experience overall. We've lowered the difficulty of the second and third alliance zones to bring them more in lines with zones from 1-50. You'll be able to continue soloing through them more easily than before, though they'll still be challenging. We have much more information about Veteran System changes on the way, so make sure to watch our site for updates.\nFIXES &amp; IMPROVEMENTS\nAlliance War\nAudio\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nMiscellaneous\nQuests\nUI\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;\nGeneral\nAudio\nGeneral\nCombat &amp; Gameplay\n&lt;a href=\"Templar\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Restoring%20Light\"&gt;Restoring Light&lt;/a&gt;\nGuilds\n&lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;\nCrafting &amp; Economy\nGeneral\nDungeons &amp; Group Content\nDungeons\n&lt;a href=\"Vaults%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Vaults of Madness&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Dungeons\"&gt;Veteran Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Darkshade%20Caverns%20II\"&gt;Veteran Darkshade Caverns&lt;/a&gt;\nMiscellaneous\nGeneral\nQuests\n&lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;\nUI\nGeneral\n&lt;a href=\"Grouping\"&gt;Grouping&lt;/a&gt;"}
