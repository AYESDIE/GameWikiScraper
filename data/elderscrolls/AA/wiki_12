It was led by High King &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of the three &lt;a href=\"Alliances\"&gt;Alliances&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe main reason the Daggerfall Covenant was established in 2E 567 was to end the poverty and suffering throughout the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; caused by dwindling trade routes, which in turn was caused by the many wars happening throughout the land such as &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;King Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. This could not be done as long as an enemy was sitting on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Merchant King of Wayrest, Emeric, took action and united the previously warring races of &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;. He earned the trust of the kings of High Rock, earned the alliance with the Redguards by a diplomatic marriage with &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, and, finally, made a war treaty with the Orcs.\nThe Redguards, a disciplined and martial people, begrudgingly agreed to join the Orcs thanks to the cunning Bretons, whose political and economic savvy make victory for the Covenant seem possible. Despite internal struggles, the Covenant believes that only it can provide strong leadership and plan for prosperity the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; needs to survive.\nMuch like the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, the Daggerfall Covenant united races that were commonly known as old enemies; the Bretons, Orcs, and Redguards. Due to the events in both &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and High Rock itself, trade routes that served as the region's main source of income were disrupted. This caused much poverty and suffering and ultimately forced the people of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding areas to unite under one banner.\nThe Daggerfall Covenant stretched over the provinces of High Rock, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil. Its capital is the city of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, which is built on two shores of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; in High Rock. The faction is led by the &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeliefs.\nThe Covenant claimed that the Reman Empire lived on in its members, as they remained true to the primacy of trade, principles of freedom, and the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, which was followed in much of the Daggerfall Covenant. The Orcish and Breton craftsmanship made the alliance an economic powerhouse, with the military strength of the Redguards and the Orcs making it a force to be reckoned with. The rulers of the Covenant longed to return to an Empire of Tamriel, with the economic prosperity, law, and justice, that it would bring. The Covenant believed that the only way to make sure the right Emperor would sit the throne was to make sure they themselves attended to it. After taking over all of Tamriel, the Covenant aimed to also install a Grand Council, which would include members from all the kingdoms of Tamriel.\nViews of the Alliances.\nThe Covenant had a hostile view against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, as the Covenant was convinced that the Dominion aimed to return Elven domination over the other races of Tamriel, forming a tyranny over the races of Man and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant pointed out that they could live peacefully with the elves, as their acceptance of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; showed, but that &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; insisted on war. They believed that the Dominion held no rights to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and that an attempt at invading the land would result in their armies being destroyed.\nThe Covenant was more open minded in regards to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, people who had traded with the kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; for ages, and while the Covenant did not wish them ill will, they were told that a continuation of support of the Dominion would bring them the same fate as the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, as the Covenant considered the Dominion to be dominated by the Altmer, with the Khajiit and Bosmer being their \"vassal slaves\". The Dominion, on the other hand, saw the Covenant as inhabited by mongrel upstarts, who opressed the Direnni, and blamed their ancestors for being fine with the rise of dangerous fanatics such as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. They also heavily opposed the Covenant's permission to raid Aldmeri ships with pirates, and frowned upon the Orcs being a part of the Covenant, believing that the Orcs were to be disciplined and subdued as quickly as possible. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; viewed the Daggerfall Covenant as too callow and immature, and stated that the Empire was a failed experiment whose time has passed, insisting that Men are unfit to rule an Empire, and that instead a Tamriel Pact had to be formed.\nSupport for the Covenant.\nWithin the northern regions of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, there was mixed loyalty to the Covenant. King &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt; had called upon the loyal sons and daughters of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; to support the Covenant, offering them a chance to live outside of their desert home. Fahara'jad had also pledged protection to all merchant ships, as well as their crews, who were loyal to the Covenant. Likewise, the ships sailing under the banner of the Aldmeri Dominion or the Ebonheart Pact, or ships manned by crews loyal to said Alliances, were now allowed to be attacked and pillaged, with even great bounties being set on the vessels, cargo, and their crew.\nOthers in Hammerfell opposed the Covenant due to the Redguards losing their traditional ways in favor of it, and due to making allies with the Orcish peoples, while also believing that High King Emeric was merely using the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; in order to become Emperor. More doubts of the need of an alliance with the Orcs came about when the Redguards linked the Orsimer deity of &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; to Malooc the Horde King, an ancient enemy of the Redguard people. As such, some of the Redguards hoped that by showing honor and strength, the Orcs may be converted to the veneration of the Divines. Mocking of Orcs was also not uncommon, with even such behavior occuring within the Wayrest Guard, despite punishments existing for such an act. Even so, it was a common belief among the &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; and Redguard population that they'd rather have the Orcs fighting their enemies than raiding farms. And likewise, while the Orcs did not all trust the Redguards and Bretons, they did generally trust High King Emeric.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, while the kingdom had accepted to join the Covenant, not all the Orc clans agreed to it. Some Orcs mistrusted the Bretons and the Redguards due to their history of being beset by these peoples. Especially the Orc clan of the Morkuls disagreed with having even joined the alliance in the first place. Other Orcs also disproved of the Covenant, stating that the elf-loving Bretons and the traitor Redguards are not their friends, and that the Orcs are neither welcome nor needed in the Covenant. Disproval of their own King Kurog also existed, with Orcs believing Kurog to have abandoend his tribe, shed blood for elves and gold while the Orcs languished and starved, fighting a war for the Bretons and the Redguards, who slaughtered the Orcs in the past, who saw the Orcs as little more than pig children. These Orcs wished that both Kurog and Emeric would fall. Some Orcs pretended to like their new allies, while still being bitter in remembering the sacking of Orsinium by the Bretons and Redguards.\nOther Orcs made agreements with King Kurog, such as the tribe under Warchief Gruznak gro-Volkar, whose tribe was pardoned for their crimes against the Covenant in return for helping the Covenant slay &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt;. Support for the Covenant was most clearly seen among the Orcs who remembered Orsinium being an Imperial province under the Reman Empire, and wished to return to that status after the Covenant formed another Empire.\nSome within the Covenant, while pledging for unity among their own, did discriminate against those not of their three races, considering the Bosmer as barbaric canibals, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of the Dunmer as imitators of Gods, the Khajiit as thieves and addicts, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; as having a lacking mental capacity, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; as cheaters.\nLeadership.\nAs trade in High Rock and Hammerfell slowed to a halt it was only appropriate to have a merchant-politician for a leader of this faction. High King Emeric took the throne as he united the races of High Rock, Hammerfell, and the newly recognized province of Orsinium. Emeric was known for his skill in politics and diplomacy. He, no doubt, was a wise leader, but his foes were given no mercy. His strategy is to infuse fear into his enemies, slaughtering armies, and leaving a few of the fighters alive only for them to run and share their tale.\nWhen the Breton &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt;\" \"became Emeric's personal army he adopted the lion as his crest, and it subsequently became the symbol of the Daggerfall Covenant.\nMembers.\n&lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dominant race of the Daggerfall Covenant, they were once ruled by &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; overlords after they were discovered to be descended from both Men and Mer, later becoming the dominant race in the region of High Rock and edging the Elves out. A reminder of those days is the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; blood that still runs through their veins. This makes Bretons gifted mages, surpassing the ability of any other race of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;. Described as talented and resourceful and having a similar focus on honor in battle, the Covenant is often ruthless in the defeat of enemies that threaten their people's prosperity. Bretons are known as skilled craftsmen, shrewd merchants, and inventive mages. The race are also famed for their Knights. They value prosperity over glory in battle and are led by High King Emeric from their capital of Wayrest.\nTheir symbol is the Lion, the crest of the Daggerfall Covenant.\n&lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiving deep within and around the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, Redguards are renowned warriors, both athletic and prodigiously talented. They value honor and dignity above all else; their sacred purpose is to preserve their ancient traditions and prove their strength and prowess, surviving in the harsh environment. Mages are highly distrusted in their society. The capital of the Redguards is the great city of Sentinel, from where they are led by King &lt;a href=\"Fahara%27jad\"&gt;Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;. The Redguards are praised for their skill in warfare and grand strategy, with many Redguards taking command over battalions in the Covenant army.\nTheir symbol represents the Redguards' skill with blades and in battle.\n&lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcs are fearless warriors who follow a code of honor forged in centuries of endless warfare. The quality of Orcish blacksmithing is known throughout Tamriel.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; when their homeland, &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, was finally given provincial status, they had to prove themselves to be more than mere savage beasts, and the Orcs did so by devoting themselves to the newly forged Covenant. They are led by King &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; from their capital of Orsinium.\nTheir symbol represents the Orcs being some of the best smiths and warriors in Tamriel.\nQuests.\nThe questline of the Daggerfall Covenant is experienced in the zone story quests of each zone within Daggerfall Covenant territory. In chonological order, the zones of the Covenant storyline are &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCovenant Military.\nArms and Armor.\nThe arms and armor of the Covenant military were, largely, based on the designs of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and the Covenant was proud in this fact, as the Daggerfall Covenant represented the ideals of the Reman Empire, which they considered the height of Tamrielic civilization, when everyone was included in the Empire.\nThe influences of the Empire on the Covenant's arms and armor were especially noticable on their axes, cuirassess, daggers, gloves, and swords. Both the axes and the gloves of the Covenant army were somewhat improved compared to their Imperial counterparts. For better protection for the forearm, the Covenant gloves included a guantlet. To improve the Imperial axe, Orcish smithing techniques were used.\nCovenant belts were made of square links, fronted with a round buckle, which was meant to represented the entire world of Nirn, with Tamriel at its center, standing for Tamrielic unity.\nBreton and Orcish influences were prevelant in the Covenant equipment. Helmets, staves, and shoulder pieces drew inspiration from either the Knightly Orders of High Rock or just Breton spellcasters. Combined Breton and Orcish design was seen in the greaves of the Covenant, whereas the Orcish influence was the most obvious on their Maces.\nIntelligence agency.\nThe intelligence agency of the Daggerfall Covenant is known as the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Daggers\"&gt;Ring of Daggers&lt;/a&gt;. While not much is known about the organisation, it is known that their leader is &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Dariah\"&gt;Copper Dariah&lt;/a&gt;. They have attempted to track down the former head of security and spymaster of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Althen\"&gt;Gerard Althen&lt;/a&gt;, and punish him for the slaying of hundreds of innocent Orc civilians during &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;.\nCovenant Army.\nThe Covenant army recruited from both less experienced troops and more impressive forces to make up its armed forces. While not regimented or as well trained as the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s, they shared more similarities and less divisions. Covenant archers were picked on their physical strength, as they needed to be able to pierce through even the thickest of armors. The majority of the spellcasters of the Covenant came from High Rock. A more elite unit within the Covnenant military were the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt;, who were tasked with defending High King Emeric, but were also ordered by the High King to defend the lands of High Rock, in order to defend the Covenant and protect its citizens.\nShips for the Covenant were made at &lt;a href=\"Tava%27s%20Blessing%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tava's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, heavy precautions against spies were made.\nThe Daggerfall military, in contrast to the soldiers of the Ebonheart Pact or the Aldmeri Dominion, attacked both the Dominion and the Pact simultaneously, instead of focusing on one of the two. The Covenant also knew the tactics of the Aldmeri Dominion, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of its members. The Bosmer were known by the Covenant to be unwilling to fight with swords, instead preferring to use their skills with the bow. In contrast, the Khajiit were noted for their skill as fighters, with the Covenant even noting that they could continue fighting with their claws, and even their tails, should they be disarmed. The Altmer were also seen as powerful in sword fights, due to their considerable reach. To combat this, the Covenant instructed its soldiers to strike low at the Altmer.\nThe Bretons are the political masters of the Covenant, and while the Redguards of Sentinel and Hallin's Stand are the smallest in number, they make up for it with tactical brilliance on the battlefield. The Orcs are the Covenant's strongest infantry and best smiths, scattering those who stand against them and their Breton and Redguard allies on the battlefield.\nHistory.\nFirst Daggerfall Covenant.\nThe First Daggerfall Covenant was created in &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;. The Kings of High Rock formed an alliance in response to the Reachmen invasion led by &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; from the east. The Reachmen razed Evermore, besieged Wayrest, sacked Camlorn, and managed to march as far as Daggerfall before they were stopped by the forces of High Rock. Specifically, the Dragoons commanded by Emeric of Cumberland greatly weakened the Reachmen army, allowing the Knights of Daggerfall to cut down the remaining Reachmen. After this victory, the Kings of Daggerfall, Wayrest, Camlorn, Evermore, and Shornhelm swore an oath to defend each other's kingdoms, and stand united against foreign foes. This marked the start of the First Daggerfall Covenant. The final battle, and the unity of the Bretons, would later be referenced in song.\nIn the aftermath of the founding of the Covenant, High Rock prospered during its rebuilding. This prosperity would become most noticeable after &lt;a href=\"2E%20561\"&gt;2E 561&lt;/a&gt;, when the largest orichalcum strike up until that point in history was made by miners near Wayrest. Emeric, the Earl of the domain of &lt;a href=\"Cumberland\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt;, proposed to King Gardner of Wayrest to use this wealth to enhance the fleet of Wayrest and improve trade throughout High Rock, a proposal which was accepted. While the fleet was being constructed, however, the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; struck, resulting in the death of not only the King of Wayrest, but his entire royal household. As a result, Emeric was crowned king, with House Cumberland becoming the second royal dynasty of Wayrest. When the Lion Guard became the elite bodyguard of Emeric, he adopted the Lion symbol as his personal crest, and later turned it into the martial symbol of the entire Covenant.\nConflict in the Covenant.\nKing Emeric had been courting the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of Shornhelm, but married Princess &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel instead in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;. In response, King Ranser was upset, and stayed silent towards Emeric. All the while he was mustering his armies, and spending the treasury of Shornhelm to hire mercenaries and invade Stormhaven.\nKing Ranser called upon the noble families of the region to come to his aid, but of the nobility, only the Montclair family was willing to fully support him. While most sources say that all the noble families backed Ranser, this is not the case, and even the Montclairs, who did end up backing Ranser's armies, did not do so at first. Count Phylgeon of the Montclair family had originally proposed to form peace, and asked for the approval of both Ranser and Emeric. While Emeric's answer was lost, Ranser answered in fury, and as a result, the Montclairs had to come to Ranser's aid.\nRanser's advances nearly brought down the Covenant when he launched a surprise attack on Wayrest. Shornhelm did not get any support from the rest of the Covenant, however, as the kings of Camlorn, Evermore, and Daggerfall all sided with Emeric to face off against the armies of Shornhelm. Through diplomacy, Emeric also managed to gain the support of Sentinel's army in order to protect Queen Maraya. In order to even further solidify his defence force, Emeric reached out to one of the great Orcish clans of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, offering them Orsinium, as &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt; had requested, if they came to his aid. This combined force managed to defeat Shornhelm, with a reborn Covenant, now as a multinational alliance instead of a Breton defensive pact.\nHouse Tamrith ceased supporting king Ranser when the Covenant approached, and called for peace, with House Dorell following suit. House Ravenwatch, a relatively small House, did not get involved in the conflict alltogether. The Montclairs would only surrender until they were pushed back to Traitor's Tor, just to the east of the city of Shornhelm. When Ranser's army started to retreat, the Orcs from Wrothgar had already started to sack the city of Shornhelm. \nAfter the conflict, Baron Tamrith became a powerful force for peace and cooperation, with the idea to form a ruling council consisting of the leaders of the three noble Houses, in order to govern the region of Shornhelm in the High King's name. The leaders of each of the three noble houses, Montclair, Tamrith, and Dorell, pledged their loyalty to High King Emeric. The King approved of the council, but promised to select a new king for the region at the first opportunity, though he failed to elect one within 38 years time. The Montclairs would later attempt to restore Shornhelm to the status it had held during the days of king Ranser, however.\nSecond Daggerfall Covenant.\nThe Second Daggerfall Covenant is a compact of the inhabitants of northwest Tamriel, consisting of the Bretons of High Rock led by King Emeric, the Orcs of Orsinium led by King Kurog, and the Redguards of northern Hammerfell led by King Fahara'jad. The Covenant is an alliance of mutual defense which aims to establish peace and order across the continent, inspired by the Reman Emperors they claim to also be the spriritual heirs of the Second Empire.\nNegotiations, debates, and arguments for the formation of the new alliance lasted for months. The final result were dozens of compromises and carefully negotiated provisions. The Covenant gauranteed freedom of trade throughout the alliance, and despite the objections of the nobility of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;, the Orcs were accepted as full members of the Covenant. All the city-states of the Covenant would eventually swear fealty to the Royal Council of the Covenant, presided over by High King Emeric. Being the architect of the alliance, Emeric also claimed supreme leadership.\nThe Covenant considered itself a noble alliance of honorable and chivalrous people, and believed they represented all the best aspects of both the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and Second Empire. They also believed that the Covenant could even form the foundation for a third Empire, which would provide all of Tamriel with mutual respect, vigorous trade, and reverence for the Divines. In &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;2E 578&lt;/a&gt;, Emeric had already concluded a treaty with Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, until his disappearance which resulted in Cyrodiil falling to the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshippers. In response, Emeric recognized they had to march on Cyrodiil and reform the Empire, in order to restore peace and justice to the provinces.\nEvents of.\nThe Covenant was also beset by undead uprisings.\nBetnikh.\nA member of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vardan\"&gt;Vardan&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to gain the knowledge which would allow him to destroy the armies of the Daggerfall Covenant.\nCraglorn.\nWithout Craglorn, the Covenant High Command was involved with investigations of possible bandit raids on trading caravans.\nCyrodiil.\nWithin Cyrodiil, &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; called for the aid of both &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlord%20Zimmeron\"&gt;Grand Warlord Zimmeron&lt;/a&gt;, of the Ebonheart Pact, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlord%20Dortene\"&gt;Grand Warlord Dortene&lt;/a&gt;, of the Daggerfall Covenant, to save Bruma from the invading Daedric forces, and capture a valuable supply line in the process. The Covenant also held some of the Elder Scrolls of Cyrodiil, which they refused to give back to the Moth Priests as they were being used for the war effort, and would lead the Covenant to victory. The Grand Warlord was even personally willing to deliver not only the Scrolls of the Covenant, but also those of the Pact and Dominion to the White-Gold Tower after the war would be concluded.\nWhile back home, Covenant Soldiers were told terrible stories about the war in Cyrodiil, about invincible Altmer mages who wore nothing but lightning, or flying Dunmeri gods, or the blood of an Argonian being able to melt swords, those in the field quickly discovered these were but rumors, and not truthful.\nValenwood.\nCovenant forces had invaded the Ayleid ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ne%20Salas\"&gt;Ne Salas&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlenumbra.\nAt the Ayleid ruins of &lt;a href=\"Silumm\"&gt;Silumm&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmeri Dominion attempted to expand and take over parts of the Covenant in High Rock, while also searching for hidden sources of power. Similar attempts were made at &lt;a href=\"Enduum\"&gt;Enduum&lt;/a&gt;. Within Stormhaven, specifically, &lt;a href=\"Koeglin%20Mine\"&gt;Koeglin Mine&lt;/a&gt;, forces of the Ebonheart Pact had also attempted a form of expansion."}

The four volumes of the Commentaries have led the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to discover the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;'s shrine within the deep caverns of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius\"&gt;Lake Arrius&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nIt is determined that the location of the Dagon Shrine is in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Arrius%20Caverns\"&gt;Lake Arrius Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero has two options to go about completing this quest.\nInfiltrating the shrine.\nMethod 1: infiltration.\nUpon entering the cave, the Hero will be greeted by a &lt;a href=\"Doorkeeper\"&gt;Doorkeeper&lt;/a&gt; who tells them to speak to &lt;a href=\"Harrow\"&gt;Harrow&lt;/a&gt;. Harrow will ask them to give him all of their items and gold. If the Hero agrees, Harrow will lead them into a dark sacrificial chamber where, after a short speech from &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, they will be invited to join the Mythic Dawn.\nThere, the Hero will be prompted to kill the prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Jeelius\"&gt;Jeelius&lt;/a&gt;. If this is done, they will become an acolyte of the Mythic Dawn. Some of the cultists that were attending the ceremony will leave, making it reasonably easier to escape. If the Hero decides to release Jeelius, the cultists will attack him and the Hero. Be warned though, as it can be difficult to keep up with him and protect him since he runs very fast. A somewhat easier way to save Jeelius is to agree to kill him, then kill all of the cultists before waking him up. This way, they will not attack him.\nMethod 2: combat.\nAlternatively, the Hero can simply proceed through the cave, killing everyone they encounter. This can be a deliberate strategy, starting with the Doorman and it can also happen as a product of the Hero refusing to hand over their inventory. Either results in the Hero blowing their cover and unable to follow the infiltration path. As the Hero is not being escorted, the combat approach also permits the looting of a side chamber behind a locked door that contains multiple leveled chests. When the Hero reaches the ritual chamber, they can then just wait out the speech and Camoran's exit. If the Hero is hidden in stealth or invisibility, most of the worshippers will depart without noticing them. This leaves a single combat with &lt;a href=\"Ruma%20Camoran\"&gt;Ruma Camoran&lt;/a&gt;. Kill her, choose to release Jeelius or not, and then take the book.\nJeelius.\nWith either method, if the Hero wants to save Jeelius, wake him up before taking the \"Mysterium Xarxes\". Taking the book causes the statue of Dagon to crumble and it will crush him if he is still on the sacrificial platform. If Jeelius makes it out of the cave alive, he will reward them later with +1 to &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; skills when visiting him in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. He will need to be spoken to twice to receive the reward.\nTaking the Mysterium Xarxes.\nRegardless of which method chosen, Mankar Camoran will escape through a portal to his &lt;a href=\"Gaiar%20Alata\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;. Picking up the book will open a sealed gate to the north and the escape route. Once the Hero has taken the book, escape from the caverns, and return to &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion Crisis escalates.\nWhen this quest is completed, the Oblivion crisis escalates:"}

The Final Piece of the Staff of Chaos remains inside the corridors of this dungeon.\nFirst Level.\nThe First Level is a large zone with confusing passageways, but fortunately, the door to the Second Level is not far away from the entrance. The fastest way to reach the next zone is to go west immediately after entering the dungeon, fighting with Hell Hounds, Homonculi, and Wraiths.\nThe door to the Second Level is locked, and the Mithril Key which opens it is guarded by a Vampire inside the room close to the door, in the northwest zone. The room is also locked, but it is possible to open it using an unlocking spell or simply attacking it. It is important to remember that Vampires are the second strongest creature encountered, having power to deal massive damage with his sword or with Fireballs.\nAfter defeating the Vampire, the &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Key\"&gt;Mithril Key&lt;/a&gt; can be looted from his corpse and used to open the Second Level's entrance.\nSecond Level.\nThe Second Level is also a large area, however this time the Eternal Champion will have to explore all of it. The entrance to the Third Level is protected by five doors, each one has a corresponding key located in different zones of the Second Level, they are the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Key\"&gt;Ruby Key&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sapphire%20Key\"&gt;Sapphire Key&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Key\"&gt;Crystal Key&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20Key\"&gt;Amethyst Key&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Key\"&gt;Diamond Key&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, if the Eternal Champion has the effect &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt;, either by spell or enchantment, they can break the walls and open only the last door with the Diamond Key, which is found close to the center of the Second Level and is protected by a Lich near an abyss (\"see map\").\nThe Ruby Key is above a platform surrounded by lava inside a large room located in the northwest zone. An Iron Golem will be protecting this key. The Sapphire Key is also located above a platform surrounded by lava protected by a Fire Daemon, this time in the northeast zone of the map. This location can be only reached through a hidden passage or by using Passwall. The Amethyst Key is also above a platform in the southeast zone, guarded by a Vampire, however this one is surrounded by an abyss. As mentioned previously, the Diamond Key is protected by a Lich near the center of the Second Level, and the Crystal Key is located on a room in the southwest with only one entrance, surrounded by lava. To take this key, the Eternal Champion will have to carefully jump over the lava. The key is protected by a Medusa. (\"all these five keys are represented in the map with white markers\").\nIf the Eternal Champion uses Passwall to break the way, before doing the next step, it is very recommendable to save the game and not to save again on the same slot until getting out of Dagoth-Ur. This is a measure of safety to ensure the Champion will not be locked inside the Second Level.\nWhen the five keys have been obtained, the Eternal Champion must open the doors. After opening the last door, Stone Golems will be protecting the entrance to the Third Level. When they are defeated, the Eternal Champion can enter the last area of Dagoth-Ur, the heart of the volcano.\nThird Level.\nThis level is different from the other two\u2014it is simply composed by one corridor and a large lava lake. The Final Piece stands right in the heart of Dagoth-Ur, surrounded by lava. To reach it, the Eternal Champion must first go through a corridor guarded by Homonculi and Wraiths.\nThe heart of Dagoth-Ur is the last area of the dungeon and one of the most dangerous places in . Four Fire Daemons guard the corners of this zone, and three Liches can be encountered next to the walls. Ghosts and Homonculi are seen flying above the platforms surrounded by lava, and more Homonculi are encountered above the central platform where the Final Piece stands.\nIt is not necessary to fight the Liches nor the Daemons to reach the Final Piece, however defeating them will grant a great quantity of experience points to the Eternal Champion. If the Levitation effect is available, it should be used now to fly above the lava. If the effect is not available, the Eternal Champion will have to jump through the platforms and reach the central platform.\nThe Final Piece is surrounded by walls and it is a bit difficult to come close to it. The Eternal Champion must stand right in the front of the flying blocks and jump above them (\"the Levitation effect must not be active; the mouse can be used to adjust the character to the right position\"). The Eternal Champion will fall inside an abyss and the Final Piece shall be in front of them; they just need to climb up the wall and touch the Final Piece. It will give a riddle before being obtained:\n\"To escape, a riddle must ye answer...\"\n\"From the beginning of eternity,\"\n\"To the end of time and space,\"\n\"To the beginning of every end,\"\n\"And the end of every place...\"\n\"What am I?\"\nThe answer is (humorously) \"E.\"\nThe Final Piece will then join the pieces collected earlier and finally repair the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and the following message will appear to the Eternal Champion.\n\"Thou art truly worthy. Go in peace,\"\n\"and let thy fate be written\"\n\"in the Elder Scrolls...\"\nThe Eternal Champion must now exit Dagoth-Ur, breaking the way again if they used Passwall to skip the Second Level.\nThe Staff of Chaos is finally completed, however, an unexpected problem is discovered.\nAmbush.\nFor the last time, the usurper Jagar Tharn appears to the Eternal Champion and reveals that before splitting the pieces of the Staff of Chaos around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, he had drained its magical power. The Imperial Wizard will defy the Eternal Champion to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Province%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Imperial Province&lt;/a&gt; and meet him personally\u2014if, of course, he survives Tharn's minions, who are sent again in a new ambush.\nAfter Tharn's creatures are defeated, the Eternal Champion must rest and receive Ria Silmane's new vision to start their &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;final quest&lt;/a&gt; and finally save &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;."}

Whether Gares was ever a Dunmer is unknown, however he eventually became an &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Ghoul\"&gt;Ash Ghoul&lt;/a&gt; through the power of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, brought into the eternal service of Lord Dagoth.\nBiography.\nDuring the resurrection of the Sixth House during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Gares obtained his Dagoth title and became head priest of the Ilunibi shrine. There he led his followers of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;, as well as conducting smuggling operations through the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt;, inserting &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Statues\"&gt;Ash Statues&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell's&lt;/a&gt; trade, so as to spread Dagoth Ur's dream visions and influence.\nGares would take part in the start of the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt; when an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; patrol came to investigate the smuggling taking place at Ilunibi. The troopers entered the caverns and were attacked immediately by cultists and creatures of the House. The troopers managed to escape the fighting and reach the shrine itself, where they came upon Dagoth Gares. Gares slew all but one of the troopers, and cursed him with &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; disease, declaring that he should survive the shrine to report what had occurred. Gares then had the trooper taken from the caverns.\nThe survivor's report would eventually lead to none other than the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; being dispatched to &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20House%20Base\"&gt;deal with the shrine&lt;/a&gt;, taking the bait that Dagoth Ur and Gares had set. The Nerevarine managed to infiltrate the shrine and confront Gares. Gares greeted the Nerevarine civily, presenting a message from Dagoth Ur that asked the Nerevarine to come to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and join the Sixth House's struggle against the Tribunal and the Empire. Gares too offered a chance at submission, but the Nerevarine would not relent. The two dueled across the Ilunibi shrine, and though Gares possessed powerful magic and strength, he was doomed to be felled by the Nerevarine. As he died, though, Gares smiled at the Nerevarine and breathed out a final curse.\nThe curse inflicted the Nerevarine with Corprus disease. Dagoth Gares died believing his Master's will to have been fulfilled. This would prove to be wrong as the Nerevarine was later \"cured\" of Corprus.\nPersonality.\nDagoth Gares was an entirely devoted servant of Lord Dagoth Ur, obsessed with pleasing his Master's will. Like many Sixth House priests however, Gares had a deep sense of honor and integrity. He spoke politely with the Nerevarine, offering chances of surrender, explaining the position of House Dagoth. This was borne out of the old House Dagoth tradition of honor, extending even into battle, where the challenger is allowed the first move.\nSpells and Powers.\nSpells.\nGares knows the following spell:\nAbilities.\nGares also benefits from the following:\nAfflictions.\nApart from automatically giving the Nerevarine corprus, he can also potentially infect them with the following:\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Sixth%20House%20Base\"&gt;Sixth House Base&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The Sixth House greets you, Lord Nerevar. Or , as you call yourself. I am known as Dagoth Gares, priest of Ilnubi Shrine, and minister of Sixth House servants. My Lord, Dagoth Ur, has informed me of your coming. I wish that this time you had come to honor your Lord's friendship, not betray it.\""}

Deny Tribunal access to the Heart, weakening the Temple while securing Red Mountain for the creation of Akulakhan. Keep the construction of Second Numidium a secret.\nPhase 2:\nCreate passive servants in ever-widening circles around Red Mountain by broadcasting compulsions couched in dream imagery to susceptible subjects in their sleep. Establish a major operational base at &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt; for further operations in the ash wastes. Establish smaller bases near small port villages and in lower-class waterfront districts in Vivec. Infiltrate and subvert smuggling syndicates. Recruit willing followers from disaffected populations, including the underworld, the poor, and rabid anti-Imperial activists.\nPhase 3:\nExpand from smaller bases to other towns and villages, and recruit and indoctrinate subjects made susceptible by dream sendings. Occupy abandoned towers and ruins, and train corrupted cultists as raiders and irregular troops. Identify, discredit, and decimate possible sources of political resistance.\nPhase 4:\nUse assassination and terror to weaken, distract, and disrupt the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Legions&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperial bureaucracy, along with their &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlaalu sympathizers&lt;/a&gt;. Inspire popular uprisings of the native poor against the foreign rich and powerful. Summon Sleepers and &lt;a href=\"Dreamer\"&gt;Dreamer&lt;/a&gt;s to Dagoth Ur to work on Second Numidium.\nInferring &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;'s Perspectives.\nDagoth Ur thinks on a large time scale -- for the most part, in the outside-of-time scale of the divine consciousness. He thinks that only obstacles of mythic scale are worth consideration. He believes he is fated to rule Morrowind, to free Morrowind of the Empire, and to become the new hard-loving Father of Morrowind. Given that perspective, the only opposing forces Dagoth Ur worries about are the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Tribunal's loss of Sunder and Keening, and with the diminishing resources of Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, Dagoth Ur believes he has permanently gained a decisive strategic advantage. On a mortal timescale, the battle may last for centuries, but the outcome is not in doubt. And Akulakhan may be a device for dramatically reducing the time scale for a decisive victory.\nThe myth of dynamic invincibility of the Emperor and the Empire has long been an unquantifiable and intimidating threat, but recent rumors of unrest in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, of the Emperor's failing health, and the unsettled question of the succession have diminished the scale of that threat. Nonetheless, the revelation that the Nerevarine is a pawn of Imperial intelligence, hand-picked and &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Caius%20Cosades\"&gt;sent to Morrowind by the Emperor himself&lt;/a&gt;, may cause Dagoth Ur considerable anxiety.\nThe Daedra represent no coherent obstacle to Dagoth Ur. Nonetheless, their personal abilities and their influence upon their fanatic followers is considerable, their motives and actions obscure, and Dagoth Ur remains concerned about them.\nThe Incarnate represents Saint &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, a mythic force that has previously defeated Dagoth Ur, and Dagoth Ur is obsessed with this threat. At the same time, Dagoth Ur knew Nerevar personally, knew that he was a mortal man with faults and weaknesses. Dagoth Ur may have some hope of seducing or negotiating with Nerevar's reincarnation. Further, when Nerevar and the Tribunal defeated Dagoth Ur, they were strong and allied; now the Nerevarine and the Tribunal are weak, opposed, and divided. Therefore, though the Nerevarine and the Tribunal represent the most serious threat to Dagoth Ur's plans, he still has good reason to believe that this time he will prevail.\nA Recent Timescale of Dagoth Ur's Activities.\n[Much of the following timescale is based on inference from incomplete information.]\nbefore 2E 882: Dagoth Ur and his kin lie dreaming beneath the sills of Red Mountain.\n&lt;a href=\"2E%20882\"&gt;2E 882&lt;/a&gt;: Dagoth Ur and his ash vampires awake refreshed and emerge from lower Red Mountain into the Heart Chamber. Dagoth Ur ritually binds himself and his brethren as heartwights in a ritual of his own devising. First stages of construction of Second Numidium [conceived during the Long Sleep] are begun by heartwights and atronach constructs in a chamber near the Heart of Lorkhan. Keeping the Second Numidium project a secret from the Tribunal is a high priority.\n&lt;a href=\"2E%20882\"&gt;2E 882&lt;/a&gt;: The Tribunal arrive at Red Mountain for their annual ritual bathing in the heart's power. Dagoth Ur and ash vampires ambush the Tribunal. The Tribunes are driven away, and prevented from restoring themselves with Kagrenac's tools at the Heart of Lorkhan.\n&lt;a href=\"2E%20882\"&gt;2E 882&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;: Intermittent Tribunal campaigns assault Red Mountain. The Tribunal and supporting forces seek to force access to the Heart Chamber, but are repeatedly driven back. Dagoth Ur recruits Sleepers and Dreamers through dream sendings. Cultists are recruited through dream compulsion. Weaker cultists become &lt;a href=\"Lame%20Corprus%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;corprus beasts&lt;/a&gt;; stronger cultists advance through stages towards the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Ascended%20Sleeper%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ascended Sleepers&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20400\"&gt;3E 400&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt; reoccupied by &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Uthol\"&gt;Dagoth Uthol&lt;/a&gt; and fortified as an advance base for Sixth House operations. Blight storms more frequent and widespread. Soul sickness spreads in regions close to Red Mountain.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20410\"&gt;3E 410&lt;/a&gt;: Sixth House bases founded near &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; and in waterfront areas of Vivec. Sixth House operatives exploit smuggler organizations and communications to spread their influence among victims unbalanced by Dagoth Ur's dream sendings.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20415\"&gt;3E 415&lt;/a&gt;: Small cells of Sixth House cultists in every town in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Larger Sixth House operations are concealed in remote dungeons where creatures are bred and cultists are trained for the coming struggle.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; lose the artifacts Keening and Sunder to &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Odros\"&gt;Dagoth Odros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Vemyn\"&gt;Vemyn&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec rescues Almalexia and Sotha Sil, but failing to recover Keening and Sunder, the Tribunal retreat from Red Mountain in disorder. Surviving &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; companions know the Tribunal was forced to retreat, but do not know how serious a reversal the Tribunal has suffered. The Three Tribunes return to their respective capitals and continue to perform their ritual functions. The Tribunes continue to grow weaker without access to the Heart, and because of resources required to support the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;. The inner circle of the Temple priesthood has begun to suspect the Tribunes have suffered seriously from wounds and demoralization in the wake of reverses at Red Mountain, but do not recognize the scale of the problem.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20426\"&gt;3E 426&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;427&lt;/a&gt;: Campaign of Sixth House assassinations of prominent Imperial citizens and &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; Imperial sympathizers. Sudden increase in number and seriousness of attacks by cultists and victims deranged by soul sickness."}

He is also called Devil Dagoth Ur or Devil of Dagoth.\nHistory.\nEarly life and Councilorship.\nVoryn Dagoth was born into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. Accounts of his early life are few, but it is known that he did later in life become the Lord High Councillor of the house and a retainer to &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;. After the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; created an alliance known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; formed by Nerevar and &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;, the king of the Dwemer in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The First Council lasted for centuries until Voryn, through unknown means, claimed to have discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architect\"&gt;Tonal Architect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; had found the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Dwemer would use the power of the Heart to create a giant machine known as the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; to use against the Chimer. Voryn, along with Nerevar, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar's wife &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; were the only ones before Kagrenac to learn about the Heart. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; later confirmed Voryn's claims and Nerevar declared war on the Dwemer, culminating in the race's disappearance at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nNerevar's death.\nAfter the defeat of the Dwemer, the artifacts &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; fell into the hands of Nerevar, who had to decide what to do with the tools. Voryn urged the destruction of the tools while Nerevar convened with the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and Azura. When Nerevar and the Tribunal returned to lock away the tools, Voryn refused to give them up saying that he was entrusted with keeping them safe. Unknown to Nerevar and the Tribunal, Voryn had experimented on the tools and the Heart and had managed to steal its divine energy. Voryn now called himself Dagoth Ur from that point on, though other sources claim that Nerevar coined the name. Nerevar and the Tribunal's guards fought and drove off Dagoth Ur, who was thought to have died. Nerevar was said to have died from his injuries fighting Dagoth Ur, though the cause of Nerevar's death is often disputed.\u00a0Other accounts suggest it was the Tribunal who killed Nerevar, but only after he had vowed along with the Tribunal to never use the tools.\nThe Tribunal took possession of the tools, and after some time, Sotha Sil managed to find a way to become gods by using the tools. The Tribunal traveled to Red Mountain and used Kagrenac's tools on the Heart of Lorkhan, using its power to attain immortality. For breaking their promise to never use the tools, Azura appeared in anger, turning the Chimer into the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and prophesying that Nerevar would &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;be incarnated&lt;/a&gt; and curse them for their deeds. Dagoth Ur, however, managed to maintain a connection to the Heart through unknown means and managed to stay alive and immortal, although temporarily non-corporeal and presumed to be dead by most.\nThe Birth of Dagoth Ur.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20882\"&gt;2E 882&lt;/a&gt;, the Tribunal journeyed to Red Mountain to renew their god-like powers. However, by that time, Dagoth Ur and his House had been reborn in new bodies that more than matched the Tribunal's power. Unable to enter the Red Mountain to renew their powers, the Tribunal grew weaker while Dagoth Ur grew more powerful as a result of being exposed to the Heart for so long. During this time, Almalexia and Sotha Sil, in a vain attempt to regain their powers, lost Keening and Sunder to &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Odros\"&gt;Dagoth Odros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Vemyn\"&gt;Dagoth Vemyn&lt;/a&gt;, only surviving after Vivec saved them. Dagoth Ur began to spread the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; diseases by powerful and unnatural ash storms from Red Mountain, beginning a complex plan to conquer Morrowind and all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; with the second Numidium, &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDagoth Ur's main goals were to:\nThe Tribunal's decline.\nDagoth Ur's first phase of his plan was to secure Red Mountain against Tribunal intruders and deny the Tribunal's access to the Heart, weakening the Temple and the three tribunes while claiming the land of Red Mountain for the creation of Akulakhan.\nA large part of the plan was to keep the construction of Akulakhan a secret from the Temple and Tribunes.\nThe Tribunal could never defeat Dagoth Ur due to two things: the first was that every time the Tribunes would invade Red Mountain and \"kill\" Dagoth Ur, the power of the Heart of Lorkhan would always revive him. The second reason was that the Tribunal had to maintain the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt; to keep Dagoth Ur's minions from invading Morrowind.\nThe Nerevarine Prophecy.\nIn 3E 427 a prisoner matching the description of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; to investigate complaints of disturbances in the region. After it was revealed in the &lt;a href=\"Cavern%20of%20the%20Incarnate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Cavern of the Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; that this person was Nerevar reincarnated, they obtained Wraithguard, recovered the other &lt;a href=\"tools%20of%20Kagrenac\"&gt;tools of Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; and met with Dagoth Ur in Red Mountain. There, they severed the Heart of Lorkhan from the mortal plane by using the tools, and without the Heart to sustain them, Dagoth Ur and his &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt; brothers perished, and Akulakhan was destroyed. By doing this, the Nerevarine ended the Blight and Corprus diseases, along with the threat of House Dagoth. This action also caused the Tribunal to become mortal.\nPowers.\nDagoth Ur could send messages in dreams and was able to make people serve him. It was also said that he could speak through the mouths of his minions. He was a powerful mage, with long lethal claws. Only by destroying the Heart of Lorkhan was the Nerevarine able to defeat him.\nPersonality.\nDagoth Ur maintained the honorable ceremonies notable to his house as he allowed the Nerevarine to deliver the first hit when they battled. When asked by the Nerevarine on how he justified his crimes he replied that he accepted the responsibility of leadership and that Morrowind could not be liberated from the Empire without bloodshed and that he viewed his actions as just and noble. It was said that Dagoth Ur had adopted the views and motivations of the Tonal Architect Kagrenac.\nNotes.\nName usage.\nIn , a simple map of the continent of Tamriel is shown, including the island of Vvardenfell. The center of this island is a volcano which is referred to only as Dagoth-Ur. However, in , the volcano is referred to by its inhabitants almost exclusively as Red Mountain. This discrepancy is explained by the fact that Dagoth Ur resides inside of Red Mountain for most of his life. Thus, in local legend, the mountain is sometimes referred to by this name."}

It resided with other holy artifacts in the vaults of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, waiting for the day it will be used to defend the realm. \nThe warhammer has the ability to serve as both an instrument of healing and cleansing and is able to siphon a creature's entire soul, empowering the wielder. The Tribunal hoped that the warhammer would never be used for the latter purpose.\nIn the late &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; manipulated a follower, &lt;a href=\"Meram%20Vox\"&gt;Meram Vox&lt;/a&gt;, into stealing the Judgement of Veloth. After he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah manipulated Meram's mother, &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Vox\"&gt;Urili Vox&lt;/a&gt;, into stealing the warhammer to exact her revenge against the Tribunal for her son's death. By &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, with the warhammer in Vox's possession, the Tribunal did not dare act against Vox directly. Instead, Almalexia acquired the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; in defeating Vox and reclaiming the hammer, which they eventually did. The hammer was then returned to the Tribunal Temple.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the Judgement of Veloth was in possession of a Tribunal monk, &lt;a href=\"Tharer%20Rotheloth\"&gt;Tharer Rotheloth&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt;.

Rising to prominence in the Late-Middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Veloth supposedly sought a more ascetic and pure way of life for his followers and gathered them into a grand pilgrimage from the southwest regions of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast. According to the contemporary texts, he \"spared not a boat, ration, or strong-armed soul among his people in this exodus and toiled to reach the land of Resdayn.\"\nHis mass pilgrimage to a new land, where stoic values were established, was successful. The race enjoyed a period of high culture, known to many as the Golden Age, where Veloth's guidance shaped generations of stonemasons and architects, as well as priests and common folk. Although he wielded a mighty warhammer\u2014Veloth's Judgment\u2014Veloth is thought of mainly as a peaceful and scholarly soul, to which the Dunmer's healing enchantments that bear his name attest.\nVeloth's power as a prophet was in no doubt, but his mossback teachings on the worship of Dunmer forebears are worthy of consideration, as he almost single-handedly began the god-cult worship of the \"Good Daedra\" prior to the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. Veloth's people honored him so much, his influence can be felt generations later. Those trekking over the Velothi Mountains southeast of Skyrim or hearing a Dunmer elder refer to their race as the \"Velothi\" still feel the presence of this world-shaping mentor of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;."}

She resides in &lt;a href=\"Velsa%27s%20Villa\"&gt;her villa&lt;/a&gt; in the Flooded District of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt; suspects that Velsa has been ratting out their info to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;, though after this is disproven, she agrees to rejoin the guild.\nBackground.\nDecades before &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Velsa was born to Arendis family of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;. Her family ran a &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;Slavery&lt;/a&gt; plantation, and she loathed her family's business. Velsa met &lt;a href=\"Narahni\"&gt;Narahni&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; slave working in the family's kitchens. They later fell in love, and made a plan to free all the plantation's slaves.\nJust as Velsa was making her escape with the slaves, her brother, whom Velsa considered the worst of her family, arrived at an unfortunate time. In order to ensure Velsa and the other slaves' escaped safely, Narahni went into the arms of Velsa's brother to distract him. Velsa saw this, and had mistaken Narahni for eloping with her brother. Before Narahni could get a chance to explain, Velsa left.\nVelsa later went on to join the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt;, he elevated Velsa to a position on the Thieves Council. &lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt; found her to be pragmatic. She later left the Thieves Guild between &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;582&lt;/a&gt;, wanting nothing to do with the guild. She retired to &lt;a href=\"Velsa%27s%20Villa\"&gt;her Villa&lt;/a&gt;, growing a number of plants in her garden and raising her pet &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeever&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha\"&gt;Sotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Cleaning%20House\"&gt;Cleaning House&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finding Velsa in her garden, she will have a conversation with &lt;a href=\"Silver-Claw\"&gt;Silver-Claw&lt;/a&gt;. She will later assist the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; in infiltrating &lt;a href=\"Silver-Claw%27s%20Warehouse\"&gt;Silver-Claw's Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;, which has been taken over by new management. Afterward, she will rejoin the Thieves Guild.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Game%20%28Thieves%20Guild%29\"&gt;The Long Game&lt;/a&gt;.\nZeira has asked Velsa to gather intel around Abah's Landing, but she has instead gone off to &lt;a href=\"No%20Shira%20Citadel\"&gt;No Shira Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to spy on the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt;. She will send the Vestige inside to find out what &lt;a href=\"Cosh\"&gt;Cosh&lt;/a&gt; is up to.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Faded%20Flower\"&gt;A Faded Flower&lt;/a&gt;.\nVelsa will ask the Vestige to help investigate whether a letter she received was truly from her family.

The drones would then store the items in a vault until a &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Architecture\"&gt;Tonal Artifact&lt;/a&gt; could fetch them.\nUnfortunately, as I suspected, that information was enough for some of the captains to betray us and change course.

As I am no warrior, I dare not venture inside without you.\nHopefully this message reaches your party in time, for I know we are of like mind.

I don't think the owner will mind if I take it. I really should spend more time around the docks, these &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; are too thin blooded for my taste.\nAnyway, one of the tales in the &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; is an account of the \"Bloodspring of Lengeir's Feast,\" a fabled source of power for &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;. It's a story I've read several renditions of before but this version suggests that it may be located in Skyrim, in a ruin buried by quaking of the earth during the &lt;a href=\"2nd%20Era\"&gt;2nd Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsidering that my business here with Inquisitor &lt;a href=\"Amolmaire\"&gt;Amolmaire&lt;/a&gt; is, shall we say, at an end, it might be a good time to leave &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; for a worthwhile diversion for the next twenty to thirty years. Perhaps I shall investigate this fabled Bloodspring.\n~2nd of Morning Star, &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;\nI was able to obtain passage from &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; by way of ship. No mean feat with this &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; insurrection going on, I assure you, I ran across one of my own in the local tavern and feared at first that it might cause problems for me, but it turns out that she is well-positioned here in the city and has been happy to help if I keep a civil manner. We spoke much on my research into the Bloodspring and while she made sure to point out that she thinks it a \"soft headed pursuit\" she did say that what shes heard would point to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\n~5th of First Seed, 4E 201\nAfter months of searching I finally may have found a lead. While looking for a bit of dinner in the &lt;a href=\"Vilemyr%20Inn\"&gt;Vilemyr Inn&lt;/a&gt;, I overheard an old hermit by the name of Jokull, talking about strange red water he found bubbling out of the ground.\nOnce I dispose of this soldier, I'll follow to see if I can find the location.\n~13th of First Seed, 4E 201\nI can't believe I didn't realize it sooner.\nJokull has been taking buckets of rock and dirt out of his house all week. When I realized that he's digging a basement I snuck in to check if he had uncovered the Bloodspring. He's hit a cave system that must be where Bloodspring has sunken into over the years. It was hard to see in the dim light, even with my eyes, but I would swear the water I saw pooled on the ground was red. Unfortunately he woke up while I was exploring the basement and he dropped his torch on a pelt as I killed him. More setbacks.\n~4th of Rain's Hand, 4E 201\nThe runnels I initially found had passed through too much rock and dirt but I've \"befriended\" some of the locals and we've managed to find the source of the Bloodspring. We've kept a low profile so as not to draw too much attention and thus far I've managed to keep them to only attacking hunters and other dregs, but we'll need to set up a ready food source that won't draw too much attention if we are to remain here.\nThe Bloodspring is not everything that I'd hoped it would be. Though it is blood and gives great strength it provides no sustenance. And the power it grants lasts only a short while and carries a weakening of the body and mind with it. I've had to lock the door to the chamber to keep the others from becoming completely dependent upon it. When I've tested it on mortals, it is worse for them, for it carries only &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and addiction with no benefits at all.\nAddiction.\nI may have just found a solution for our food problem."}

I'm glossing over much that isn't of interest to my search but it would seem that the woman he was in love with turned into a vampire and subsequently turned him as well. They went on a rampage through the Spring and killed the other priests as they cowered in the pool, praying for Arkay's protection.\n\"...and as we tore the spine... ...last priestess... ...took the viscera into the &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20Chalice\"&gt;Bloodstone Chalice&lt;/a&gt;... ...waters ran red forever more...\"\nPerhaps this \"Bloodstone Chalice\" is the answer.\n~18th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt;, 4E 201\nWeeks of research and still nothing to show for it. It would seem that the Bloodstone Chalice is most likely the key to harnessing the power of the Spring, but it is also clear that at some point it was removed from the ruins.\nI've found an illustration of it which I have endeavored to sketch here, but nothing else regarding where it may have ended up."}

This results in the player being able to power attack every second for 720 seconds (although you cannot attack this fast). This gives the player a massive advantage during a fight.\nThis item is also easy and cheap to make due to the recipe being known by default and all ingredients are easily found or bought for low prices.

I never want what happened there to happen to my home again. I suppose that's why I keep such meticulous records. If someone in my Sanctuary breaks &lt;a href=\"Five%20Tenets\"&gt;the tenets&lt;/a&gt;, I want to have absolute proof of that. And if we're falsely accused of breaking the tenets, then I want to be able to point to the appropriate journal and show the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; that, this time, it made a mistake.\nSo I write down everything.\nMiddas\nThe &lt;a href=\"Astara%20Caerellius\"&gt;Matron&lt;/a&gt; asked me how I was feeling today. Why? Does she know something I don't?\nTurdas\n&lt;a href=\"Hildegard\"&gt;Hildegard&lt;/a&gt;'s fur was all over my living space today. I told her not to come around when she was in &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolf form&lt;/a&gt;. I'm making a note of this transgression, just for the record.\nFredas\nI wonder what would happen if I mixed goat milk with bile-beer? Remember to try that the next time &lt;a href=\"Kor\"&gt;Kor&lt;/a&gt; brings in supplies.\nMorndas\n&lt;a href=\"Tanek\"&gt;Tanek&lt;/a&gt; said hurtful things about my scales and my tail. Someday, I'm going to inform the &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt; about the way he treats his family.\nTirdus\nAnother one of the family was found murdered today. Poor &lt;a href=\"Symdul\"&gt;Symdul&lt;/a&gt;. There was something familiar about the way he was killed. I need to think about that and check my old notebooks.\nTurdas\nThe Speaker seemed displeased with me. He kept throwing dark glances at me every time I jotted down what somebody said. Or maybe not. He always throws dark glances at us.\nFredas\nI listened to a sermonizer today. I started taking notes, as usual, but I soon became so upset that I couldn't read my own handwriting. How dare they say such lies about the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;? I must inform the Matron about this.\nLoredas\n&lt;a href=\"Cimbar\"&gt;Cimbar&lt;/a&gt; was tortured and killed. Sadness fills the Sanctuary like water fills a lake. My heart breaks for poor &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Motierre\"&gt;Mirabelle&lt;/a&gt;. She so enjoyed fornicating with Cimbar as often as possible. Maybe she'd appreciate reviewing all of my extensive notes on their couplings?\nSundas\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;New-Blade&lt;/a&gt; asks the most interesting questions. I need to jot these down.\n\"What do we do after we get to &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;?\" Good question! \"How do we do that?\" Sometimes the New-Blade is a bit dense. \"What do you need me to do?\" I could have been inappropriate here. \"Wasn't this Sanctuary abandoned?\" Not paying attention. Already explained that.\nMorndas\n&lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Viria\"&gt;Lyra Viria&lt;/a&gt;. That's a name I haven't thought about in a long time. We were friends once, brother and sister. She was dead. Or so I though. Now I discover that she's not only alive, but she's the one who purified our Sanctuary. And now I find out that sje's the Black Dragon, the murderer responsible for killing my current brothers and sisters. I can't fathom why she turned against the Brotherhood, but it doesn't matter. She needs to die.\nMiddus\nI remember a night back in my old Sanctuary. I was a new initiate, and so was Lyra. The seasoned brothers and sisters enjoyed trying to frighten us with all kinds of scary stories. I remember one in particular, when Lyra and I were listening with a combination of tension and fascination. It was the story of &lt;a href=\"Brombar\"&gt;Brombar&lt;/a&gt;, an Assassin who betrayed his brother. He was mortally wounded by the sister who was sent to punish him. She left him barely alive so that when the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Sithis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wraith of Sithis&lt;/a&gt; appeared to claim his soul, he'd be completely aware of what was happening to him. That scared us both so much that neither of us could sleep soundly for more than a week. Why did I think of that, I wonder?\nTurdas\nThe Matron ordered me to track down the Black Dragon and kill her. I am honored and saddened by the trust she places in me."}

My research finally bore fruit. The stone husk incubation vessels are the answers to all the unknowns I hoped to unearth. My hope for this is twofold. One, that I will be able to resurrect mortal souls from their afterlife. Second, that I will be able to free vampire souls from &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and thus free them from &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. I will attempt this extraordinary feat on a mortal first. A woman named Lisolda, who died of a wasting disease. Once I am sure that experiment is a success, I will attempt the much riskier undertaking of trying this on a vampire soul. I only pray that my excitement is not premature. \nI was a fool to think I had all the answers. I preach to Rada al-Saran about protecting mortals, yet my own experiment caused one to suffer needlessly. I attempted to resurrect Lisolda. At first, I was elated. She did return from the dead. But she was not whole. Returning to the world of the living drove her mad. She was so angry. I could feel her rage as clearly as if she were made of flames. I could not think of a way to help her. I was forced to kill her to prevent her from harming anyone, and that act sickens me. My hubris caused Lisolda so much pain. It shames me. I must discover what went wrong. Perhaps if I put some of my own essence in a reliquary, it might stabilize the experiment. That will be my next course of action. \nThere are simply too many unknowns. I modified the ritual, but I dare not follow through. The amount of life energy required to pull a soul out of Coldharbour\u2014that's too high a price to pay. I will keep a record of the process in this journal, but it must not be acted upon. The stone husks cannot be trusted as a methodology as they currently exist. This decision pains me, but I know in my heart it is right. I cannot hurt another the way I hurt Lisolda. I will not risk any others and cause more suffering. This study is closed.\nI have also begun to contemplate the ramifications of a world without a cycle of life and death. The possibility is horrifying. Why did I ever think this path was the way to peace? I was right to end my experiments and my research where I did.\nI do not know why I accepted &lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt;'s invitation and came to &lt;a href=\"Grayhome\"&gt;Grayhome&lt;/a&gt;. Curiosity, I suppose. An undying hope that I can change the course of the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Council\"&gt;Gray Council&lt;/a&gt; and avoid the war that &lt;a href=\"Styriche\"&gt;Styriche&lt;/a&gt; so desperately craves? I did bring all of my equipment with me. The ritual chamber they constructed here is really quite impressive. For a moment, I contemplated renewing my research with &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Tzinghalis\"&gt;Tzinghalis&lt;/a&gt;, but I know now that would be folly. It's unfortunate I cannot extract my essence from the reliquary, but that is the least of my worries. For now, I will store it in the first floor armory, hidden among the other reliquaries. I have no intention of staying in Grayhome or remaining a part of the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;'s Gray Council, but at least I know the reliquary will be safe here. Let it serve as a reminder of my failure. If I am to truly broker peace between mortals and vampires, I still have a long road ahead of me. It's time to take my leave."}

Verkarth was once ruled by &lt;a href=\"Styriche\"&gt;Styriche&lt;/a&gt;, the Vampire King of Verkarth who fought against &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nVerkarth is located on the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the mountain range that separates the northern Hammerfell border from the rest of the province. Verkarth is rather close to the region of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ska%27vyn\"&gt;Ska'vyn&lt;/a&gt;. The nearest settlements to Verkarth City are the townships of &lt;a href=\"Thorstad%20Place\"&gt;Thorstad Place&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Karnver%20Falls\"&gt;Karnver Falls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riverpoint\"&gt;Riverpoint&lt;/a&gt;, and the mentioned city of Skaven. Because of the city's close proximity to Skaven, one can assume that Verkarth is located in the Kingdom of Skaven, although this is not confirmed.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; expanded beyond the borders of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and into the provinces of Western Tamriel. The Bangkorai Garrison was a prominent settlement in the area, with a Chapel to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; in the fortress. &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt;, before he was a priest, lived in the Bangkorai Garrison and was a Priest of Stendarr, who spiritually healed the warriors guarding the Garrison after conflicts. The leader of Verkarth at the time was &lt;a href=\"Styriche\"&gt;Styriche&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; with a powerful army called the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;. The Host consisted of Vampires, Bat-men, and &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, and ravaged the area, until they reached the Bangkorai Garrison. &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Hestra\"&gt;Empress Hestra&lt;/a&gt;, the then leader of the Alessian Empire, was moving into Bangkorai and was intercepting the Gray Host at the Bangkorai Garrison.\nPelin prayed to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; and after saving &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Clancie\"&gt;Sergeant Clancie&lt;/a&gt;, he plunged into the Batmen horde. As Pelin landed onto the horde, the monsters swarmed Pelin, draining the blood from his body, but from divine intervention from Stendarr, his body was filled with endless amounts of blood and flooded the Batmen with fountains and geysers of gory blood. The Bangkorai Militia under Clancie had mostly slain the creatures, forcing Styriche to retreat. Hestra cornered the army and ultimately defeated, along with Styriche. It was at this moment, Pelin went from a mere beadle to the position of Saint, being worshipped throughout Bangkorai to this day. After this battle, High Rock was named the Imperial Province under the Alessian Empire. What became of Verkarth after the death of Styriche is unknown, but Styriche was reanimated during the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, whenever one of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; throughout Tamriel was activated.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Verkarth City in their quest to recover the pieces."}

The destruction he had caused had soon gained the attention of a village mayor, who hired Bourlor to slay him. During their confrontation, Bourlor shot an arrow toward Vernaccus, who promptly fled back to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0before the arrow found its mark. The arrow missed Vernaccus and struck the tree behind him. Back in Oblivion, instead of berating him, the other Daedra, including even\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, praised him for proving the superiority of Daedra over the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis event had earned Vernaccus a modest reputation, and even a few shrines and worshippers. During this time, he would also be known by such names as \"The Elusive Beast\", \"The Unpursuable One\", \"He Who Cannot Be Touched\", and \"The Bane of Kynareth\". One day, he had discovered that one of his shrines was under assault by a group of mercenaries who had begun pelting his shrine with stones. Furious, he appeared before the mercenaries, who fled before he had the chance to kill any of them. As the mercenaries fled, his worshippers began showering him with praise and reverence. In this moment of distraction, he was struck in the back by a stone thrown by one of the mercenaries. Instead of fleeing, they now ridiculed Vernaccus and began throwing even more stones at him.\nAs he fled into the shrine, the door behind him was slammed into his back by one of the thrown stones. An arrow that had been lodged in the door since it was still a tree, stabbed him in the back. It was the same arrow fired by Bourlor so long ago, still stuck in the spot where it had landed. Vernaccus had finally been struck by the very arrow that made him famous."}

While he ordered a mug of &lt;a href=\"greef\"&gt;greef&lt;/a&gt;, his mates &lt;a href=\"Garaz\"&gt;Garaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xiomara\"&gt;Xiomara&lt;/a&gt; joined him with moderately sincere concern.\n\"What's wrong with you, Hallgerd?\" asked Xiomara. \"You're later than usual, and there's a certain air of tragedy you've dragged in with you. Have you lost money, or a nearest and dearest?\"\n\"I haven't lost any money,\" Hallgerd grimaced. \"But I've just received word from my nephew that my cousin Allioch has died. Perfectly natural, he says, just old age. Allioch was ten years younger than me.\"\n\"Aw, that's terrible. But it goes to show that it's important to savor all of life's possibilities, 'cause you never know when your time is coming,\" said Garaz, who had been sitting at the same stool at the smoky cornerclub for the last several hours. He was not one cursed with self-awareness.\n\"Life's short all right,\" agreed Xiomara. \"But if you'll pardon a sentimental thought, few of us are aware of the influence we'll have after our deaths. Perhaps there's comfort there. For example, have I told you the story about &lt;a href=\"Vernaccus\"&gt;Vernaccus&lt;/a&gt; and Bourlor?\"\n\"I don't believe so,\" said Hallgerd.\nVernaccus was a &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; (said Xiomara, throwing a few dribbles on flin on the hearth to cast the proper mood), and though our tale took place many, many years ago, it would be fair to say that Vernaccus still is one. For what after all is time to the immortal daedra?\n\"Actually,\" Garaz interrupted. \"I understand that the notion of immortality--\"\n\"I am trying to offer our friend an inspirational tale in his hour of need,\" Xiomara growled. \"I don't have all bloody night to tell it, if you don't mind.\"\nYou wouldn't have heard of Vernaccus (said Xiomara, abandoning the theme of immortality for the time being) for even at the height of his power and fame, he was considered feeble by the admittedly high standards of the day. Of course, this lack of respect infuriated him, and his reaction was typical of lesser daedra. He went on a murderous rampage.\nSoon word spread through all the villages in the Colovian West of the unholy terror. Whole families had been butchered, castles destroyed, orchards and fields torched and cursed so nothing would ever grow there again.\nTo make things even worse for the villagers, Vernaccus began getting visitations from an old rival of his from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. She was a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer\"&gt;daedra seducer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Horavatha\"&gt;Horavatha&lt;/a&gt;, and she delighted in taunting him to see how angry she could make him become.\n\"You've flooded a village and that's supposed to be impressive?\" she would sneer. \"Try collapsing a continent, and maybe you'll get a little attention.\"\nVernaccus could become pretty angry. He didn't come very close to collapsing the continent of Tamriel, but it wasn't for lack of trying.\nA hero was needed to face the mad daedra, and fortunately, one was available.\nHis name was Bourlor, and it was said that he had been blessed by the goddess &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. That was the only explanation for his inhuman accuracy with his bow and arrow, for he never missed a target. As a child he had driven his marksmanship tutors wild with frustration. They would tell him how to plant his feet, how to nock a bolt, the proper grip for the cord, the best method of release. He ignored all the rules, and somehow, every time, the arrow would catch a breath of wind and sail directly to his target. It did not matter if the quarry was moving or still, at very close range or miles away. Whatever he wanted to strike with his arrow would be struck.\nBourlor answered the call when one of the village mayors begged him for help. Unfortunately, he was not as great a horseman as he was an archer. As he rode through the forest toward the mayor's town, a place called Evensacon, Vernaccus\u00a0was already murdering everyone there. Horavatha watched, and stifled back a yawn.\n\"Murdering a small town mayor isn't going to put you in famous company, you know. What you need is a great champion to defeat. Someone like &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; or--\" she stared at the figure emerging from the forest. \"That fellow!\"\n\"Who's he?\" growled Vernaccus between bites of the mayor's quivering body.\n\"The greatest &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt; in Tamriel. He's never missed.\"\nBourlor had his bow strung and was pointing it at the daedra. For a moment, Vernaccus felt like laughing\u2014the fellow was not even aiming straight\u2014but he had a well-honed sense of self-preservation. There was something about the man's look of confidence that convinced the daedra that &lt;a href=\"Horavatha\"&gt;Horavatha&lt;/a&gt; wasn't lying. As the bolt left the bow, Vernaccus vanished in a sheet of flame.\nThe arrow impaled a tree. Bourlor stood and stared. He had missed a target.\nIn Oblivion, Vernaccus raged. Fleeing before a mortal man like that\u2014not even the basest &lt;a href=\"scamp\"&gt;scamp&lt;/a&gt; would have been so craven. He had exposed himself for the weak, cowardly creature he was. As he considered what steps to take to salvage the situation, he found himself face-to-knee with the most fearsome of the Daedra Princes, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I never thought anything much of you, Vernaccus,\" the giant boomed. \"But you have more than proven your worth. You have shown the creatures of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; that the daedra are more powerful than the blessings of the Gods.\"\nThe other denizens of Oblivion quickly agreed (as they always did) with the view of Molag Bal. The daedra are, after all, always very sensitive about their various defeats at the hands of mortal champions. Vernaccus was proclaimed The Elusive Beast, The Unpursuable One, He Who Cannot Be Touched, The Bane of Kynareth. Shrines devoted to him began to be built in remote corners of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nBourlor meanwhile, now found flawed, was never again called to rescue a village. He was so heartbroken over his failure to strike his target that he became a hermit, and never restrung his bow again. Some months later, he died, unmourned and unremembered.\n\"Is this really the tale you thought would cheer me?\" asked Hallgerd incredulously. \"I've heard the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Worms\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt; told more inspirational stories.\"\n\"Wait,\" smiled Xiomara. \"I'm not finished yet.\"\nFor a year's time, Vernaccus was content to watch his legend grow and his fledging worship spread from his home in Oblivion. He was, in addition to being cowardly and inclined toward murderous rages, also a very lazy creature. His worshippers told tales of their Master avoiding the bolts of a thousand archers, of moving through oceans without getting wet, and other feats of avoidance that he would rather not have to demonstrate in person. The real story of his ignominious retreat from Bourlor was thankfully forgotten.\nThe bad news, when it came, was delivered to him with some relish by Horavatha. He had delighted in her jealousy at his growing reputation, so it was with a cruel smile she told him, \"Your shrines are being assaulted.\"\n\"Who dares?\" he roared.\n\"Everyone who passes them in the wilderness feels the need to throw a stone,\" Horavatha purred. \"You can hardly blame them. After all, they represent He Who Cannot Be Touched. How could anyone be expected to resist such a target?\"\nVernaccus peered through the veil into the world of Mundus and saw that it was true. One of his shrines in Colovian West country was surrounded by a large platoon of mercenary soldiers, who delighted in pelting it with rocks. His worshippers huddled inside, praying for a miracle.\nIn an instant, he appeared before the mercenaries and his rage was terrifying to behold. They fled into the woods before he even had a chance to murder one of them. His worshippers threw open the wooden door to the shrine and dropped to their knees in joy and fear. His anger melted. Then a stone struck him.\nThen another. He turned to face his assailants, but the air was suddenly filled with rocks.\nVernaccus could not see them, but he heard mercenaries in the woods laugh, \"It's not even trying to move out of the way!\"\n\"It's impossible not to hit him!\" guffawed another.\nWith a roar of humiliation, the daedra bounded into the shrine, chased by the onslaught. One of the stones knocked the door closed behind him, striking him in the back. His face broke, anger and embarrassment disappearing, replaced by pain. He turned, shaking, to his worshippers who huddled in the shadows of the shrine, their faith shattered.\n\"Where did you get the wood to build this shrine?\" Vernaccus groaned.\n\"Mostly from a copse of trees near the village of Evensacon,\" his high-priest shrugged.\nVernaccus nodded. He dropped forward, revealing the deep wound in his back. A rusted arrowhead buried in a whorl in the wood of the door had jolted loose in the assault and impaled him. The daedra vanished in a whirlwind of dust.\nThe shrines were abandoned shortly thereafter, though Vernaccus did have a brief resurgence as the Patron Spirit of Limitations and Impotence before fading from memory altogether. The legend of Bourlor himself never became very well known either, but there are still some who tell the tale, like myself. And we have the advantage of knowing what the Great Archer himself didn't know on his deathbed\u2014his final arrow found its target after all."}

The Boneshapers had advanced to the Vernim Woods and had kept the Pact at bay for a while.

Should've taken it as a sign.\nWe'd done business before, she and I. Smuggling &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;black soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, corpses, the kind of &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;dark and dishonest&lt;/a&gt; things that come in pairs. But this was different. This was big.\nThis sword she gave me was like nothing I'd ever seen. Teeth like &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;slaugherfish&lt;/a&gt; and a blood red gem in the center. I said that it must've been one of a kind. That's when she smiled and told me there was another.\nMy job was to swap them.\nWe sealed the venture with a coin, of which more was promised later. The mage told me I'd be contacted in a week. A group of her associates would pay us to use the hideout to kill some &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;, after which, I'd make the switch.\nShe told me to keep this a secret from the mages, which made me pause, but the details didn't matter to me. All I wanted to know was the number on the ledger. It was enough. Months later and the deal had turned rotten. The mages underestimated their own magic, and we our greed. Now we're all paying the price for our stupidity.\nSome tried to fight their way but the bastard won't die. I'm beginning to think he can't. On top of that, every man that he's felled has risen to fight beside him, making him that much harder to kill.\nI guess I have no one to blame but myself. I should've trusted my gut from the start. Mage jobs always have a bad stink on them, but this one smelled especially foul. But I wanted that gold so bad, I convinced myself and the men it was &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe funny thing is, I don't even have Bloodthirst anymore. I lost it at the pits at &lt;a href=\"Faldar%27s%20Tooth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Faldar's Tooth&lt;/a&gt;, thinking I could just kill the mages and Gatharian once I got my hands on the other one. But when the spell went bad, the guild sealed the captain in these chambers, and us along with him. Now all I have left is a festering wound, an empty stomach, and the mage's coin to show for it.\nChances are, this coin is probably the only thing that will make it of here. But oh, could it tell you a story.\nBecause this coin has bought a lot of lives.\nIt's sold a lot of dreams, and spilled a lot of blood.\nI know now the coin is cursed. Yet for some reason, I can't let it go."}

The Vestige, at the game's opening, has been captured by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and is imprisoned in his realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;; their soul has been stolen. There is an ancient prophecy in the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; which states that the Vestige will thwart Molag Bal's plan to merge the world of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; with the realm of Coldharbour in Oblivion. During the events of , the Vestige attempts to reclaim their soul from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; and stop the merging of Oblivion and Nirn.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven%20in%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Soul Shriven in Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige was one of many mortals sacrificed by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; to Molag Bal, specifically by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; himself. They were sent to &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;The Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour. There, the Vestige was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, who informed them that they had an important part to play in foiling Molag Bal's schemes. First, the Vestige had to escape and locate a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; half-&lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; to help free the Prophet. At that moment, the prisoners overpowered the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; guards and began liberating the other prisoners, including the Vestige. They fought their way through the prison, eventually finding Lyris and, with the aid of a mad Soul-Shriven knight named &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;, were able to locate the Prophet's cell. However, for him to be liberated, someone had to take his place in the cell. Lyris switched places with the Prophet, who vowed they would find a way to free her. The Prophet and the Vestige made their way to one of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; and, with the aid of the Prophet's magic, were able to return to Nirn.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Harborage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige and the Prophet were not returned to the same location on Nirn, but they eventually reunited at a place called &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Location%29\"&gt;the Harborage&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Prophet explained the events that led up to his capture. Several years prior, the Cyrodilic Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; desired to become &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; in order to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to legitimize his claim to the Ruby Throne. Mannimarco was able to convince him that he knew a ritual that could accomplish this, but that it required the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the leader of the Dragonguard &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, Lyris Titanborn and the High Chancellor of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, they became the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;. They were able to retrieve the Amulet of Kings and begin the ritual. At that moment, Mannimarco used his magic to immobilize the others and reveal his true intentions: he was an agent of Molag Bal, and the ritual in fact weakened the barriers between Nirn and Oblivion in an event known as the Soulburst. This event allowed Molag Bal to initiate a Planemeld, a forceful merging of worlds.\nAfter the ritual, Varen disappeared, Sai Sahan fled with the Amulet of Kings, and Abnur Tharn pledged allegiance to Mannimarco in cowardice, and Lyris was captured and sent to Coldharbour, both in different locations. After his tale was done, the Prophet informed the Vestige that he needed more time to rest and to devise a way to free Lyris from Coldharbour.\n&lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Daughter of Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after, the Prophet contacted the Vestige and asked them to return to the Harborage, having found out where Lyris was being held in Coldharbour. Molag Bal had moved her to the Foundry of Woe and the Prophet opened a portal to Coldharbour. Once the Vestige located her, they were forced to aid her in retrieving several aspects of herself Molag Bal had removed to torment her: settle her regret over killing her mother at birth, assuage the solitude she'd felt throughout her life, resolve her uncertainty and defeat her terror. The pair then escaped Coldharbour and returned to the Harborage.\n&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Shadows\"&gt;Chasing Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prophet recalled the Vestige to him, having heard whispers of fear near the Harborage. The Vestige was tasked with locating a Worm Cult agent nearby. Locals pointed to a mysterious Imperial nosing around, leading the Vestige to a cellar infested with undead. Inside, Abnur Tharn appeared to them via the Orb of Discourse which was sowing fear in the nearby populace, thinking the Worm Cult agent was trying to contact him. Tharn was surprised to see the Vestige instead, but before they could speak further, the Worm Cult agent attacked. The Vestige defeated him, and then brought the Orb to the Prophet, who believed he could use it to locate Sai Sahan. As Sai had fled with the Amulet, and the Amulet was the only way to stop Molag Bal, the Prophet desired to locate him.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile using the Orb of Discourse to locate Sai Sahan, the Prophet was contacted by Abnur Tharn, who desired to speak with the Vestige. Upon arriving at the Harborage, Tharn informed them that he had no desire to continue to serve Mannimarco, but that he was imprisoned in Coldharbour's &lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt; and needed to be rescued. In exchange, he offered knowledge of Sai Sahan's location. The Vestige and Lyris entered Coldharbour once more, where they were aided by Cadwell to enter the Castle undetected. Fighting their way through many Worm Cultists and undead minions, they eventually managed to locate Tharn and free him. However, Mannimarco appeared before them and attempted to slay them using several waves of summoned skeletons. After dispatching them, Tharn and Mannimarco began a magic duel, which Tharn won when the Vestige hit Mannimarco, breaking his concentration. The Prophet then opened a portal to the Harborage and the trio escaped Coldharbour. The Prophet then revealed that he was in fact Varen Aquilarios. He claimed he had hesitated about revealing himself as he was not sure how the Vestige would react, since his actions ultimately lead to their death.\n&lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tharn&lt;/a&gt; revealed that while he did not know Sai Sahan's exact location, he was willing to assist the Prophet in locating it. This angered Lyris.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tharn%20Speaks\"&gt;The Tharn Speaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring their travels, the Vestige was contacted by a banekin bearing a message from Abnur Tharn requesting a meeting away from the Harborage, at a Mages Guildhall. There, the Vestige found Tharn disguised as a guild mage. Tharn explained that Mannimarco stored artifacts and occasionally information in a nearby Ruin and that it may contain Sai Sahan's whereabouts. The two entered the ruins and discovered that Sahan was being held in Coldbarbour's Halls of Torment, being tortured for the location of the Amulet of Kings.\nVaren informed the Vestige that he would need time to determine the Halls of Torment's exact location in Coldharbour and would contact them when he knew.\n&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Varen determined the location of the Halls, he sent the Vestige through a portal and made them choose whether to take Tharn or Lyris along. The two entered the Halls and found Sahan being tortured by a &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; called the Duchess of Anguish, who was using doppelgangers of the Five Companions to torture Sahan both physically and mentally in an effort to reveal the location of the Amulet of Kings. After slaying the doppelgangers and the Duchess, the pair rescued Sahan and returned him to the Harborage. There, Sahan informed them that he had hidden the Amulet in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. He requested a few days to recover from his ordeal before setting out.\n&lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Valley of Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nSai Sahan informed the Vestige that they required an item to unlock the chamber in which the Amulet was being kept: the Ring of Stendarr's Mercy. Sahan had left the Ring in the care of &lt;a href=\"Kasura\"&gt;Kasura&lt;/a&gt;, a Redguard Blademaster and his old mentor. Varen opened a portal in the Abbey of Blades in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige, Tharn, Lyris and Sahan entered. Upon arriving, they discovered Molag Bal had sent a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Abbey. They were able to slay it, but it had already destroyed most of the Abbey and killed most of the students before they arrived. Kasura thanked her rescuers and led them to where she had stored the Ring: the ancestral crypt of Sai's ancestors. Within, a vision of Mannimarco appeared and raised the dead within the crypt in an attempt to stop them from retrieving the Ring, but they were stopped and the Ring was recovered. Sahan, Lyris and Tharn stayed behind to assist Kasura and her remaining students in burying the dead while the Vestige returned to the Harborage.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Shadow of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Lyris, Sahan and Tharn had returned from the Abbey of Blades, they joined the Vestige in venturing to Sancre Tor. As they entered the ruins, they encountered yet another vision of Mannimarco. This time, the King of Worms explained that he had placed a spell on Sahan to track his every movement. More importantly, he revealed that he planned to use the Amulet of Kings to trap Molag Bal and absorb his essence, turning himself into the next Daedric Prince of Domination. The wards of Stendarr that Sai Sahan had placed on the chamber containing the Amulet would conceal him from Molag Bal until he was ready to strike. The Vestige and their companions fought their way through the ruins before confronting Mannimarco himself in the Amulet chamber after removing the wards. After killing him, Molag Bal himself appeared and dragged Mannimarco's soul into Coldharbour, having known of his betrayal all along. The Vestige recovered the Amulet of Kings and returned to the Harborage.\n&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Five%20Companions\"&gt;Council of the Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren asked the Vestige to join them at the Harborage once more. There, Sahan gave the Vestige the choice of joining the Five Companions or not. Afterwards, Tharn explained his plan for the Amulet: he believed that the Divine power of the Amulet could harm Molag Bal sufficiently to force him to relinquish all the souls he had stolen, including that of the Vestige. However, there was a price: the ritual needed to imbue the power would require a soul. Obviously the Vestige could not do this; neither could Tharn who would need to perform the ritual. Lyris, Sahan or Varen would need to sacrifice themselves to imbue the Vestige with the power of the Divines, and each of them volunteered to be the sacrifice when the time came. Varen then explained that forces would soon launch an assault on Coldharbour, and that the Vestige would need to join them.\n&lt;a href=\"Messages%20Across%20Tamriel\"&gt;Messages Across Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Vanus told them that he and Countess Hakruba of the Fighter's Guild had a plan to attack Molag Bal's realm and end the Planemeld. To do so, they needed the cooperation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in order to maintain the Guilds' neutrality. Vanus and the Vestige visited &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and convinced them to meet for a council on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;, off the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe negotiations quickly broke down as the leaders began to argue and insult each other. As Vanus and the Vestige attempted to restore order, Molag Bal appeared before them and opened portals to Coldharbour on the island and Daedra poured forth. The enemy was repelled, but Vanus and Hakruba realised that neither alliance leader would agree to send forces into Coldharbour for fear that the other two would take the opportunity to seize the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The Guilds would need to do it on their own. They assembled all available Guild members on Stirk and entered Coldharbour.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;The Army of Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe plan quickly fell apart as the force became scattered all over Coldharbour due to Molag Bal's defenses. The Vestige appeared alone and entered an intact, pristine yet abandoned city. They encountered a being called the Groundskeeper, who explained the origin of the city.\nCenturies earlier, the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; had been at war with Molag Bal. Using Daedric artifacts called the Lights of Meridia, she forced a city into Coldharbour, protected by her power so that Molag Bal could neither see into it nor touch it. Inside was a force of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s loyal to her, led by the last King of the Ayleids, &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;. Meridia had foreseen that this safe haven would one day be instrumental in foiling the schemes of the Lord of Brutality. One by one, however, the Ayleids lost faith and left the safety of the Hollow City and were slain. King Dynar himself was eventually captured and imprisoned by Molag Bal's forces.\nThe Vestige then set out to gather the Guilds' assault force and rescued King Dynar, who had been kept alive by Molag Bal in order to torture him. They all assembled in the Hollow City and planned the assault, with King Dynar taking command of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; since their commander had died shortly after arriving. The Vestige also encountered and assisted several villages and settlements that had been sent to Coldharbour for various reasons over the centuries. In exchange, these damned souls agreed to join the force gathering at the Hollow City.\nDespite being separated and arriving alone, Vanus Galerion had set off on his own to destroy the Black Forge, where Dark Anchors were built, and &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Shackle\"&gt;the Great Shackle&lt;/a&gt;, which was powering the Planemeld. He failed and was captured, but was rescued by the Vestige who was then able to destroy both objectives. &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt; assisted and revealed to them they were too late: the Great Shackle had already created a Planar Vortex which was quickly drawing Nirn into Coldharbour faster than ever before. They would need to reach the Planar Vortex and activate the Lights of Meridia within to destroy it.\n&lt;a href=\"Crossing%20the%20Chasm\"&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo reach the Planar Vortex, the Guild force would need to cross The Chasm, a narrow and heavily defend strip of land, and capture the Reaver Citadel. The Vestige leads the charge, closing Daedric reinforcement portals and eventually defeating Molag Grunda, the commander of the Chasm's forces. Upon capturing the Reaver Citadel and the Endless Stair, they then entered the Planar Vortex, where the Groundskeeper revealed herself to be the Daedric Prince Meridia. She assisted the Guild force in closing the Dark Anchors inside the Vortex, but was confronted by Molag Bal at the final Anchor. The two fought one another as Vanus prepared the Lights of Meridia. The Vestige and the remaining Guild forces fought wave after wave of Daedra and Dremora until Vanus finally activated the Lights. The Planar Vortex then collapsed.\n&lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Schemes\"&gt;God of Schemes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige awoke back in the Hollow City's Chapel. Meridia congratulated them on their victory, but informed them that King Dynar had been mortally wounded in the final battle in the Planar Vortex. The Vestige heard the Ayleid King's last words and exited the Chapel, only to find Varen waiting outside informing them the time to reclaim their soul had come. The Five Companions assembled at the Harborage one last time and entered Heart's Grief, the seat of Molag Bal's power in Coldharbour. Within, they found Mannimarco being tortured by undead. After speaking with them, the Vestige was given the choice of freeing the King of Worms or leaving him to his fate. Regardless of their choice, the Five Companions approached the Seat of Tyranny and prepared the ritual. The Vestige then had to choose whether to sacrifice Lyris, Sahan or Varen. Tharn performed the ritual and imbued the Vestige with the power of the Divines. After the ritual, the Vestige glowed with divine golden light and carved a path through countless Daedra and Dremora. Finally, they reached Molag Bal and engaged in combat with the God of Schemes, finally cutting him in half with a blade of golden light.\nThe Vestige was transported to the &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, Meridia's Oblivion realm. The Vestige is reunited with their soul and is told by Meridia that whichever companion they had sacrificed is now part of their soul as well. Molag Bal appeared and spoke with them; calmly explaining that he was impressed with their prowess but that the Vestige had attracted the attention of the other Daedric Princes and that they could not comprehend the politics of Oblivion. Meridia then materialized and told Molag Bal to leave her realm, which he did after one last mockery. Meridia then congratulated the Vestige on their success but that the journey was far from over. She explained that Tharn fled after the ritual with the Amulet of Kings, that he would never be able to use its power for himself but that he would spend many frustrating years trying nonetheless. Meridia then explained the significance of the Vestige, whose task is to unite the peoples of Nirn by seeing the world from their eyes and fighting to unite the people regardless of faction. The Daedric Prince returned the Vestige to the Harborage to bid farewell to the remaining Companions, promising to send an item to help them in their quest to unite Nirn.\nUpon return, Cadwell rewards the Vestige with the weapon of the sacrificed companion, and then provides a single crystal of the Light of Meridia. By touching the crystal, it allows the Vestige to start their quest over in another faction as an unknown drifter, destined to rise again to heroic status through their tasks in the other faction."}
{"id": "938459", "revid": "44917185", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=938459", "title": "Vestige (Essence)", "text": "Vestige, also called Morphotype, is the essence of any &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, analogous of the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen Daedra die, their Vestige returns to their home realm in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, where it gradually accretes &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Creatia\"&gt;Chaotic Creatia&lt;/a&gt; which slowly takes on the form of the Daedra, granting it a new physical form. The same process happens for Daedra who die in their home realm too. However, it is believed that certain realms of existence, specifically realms of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; that are dominated by &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; influence, are not tied to the &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in a manner that allows a slain Vestige to return to its native realm, and thus a Vestige will remain trapped in such a realm should a Daedra be killed in it.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach Soul Shriven is a mortal kidnapped from &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; at the moment of death, his or her soul stolen by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and given in exchange the vestige that enables him or her to form a counterfeit body in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. But they are not native to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, so a Soul Shriven's body is an imitation of the body worn in life, suffering rapid wear and decay until it dies, only for its vestige to form a body once again, over and over, like a Daedra. It is also believed that the lack of an &lt;a href=\"Anuic\"&gt;Anuic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; makes the bodies of the Soul Shriven deformed. Like the Daedra, the Soul Shriven are bound to their home realm of Oblivion, namely &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. However, by absorbing the power of a &lt;a href=\"Skyshard\"&gt;Skyshard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, who is a unique Soul Shriven who was not deformed, could bind themselves to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and reform there upon death. However, it was still believed they were linked to Coldharbour in some manner and depended on it to reform since their soul resided there."}

To try to understand the events that transpired and how I now find myself heading to\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut what do I reflect on? Why, the circumstances that brought me to this point, of course. How\u00a0my brother\u00a0was taken from me. How my family and their damn honor were to blame.

It started when I noticed that some of the other passengers never strayed from the shadows. They kept to the lower levels and the darkest corners of the vessel. After I noticed them, they noticed me. They started talking to me. Telling me to listen to the darkness all around me. To hear the voice of the Mother of Shadows.\nI have half a mind to put my blade through their creepy hooded heads and dump their bodies into the ocean. At least I know I'd sleep better at night. Something has stayed my hand, though. Maybe they're starting to grow on me. Or I've been more lonely than I thought so that even creepy, crazy shadow crawlers are beginning to make good companions. I suppose they have their uses. But this new thing? A voice in the darkness? That's really starting to disturb me.\nNow, it's not like I'm actually hearing voices. Not exactly. But I do find myself talking to myself. And sometimes it feels like someone is listening to me. And, as weird as it is to write this down, sometimes that makes me feel better.\nMaybe I just miss my mother and I'm imagining that I'm talking to her. She was innocent in all of this. I wonder where she is now? I couldn't bear to face her after I killed my father. She had already been through so much, and I didn't want to see the pain my actions\u2014justified though they may have been\u2014had caused her.\nNo, I'm not crazy. I've been having dreams. Dreams filled with talking crows and shadowy creatures. With towers stretching to the stars. These are dreams of darkness and change. Of a chance for a new world.\nWhen I read these words, it seems like I should be afraid, but I'm not. There's a comfort to it all, as strange as that sounds. I think it's the Lady of Shadows. She's kind to me. She listens to me when I speak to her in my dreams. She holds me when I cry. She comforts me.\nThis woman, she is more of a mother to me than my own mother ever was.

He begs that the Nerevarine find out what has happened to his lost sweetheart, promising to give his full support for the Nerevarine if they do this small task for him.\nA tale of two women.\nAt this point there are two options to the Nerevarine. The first is to actually track down Saren, by first speaking to people in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.

Saren, however, will refuse to talk about Ramoran at all, leaving the Nerevarine with nothing more to do than report to Ramoran that Saren is alive and living in Vivec (at which point he will suggest that he will seek her out himself).\nThe second option is to ignore Ramoran's request and instead force him to forget the past. One of Ramoran's bodyguards, &lt;a href=\"Nalvyna%20Sarinith\"&gt;Nalvyna Sarinith&lt;/a&gt;, will act oddly when you speak to her about Ramoran. Should the Nerevarine tell Ramoran of their interpretation of Sarinith's actions (i.e. that she is in love with Ramoran) then Ramoran will accept her attentions and the Nerevarine's work.\nHaving followed either option during the quest, the Nerevarine will receive the support of Ramoran within House Redoran matters from this point forwards."}

She is associated with &lt;a href=\"spiders\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt;, slugs and other repulsive creatures which inspire mortals with an instinctive revulsion. She is also known as the Mistress of Decay, and the Spirit &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. She also is the patron of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s cannibals, taking pleasure in the consumption of &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s. Namira's &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is known as the &lt;a href=\"Scuttling%20Void\"&gt;Scuttling Void&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nOne of the first recorded encounters with Namira is of a tale about a person who had dealt with the Prince sometime in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The person, known as Wheedle, was the 13th child of a king in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. As such Wheedle was in no position to take the throne or even inherit much property or wealth.\nWhile searching for fortune and fame, he met and saved a vagabond who was actually Namira. Recognizing her, he begged to be her apprentice for power and glory. He followed her for 33 days and nights begging at her feet; on the 33rd day Namira revealed that by doing so he had completed the apprenticeship, and thus gave him her power.\nShe gave him three \"blessings\": disease, pity, and disregard. With those \"blessings,\" his name became legendary among the beggars. First, he could choose to have any disease with visible symptoms, but he needed to always have one. He then became a beggar: a terrible beggar who could evoke pity from any passers-by. Finally, Wheedle discovered that the power of disregard gave great access to spoken secrets: people unknowingly said important things where Wheedle could hear them. Wheedle grew to know the comings and goings of every citizen in the city. To this day, it is said that if one really wants to know something, one should ask the beggars, for they have eyes and ears throughout the cities and know all the little secrets of the daily lives of its citizens.\nSecond Era.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Namira\"&gt;Aspect of Namira&lt;/a&gt; appeared in &lt;a href=\"Xal%20Ithix\"&gt;Xal Ithix&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Namira was responsible for the corruption of the xanmeer of Xal Ithix by tainting the Hist's connection and causing the animal inhabitants to become aggressive. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; undid the corruption by stopping the ritual intended to spread Namira's influence further throughout the land by using an object called \"Namira's Hand.\"\nThird Era.\nWhen summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Namira\"&gt;her shrine&lt;/a&gt;, Namira spoke to the champion about the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20One\"&gt;Forgotten One&lt;/a&gt;s, a group of fanatical worshipers that lived in the darkness of the ruin &lt;a href=\"Anga%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; were planning to bring light to Anga and \"save\" the Forgotten Ones. The champion was asked by Namira to use Namira's spell on the priests and let the Forgotten Ones finish them off. When the priests of Arkay were slain, Namira rewarded the champion her ring. The &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt; reflects both spell damage and physical damage.\nFourth Era.\nDuring the Fourth Era, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; encountered a group of cannibals who worshipped Namira. The cannibals wished to kill and eat a &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Verulus\"&gt;priest of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn either killed the priest and was rewarded with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt; or slaughtered the cult of cannibals. While the ring is worn, &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; is increased and the wearer can feast on the dead, which provides increased &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Health regeneration.\nInvocation.\nThe summoning date of Namira is 9th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;. Namira can also be summoned at her shrine by someone repulsive; she does not like attractive people.\nDaedric artifact.\nNamira's artifact is the aptly named &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt;. To acquire it in , the Hero must complete the &lt;a href=\"Namira%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Shrine of Namira quest&lt;/a&gt;. In , the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must complete \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Taste%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Taste of Death&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, and side with &lt;a href=\"Eola\"&gt;Eola&lt;/a&gt;. The rings in each game have different enchantments. "}

If they are to get their help, they will need to make themselves less attractive to others.\nWalkthrough.\nObtain a means by which the Hero's &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt; can be lowered below 20. A simple way to do this to obtain enough &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Wine\"&gt;Cheap Wine&lt;/a&gt; which lowers Personality by 10 per bottle, but there are other methods, see &lt;a href=\"Namira%20%28Quest%29%23Trivia\"&gt;Trivia&lt;/a&gt; below. Then, head for the &lt;a href=\"Namira%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt;, which is east and slightly south out of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; and northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ruby%20Cave\"&gt;Red Ruby Cave&lt;/a&gt;. On arriving, talk to &lt;a href=\"Hjolfrodi%20the%20Harrier\"&gt;Hjolfrodi&lt;/a&gt;, who informs the Hero that they are far too appealing to worship at the shrine and sends them away.\nOnce the Personality is down to 20 or lower and talk to the Hjolfrodi again, who will now let the Hero through to talk to the Daedric Prince.\nAt the shrine.\nNamira wants the Hero to help out a flock of her followers, called The Forgotten Ones, who are holding up at the nearby &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anga%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anga&lt;/a&gt; presumably because the worshippers prefer the darkness. Unfortunately for them, a group of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;'s priests have turned up to try and help the Forgotten Ones find their way back to the light.\nNamira tasks the Hero with finding each priest and gives the Hero an &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; spell called \"&lt;a href=\"Namira%27s%20Shroud\"&gt;Namira's Shroud&lt;/a&gt;\" to cast on the priests, one by one, which will cause the Forgotten Ones to attack and kill the priests. Leave the shrine and head due south to the ruin.\nAnga.\nOnce inside, start looking for the priests as indicated on the compass. When one is found, cast the spell on them. Immediately they're set upon by several of Namira's followers, who'll dispatch them with ease.\nRepeat casting the spell on the priests until all four have been taken down. Namira's spell must be used on the priests, otherwise the quest will fail.\nIn the corridor on the east side of the ruin is a push button that opens the square room just beyond it. This room contains two leveled undead and a leveled chest. There is a floor plate in this room that opens the wall on the other side. Thus, an alternative is to let the undead kill the priests, once they are released from the sealed room. If the Hero of Kvatch leads the creatures on a chase past the characters, the outcome of four dead priests is more likely. The reward from Namira is the same, as long as it was the creatures, not the Hero, who killed the priests. However, the quest will also fail if the Hero kills any of the Forgotten. This can happen if one of them takes damage aimed for a priest or undead and becomes aggressive.\nReward.\nHead back to Namira's shrine and talk to her again. She'll reward the Hero with the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Namira%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ring of Namira&lt;/a&gt;, which has &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Reflect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20Spell\"&gt;Reflect Spell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; on it. Note that Namira does not care what the Hero's personality is at this time, only when the quest is given, which is why temporary lowerings (e.g., drain effects) work and damage effects are not required."}

The explanation for my confusion is simple: this place was indeed constructed in a more recent period, but its inhabitants were primarily ancient: this was the site of powerful necromantic experiments - from the look of things, the subjects of these experiments were the most ancient Ayleid kings!\nHaving made this discovery, I thought at once to return to the suface and report my findings. Only, when I tried to return to the way I came, I found it blocked. I thought for certain I was trapped, when one of the ancient spirits of this place suddenly appeared to me.

She is known for being a crisp countess, ruthless in negotiations and cunning in thought. During the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, she played a crucial role in the events that led to the Second Battle of Bruma, allowing &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; to proceed with his plan to allow the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to attack the city. She was also known to be an avid collector of &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; artifacts.\nBackground.\nAt some point during the Third Era, Carvain was named countess of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"County%20Bruma\"&gt;County Bruma&lt;/a&gt;. A somewhat controversial choice, given her &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; heritage and the fact the Bruma was for all intents and purposes &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; country, but she proved herself an able ruler in time. Despite this, some among the nobility of Cyrodiil still held misgivings about her.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Carvain found her county host to the last surviving heir to the throne and the only person capable of saving &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;: Martin Septim. Hidden in &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; in the mountains north of Bruma, Martin was secretly orchestrating a means of defeating the Daedric hordes and ending the Crisis. Bruma was inevitably caught in the middle, becoming a focal point for the war. The &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric cult behind the Oblivion Crisis, planned to attack the city in an effort to corner Martin at Cloud Ruler. The Blades notified Carvain of this, and she responded accordingly.\nTowards the end of the Crisis, Bruma was to finally come under full attack from the Daedra. Martin's plan of defeating them involved allowing the Mythic Dawn to proceed with the attack. Carvain was informed of Martin's plan by his champion, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, a singular figure in the war. Though hesitant to risk Bruma's destruction, Carvain agreed to the plan, accepting that if Bruma fell, so would the Empire. She met with Martin for a council of war to finalize the plans, then ordered the gates of Bruma closed and the city's troops deployed. The Second Battle of Bruma, though costly in terms of life, was ultimately a success, and Bruma was saved from destruction. Carvain allowed for a statue to be erected in Bruma commemorating the hero of the battle, the Hero of Kvatch.\nPersonality and traits.\nNarina Carvain was described as \"a cunning and ruthless negotiator.\" She was considered truly politically adept, although aloof and cold as her county. She was also a very religious person, known to be a dutiful &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;goer. Despite her political prowess however, she also knew when the time for words was over, and when desperate action was needed, going against the advice of even her top military advisors, such as &lt;a href=\"Guard%20Captain\"&gt;Guard Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt;. Carvain also possessed a talent for reading others, as displayed when she first met the Hero of Kvatch. She detected that the Hero truly was just that, a person who could inspire and lead others to victory, though the Hero never responded to her claims.\nNarina was a known scholar and collector of Akaviri antiquities. In her throne room, she had on display ancient &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Katana\"&gt;Akaviri katanas&lt;/a&gt; and shields, and she even carried an Akaviri katana on her person, suggesting some skill with the blade. At one point, she hired the services of an adventurer, who may or may not have been the Hero of Kvatch, to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Draconian%20Madstone\"&gt;Draconian Madstone&lt;/a&gt; from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; in the north.\nDialogue.\n\"Welcome to Bruma Castle.

And I am quite new to this notion of being heir to the throne. Thank you for coming. I know I am asking for a great deal of trust. But this is the only way. I would not suggest it otherwise.\"\nCountess Narina Carvain: \"Your champion has already explained the situation to me. I have agreed to it. We will not win this war through caution.\"\nMartin Septim: \"You have a rare gift, to know when desperation is the path of wisdom. I will do everything in my power to defend your city, my Lady.\"\nCountess Narina Carvain: \"If Bruma falls, the Empire falls with us. So be it.\"\nDefending Bruma.\nCountess Narina Carvain: \"Burd!

The &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Kinhouse\"&gt;Hlaalu Kinhouse&lt;/a&gt; is the seat of political power in Narsis and it is located on the northern end of the city. The Narsis Bazaar is located on the western end of town, and it is where all the magic happens in Narsis, all of the trade occurs in the merchant corner.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth Ash-King&lt;/a&gt; advanced from the northwest, past modern-day &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Virak\"&gt;Fort Virak&lt;/a&gt; to eventually arrive onto the westernmost bank of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zabamat\"&gt;Zabamat&lt;/a&gt;. Scouts came back to Wulfharth with news that the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i forces had left Narsis to join the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the Nords. The conflict eventually moved to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; commenced.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20559\"&gt;2E 559&lt;/a&gt;, House Hlaalu and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; advanced beyond their political borders and had several disputes near the border to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The battle between the two Great Houses was memorable for its scope and its casualties. Narsis' Hlaalu wanted to build a trading post in disputed territory while &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;'s Dres did not want to see the light of day. House Dres sent a militia of Dres mercenaries that surrounded the Hlaalu Workers. &lt;a href=\"Purilla%20Falen\"&gt;Purilla Falen&lt;/a&gt; of the Hlaalu Guard defended the outpost and used the only mage there to build a portal to Narsis for reinforcements. Falen's Guard managed to hold the Dres back until the Narsis Merchant-Warriors came pouring into the trading post and defeated the Dres Mercenaries. Purilla Falen was honored by the Council of House Hlaalu and died in combat.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt; has swept throughout the Deshaan Countryside and had affected many settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Serkamora\"&gt;Serkamora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muth%20Gnaar\"&gt;Muth Gnaar&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Narsis went into lockdown to avoid the spread of the plague into Narsis. &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Ralden\"&gt;Councilor Ralden Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giron%20Sadri\"&gt;Giron Sadri&lt;/a&gt; were in charge of the situation and noticed a sudden decrease in people living in Narsis. Before the lockdown, many residents fled to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; to escape the plague but when the lockdown occurred, the resident count should have remained stagnant, but it started to decrease when people began to go missing. A mysterious traveler that was known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; appeared in Narsis and was ordered by Ralden to investigate the situation.\nThe Vestige and an &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian%20%28Online%29\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; discovered a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Cult known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Maulborn\"&gt;the Maulborn&lt;/a&gt; on the eastern shores of Lake Hlaalu, dumping a strange concoction known as Plague Husk Scent into the lake. This was to destroy Narsis' water supply. It was later revealed that Giron Sadri was allied with the Maulborn and deliberately brought the Llodos Plague into Narsis. The Vestige encountered Sadri in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Narsis%20Ruins\"&gt;Narsis Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and defeated him in combat. Narsis was saved from the Llodos Plague, but the Plague Husk Scent was tested on Narsis to be eventually used in Mournhold. The &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; was notified and advanced to the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Gorge\"&gt;Obsidian Gorge&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the creator of the plague, &lt;a href=\"Merdyndril\"&gt;Merdyndril&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Narsis was one of the eight major kingdoms in Morrowind, and it was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Vermothah\"&gt;Queen Vermothah&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ministry began to fall in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;False Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; disappeared without a trace, but it was kept in the air by a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;. The device was built by &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Lord Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, and it was powered by souls. A woman named &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt; was taken to power the Ingenium, but her lover, &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt; prevented this and inadvertently damaged the Ingenium, resulting in the Ministry dropping onto Vivec City. The meteor destroyed Vivec City and killed many citizens living in the city; the impact left a huge crater that filled up with water that became known as the &lt;a href=\"Scathing%20Bay\"&gt;Scathing Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The destruction shook the entirety of Morrowind and affected locations far from Vvardenfell. The area around Narsis was suspiciously quiet until after the Ministry crashed onto Vivec and the region was hit by a series of tremors."}

Back for another tale of the amazing Narsis Dren? Of course you are. Why else would you be here, right now, holding this exceptionally crafted tale? Let's get to it, shall we?\nI was investigating an ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; barrow, searching for the Glittering Garters of Gwenyld the Gauche (or something along those lines) when I stumbled upon an ominous lever that opened a hidden door. Now, I wasn't exactly sure what the lever was going to do when I pulled it, but you know my motto\u2014Leave a lever, lose a lord. (Trust me, it makes a lot more sense in the original &lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleidoon&lt;/a&gt;.) A hidden door slid open when I activated the lever, revealing a secret room that had thus far eluded even the most determined tomb robbers. (Tomb robbers, by the way, tend to be reticent when it comes to pulling ominous levers. That's why Narsis Dren is better than they are. It's all about the bravery.)\nThe secret room was a spacious affair, full of funeral finery and relics from a forgotten age. One item that stood out was a ring of pure iron, covered in Nord runes. It was probably small for a Nord's thick fingers, but it seemed nearly large enough to fit upon my &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; wrist. I slipped the ring into my pack and turned to examine the rest of the chamber, immediately noticing the massive sarcophagus placed strategically in the center of the room. It was all carved stone with inlaid jewels and Nordic runes that matched those decorating the iron ring. Obviously, this was the final resting place for an important &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl&lt;/a&gt;, king, or even a dragon priest. My mind boggled at the possibilities of what awaited inside that stone coffin. But I have learned from experience never to reach blindly into the honey pot. Instead, I carefully studied the sarcophagus, looking for any noticeable traps. When a visual inspection failed to reveal anything out of the ordinary, I began to gingerly examine the seam where the great stone lid met the deeper casket. Using my handy collection of picks and probing rods, I tested the entire circumference of the lip of the lid. Nothing.\nIs that when I finally hefted the lid to peer inside? Not so fast, devoted reader! I had one more investigation to make before I opened the tempting sarcophagus. I had to study the intriguing runes that covered the lid. I suspected they dated back to at least the Neo-Meadic era of Nord history, and perhaps even older. The trick to decipher old runes is finding one or two bits that you recognize and starting your translation with them. In this case, I spotted a rune that looked remarkably like the current pictograph for \"foul\" or \"stink.\" Beside it was a symbol I was certain meant \"spell\" or perhaps \"&lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\" So, at least a portion of the intricate runes said something along the lines of \"foul spell\" or \"stinky magic.\" I deciphered the rest of the runes without even needing to read them. It proclaimed that the sarcophagus was protected by an ancient Nord curse of the most odorous kind.\nCurses, however, have never hindered the great Narsis Dren! Yours truly has defeated all sorts of assorted tomb guardians, insidious traps, and hostile rivals. What's an ancient Nord curse to someone as amazingly competent as me? Not worth worrying about, I assure you! I was neither frightened by the curse nor dissuaded from pursuing my usual course. I placed both hands upon the sarcophagus lid as I prepared to slide the heavy stone aside. That's when a strange and not terribly unpleasant tingle ran up and down my arms and a bright white light filled my eyes. When the light faded, I found myself inside a cramped, cold space, surrounded by dry stone and total darkness. Somehow, I wound up inside the still-sealed sarcophagus! Perhaps I had dismissed the threat of the curse a tad too soon.\n\"Hello,\" I said hopefully. \"Is there anyone out there?\" I knew that there wasn't. My lackadaisical assistant was outside, lounging around our campfire and probably drinking deeply from my most expensive flask of &lt;a href=\"flin\"&gt;flin&lt;/a&gt;. At least there wasn't a body inside the stone coffin with me. That would have been awkward. I pushed with all my might, but the lid wouldn't budge. Now, lesser men would crumble at a moment like this, but Narsis Dren is not a lesser man. Quite the opposite. He's a better than lesser man! When I get into situations like this, I always ask myself, \"Self, what would Narsis Dren do?\" And then it came to me. The iron ring! Its runes matched those on the sarcophagus. There had to be a connection. I strained to reach my pack, then dug around until I found the iron ring.\nI drew the ring out of my pack, holding it firmly with determination and dramatic purpose. I touched the ring to the stone lid. Nothing happened. I admit, that was a little disappointing. With a sigh, I slipped the large ring onto the second and third fingers of my left hand. I said the word \"Open\" out loud, annunciating the syllable over and over as I worked my way through every language I knew. Again, nothing. Now I was beginning to become disheartened. I made a fist and touched the lid with the ring while rapping my forehead upon the cool stone three times in fast succession. Why? Oh, just chalk it up to the old Narsis Dren instinct. Another flash of white light obscured my vision. When it cleared, I was standing outside the sarcophagus, back in the secret chamber.\nThe moral of my story? Avoid tempting sarcophaguses at all costs. They're usually more trouble than they're worth."}

To be fair, I told her to remain at our camp, but that's rarely stopped her from following me before. Now she decides to listen to me! Ah well. I've recorded my own thoughts before. Back before I became the famous and beloved explorer I am today. It might even be fun!\nI've been wandering around in this damn barrow for hours! I've seen all kinds of interesting, old Nord relics, and the place is just filled with crypts and stone coffins, but I haven't seen hide nor hair of the real prize I expect to find in this barrow\u2014a dragon priest mask! From the evidence I've been able to examine, I'm certain that a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dragon priest&lt;/a&gt; is somehow associated with this misplaced burial pit. After all, why else would the Nords build this place so far from their beloved Skyrim? I need to search a bit more before I call it a day.\nWell, that was unexpected. I'm not exactly sure what I touched, but I must have done something. The Nord dead have started to wake up! They're &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;! And do you know how much I hate draugr? Well, I really do hate them\u2014almost as much as my servant &lt;a href=\"Borfree%20Dull-Blade\"&gt;Borfree&lt;/a&gt; hates &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;! I need to get out of here and figure out a new strategy. And I guess I should warn the nearby village. Just to be polite."}

Naryu's exploits have inadvertently saved countless lives throughout the provinces, such as ending the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; and the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Sweetroll%20Killer\"&gt;Sweetroll Killer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nDark Elf women are often known to be flirtatious and promiscuous, Naryu included; she is known as the \"the Beautiful Darkness.\" Naryu Virian is an agent of the Morag Tong, and uses her soft-spoken feminine voice to coerce people into spilling information or into doing her bidding. However, she is also a ruthless and cunning assassin with a reputation larger than her guild, and completes every writ by any means possible. Naryu also has a free-will attitude and a dark sense of humor, appreciating even the creepiest and foreboding of things. However, she still has a softer side in regard to close friends and allies.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly Life &amp; Exploits in the Morag Tong.\nNaryu Virian was born in the province of Morrowind, to &lt;a href=\"Mjahlar%20Virian\"&gt;Mjahlar Virian&lt;/a&gt;, a well-respected member of the Morag Tong. At one point, Mjahlar took in an orphaned child named &lt;a href=\"Odral%20Quintayn\"&gt;Odral Quintayn&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Mjahlar sponsored both Naryu and Odral in the Morag Tong, who trained with each other throughout the years. Naryu trained under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Varon%20Davel\"&gt;Varon Davel&lt;/a&gt;, a senior member of the guild. Her father retired soon after, leaving for &lt;a href=\"Vounoura\"&gt;Vounoura&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Her time in the Morag Tong had garnered the attention of several of their assassins, including &lt;a href=\"Ashur%20of%20the%20Quiet%20Blade\"&gt;Ashur of the Quiet Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the few who sought to train her, though past it to Davel. During her training, she was observed by the young nobles of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Veya%20Releth\"&gt;Veya Releth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulran%20Releth\"&gt;Ulran Releth&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom have grown to admire her. As time went on, Naryu rose through the ranks of the Morag Tong, completing writs with relative ease. She had also begun to experiment in her killing methods, using the usual knife and garrote in addition to items in arms-reach like stew pots and even a copy of the &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2024\"&gt;Twenty-Fourth Sermon of Vivec's Lessons&lt;/a&gt;. She is incredibly resourceful and takes an opportunity that comes her way. Her reputation had eventually surpassed Morrowind, bringing attention to the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt;. The two eventually came together but were eventually estranged.\nThe Llodos Plague in Deshaan &amp; the Maulborn.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the region of Deshaan was afflicted with the &lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt;, which had rapidly spread across the western grazelands. Both Naryu Virian and Varon Davel were dispatched to uncover the source of this plague, ending up in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;, which had been blockaded to prevent the disease from moving into the city. &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Ralden\"&gt;Councilor Ralden&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Narsis, had also hired the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to uncover the source, who had also reported to &lt;a href=\"Giron%20Sadri\"&gt;Giron Sadri&lt;/a&gt;, an advisor of the Councilor. Naryu followed the Vestige to a &lt;a href=\"Maulborn\"&gt;Maulborn&lt;/a&gt; camp at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Lake Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, where she revealed that Giron was actually a Maulborn agent that hoped to have the Vestige killed at the camp to cover his tracks \u2014 though this failed when the two decided to team up. In the end, the two were able to uncover Giron Sadri's plot to poison Narsis, promptly executing the Maulborn agent. This would be the first time the pair would work together, eventually blossoming into a strong relationship. However, the Llodos Plague continued to spread towards &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, and so the two would work together to prevent the plague from passing through the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Gorge\"&gt;Obsidian Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, with help from &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mournhold Investigation &amp; the Maulborn's Plot.\nThe battle at Obsidian Gorge was fought between House Hlaalu and the Maulborn under the command of &lt;a href=\"Merdyndril\"&gt;Merdyndril&lt;/a&gt;. Maulborn had set up barriers within the ruins, which had protected them from the plague. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Diiril\"&gt;Captain Diiril&lt;/a&gt; utilized archers to destroy the crates in the lower basin, which contained the disease. Naryu ordered the archers to fire from a cliff while the Vestige defended them from the Maulborn horde. Eventually, the plague was released throughout the Gorge, with many being killed by it. Naryu had fortunately escaped the Gorge before it could affect her, but the Vestige remained, murdering Merdyndril in the ancient ruins. With the antidote in hand, the diseased were cured, and the Llodos Plague was ended, though the Maulborn still intends to attack Mournhold, especially with the sudden influx of visitors. And so, Naryu and the Vestige team up to uncover the Maulborn, beginning with the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; stationed on the outskirts of the city. Through coercion, the two were lead to the Mournhold Underground, where they discovered a large militia of Maulborn that intend to raid the city for &lt;a href=\"Veloth%27s%20Judgement\"&gt;Veloth's Judgement&lt;/a&gt;. Before they were able to escape, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; appeared herself, exterminating the Maulborn. With the plague dealt with and the Maulborn threat over in Mournhold. Naryu left Deshaan to continue her writs, but this would not be the last time she would see the Vestige.\nDiplomatic Dilemma in Eastmarch; Contract: Dhalen.\nSometime later, Naryu is dispatched to the frozen region of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim along with a writ to kill &lt;a href=\"Dhalen\"&gt;Dhalen&lt;/a&gt;, a Breton alchemist that experiments with &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; magic. Dhalen was situated in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Fort Amol&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; were gathering. And so Naryu tagged along with the Dunmeri delegation with &lt;a href=\"General%20Yeveth%20Noramil\"&gt;General Yeveth Noramil&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmeri leader of the Pact. Around this time, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;'s brother &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Strong-Prince\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt; had resurfaced, interrupting the &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt; and posing a threat to both his brother and the Pact. It was at this point she reunited with the Vestige, whom she worked with to uncover the suspicious action in Fort Amol. Eventually, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vurlop\"&gt;Lord Vurlop&lt;/a&gt; of Amol had betrayed the Pact, allowing Dhalen to poison Jorunn with the foulest of magic. With Dhalen and Vurlop dead, the Pact needed to save the king. Naryu's contract was complete, and so she parted ways with her friend, continuing her usual work.\nThe Seven Secretives; Contract: Vonos Bero &amp; Rythe Verano.\nAs time went on, the Morag Tong had grown exponentially, being used frequently within Dunmeri society, ever since the eventful assassination of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;. Naryu Virian had taken upon the honorable writs issued by Grandmaster &lt;a href=\"Rythe%20Verano\"&gt;Rythe Verano&lt;/a&gt;. Virian was to assassinate members of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Secretives\"&gt;Seven Secretives&lt;/a&gt;, high-ranking members of the Morag Tong that have betrayed their brethren, or so she was told. Later that night, Naryu rummaged through Verano's office, learning of the Grandmaster's plot against the Seven, using them as a scapegoat for his crimes. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boldekh\"&gt;Boldekh&lt;/a&gt;, Naryu assassinated Rythe at the grotto of &lt;a href=\"Mudan%20Ruins\"&gt;Mudan Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. Naryu took his skull with her as she assassinated the Seven Secretives. Its members were scattered throughout Tamriel, and so Virian traveled the &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt;, beginning in her homeland of Vvardenfell with her first contact, &lt;a href=\"Vonos%20Bero\"&gt;Vonos Bero&lt;/a&gt;, son of a &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; noble. Bero had traveled all over the island, taking up various identities such as \"Ulamadash the Merry Tinker\", evading Naryu. Eventually, he had reached the northeastern edge of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, taking refuge in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bthuand\"&gt;Bthuand&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, Bero was killed by Nayru, who would leave Vvardenfell for the distant wastelands of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, where she would have to confront her second target.\nThe Seven Secretives; Contracts: Odral Quintayn &amp; Vuldronu Oth.\nNaryu arrived in Craglorn through the township of &lt;a href=\"Belkarth\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt;, after taking a caravan via the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstar%20Caravan%20Company\"&gt;Dragonstar Caravan Company&lt;/a&gt;. Her next target was Odral Quintayn, her adoptive brother and well-versed alchemist of the Morag Tong. Quintayn was hidden within the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;, a group in Upper Craglorn that followed &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Malazar, the Serpent Constellation&lt;/a&gt;, taking the name of \"Menden Flot\" and becoming the Regent of Roiling Concoctions. Quintayn had involved himself in the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mantikora\"&gt;Mantikora&lt;/a&gt;. Naryu swiftly dispatched him after the birth of the Mantikora. With Quintayn dead, she traveled to the east beyond &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. There, Naryu killed &lt;a href=\"Vuldronu%20Oth\"&gt;Vuldronu Oth&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken refuge amidst the chaos of the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, within the throne room of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. With both women disguised as &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; warriors, Naryu killed Oth as she passed behind a pillar. She caught the books Oth had been carrying and dissolved them outside in a pit of &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Plasm\"&gt;Azure Plasm&lt;/a&gt;. With three down, Naryu took to the northern wastes of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Seven Secretives; Contracts: Rels &amp; Myvryna Llothri.\nNaryu traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Stronghold\"&gt;Morkul Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in Wrothgar, which had the only dropbox in Wrothgar for the Morag Tong. Her target was the husband-wife team of &lt;a href=\"Rels%20Llothri\"&gt;Rels Llothri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Myvryna%20Llothri\"&gt;Myvryna Llothri&lt;/a&gt;. The couple had no idea about an assassin tracking the Seven Secretives, and so Rels traversed all of Wrothgar, leaving &lt;a href=\"Pariah%20Scamps\"&gt;Pariah Scamps&lt;/a&gt; while Myvryna had left for &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Naryu traveled all throughout Eastern Wrothgar, from the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt; to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zthenganaz\"&gt;Zthenganaz&lt;/a&gt; until she had finally caught him in &lt;a href=\"Paragon%27s%20Remembrance\"&gt;Paragon's Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;, where Rels was hidden among the &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20Fanatics\"&gt;Malacath Fanatics&lt;/a&gt;. Rels had the upper hand on Naryu, attempting the \"&lt;a href=\"Crescendo%20on%20the%20Fiddle\"&gt;Crescendo on the Fiddle&lt;/a&gt;\" technique on her neck, but Naryu succeeded in using \"&lt;a href=\"Gutting%20the%20Trout\"&gt;Gutting the Trout&lt;/a&gt;.\" Naryu narrowly escaped and traveled to Orsinium, where Myvryna took on the persona of an &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;. She was a master of disguise, taking the name of \"Algutha gra-Varda\" and working at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Orsimer%20Glories\"&gt;House of Orsimer Glories&lt;/a&gt;. Myvryna had taken the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt; from the house, which was mistakenly called the Helm of Kharag gro-Khar. With the helm, Myvryna fled to the north at the &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Knoll\"&gt;Bloody Knoll&lt;/a&gt;, where Naryu killed her. With the couple dead, Naryu traveled south to the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Seven Secretives; Contract: Tlera Verano.\nNaryu Virian landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Hew%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Hew's Bane&lt;/a&gt; via the smuggler's hideout of &lt;a href=\"Shark%27s%20Teeth%20Grotto\"&gt;Shark's Teeth Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, with a writ to kill &lt;a href=\"Tlera%20Verano\"&gt;Tlera Verano&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the Morag Tong Grandmaster. Verano was last seen in this region, residing in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. Virian disguised herself as a Redguard laborer, scoping out the entire city from the sewers to the streets for the guild's chief accountant. Her search first took her to &lt;a href=\"Hubalajad%20Palace\"&gt;Hubalajad Palace&lt;/a&gt; and eventually the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Den%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Den&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the local &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. It was here at the Den, Naryu discovered Tlera dead, only to find out that it was a body-double, meant to stop her in her tracks. Naryu found a journal in Tlera's shop, which described her desire for the &lt;a href=\"Aurbical%20Abacus\"&gt;Aurbical Abacus&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact belonging to &lt;a href=\"Khoshira\"&gt;Khoshira&lt;/a&gt;, Priestess of &lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt; and sister-in-law to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Hubalajad\"&gt;Prince Hubalajad&lt;/a&gt;. She was buried in the catacombs of &lt;a href=\"Bahraha%27s%20Gloom\"&gt;Bahraha's Gloom&lt;/a&gt;, the Hubalajad family tomb. It is here the Abacus was found and where Tlera Verano would also be found. Deep in the tomb, Naryu encountered Tlera and a &lt;a href=\"Mournful%20Aegis\"&gt;Mournful Aegis&lt;/a&gt;. With the Aegis tearing Verano to shreds, Naryu smashed the Abacus and left Hammerfell for the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Seven Secretives; Contract: Dathus Ildram.\nAt the time of Naryu's arrival, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; had begun to make their appearance well known, bringing the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Hour\"&gt;Order of the Hour&lt;/a&gt; and killing &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. Naryu had traveled to the local outlaws refuge, where she was eventually led to clues about her next target, &lt;a href=\"Dathus%20Ildram\"&gt;Dathus Ildram&lt;/a&gt;, who posed as a &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; agent to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Naryu had learned of the Brotherhood's presence in the Gold Coast, even meeting the Vestige from back in Eastmarch. Naryu needed to kill Ildram at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Kvatch\"&gt;Castle Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, but did not want the attention going to her and the Morag Tong. And so, she tasked her friend with infiltrating Castle Kvatch with her, allowing her to kill him and have her friend take the glory for the Brotherhood. With Ildram dead, the two went their separate ways, but Naryu learned that Ildram in Kvatch was a body-double, with the real one still at large. And so, Naryu followed her lovely vagabond to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, to find more, only to be encountered by &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Terenus\"&gt;Speaker Terenus&lt;/a&gt;. Terenus would then point the way to the &lt;a href=\"Enclave%20of%20the%20Hourglass\"&gt;Enclave of the Hourglass&lt;/a&gt;, where Ildram was hiding and only to leave for &lt;a href=\"Knightsgrave\"&gt;Knightsgrave&lt;/a&gt;. It was there, Virian killed Ildram and ended the Seven Secretives. Naryu Virian would return to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, to hand in the contracts. But before this, she had some more business on the Gold Coast, with her darling friend and another long-time friend.\nThe Sweetroll Killer &amp; the Foreboding Future.\nA serial killer dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Sweetroll%20Killer\"&gt;Sweetroll Killer&lt;/a&gt; had begun to appear throughout the Gold Coast, leaving a &lt;a href=\"Sweetroll\"&gt;Sweetroll&lt;/a&gt; as their calling card. The killer leaves a Sweetroll to their victims, letting them know that they are targeted. Naryu was given a Sweetroll, leading her to investigate the matter. She had left notes throughout Kvatch to lure the killer out of hiding, but failed. Her friend and &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt; agent, &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt;, followed her message to her safe house, where they confronted each other. Naryu was surprised to see her friend, and they threatened each other with death until they understood their motives. Razum-dar and Naryu reunited, deciding to work with their mutual friend on uncovering the Sweetroll Killer. After several steps, the three encountered the killer, &lt;a href=\"Louna%20%28Dunmer%29\"&gt;Louna&lt;/a&gt;, at her farmstead outside of Anvil. Louna was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Fate-Bearers\"&gt;Fate-Bearers&lt;/a&gt;, a group that can look towards the future, and kill all the people that would cause the world's demise. Louna told Naryu that her daughter would lead to the world's destruction, hence why she was given a sweetroll. Louna's fate was dealt with by Naryu's friend, but it is unknown whether she was spared or killed. But regardless, the Sweetroll Killer's spree was over, and Naryu returned to Vvardenfell.\nThe Death of Ulran Releth &amp; Veya's Wrath.\nNaryu returned to Vvardenfell at a bad time, as &lt;a href=\"Ulran%20Releth\"&gt;Ulran Releth&lt;/a&gt; had been exiled by &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and his sister &lt;a href=\"Veya%20Releth\"&gt;Veya Releth&lt;/a&gt; needed help finding her brother. Naryu had inducted Veya into the Morag Tong, considering her skills with a blade, and so was under Naryu's supervision. Veya went into hiding, first at the cavern of &lt;a href=\"Mallapi\"&gt;Mallapi&lt;/a&gt;, while Naryu continued her writs and investigated the situation. While assassinating &lt;a href=\"Curate%20Sneg\"&gt;Curate Sneg&lt;/a&gt; at the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ashurnibibi\"&gt;Ashurnibibi&lt;/a&gt;, Naryu encountered the Vestige, who was hired by &lt;a href=\"Eris%20Releth\"&gt;Eris Releth&lt;/a&gt; to find his daughter. Despite their times together, Naryu needed to trust her friend before letting them meet with Veya. After retrieving a registry in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, Naryu felt that they were trustworthy, and so her friend was able to meet Veya. While the two were talking, Naryu entered Mallapi, telling them that they need to leave, as the &lt;a href=\"Ferhara%27s%20Warclaws%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Warclaws&lt;/a&gt; were close. Naryu stayed behind in case the Warclaws entered. Eventually, the three reunited on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Kudanat%20Mine\"&gt;Kudanat Mine&lt;/a&gt;, where the both the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s and Ulran resided in. Deep in the mine, the three discovered Ulran's corpse as well as a &lt;a href=\"Memory%20Stone\"&gt;Memory Stone&lt;/a&gt;, which led to further investigation into this plot against Ulran.\nSometime later, Naryu received a writ for &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Dolvara%20Arenim\"&gt;Councilor Dolvara Arenim&lt;/a&gt;, who was meeting illegally with both &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; to bring about &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; in Pact territory. Veya was convinced that Dolvara had intel on Ulran, and so she sent their mutual friend to help Naryu in the mission. Fortunately, Naryu knew that Veya would convince them to come, and so she waited for them, going about their mission and encountering Dolvara. It was revealed that Ulran was murdered by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Brivan\"&gt;Captain Brivan&lt;/a&gt;, as a loyalty test to House Redoran and that the test was commissioned by both Veya and Ulran's father, Eris Releth. Because of this, Veya was hellbent on killing Eris, escaping the hideout in Balmora to deal with both Brivan and Eris. Both Naryu and the mutual followed suit, being able to incapacitate Veya, but could not save both Eris and Brivan. Before the three could leave, &lt;a href=\"High%20Councilor%20Meriath\"&gt;High Councilor Meriath&lt;/a&gt; offered them a proposition, to keep this under the rug and never bring it up again. With &lt;a href=\"Ashur\"&gt;Ashur&lt;/a&gt; healing Veya, Naryu was left with the grim choice of either killing Veya or sending her away to make amends. Veya's fate is unknown, but what happened in Balmora had finally been resolved. Sometime later when her friend defeated &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, Naryu was invited to the ceremony at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; himself congratulated both her friend and &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;. This was the last time both Naryu and the Vestige would see each other, both contemplating their future and Naryu confessing her affection towards her friend. Naryu continued her career as a Morag Tong assassin.\nLegacy.\nNaryu Virian's exploits have been compared to the legendary hero &lt;a href=\"Investigator%20Vale\"&gt;Investigator Vale&lt;/a&gt;, which is quite accurate as she had helped end the Llodos Plague in Deshaan, saved the king of the Ebonheart Pact, and even ended the spree of the Sweetroll Killer. Naryu's fate is largely unknown, but there are some likely possibilities. It may be assumed that like her father before, Naryu continued through the ranks of the Morag Tong, ultimately retiring in &lt;a href=\"Vounoura\"&gt;Vounoura&lt;/a&gt;, where other Morag Tong agents retired. Throughout her time with her the Vestige, her \"darling vagabond,\" she hints at a quiet life in a cabin in the woods with them, which could have happened, along with her retirement in Vounoura. Although, should Veya's endeavors become revealed to the world, Naryu would be hunted by the Morag Tong since she was responsible for her. Not to mention, Veya killed without a writ. She either died by their hands, or was on the run for the rest of her life.\nLouna's message to Naryu, \"Her fate is the worst of all. Her daughter causes the world to burn. Or she could. The future is a fluid thing,\" refers to Veya Releth, who would eventually arrive at &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Summerset\"&gt;Isle of Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, becoming &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;'s champion. Veya adopted the name of Tundilwen, taking hold of a corrupted version of the &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreaker\"&gt;Dawnbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and using it against her mutual friend, Naryu's \"darling vagabond\" and their friends. Veya was initially killed by the Vestige but was later resurrected in a vile, corrupted shadow form to protect &lt;a href=\"Transparent%20Law\"&gt;Transparent Law&lt;/a&gt; from them. Eventually, both Veya and Nocturnal were defeated when the Vestige stabbed Transparent Law with the Dawnbreaker. Veya's fate is unknown; she could have likely been cast off to &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;, due to her loyalty to Nocturnal. This event was prophecized by the Fate-Bearers, but it, fortunately, did not come to fruition. Whether Naryu learned about the events at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; is unknown."}

Legends tell that when the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; tried to conquer it, the Dwemer submerged the entire city into the sea until the invaders gave up.\nThe workshops in the city were reputed to be capable of assembling a complete automaton in a single day. It has been believed that much of the Dwemer army that fought at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; was constructed in Nchardak.\nLike most of the Dwemers' cities, Nchardak fell into a state of disrepair and ruin after the Dwemers' disappearance. By the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; most of the lower levels of the city have been flooded and bandits have taken up residence in the outer areas.\nSublocations.\nNchardak Great Chamber.\nAfter the main quest the water level can be lowered by taking the cubes from the boilers. On the left path there will be a room that has a centurion sphere and a chest, but also a cube receptacle which will lower the last of the water in the great chamber (provided the other two cubes are already in place at the top of the chamber). While in the main part of the Great Chamber, going right down the ramp in front of the lift and then turning around will reveal a chest underneath it, sitting in the water.\nAt the bottom of the room, a temporary cube receptacle is found which will open a door to a chest. Along the floor, four malachite veins can be found. Underneath the aqueduct door on the map, around a large column base, is a small chest and on the left side there is a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Battleaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven battleaxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nNchardak Workshop.\nReturning after the main quest mission is easier because multiple Dwemer cubes can be brought to lower the water level all the way (which is necessary to reach the lower rooms).\nOn the bottom floor there are some tables with some random Dwemer items, a few weapons, and pieces of armor.\nIn the two side rooms, looking left from the top, a cube receptacle and some more Dwemer items can be seen. To the right are some more Dwarven items.\nNchardak Aqueduct.\nAfter completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;The Path of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;,\" it is possible to return to the great chamber and reinstall the cubes at various locations. The aqueduct can be reached by removing two cubes from the boiler switches, then swimming to the north end of the room, where there is a control switch and a locked door. A control cube is needed to unlock the door. This leads to the aqueduct.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kagrumez%20Resonance%20Gem\"&gt;Kagrumez Resonance Gem&lt;/a&gt; is inside a room with no direct entrance to the east side of the aqueduct. It is possible to get inside by first going to the room on the eastern most side where the Control Pedestal is. From the ledge in front of the control pedestal, another small ledge is visible to the north. After jumping there, the rocks can be used as a stepping point to jump to the platform right above that ledge. There is another control switch that opens the door, and inside there will be a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Ballista%20Master\"&gt;Dwarven Ballista Master&lt;/a&gt;. On the table is the stone, random dwemer items scattered about, and a chest with random loot.\nThere is another door on the eastern side of the room which can be opened if all of the three bridges have been raised."}

After killing the spider, they gain access to Nchuand-Zel. Alternatively, the lock can be picked for access without needing to talk to &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt;. If picked, it is an adept-level lock. The key to Nchuand-Zel can also be pickpocketed from &lt;a href=\"Aicantar\"&gt;Aicantar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe entrance to Nchuand-Zel is a large chamber with several sections. The men working in Nchuand-Zel attempted to block the Falmer from entering the ruins, but the creatures were too strong for the men to hold back. While exploring the Armory, Quarters and Control, the Dragonborn finds notes and journals from the men who were working in the ruins along the way.\nAfter completing \"The Lost Expedition\" and activating the Dwemer defenses, the Dragonborn can witness a short fight between Dwemer Automatons and a few Falmer.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon entering, the Dragonborn will be looking down a small hallway. Go down this hallway\u2014minding the fire trap\u2014and get ready to face a Falmer on the bridge ahead. He can be killed easily with a sneaky shot from a bow. There will be three more Falmer along this bridge. After those two, there are two more Falmer on the bridge before the door. The final two are stronger than the first two.\nNchuand-Zel Quarters.\nWalk down the hall. To the immediate left (east) there are two pieces of scrap metal. To the right there is a mounted Centurion head. Continuing, the Dragonborn will see another Falmer upon rounding the next corner. He will not see them, so they can sneak-kill him easily. Killing him will alert another Falmer, who will subsequently ascend the staircase. Passing the stairs and continuing down the hall, the Dragonborn will meet a single strong Falmer. Keep going and to the right (west) there is an adept-locked gate. Behind it is some scrap metal, random armor pieces, a potion, and a Dwemer chest containing random leveled loot. Down the stairs, the Dragonborn will meet several Falmer. Finish them off and continue. Another Falmer will be positioned atop the small stairway in the next room. Engaging him will alert a couple more who will attack. Finish them off and go up the stairs.\nIn the next room the Dragonborn will be returned to the door to Nchuand-Zel. They must go back the way they came until they find the stairway leading down. Go down the stairway and continue through the hall. Prepare to fight a few Falmer at the next stairwell after looting a couple of dead Falmer. Go up the stairs (beware the fire at the top) and get \"&lt;a href=\"Stromm%27s%20Diary\"&gt;Stromm's Diary&lt;/a&gt;\". There is also a dead Falmer in this area.\nIf the Dragonborn continues down the hallway, they will soon come to two dead Falmer. There is nothing in the next room except poison on the small blood-covered table and a torture trap to play around with (pull the lever on the right of the doorway to activate. It will not hurt the Dragonborn).\nGo back the way from which this area was entered, and go back through the door to Nchuand-Zel. To the left (west) and then left again (south) onto the small platform, is a pathway that can be followed down.\nAt the bottom of the pathway you can turn left (east) to cross a bridge where you will see a Falmer. Head back up to where you just came from and turn left (south) onto another small platform, down to the bottom level where there is an Adept-locked gate with a chest inside. From here you can swim to the Nchuand-Zel Armoury on the west wall.\nNchuand-Zel Armory.\nUpon entering the Armory, the Dragonborn will be met with two Falmer just up the stairs. After dealing with them, head right (north) and battle a stronger Falmer and his pet, a skeever. When they are dead, go left (west) down the stairs (beware the fire trap. It is likely it will not touch the Dragonborn, but any followers will be affected). Turn left again (south) (beware of a spike trap; the spikes will come from the walls of the doorway) and down the small staircase in the doorway. In the next room there are inactive Dwarven Spheres and Dwarven Spiders, as well as the body of a Falmer and Erj. Search his body for his notes. Behind Erj is a chest containing leveled loot. Four gates around this central room can be opened for loot.\nJust back up the small staircase on the right (north) wall the way you came, head forwards up a staircase to find yourselves at a door back to Nchuand-Zel.\nThis door will lead you to a platform where you'll find the body of Krag, which you should search for his journal. There is also the Alteration skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;\" on the bench next to him, and on the bed roll furthest from the door is a sack containing ingredients or food items. Turn left (north) up the path, past an Imperial corpse, to the door to Nchuand-Zel Control.\nNchuand-Zel Control.\nUpon entry, follow the path forward, and when you turn left be careful of the pressure plate (arrow trap) in the middle at the bottom of the ramp. Kill the pair of Falmer at the top and head left (west) down the next hall. Be careful of the spike trap in the doorway and kill the next pair of Falmer in the next room. Turn left (south) and search Staubin's body for his diary.\nContinue on and there are several Dwarven Spiders to battle. Head up the double staircase, and continue around this area. There are two dead Dwarven Spheres carrying varying soul gems and a Falmer to kill. Up a small staircase and to the left (north) there is a small room with a chest to loot, lever to pull and a potion to grab. This lever reactivates the Dwarven automatons in the ruins, which will take out the Falmer so the expedition can go on: now is the time to leave.\nContinue down the hall past the now-opened gate on the right (east) of this room. Head to the end of the path and find an unlocked Dwemer chest. Jump off of this bridge to the lower level and turn south, back out of the entrance door directly by where you land.\nHead up a dark dirt path immediately to the left (north) of the door. From this upper platform you can easily kill the Dwarven Centurion, which was fighting Falmer on Krag's platform since you reactivated it, with long-distance attacks, as it can't climb the path and can't retaliate. Jump back up onto the dirt path to loot the dead Centurion and then return up the dirt path, through the doorway to the left (north), along a corridor to a door back to the Excavation Site.\nRun back to Calcelmo, where telling him about the expedition will reward the player with a leveled amount of ."}

Holding the &lt;a href=\"rank\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Magician\"&gt;Magician&lt;/a&gt;, she is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Cheydinhal Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; during the final years of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. She is skilled in &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; and can &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; others in its use up the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk%23Magic%20Arts\"&gt;novice&lt;/a&gt;-level. Deetsan is connected with the \"&lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Recommendation\"&gt;Cheydinhal Recommendation&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, helping the Hero by giving them the &lt;a href=\"Buoyancy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Buoyancy&lt;/a&gt; spell for free. After events involving the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;'s role as an &lt;a href=\"Associate\"&gt;Associate&lt;/a&gt; of the guild, she becomes the leader of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; division after &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt; is ousted as a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; and is exiled from the guild. Deetsan is considered the most caring of the Cheydinhal mages, and is very friendly to new Associates.\nPersonality.\nMost of the people of Cheydinhal observed that they'd never seen a mage as happy to be in the guild as Deetsan, though she came off as a bit insecure. This insecurity came to light while working under &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the Cheydinhal guild. Falcar, seemingly acting out of sheer cruelty, gave &lt;a href=\"Vidkun\"&gt;Vidkun&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Associate\"&gt;Associate&lt;/a&gt; of the guild, the task of retrieving a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Burden\"&gt;Ring of Burden&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20Well\"&gt;Mages Guild Well&lt;/a&gt;. He left to do the task, and promptly vanished into thin air.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20Recommendation\"&gt;Cheydinhal Recommendation&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeetsan, who had liked Vidkun, worried over him, but refrained from saying anything until Falcar gave the same task to the individual who would later become the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Champion of the Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, in exchange for a recommendation to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to her intervention, providing the Champion with a spell that combined &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; with a mild &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt; effect, they survived. But when she told Falcar she had helped the new Associate and threatened to report him to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council of Mages&lt;/a&gt;, he flew into a rage and stormed out, saying the Guild's days were numbered.\nUpon the return of the Champion from the task, Deetsan apologized profusely for her role in Falcar's disappearance, and hopefully suggested the Champion might find a recommendation in Falcar's room. When the Champion's investigation turned up no recommendation, but instead a pair of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;black soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, Deetsan took the initiative, writing a report to the council and include the Champion's recommendation herself. As a result of this, when the Council formally expelled Falcar, Deetsan was promoted to head of the Cheydinhal branch.\nDialogue.\n\"I'm Deetsan, Magician. Mages Guild, that is.\"\n\"I'm Deetsan, Magician. Mages Guild, that is.\"\nAfter speaking to Falcar:\n\"Good day.\"\nAfter Falcar is out of earshot:\n\"Good day.\"\nAfter obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Burden\"&gt;Ring of Burden&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"I'm afraid some things have happened while you've been gone, Associate. It may affect your recommendation.\"\nAfter finding &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gems&lt;/a&gt; in Falcar's room:\n\"What's this? Black soul gems? Oh, dear. This is worse than I'd expected. All right. I'll just take these from you. I'll need them for my report to the Council. Now, you didn't find any sort of recommendation? Very well. I shall write one myself, and include it in my report to the Council. In light of the circumstances, I believe they'll find it more than adequate.\"\nAfter obtaining all recommendations:\nRecommendation \"You've been through quite a bit, haven't you? Well, I think you have proven yourself worthy. The Arcane University awaits you now. Speak with Raminus Polus when you arrive. He will assist you.\""}

Tell her to meet Martin at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Great Chapel of Talos&lt;/a&gt; to have a war council and prepare for battle. The Countess will accept the plan, and will order her guards to prepare for battle.\nAfter the meeting, follow Martin and his small army out to an area just east of the city. On the way, they pass the citizens of Bruma, who will clap and cheer for Martin as he passes by them.\nGreat Gate site.\nSoon after arriving at the east side of the city, Martin addresses the troops to make a rallying speech before the battle. Smaller gates open behind him and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; will begin to come out of the gates.\nAs soon as Martin has finished his speech, try to eliminate as many Daedra and defend Martin until the Great Gate opens. Three Daedra will spawn from each gate during each wave, and after every second wave another gate is opened.\nIf the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;Allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed, there should be additional good-quality soldiers to keep Martin safe from three increasingly-larger waves of Daedra from the lesser gates and then the Great Gate itself. In some cases, there will even be guard captains assisting in the fight.\nThe Hero can also get some of the &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; Guard to follow, even if they are weak, as they can still distract enemies.\nIn addition, the Hero can get extra backup from any of their followers if the appropriate quests have been completed. These include a Mage Apprentice, a Dark Brotherhood Murderer, a Knight of the Nine and Mazoga the Orc.\nThe Great Gate opens.\nAs soon as the Great Gate opens, run up and enter through it. Be sure to go through as quickly as possible, as entering it will render Martin essential again (provided one completes the next section of the quest in time).\nBe sure to be prepared, as there will not be a second chance later, and the follow-up timed quest inside the Great Gate itself does not allow for much margin of error."}

This is an optional quest for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, and may be skipped once the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; starts the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBackground.\n\"Apparently there's a strange jester near the Loreius Farm, on the road north of Whiterun. It would seem he's transporting a coffin in a cart, but one of the wheels has broken off. It might be worth investigating.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhile traveling north of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn may encounter a peculiar man in a &lt;a href=\"jester%27s%20outfit\"&gt;jester's outfit&lt;/a&gt; with a broken-down cart. It turns out his name is Cicero and he will beseech them to aid him, stating he needs repairs for his wagon wheel to move his \"mother's\" (actually The Night Mother's) corpse to a new burial site. By heading up to &lt;a href=\"Loreius%20Farm\"&gt;Loreius Farm&lt;/a&gt; and speaking with &lt;a href=\"Vantus%20Loreius\"&gt;Vantus Loreius&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn will receive the quest. One can also receive the quest by talking with Cicero first, where he will moan about the broken wagon wheel and tell the player to go find Loreius so he can fix it, or by witnessing &lt;a href=\"Uthgerd%20the%20Unbroken\"&gt;Uthgerd the Unbroken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skulvar%20Sable-Hilt\"&gt;Skulvar Sable-Hilt&lt;/a&gt; speaking of Cicero outside the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Stables\"&gt;Whiterun Stables&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can choose either to report Cicero to the lone &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt; that patrols the road, or persuade Vantus to help him. If the latter is chosen, when Cicero is later encountered at the Dark Brotherhood sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, he will recognize the Dragonborn and compliment them, and will reward them with some gold. Going back to Cicero and telling him he will get help from the farmer will make him very happy and reward the player with some . Alternatively, if they have spoken to Loreius first, the farmer states that he is afraid and suspicious of Cicero, and does not wish to get involved in possibly illegal activities.\nIf helping Vantus, he will also reward them with some for helping him get rid of the troublesome jester."}

Upon entering the room, the Hero must face off with Delfran, who holds one of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowkeys\"&gt;Shadowkeys&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadowkey can be found on top of Delfran's throne.\nThere is a chest within the level containing &lt;a href=\"Grell%27s%20Letter\"&gt;Grell's Letter&lt;/a&gt;, which may show one of two messages. Both point to the eventual fight with &lt;a href=\"Pergan%20Asuul\"&gt;Pergan Asuul&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowgate.\nDelfran's Shadowkey is needed to enter this &lt;a href=\"shadowgate\"&gt;shadowgate&lt;/a&gt;. The area beyond the gate contains numerous enemies, including &lt;a href=\"Umbric%20Rat\"&gt;Umbric Rat&lt;/a&gt;s and a few bandits. The area is a series of extremely narrow hallways, at the end of the final hallway lies a chest containing the &lt;a href=\"Dusk%20Dagger\"&gt;Dusk Dagger&lt;/a&gt; as well as Healing and Magicka Potions, and finally, there is 227 gold."}

Delphine is one of the last remnants of the Blades, residing in the township of &lt;a href=\"Riverwood\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; and reforming the new iteration of the Blades from &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;), Delphine was an Agent of the Blades. By then, she was a high-priority target to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Before the war, Delphine orchestrated several attacks on the Dominion during her stay in their Territory, which consists mainly of both the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. By the time she was discovered, the first purge against the Blades had begun, fortunate for her; she was recalled to Cyrodiil, avoiding the Dominion's wrath. When the Great War had commenced, Delphine was able to evade several assassination attempts on her life, until she had ultimately escaped the Dominion, into the province of Skyrim, where she resided in the quaint hamlet of Riverwood, near the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. She would evade the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; for roughly over thirty years, waiting for the call to arms.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Delphine resides in the township of Riverwood, taking the position of Innkeeper at the &lt;a href=\"Sleeping%20Giant%20Inn\"&gt;Sleeping Giant Inn&lt;/a&gt;, and working alongside &lt;a href=\"Orgnar\"&gt;Orgnar&lt;/a&gt;, a Nordic Commoner that was a resident in Riverwood. It is unknown how long the two have worked with each other. During her time in Riverwood, she garnered allies throughout the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;Court Wizard&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun. The two would attempt to uncover the various &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;Dragon Burial Mounds&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout the province of Skyrim. With the help of an estranged warrior, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt; was recovered, the contents of the stone would be remade into the &lt;a href=\"Map%20of%20Dragon%20Burials\"&gt;Map of Dragon Burials&lt;/a&gt;. When news that the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; had revealed themselves, Delphine sought a way to garner their attention, she would traverse the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that the Dragonborn would attempt to take it. Her plan succeeded and the Last Dragonborn headed to Riverwood, meeting with Delphine.\nBeing naturally unconvinced, Delphine traveled with the supposed Dragonborn to the sacred forest of &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;, to slay the resurrected Dragon known as &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt;, who was slain in the area many years ago. In the aftermath of the battle, the warrior absorbed the Dragon's soul, proving the fact that they are the Dragonborn. And so the two began to uncover the person responsible for this &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Delphine's first idea was the Thalmor, so she tasked the Dragonborn with infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt; near the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was revealed that the Thalmor were not responsible. To uncover more information, the two decided to locate &lt;a href=\"Esbern\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;, another rogue member of the Blades, living out in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. With Esbern's help, the duo learned that the prophecy foretold in &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; had begun, revealing that &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic God of Destruction was responsible for the Dragon Crisis. In the end, the Last Dragonborn was able to vanquish Alduin within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nBefore the Blades were made into the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;'s personal bodyguard, they were originally dragon hunters that served the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who is considered the ultimate dragonslayer. Delphine took it upon herself to re-establish the Blades, not only as the Grandmaster but for their initial purpose. Before meeting Delphine, the Last Dragonborn was acquainted with &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, who despise the Blades and vice versa. When the existence of &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; was revealed to the Blades, the Last Dragonborn was tasked to eliminate the dragon, knowing that the elder dragon was considered the Dragonborn's master in the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn had killed Paarthurnax then they would be disowned by the Greybeards, but if they let Paarthurnax live, then the Dragonborn would be considered an enemy of the Blades. Delphine gave the Dragonborn this ultimatum, and it is unknown whether it was carried out or not. Regardless, the Blades grew, taking in newer members and operating out of &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, amidst the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;. What became of Delphine's Blades is currently unknown."}

During &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20War\"&gt;The Great War&lt;/a&gt;, she evaded attempts at her life several times, ultimately escaping the Thalmor and being stationed in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. She returned to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, remaining alert to the surveillance of the Thalmor.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn retrieves the &lt;a href=\"Dragonstone\"&gt;Dragonstone&lt;/a&gt; and returns to &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; with the Dragonstone for &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar&lt;/a&gt;, the Court-Wizard will be discussing the ancient Nords with Delphine and how they defeated the dragons. There she will be wearing her &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leather armor&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20Hood\"&gt;Thieves Guild Hood&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn tries to speak to Delphine, she will just tell them to \"mind their own business.\"\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelphine is the acting Grandmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last remaining members operating in Skyrim. While searching for the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn finds a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note%20%28Delphine%29\"&gt;Mysterious Note&lt;/a&gt; in its place at &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt;, saying to go to the Sleeping Giant in Riverwood and rent the attic room. At the inn, Delphine approaches and relinquishes the Horn, demanding to speak in private. She reveals then that she is a member of a secret organization, seeking the next Dragonborn.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Blade%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;A Blade in the Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo provide sufficient proof of being truly Dragonborn, she asks for help in slaying a dragon at &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;. There, they find &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the same dragon &lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;that attacked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt;, another dragon. Completing this, she reveals herself to be a member of the Blades and believes that the Thalmor may be involved with the re-emergence of dragons in Skyrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Diplomatic%20Immunity\"&gt;Diplomatic Immunity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuspecting the Thalmor are behind the return of the dragons, Delphine sends the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes of finding some sort of explanation of the dragons' return. However the only thing found out was that the Thalmor were looking for &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt;, the only other remaining member of the Blades. From what they learned from torturing a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Etienne%20Rarnis\"&gt;Etienne Rarnis&lt;/a&gt;, was that Esbern was somewhere in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway\"&gt;The Ratway&lt;/a&gt; sewers beneath &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Cornered%20Rat\"&gt;A Cornered Rat&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter returning from the Thalmor Embassy, with knowledge of Esbern's &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway%20Warrens\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt;, Delphine sends the Dragonborn to Riften's &lt;a href=\"The%20Ratway\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt; to look for Esbern.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter finding Esbern, Delphine learns of the location of a hidden sanctuary known as &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn, Esbern, and Delphine set out to find this sanctuary and claim it.\n&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Blades\"&gt;Rebuilding the Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter gaining entrance to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn can ask Delphine why there are only two Blades members. She then re-explains that the Thalmor hunted them down during the Great War. From there the Dragonborn can bring up to three followers to Sky Haven Temple, to recruit them into the Blades. After that, Esbern will send the four out to slay dragons.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon reaching &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; for the peace treaty, Delphine and Esbern will arrive and begin arguing with Arngeir. Eventually, he agrees to let them participate in the meeting.\n&lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelphine reveals that she is aware of &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;'s existence and demands his death as part of the quest. Unless the dragon is slain, the Blades will no longer assist the Dragonborn, and items at Sky Haven Temple will be considered stolen.\nMultiple followers.\nDelphine is one of the quest characters that can be exploited to be a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; throughout Skyrim along with another follower of choice. If Delphine is exploited as a follower during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;,\" and the Dragonborn becomes a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, she will attack the Dragonborn on sight.\nConversations.\nDelphine: \"Orgnar. [long pause] Orgnar! Are you listening?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Orgnar\"&gt;Orgnar&lt;/a&gt;: \"Hard not to.\"\nDelphine: \"The ale's going bad we need to get a new batch.

The terminology is clearly First Era or even earlier. I'm convinced this is a copy of a much older text. Perhaps dating to just after the Dragon War. If so, I could use this to cross-reference the names with other later texts.\"\nDelphine: \"Good. I'm glad you're making progress. My employers are anxious to have some tangible answers.\"\nFarengar: \"Oh, have no fear.

Ah, yes, the Jarl's protege! Back from Bleak Falls Barrow? You didn't die, it seems. Ah! The Dragonstone of Bleak Falls Barrow! Seems you are a cut above the usual brutes the Jarl sends my way. My... associate here will be pleased to see your handiwork. She discovered its location, by means she has so far declined to share with me.\"\nFarengar: \"So your information was correct after all. And we have our friend here to thank for recovering it for us.\"\nDelphine: \" went into Bleak Falls Barrow and got that? Nice work. Just send me a copy when you've deciphered it.\"\nDelphine: \"Orgnar. I'm travelling. You've got the inn 'til I get back.\"\nOrgnar: \"Right, happy trails.\"\nSeeing Esbern:\nEsbern: \"Delphine! I... it's good to see you. It's been... a long time.\"\nDelphine: \"It's good to see you, too, Esbern. It's been too long, old friend. Too long. Well, then. You made it, safe and sound. Good. Come on, I have a place we can talk.\"\nDelphine: \"Orgnar, hold down the bar for a minute, will you?\"\nOrgnar: \"Yeah, sure.\"\nIn the secret room:\nDelphine: \"Now then. I assume you know about...\"\nEsbern: \"Oh yes! Dragonborn! Indeed, yes. This changes everything, of course. There's no time to lose. We must locate... let me show you. I know I had it here, somewhere...\"\nDelphine: \"Esbern, what...\"\nEsbern: \"Give me... just a moment... Ah! Here it is. Come, let me show you. You see, right here. Sky Haven Temple, constructed around one of the main Akaviri military camps in the Reach, during their conquest of Skyrim.\"\nDelphine: \"Do know what he's talking about?\"\nEsbern: \"Shh! This is where they built Alduin's Wall, to set down in stone all their accumulated dragonlore. A hedge against the forgetfulness of centuries. A wise and foresighted policy, in the event. Despite the far-reaching fame of Alduin's Wall at the time - one of the wonders of the ancient world - its location was lost.\"\"\nDelphine: \"Esbern. What are you getting at?\"\nEsbern: \"You mean... you don't mean to say you haven't heard of Alduin's Wall? Either of you?\"\nDelphine: \"Let's pretend we haven't. What's Alduin's Wall and what does it have to do with stopping the dragons?\"\nEsbern: \"Alduin's Wall was where the ancient Blades recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return. Part history, part prophecy. Its location has been lost for centuries, but I've found it again. Not lost, you see, just forgotten. The Blades archives held so many secrets... I was only able to save a few scraps...\"\nDelphine: \"So you think that Alduin's Wall will tell us how to defeat Alduin?\"\nEsbern: \"Well, yes, but... there's no guarantee, of course.\"\nDelphine: \"Sky Haven Temple it is, then. I knew you'd have something for us, Esbern.\"\nHanding over the Inn:\nDelphine: \"Orgnar, this is it. The inn is yours. I'm probably never coming back here.\"\nOrgnar: \"Well, now. That's something to think about.\"\nDelphine: \"Take care of yourself, Orgnar. Goodbye.\"\nOrgnar: \"Yeah... sure. You, too, Delphine. You be safe.\"\nEntering Karthspire:\nDelphine: \"This looks promising.\"\nEsbern: \"Yes. Definitely early Akaviri stonework here.\"\nDelphine: \"We've got to get this bridge down. These pillars must have something to do with it.\"\nEsbern: \"\"Yes. These are Akaviri symbols. Let's see... you have the symbol for \"King\"... and \"Warrior\"... And of course the symbol for \"Dragonborn.\" That's the one that appears to have a sort of arrow shape pointing downward at the bottom.\"\"\nPressure plates:\nEsbern: \"Wait.\"\nDelphine: \"Why are you stopping?\"\nEsbern: \"We should be careful here. See these symbols on the floor?\"\nDelphine: (To the Dragonborn)\"Hmm, Esbern's right. Looks like pressure plates.\"\"\nEsbern: \"Be careful.\"\nAfter securing the area:\nDelphine: \"Looks safe now. Let's move.\"\nEsbern: \"Yes, yes! I think we must be close to the entrance.\"\nBas reliefs:\nEsbern: \"Fascinating! Original Akaviri bas reliefs... almost entirely intact! Amazing... you can see how the Akaviri craftsmen were beginning to embrace the more flowing Nordic style...\"\nDelphine: \"We're here for Alduin's Wall, right, Esbern?\"\nEsbern: \"Yes, of course. We'll have more time to look around later, I suppose. Let's see what's up ahead.\"\nFinding Alduin's Wall:\nEsbern: \"Shor's bones! Here it is! Alduin's Wall... so well preserved... I've never seen a finer example of early second era Akaviri sculptural relief...\"\nDelphine: \"Esbern. We need information, not a lecture on art history.\"\nEsbern: \"Yes, yes. Let's see what we have... Look, here is Alduin! This panel goes back to the beginning of time, when Alduin and the Dragon Cult ruled over Skyrim. Here the humans rebel against their dragon overlords -- the legendary Dragon War. Alduin's defeat is the centerpiece of the Wall. You see, here he is falling from the Sky. The Nord Tongues -- masters of the Voice -- are arrayed against him.\"\nDelphine: \"So, does it show how they defeated him? Isn't that why we're here?\"\nEsbern: \"\"Patience, my dear. The Akaviri were not a straightforward people. Everything is couched in allegory and mythic symbolism. Yes, yes. This here, coming from the mouths of the Nord heroes -- this is the Akaviri symbol for \"Shout.\"\"\"\nDelphine: \"You mean they used a shout to defeat Alduin? You're sure?\"\nEsbern: \"Hmm? Oh, yes. Presumably something rather specific to dragons, or even Alduin himself. Remember, this is where they recorded all they knew of Alduin and his return.\"\nDelphine: \"So we're looking for a Shout, then. Damn it.\"\nEsbern: \"\"Look, here. In the third panel. The prophecy which brought the Akaviri to Tamriel in the first place, in search of the Dragonborn. Here are the Akaviri - the Blades - you see their distinctive longswords. Now they kneel, their ancient mission fulfilled, as the Last Dragonborn contends with Alduin at the end of time. Are you paying attention, Delphine? You might learn something of our own history. I know the prophecy by heart. Once all Blades knew it.'When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world'\n'When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped'\n'When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles'\n'When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls'\n'When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding'\n'The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn.'\nDelphine: \"Well, I'm going to look around some more. See what the Blades left for us.\"\nEsbern: \"Yes... yes, that's an excellent idea. Who knows what lost treasures we might discover?\"\nDelphine: \"You there. The Dragonborn wishes to give you the chance to join the lost guardians of Tamriel. The dragon slayers. The Blades. Do you wish to become a Blade?\"\nFollower: \"I do.\"\nDelphine: \"Are you willing to trade away all claims and titles of your former life? To live here and devote yourself to protecting Tamriel from danger?\"\nFollower: \"I do.\"\nDelphine: \"Then by my right as acting grandmaster, I name you a Blade, with all the privileges, rights, and burdens that brings. Godspeed.\""}

Although suspicious of how the Brotherhood came to acquire the amulet, he willingly accepts it.\nWhen Delvin was a new member of the Thieves Guild, he attempted a robbery in an unspecified tavern that resulted in him accidentally committing murder. &lt;a href=\"Gallus%20Desidenius\"&gt;Gallus&lt;/a&gt;, caring for Delvin, sent him to live with the Dark Brotherhood for several years until the heat caused from the murder died down. It was here he developed a relationship with Astrid, which ended when he left the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the scene involving &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer&lt;/a&gt; angering the Guild, Delvin will have a line of dialogue about betrayal, and that it's \"like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.\" This could indicate he was in the Brotherhood and betrayed by them, or even by Astrid herself, though it leaves much to speculation because there will be no other discussion on the matter. Astrid will only smugly reveal that they have a \"history.\" It could even indicate that he, like Astrid herself, felt betrayed when the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; did not choose a new &lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt; and let the Brotherhood decline.\nIf the Dark Brotherhood questline has progressed to the point that the Brotherhood is now located in the &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Dawnstar Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, he will sell a few things to improve the sanctuary during the quest &lt;a href=\"Where%20You%20Hang%20Your%20Enemy%27s%20Head\"&gt;Where You Hang Your Enemy's Head&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne can choose the following options:\nConversations.\nBrynjolf: \"You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.\"\nKarliah: \"Please, lower your weapons so we can speak.

Get in here, all of you!\"\nDelvin: \"The gold, the jewels... it's all gone.\"\nVex: \"That son-of-a-bitch! I'll kill him!\"\nBrynjolf: \"Vex! Put it away... right now. We can't afford to lose our heads... we need to calm down and focus.\"\nDelvin: \"Do what he says, Vex. This isn't helpin' right now.\"\nVex: \"Fine. We do it your way. For now.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Delvin, Vex... watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me right away.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Delvin, please tell me you have good news.\"\nDelvin: \"If I told you that, I'd be lying. We haven't had a bit in weeks. our clients are starting to get angry.\"\nBrynjolf: \"You tell this sorry bunch of thieves that they need to put down their flagons and get to work if they want to keep their status!\"\nDelvin: \"I will, I will...\"\nDelvin: \"I don't know where you find your sources, but that last shipment of skooma was some of the best quality I've seen in years.\"\nTonilia: \"I just got luck is all. Bumped into someone who knew someone else. The rest just writes itself.\"\nDelvin: \"If you like I'd be happy to take it over the operation for you. Take the source off your hands.\"\nTonilia: \"And lose out just when the going is getting good? No thanks.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep it short. Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in order. With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master should be yours. Delvin?\"\nDelvin: \"Agreed.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Vex?\"\nVex: \"Sure, why not.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Karliah?\"\nKarliah: \"Absolutely.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild Master and wish you good fortune and long life. Now everyone get back to work.\""}

He's in the back, behind the brew vats.\" A shadow in the smoke made a vague gesture, swirling the thick vapors. The gentleman coughed, and began to make his way across the dim room.\nThe chamber was a common room of sorts, with a dozen or so tables and three-score mismatched chairs, some of which were occupied with drinkers although somewhere far above the noonday sun shone down on the desert city of &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. The ceiling was low and the gentleman was tall, so he had to weave his way between the low-hanging oil lamps that contributed most of the air's burden of smoke. \"Beetle oil,\" he said to himself, sniffing, \"and the cheapest possible grade.\"\nBeyond the brew vats the air was a bit less dense, but it was also even darker than in the common room. A single lamp burned upon a table against the far wall, its flame reflecting from a carafe, a flagon, and the embroidered edging on the vest of someone sitting on a chair, leaning back against the wall.\nThe gentleman approached the table, stopped at a respectful distance and asked, \"You are \u2026 the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Asp\"&gt;Red Asp&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nThe front legs of the chair came down with a thump. \"That's what they call me,\" said a low voice from above the vest. \"Traditional title for the doyen of the Hallin's Stand &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. And you?\"\n\"My name \u2026 isn't important,\" the gentleman said. \"But my business\u2014is.\"\n\"How important?\"\nThe gentleman drew a sack from his waistband and dropped it on the table. It clanked. The Red Asp opened it with a finger and stirred the contents for moment. \"This would qualify as payment for important business. A down payment, anyway,\" he said. \"What's the target?\"\n\"The Governor of Hallin's Stand.\"\n\"You're in the wrong place, friend,\" said the Red Asp, with just a tinge of regret. \"We don't do assassinations.

It's the symbol of his right to rule. And I want you to take it,\" the gentleman said, \"during the &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20Dance\"&gt;Ceremonial Dance&lt;/a&gt; at the Governor's Ball.\"\nThere was a long pause, and then, \"Deal,\" said the Red Asp. \"Of course, I'll have to handle the matter personally. None of my cutpurses or burglars are up to this sort of job.\" He lifted the carafe and poured fragrant pomegranate wine into the flagon. \"Will you drink on it?\"\n\"Both of us,\" the gentleman said, \"from the same vessel?\"\n\"It's how we do things here.\"\n\"In that case,\" said the gentleman in the blue velvet tunic, \"I'd be delighted.\""}

In fact, he even suspects his maid of passing off information about him. Even if Dengeir becomes Jarl, he is still as paranoid as before.\nBackground.\nDengeir of Stuhn lives in &lt;a href=\"Dengeir%27s%20House\"&gt;Dengeir's House&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;.

Dengeir is also Jarl &lt;a href=\"Siddgeir\"&gt;Siddgeir&lt;/a&gt;'s uncle.\nJarl of Falkreath.\nHe once ruled Falkreath as Jarl, but his nephew Siddgeir has taken over the position as Jarl and Dengeir now serves the Jarl's Court as a Thane.\nHis story of why he no longer rules as Jarl differs radically from his nephew's. He believes he was asked to step down when he took sides with the Stormcloaks and that it was, in fact, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; plot to oust him from his seat of power. Dengeir states that he began noticing that Imperial spies were everywhere amongst the people of Falkreath, keeping tabs on and influencing everyone from the shadows.\nWhen Dengeir found out about this, the spies made a few well placed bribes and the next thing he knew, the Nobles were calling for a new Jarl. Siddgeir, who is ever willing to please the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, was then named in his place. However, Siddgeir states that Dengeir had become too frail in his old age to continue as Jarl, and as such stepped down.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Some%20Light%20Theft\"&gt;Some Light Theft&lt;/a&gt;.\nDengeir needs help in retrieving a note, possibly destined for Imperial hands, from &lt;a href=\"Lod%27s%20House\"&gt;Lod's House&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ancestor\"&gt;Dark Ancestor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after completing the first task, Dengeir will ask for help with another. He explains that a nearby grave has been dug up and it is thought to be the work of gravediggers. He states that it was his ancestor, &lt;a href=\"Vighar\"&gt;Vighar&lt;/a&gt; who is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; and has now been freed from his coffin after his grave's &lt;a href=\"wardstone\"&gt;wardstone&lt;/a&gt; was stolen. He requests assistance in dispatching this foe and saving his family's reputation before Vighar's condition is revealed. If the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline has been completed\u00a0and Dengeir is now Jarl,\u00a0this quest becomes unavailable.\n&lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Liberation of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20from%20Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Rescue from Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;\" is completed, Dengeir will become the Jarl of Falkreath once more. When asked why he supports the Stormcloaks, he states that, \"\"Some &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; does not know what's best for Skyrim and should not dictate how her people should live.\"\"\u00a0He also states that he is \"no fool\" and knows that &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; is \"selfish and power-hungry\" but that he is the devil he knows (as opposed to the emperor).\nDialogue.\n\"If you're sympathetic to the Empire, you'd be wise to put Falkreath far behind you.\"\n\"Mind what you say!

The &lt;a href=\"Duneripper%20%28Online%29\"&gt;duneripper&lt;/a&gt; shares many aspects of that aquatic monster but has adapted to live within the roasting sands of the western Alik'r Desert. Ambush hunters like the duneripper are well suited to this arid, unforgiving landscape. The beast is immensely proportioned-- it can reach the length of three &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;-- and its armored tail is covered in chitinous scales. Unlike the sea-drake, the duneripper has learned the primal art of patience. With a digestion system that requires only a modicum of food to sustain the large beast, the duneripper burrows beneath the sand, sometimes lying motionless for days, waiting to strike its victim.\nThe first sign of a duneripper is the dorsal crest piercing the sand just before an attack, as the nearby sand churns like a whirlpool. The quarry is unaware until the very last moment that a sharp-toothed, salivating mouth is closing in on it. Should a bite not incapacitate its prey, the duneripper will try to clamp down on it, roll onto it, constrict it, or burrow back into the sand to suffocate it.\nThe duneripper will also sweep its tail around to upend its prey, and it exhibits short bursts of impressive speed. Beware the shifting sands, for they may be a prelude to a swift and bloody death.\nThere have been tales of these giant, crablike beasts since before the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; first explored the vast dunes of the Alik'r Desert. With only the duneripper to fear, the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Scorpion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giant scorpion&lt;/a&gt; has been left alone to grow to enormous proportions. Its girth is comparable to a large bull, and it has two horrific front pincers, six smaller legs that end in sharp claws, and an immense and segmented prehensile tail, which would be a marvel to watch were it not the most feared natural weapon of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. After one of these monstrosities spot its prey, it moves with great speed across the sand, leaving only the shallowest of imprints.\nIt usually attacks with its claws, catching its meal before the tail lashes out, usually killing the poor victim quietly but unpleasantly: If the barbed stinger doesn't slay the victim outright, the deadly venom pumped into the open wound immobilizes it. The corpse or paralyzed victim is then slowly eaten and digested externally. To prevent this most heinous of deaths, it is recommended you attack from behind, concentrating on incapacitating the tail, as the hardened carapace is extremely difficult to breach. Native shamans of the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt; prize &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Scorpion%20Stinger\"&gt;giant scorpion stingers&lt;/a&gt;, but they prefer to harvest these themselves, rather than pay for ones slain by others.\nExcitable children are subdued by talk of a &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lamia&lt;/a&gt; visiting them in the night. Many variations of the tale exist where a charmed traveler surrenders to a terrible and painful death at the talons and bite of a Lamia. This beast is a well-known underwater menace to the fishermen of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. Recent Imperial research, and evidence from the local viziers in the Alik'r Desert region of Hammerfell, as discovered aggressive and untamed desert kin with a similar skeletal structure and vicious attack pattern.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lamia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lamia&lt;/a&gt; is an amalgam of snake and woman, although it is assumed they are hermaphroditic and lay eggs like a reptile (which are then abandoned and the immature Lamiae are left to fend for themselves). the less enlightened see this creatures as a cursed people, but there is no evidence for this. Lamiae stand as a tall full-grown &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; male when fully reared up, and they use their long tails to steady themselves while on land. Their sharp poison fangs, ophidian heads, and scaled tails have led to an aversion of this chimera across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have a lust for gold, jewels, and trinkets, and are known to loot and wear such treasure from the corpses of those they've slain. They understand language but have a rasping hiss rather than anything intelligible. However, they have developed an eerie, almost mesmerizing song that can entrance and entrap the credulous. They lack intelligence to craft or make art, they never venture far from their lair, and they live independently unless they need to congregate for safety or are under command of a more powerful Lamia or other entity. Their mastery of electrical magic is innate, not learned. But their appetite is voracious; they devour the flesh, meat, and bone of any living creature.\nBeware the song of the Lamia. It may be the last lullaby you ever hear.\nThe dread mausoleums in the waters near &lt;a href=\"Bergama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bergama&lt;/a&gt; hold more than their fair share of the dead. Grave robbers tell of a terrible spectre, a hooded shape of fear, tattered and floating in the cool, stale air.

You will find yourself in a cave; make your way through and you will find yourself in a place with many &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flame Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;. Minantille will be located on the hill across the lava pool; you will need to fight through many of the atronachs to get there. Once you reach Minantille, you will be set upon by an enemy known as &lt;a href=\"Minantille%27s%20Rage\"&gt;Minantille's Rage&lt;/a&gt;. Kill it, then speak with Minantille. She will thank you for helping her overcome her anger from being disgraced as a general, and will take your teleportation scroll. \nAfter you have helped Minantille, a portal will appear just ahead. It will take you to &lt;a href=\"Merion\"&gt;Merion&lt;/a&gt;'s headspace; you will again find yourself in a cave. Head through to the big room; in the north of said room, you will find Merion with the spirit of a lady. Speak with Merion and he will insist that he is in love, but that his love is scared of the giant mushrooms here in the cave and thus won't move from here. He will mention that he was going to use the mushrooms' spores for alchemy, but he left his pack somewhere. The backpack is in the center of the room; it will contain a recipe for a potion to resist magic spells. The ingredients can be found around this cave. The Lavendercap Mushrooms are in the southern tunnel; head on from there to the upper floor and you will find the Bloodcrown Spores. Then head south from there to find the final ingredient, the Gleamcap Spores. Once you have all the ingredients and have mixed them into a potion, head back and use it on Merion's lady friend. She will disappear; give Merion the teleportation scroll and he will head out. \nHead back to the portal you used to get here, and use it to return to the Tower of the Vale. You will see a new portal there, to &lt;a href=\"Nuulehtel\"&gt;Nuulehtel&lt;/a&gt;'s headspace. You will find yourself in an icy cave; Nuulethel will be just in front of you. He will ask you to build him a fire so that he can warm up and get out of here. The materials to build the fire can be found around the cave; the Flint and Tinder are in the west, the Oil is in the north and the Straw is in the east. Once you have all of these things, head back to Nuulehtel and build a campfire. Nuulehtel will now agree to use your scroll to get to safety. \nHead back to the main tower and through the trap door in the northeast of the room. You will find yourself in Sanessalmo's lair; confront him and kill him, then use your last teleportation scroll to get back to Eminelya. Speak with her to finish the quest."}
