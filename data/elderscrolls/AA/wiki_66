With tensions rising between Hammerfell and the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Volag agreed to sign a treaty with &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thassad%20II\"&gt;Thassad II&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20854\"&gt;2E 854&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Thassad II died, Hammerfell was plunged into a bloody civil war between the Crowns and the Forebears. While his son, Crown prince &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, tried to reunite the cities of Hammerfell, Volag's army took the capital, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, after an event known as &lt;a href=\"Volag%27s%20Purge\"&gt;Volag's Purge&lt;/a&gt;. A'Tor was forced to fall back to his seat of power, &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding\"&gt;Port Hunding&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. When the Forebears began losing the Civil War, Volag and the other Forebear leaders made a &lt;a href=\"Forebear%20Truce\"&gt;pact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which would result in a Forebear victory. However, shortly after the victory, Volag disappeared, resulting in Hammerfell completely falling to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s rule, with Volag's capital, Sentinel, being ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; governor &lt;a href=\"Senecus%20Goddkey\"&gt;Senecus Goddkey&lt;/a&gt;. He would later return with a rebellious force to retake Sentinel, when at the same time another &lt;a href=\"Restless%20League\"&gt;rebellious force&lt;/a&gt; took over Stros M'Kai under the command of &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basil%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Basil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt;. Following these events Tiber Septim himself came to Stros M'Kai to work out a &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; between the three factions, which resulted in Hammerfell wanting to join the Empire instead of it being its subject."}

The place is called &lt;a href=\"Breagha-Fin\"&gt;Breagha-Fin&lt;/a&gt;, and the legends surrounding the place are simply\u2014well\u2014fascinating!\nMost of the legends describe the cavern as home to a race of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; that migrated here from the harsh and unforgiving Skyrim wilderness. Of course, no giants are found in the region today, so I'm not sure how much to believe these stories. The place is certainly full of giant accouterments, though.\nThe bones of massive mammoths, including skulls topped with great horns, adorn the walls of the cavern. Since such creatures have never been known to roam the &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; wilderness, the presence of their bones lends some credence to the tales of sojourners from the frigid wastes of Skyrim, though.***As I write these words, I am listening to sounds coming from the entrance to the caves. Could it be bandits? A wild animal, perhaps? I sincerely hope it's just some traveler, looking for shelter from the wind and rain. Either way, I had better go see what's going on.***Nords! There are Nords in Rivenspire and they're moving into Breagha-Fin! Should I talk to them? Try to reason with them and convince them to let me leave? Or should I try to find a place to hide and hope they move on? Perhaps that sealed chamber I found on the second level will offer some level of protection. Yes, that's where I shall hide, and hope for the best."}

He was originally trained to be the ruler of the realm, a training which did not turn out well. When the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; broke out, Durak and his loyal forces went out to fight for the Empire. Before he left, the King crafted and gave Barzul a fearsome cleaver, known as the &lt;a href=\"Headman%27s%20Cleaver%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Headman's Cleaver&lt;/a&gt;. In the absence of the King, Barzul was named regent. Barzul was a great warrior, but a terrible ruler, installing executions as punishments for even the most petty of crimes. As a result the people were terrified of him.\nWhen the Great War ended, the King returned, and took back his throne. When the King learned of Barzul's deeds, he became so furious he disinherited his son, and named his granddaughter, Urzoga, the heir to the throne. When the King died in &lt;a href=\"4E%20186\"&gt;4E 186&lt;/a&gt;, Urzoga became Queen. In his lust for the throne, Barzul has attempted to kill the Queen through a coup at least once, but failed.\nMore recent attempts of Barzul to undermine the rule of Urzoga came through taking hold of smuggling routes while posing as the River Snake. He also infiltrated into the realm of the Queen by using his agent, &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Larouche\"&gt;Gabrielle Larouche&lt;/a&gt;, as a means to lure the Queen into a trap. This attempt failed, however, as the Hero arrived and rescued the Queen.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Farmer%27s%20Plea\"&gt;The Farmer's Plea&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Barzul murdered a smuggler, the Hero is tasked to investigate who is responsible.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Hit\"&gt;The Big Hit&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"M%27jaddah\"&gt;M'jaddah&lt;/a&gt; has found new information on the shipping operations of Barzul.

The Hero must stop him.\nConversations.\nThe River Snake: \"Hello, daughter. So nice of you to visit your father.\"\nQueen Urzoga: \"I have no father!\"\nThe River Snake: \"\"I see you've met my new associate... Gabrielle, why not show the \"Queen\" what you can do?\"\n[After the battle]\nQueen Urzoga: \"You beast! There never was a treasure, was there?\"\nThe River Snake: \"Oh, but there is...

Why go for a kingdom, when you can have a whole empire?\"\nQueen Urzoga: \"You're insane!\"\nThe River Snake: \"I should have just drowned you when you were born.

Per Magus-General Septima Tharn's request, I will share what I know to aid the provisioners of less accomplished legions.\nStep 1: Acquire Ingredients\nWhen you are in the field, your backpack is the only pantry upon which your soldiers can rely. Requisition anything you can find--every barrel, chest, or sack of grain should make its contribution to your cause.\nAs an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; soldier you have the right to requisition as much as you want, but use discretion. A citizen with an empty larder will have long memories of Imperial imposition. A single handful, scoop, or item from each barrel, chest, or sack is my simple rule.\nStep 2: Acquire Recipes\nNever forget that you are a &lt;a href=\"Provisioning\"&gt;provisioner&lt;/a&gt;, not a chef. You aren't cooking personal meals for the Duchess of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't matter how the food tastes as long as it feeds your cohort. You want recipes that are fast, simple, and best made in bulk.\nTake &lt;a href=\"Grilled%20Capons\"&gt;grilled capons&lt;/a&gt;, a meal that requires &lt;a href=\"Capon%20Meat\"&gt;Capon Meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drippings\"&gt;drippings&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn't matter that you know the ingredients required--without a proper recipe, they're just raw meat and grease. Locals always have their own ways to prepare local ingredients, so stay vigilant for recipes while requisitioning supplies.\nStep 3: Cook, Cook, Cook\nOnce you've learned a recipe, bring those ingredients to a cooking fire. Then cook them. Don't burn the food.\nRemember to serve your cohort what it needs most. Scouts and skirmishers need &lt;a href=\"Roast%20Goat\"&gt;roast goat&lt;/a&gt;. Mages in your cohort are best fed &lt;a href=\"Capon%20Noodle%20Soup\"&gt;capon noodle soup&lt;/a&gt;. Infantry can always use trotter pie. Never forget that a hot meal can make the difference between life and death.\nAddendum: Brewing On The Go\nI hear enough questions about brewing to warrant its own section. I recommend you never keep more than a flask of fine brew with you. Your cohort will know it's a prize for those who truly distinguish themselves.\nYet sometimes the cohort needs liquid courage, such as before a battle or a parade review. This is when I brew horrible swill from local recipes, both to shock the soldiers into a state of confident readiness and keep them from growing fond of the stuff.\nStep 1 and Step 2 are identical to the similar steps for cooking. As for the third?\nStep 3: Brew, Brew Brew\nOnce you've learned a recipe, bring those ingredients to a cooking fire. Then brew them. Don't spoil the drink.\nI often present excess brew to the locals who \"donated\" the ingredients in the first place. This is not Imperial requisition policy, but I it helps my cohort stay in their future good graces should we suffer a retreat due to the actions of less stalwart legions."}

The king's son &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; fled to Stros M'Kai after &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; was captured and gathered his forces. The Crowns won many battles and planned to retake the capital, but the Forebears signed a treaty allying themselves with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and his Empire. &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s and Forebears combined were no match for the Crowns. Knowing the fate of his kingdom was at stake, the Prince prepared to make his last stand.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt; joined the rebels, they were little more then \"a wild pack of nationalists with sharp sword and enthusiastic schemes.\" They worked for A'Tor in secret, removing Forebear traitors on the mainland and killing Imperial emissaries who lingered too long on their borders. The League was forced to watch from afar during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt;, since the prince could not risk openly affiliating with them. During the conflict, the prince was mortally wounded by the poisoned arrow from the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; and, in a desperate attempt to save his life, the arch-mage &lt;a href=\"Voa\"&gt;Voa&lt;/a&gt; trapped the prince's soul within a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;, which would later come under the League's safekeeping. While Basil mourned his death, Iszara, frustrated with the League's indecisiveness, stole the soulgem and fled to Stros M'Kai to find a way to resurrect the prince. Cyrus made his way to the League's hideout and spoke to Basil to uncover her whereabouts, but found little that he did not already know.\nWhen Cyrus succeeded in locating and freeing Iszara, she made her way back to the hideout and together concocted a plan for retrieving the lost soulgem and finding someone to bring the heir to the throne back to life. Basil promised Cyrus that \"when you have the prince, you have his men.\"\nWith preparations made, Cyrus sent &lt;a href=\"Coyle\"&gt;Coyle&lt;/a&gt; to signal the Restless League from the &lt;a href=\"Saintsport%27s%20Lighthouse%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Saintsport's Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;. After sneaking the Yokundan gypsy &lt;a href=\"Saban\"&gt;Saban&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Arkay%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Temple of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, Basil and his men docked in and killed the nearby Imperial guards before arriving at the temple themselves. When the resurrection failed, placing the soul of A'Tor in his sword rather then his body, Basil threatened to abandon the cause until Cyrus gave a rousing speech, promising to go to the palace and kill the provisional governor &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Lord Amiel Richton&lt;/a&gt; himself with the now enchanted royal blade. Basil and the Restless League then took to the water again, securing the harbor and destroying the Empire's ships. \nAfter Richton's defeat and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Battle%20of%20Hunding%20Bay\"&gt;Second Battle of Hunding Bay&lt;/a&gt; won, Basil aided in restoring the Old Quarter to its former glory, now a decorated Captain under Iszara's wise rule.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Meeting%20the%20Restless%20League\"&gt;Meeting the Restless League&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak to Basil to find out what happened to Iszara.\n&lt;a href=\"Saving%20Iszara\"&gt;Saving Iszara&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasil provides the first clue in regards to Iszara by pointing out she took A'Tor's soulgem with her.\n&lt;a href=\"Resurrecting%20Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Resurrecting Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasil and his men make their way over to the Temple of Arkay to be present during the resurrection.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20the%20Palace\"&gt;Attack on the Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasil and his forces take over Stros M'Kai and its harbor, while also engaging with the Imperial fleet.

Immediately to the left (west) is a half buried bookshelf with an East Empire Trading Company Strongbox containing leveled loot. Walking over the ash pile there is a skeleton near a small window with minor &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;. To the right (northeast), a curved set of stairs leads down. From the bottom, there is a chest to the left (east). Against the southeast wall is a rough opening for a passage down to the right (south). At the bottom, a corridor continues straight to a closed gate.\nBefore that, on the right (west) side of the corridor is a room with several beds and shelves containing various pieces of &lt;a href=\"Chitin%20heavy%20armor\"&gt;Chitin heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20Armor%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Morag Tong armor&lt;/a&gt;.

The closed door on the right opens to a narrow room where the floor is covered in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bear traps&lt;/a&gt;, and a pull chain that opens part of the corridor gate against the back wall. The open door on the left leads to a room containing what looks like a raised boxing ring with several dummies. Against the back wall is a leveled sword on a chair.\nBack in the corridor, a pull chain between the left-hand door and the gate opens the rest of the gate. Beyond that are two pull chains on the right that will close both halves of the gate just opened, then several swinging door traps with numerous triggers on the floor. Behind the swinging door on the right (west) side is a small area with two columns with pull chains on their other side, plus a sideways spike trap. The two pull chains must be activated to open the last gate to the last room.\nBeyond that gate, another pull chain on the right closes the gate just opened. A doorway at the south end of the passage opens to a large, roughly circular room with &lt;a href=\"Vendil%20Severin\"&gt;Vendil Severin&lt;/a&gt; (for the \"&lt;a href=\"Served%20Cold\"&gt;Served Cold&lt;/a&gt;\" quest).

Typically they are the tribe's strongest warrior. Second in command are one or several &lt;a href=\"Gulakhan\"&gt;Gulakhan&lt;/a&gt;s, champions who serve as the voice of the tribe in matters of trade and negotiations, dealing with outsiders on behalf of the Ashkhan. The position of Gulakhan can be hereditary, and in the event of the death of an Ashkhan his successor is typically chosen from among the Gulakhans. While the Ashkhan leads in all material matters, the &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman\"&gt;Wise Woman&lt;/a&gt; leads in all spiritual ones. The Ashkhan will almost always seek her counsel and obeys her visions. On rare occasions, the Wise Woman may even take up the mantle of leadership in lieu that no current Ashkhan exists.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, an outlander \"born on a certain day to uncertain parents\" sought out the various Ashlander tribes of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; to be named the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. This title could only be bestowed by the tribal leaders, whose own motivations ranged from the noble and honorable to greed and vanity. Either by words, deed or steel, the incarnate ultimately succeeded in this endeavor and went on to defeat the mad-god &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and save all of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;."}

Free of the strictures that both provide structure and a high degree of rigidity for the Great Houses, they organize in loose tribes and harken back to an earlier time in Dark Elf history. They subsist as herder-hunters and find simple pleasures in a more natural lifestyle.\nAshlanders revere their ancestors and worship Daedra, refusing to acknowledge the divinity of the Living Gods of the Tribunal. They occasionally trade with other tribes and even with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, exchanging &lt;a href=\"Guar%20Hide\"&gt;guar hides&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shalk%20Resin\"&gt;shalk resin&lt;/a&gt; for news of the wider world and goods they can't easily acquire in the wild. Within their nomadic society, the Ashlanders are courteous, proper, and polite. When dealing with outsiders, though, they can become easily offended. Tribal leaders, called &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;ashkhans&lt;/a&gt;, serve as the \"warrior-protector\" of the community they lead. Second in command is the &lt;a href=\"Gulakhan\"&gt;gulakhan&lt;/a&gt;, who serves as the voice of the tribe in matters of trade and negotiations. Outsiders will do well to approach the gulakhan first, before attempting to seek an audience with the ashkhan. Each tribe also has a wise-woman, a farseer who keeps the songs, lore, and prophecy of the tribe. She is the spiritual leader of the tribe. The rest of the tribe stands as equals, sharing responsibilities as the hunt, herd, forage, and otherwise support each other.\nThe nomads are organized into four primary tribes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ahemmusa tribe&lt;/a&gt; resides in the southern coastal regions and swamplands of Vvardenfell. In years past, they traveled from coast to coast fishing and hunting, but more recently have largely been pushed out into the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; region as &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; and Redoran settlements spring up around their former grounds. The Ahemmusa are among the most peaceful of Ashlander tribes and the weakest in terms of amassing any sort of warband. They wear light clothing, often adorned with small shells, scales and even netting. Their weapons are more like tools, simple knives and spears they can use to work as well as defend themselves if need be. They prefer to keep to themselves and be left alone, living out their lives hunting, herding, and especially fishing. They have a small, semi-permanent settlement currently along the Bitter Coast where they live off the fish and other local wildlife in the swamplands.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun tribe&lt;/a&gt; resides in the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; region of Vvardenfell, and are as dour and dangerous as the volcanic ashlands they hail from. The Erabenimsun are quite war-loving. They are seen as greedy and cruel by their fellow Ashlanders and are believed to not have respect for many Ashlander customs. They care little about prophecy, history, and lore, so the Wise Woman has little power in this tribe. Erabenimsun are also typically the most heavily armed and armored. They are warriors first and foremost, valuing strength above all else.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Urshilaku tribe&lt;/a&gt; is the most highly respected tribe and the second most populous. They reside in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash%20%28Online%29\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt; region and the northern &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, which, like the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt;, is considered prime hunting and foraging land. But more than its many hunters, warriors, and herders, Urshilaku is famed for its lore-keepers. It is the only tribe that currently has multiple &lt;a href=\"Farseers\"&gt;Farseers&lt;/a&gt;, and the Wise-Woman of Urshilaku is widely renowned. Urshilaku has been key in ushering in a temporary age of peace among the Ashlander tribes, for all are listening when the oracles speak of an age of coming strife that the tribes must prepare for. In particular, it is the Urshilaku tribe that keeps faith that Nerevar Incarnate will return soon to unite the people. Urshilaku are some of the only Ashlanders to occasionally use magic. More common than actual spell-weaving is &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, at which they are highly skilled. They are also the tribe most interested in ancient relics, scrolls, and other items one might find in the ruins dotting Vvardenfell. Bringing them such things is one way to gain favor with this tribe.\nThe most populous tribe, the proud and confident &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Tribe%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Zainab&lt;/a&gt; resides in the fertile &lt;a href=\"Grazelands%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; region of northeast Vvardenfell. Like the Ahemmusa, they are surprisingly peaceable and friendly even to outlanders, although they are somewhat greedy and arrogant as well. Zainab is, in a way, the oddest of the tribes in that they follow the old ways, but they are extremely interested in the change that has overtaken Vvardenfell. They freely trade with the Great Houses, and some have even sought to forge more firm business deals with houses like &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. All in all, one gets the impression that Zainab is the most willing to adapt, even if they will not entirely leave their Ashlander lifestyle behind. Zainab possesses the most diverse collection of goods, including their arms and armor. They typically trade for goods instead of crafting them, and they are well known for harvesting, foraging, and mining in the rich Grazelands, which has led to their unrivaled prosperity."}

This outsider likely assumes that the Ashkhan leads the tribe, since the Ashkhan is usually the strongest warrior. This assumption leads the outsider to grief, should they ignore the more subtle strength and power within the tribe when trying to negotiate or request assistance. The Wise Woman serves as the spiritual leader of the tribe, and even the Ashkhan seeks her counsel and obeys her visions.\nA Wise Woman employs a type of magic foreign to those trained in the use of the different schools of magicka. Her magic appears to be grounded in the natural world. Evidence exists that some Wise Women receive prophetic visions. Certain scholars studying the Ashlander clans say that this dream-interpretation simply makes use of intuition and a thorough understanding of the internal relationships and politics within a given clan to claim some sort of prophetic vision. They label Wise Women as lore-keepers, with a useful, if largely informal, knowledge of herbal alchemy. This attitude is dismissive and speaks to the lack of scholarly study on the part of the observer.\nI have spent some time among the Ashlander clans and have personally witnessed a Wise Woman who was able to heal a gravely injured hunter. The recovery from a grievous injury within the span of a day was nothing short of miraculous. This hunter, who was gored badly by some creature, was at death's door when brought to the Wise Woman. The loss of blood alone did not bode well for survival. I did not witness whatever rituals the Wise Woman may have performed in his healing. I was, however, able to speak with the hunter, and within a day, she was up and walking.\nThe clan Wise Woman should never be ignored and her advice never dismissed. Not if you want to successfully deal with an Ashlander tribe."}

Their way of life is very different from that of the House Dunmer, having changed little from the time of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Ashlanders claim descent from the original followers of Veloth, who left the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; to settle Vvardenfell in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, and, in time gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; culture. There a belief that the Ashlanders built stone settlements and then abandoned them at a later juncture, but the truth of this is unclear.\nThe invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; drove the Ashlanders to consolidate from many tribes into a few more powerful entities, which became the precursors to the Great Houses of Morrowind. Following the formation of the Great Houses, the Dunmer population began to settle, and the numbers of nomadic Ashlanders declined. Those that remained were pushed into the poorest lands on and around Vvardenfell. Nonetheless, relations between the two peoples remained cordial thanks to the work of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, who united the Great Houses and Ashlander tribes to drive the Nords from &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which deified the mortal Tribunal of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, estranged the Ashlanders further, who grew to hate the new religion, which persecuted them. The Ashlanders came to harbor a belief, associated with &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;, that the Tribunal attained their powers not through godly effort but profane sorcery, and that &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; had been murdered but would return as prophesied by Azura.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the Ashkhan Chodala, who had fought the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;, siphoned off some of Vivec's power into a staff, aiming to use its power to become the prophecied &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; and unite the Ashlanders. However, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; revealed that, through his lack of faith in good counsel, Chodala was not the Nerevarine.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nAshlanders are arranged into tribes, which are primarily nomadic but some of which have semi-permanent settlements in the regions across Vvardenfell, in addition to some possibly permanent settlements on mainland Morrowind. These include:\nAshlanders primarily graze herds of livestock, as well as hunting, fishing and foraging where they can. Some tribes trade with the Great House Dunmer, primarily materials which their animals produce for things that they cannot make from their herds.\nEach tribe is led by an &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;Ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who is typically the tribe's strongest warrior. The Ashkhan will have either one or several gulakhans functioning as deputies and dealing with outsiders on behalf of the Ashkhan. The position of gulakhan can be hereditary, and in the event of the death of an Ashkhan his successor is typically chosen from among the gulakhans.\nThe spiritual wellbeing of each tribe is looked after by the &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman\"&gt;Wise Woman&lt;/a&gt;, who provides healing and counsel to the tribe. They are also the historians of the tribes, retaining each tribe's oral tradition and passing it down through the generations. Generally, when a Wise Woman dies without passing on their history, that tribe's knowledge is lost. They also retain a good deal of the tribes' oral traditions, with much Ashlander poetry coming from them or collected by them.\nAshlanders have very strict customs relating to how foreigners, people and things are to be handled. The giving of gifts between both friends and strangers out of respect is common, although giving the wrong gift can be risky, even among friends.\nOutsiders are typically not welcome in Ashlander's yurts, although most Ashlanders consider killing an unarmed stranger shameful, and most will let them leave with only a reprimand. Hospitality is formally granted by a member of the tribe, and is then something that cannot be violated without bringing shame to the tribe. True friendship with the Ashlanders, however, is marked by the declaration of being \"Clanfriend.\" A Clanfriend is made only after a ritual known as the harrowing, whereby the outsider is judged by the ancestors of the tribe.\nReligion.\nIn contrast to the Dunmer of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, Ashlanders continued to worship the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and their ancestors after the apotheosis of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the worship of the Daedra, each tribe has its own cult which venerates its own ancestors.\nThese cults have a negative view of the Tribunal, who they view as false gods who killed Nerevar. Their religion emphasizes mysticism and personal revelation, and the tribes and Wise Women hold much stock in dreams and visions, another point of difference from the Temple.\nThe Nerevarine Cult.\nFollowing the death of Nerevar and the apotheosis of the Tribunal, many Ashlanders believed that he would return and drive outlanders from Morrowind, as prophesied by Azura. The Tribunal Temple has always threatened any believers in the Nerevarine Cult with death or imprisonment, even if the Ashlanders' continued veneration of the Daedra was tolerated. Due to their stated goal to drive all outlanders from Morrowind, however, the Empire considered them hostile, and did not stop the &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;' violent suppression of the cult.\nAs a result, the Nerevarine Cult was forced underground even among Ashlanders, and its true size was difficult to gauge. By &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the persecution had been reduced to a small following, which only held influence among the Urshilaku tribe.\nFollowing the events surrounding the emergence of the Nerevarine, the Ashlanders were considered by the Temple hierarchy, particularly the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt;, as \"guardians of the true way.\" In the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Wise Women are commonly sought out by pilgrims for their guidance in the faith."}

They live in camps of small, mobile huts, herding guar, and hunting wildlife for meat and hides. By tradition, the Ashlanders claim the right to raid other settlements and other tribes for plunder and slaves. The Ashlanders worship their ancestors and are led by their &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;Ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;, or warchiefs, and are counseled by the arcane wisdom and prophecies of their &lt;a href=\"wise%20women\"&gt;wise women&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Velothi are people of Ashlander stock who have abandoned nomadic life and settled among the native Dunmer. The Velothi are despised by their Ashlander cousins as being weak and soft, while the Dunmer look down upon the Velothi as an insignificant underclass.\nCulture.\nThe Ashlander culture is an anachronistic survival of the ancestor worshipping tribal culture that evolved into the theocratic &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; culture of the native Dunmer. They see the worship of living Dunmer, the practice of Morrowind's main religious organization, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, as an abomination. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Cult\"&gt;Nerevarine Cult&lt;/a&gt; can be seen as such an ancestor cult.\nThe Ashlanders prefer the lifestyle of the Ashlander nomadic herder or hunter, and their ancestor worship is shamanistic and primitive by Dunmer and Imperial standards.\nAshlander nomadic camps have portable huts of hides stretched on chitin frames. These huts can be quickly dismantled and packed atop a guar when moving to new grazing and hunting grounds. The khan's hut is simply a larger, more elaborate version of a family hut.\nCustoms.\nMost Ashlanders wish all foreigners and their false gods could be driven from Morrowind. At the very least, Ashlanders wish that the foreign devils would leave them in peace. Ashlanders think it shameful to attack unarmed persons but will kill without hesitation an armed person who offends them or their clan laws. No Ashlander is foolish enough to make war against the Empire; however, if such a war might be won, many Ashlanders would no doubt cheerfully give their lives to do it.\nAmong clan and kin, Ashlander courtesy is very proper and polite, but to strangers, they are mean and hateful. Ashlander challenges are very solemn and serious things. Ashlanders are not offended by gifts of money and take them as tokens of deference and respect.\nAshlanders may challenge a stranger who enters a yurt without invitation. Customs differ with different tribes. For example, leave when requested and you may be forgiven. When challenged for sport, it is acceptable to decline; however, when challenged for honor, it is shameful to decline. A challenge for one's honor is mostly the result of offensive actions or acts of speech. It is also worth noting that these challenges of honor may also represent customary formal challenges of status or ritual.\nTribes.\nDuring the events of , four different tribes live on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. They are the &lt;a href=\"Ahemmusa%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ahemmusa&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Erabenimsun%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Erabenimsun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Zainab&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ahemmusa tribe lives in the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; and are considered to be mild and peace-loving. &lt;a href=\"Sinnammu%20Mirpal\"&gt;Sinnammu Mirpal&lt;/a&gt; is their Wise Woman and Ashkhan in one person.\nThe Erabenimsun tribe lives in the region of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; and are considered to love themselves and their weapons above everything else. Their Ashkhan, &lt;a href=\"Ulath-Pal\"&gt;Ulath-Pal&lt;/a&gt;, is cruel and ambitious. In contrast, their Wise Woman, &lt;a href=\"Manirai\"&gt;Manirai&lt;/a&gt;, is more cautious and reasonable.\nThe Urshilaku tribe live in the northern &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. Their Ashkhan is &lt;a href=\"Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt; and their Wise Woman is &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt;. They are the tribe most closely connected to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Cult\"&gt;Nerevarine Cult&lt;/a&gt;, as a matter of fact, their Ashkhan is the warrior-protector of the cult, and their Wise Woman is its seer.\nThe Zainab tribe live in the interior of the Grazelands. They are considered sly and crafty. Their wise woman is &lt;a href=\"Sonummu%20Zabamat\"&gt;Sonummu Zabamat&lt;/a&gt;.\nRankings.\n&lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt; are the two favored attributes of the Ashlander Faction. Favored Skills for the Ashlanders are &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spear\"&gt;Spear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Medium Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMabrigash.\nThe Mabrigash are witch-warriors who live on the fringes of Ashlander society. Former wise-women who have defied the patriarchal rules of behavior that govern their culture, practicing forbidden &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Snake%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ghost Snake&lt;/a&gt; magic, and are thus outcasts."}

The Ashlands of Vvardenfell refers to the region that surrounds the volcano of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Vvardenfell. The city of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; sits on the edge of the Ashlands, near the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt; in the west. It was built around the carapace of a giant &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Crab\"&gt;Emperor Crab&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the Vvardenfell Capital of the Great House Redoran. The town of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; is further into the Ashlands and is a mining colony from House Redoran. The &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; have a camp located on the northern coast of the Ashlands, along with the Sheogorad Strait. The &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt; is a fortress settlement that guards Vvardenfell against the summit of Red Mountain.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the city of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; was originally a large Aslander camp located along the &lt;a href=\"Foyada%20Drura\"&gt;Foyada Drura&lt;/a&gt;. It was founded by a group of Ashlanders and members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hleran\"&gt;House Hleran&lt;/a&gt; when they slew the ancient Emperor Crab named &lt;a href=\"Skar\"&gt;Skar&lt;/a&gt; using a mighty spear called &lt;a href=\"Calderas\"&gt;Calderas&lt;/a&gt;. The village of Ald'ruhn was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Conoon%20Chodala\"&gt;Ashkhan Conoon Chodala&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%20Dovrosi\"&gt;Wise Woman Dovrosi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%20Asani\"&gt;Wise Woman Asani&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala had come to the possession of an ancient artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt;. It was a powerful device created by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;foreign&lt;/a&gt; influence, Chodala believed he was, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; of Prophecy. Chodala gathered the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Exiles\"&gt;Red Exiles&lt;/a&gt;, a group of exiled Ashlanders and began to force the tribes of Vvardenfell to bow to his whim. Chodala, along with his sister &lt;a href=\"Seryn\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt; and an Outlander named the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; arrived into the Under-Skar to show Chodala the truth and the consequence of his actions. He decided to ignore the warnings of the past &lt;a href=\"Failed%20Incarnate\"&gt;Failed Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;s and fled to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kaushtarari\"&gt;Kaushtarari&lt;/a&gt; where he died by the hands of the Vestige.\nAround this time, a Dunmeri mer named &lt;a href=\"Drelyth%20Hleran\"&gt;Drelyth Hleran&lt;/a&gt; arrived into the camp of Ald'ruhn to find his lost ancestral tomb in the Ashlands. Hleran asked the Vestige to help in his endeavor by becoming accepted into the Tribe. The Vestige traveled to the Shrines dedicated to the four Vvardenfell tribes and spoke with Wise Woman Asani as well as &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Kuamta\"&gt;Farseer Kuamta&lt;/a&gt;. With knowledge from Asani, the Vestige found the &lt;a href=\"Hleran%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;Hleran Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt; on the lava basin of Foyada Drura. Deep within the Tomb, the Vestige met the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Dranoth%20Hleran\"&gt;Dranoth Hleran&lt;/a&gt;, who told the story of the foundation of Ald'ruhn as well as the death of Skar, the Emperor Crab. Ald'ruhn was founded by the Ashlanders of Vvardenfell as well as the members of House Hleran. Dranoth used the legendary spear called &lt;a href=\"Calderas\"&gt;Calderas&lt;/a&gt; to slay Skar and the Ashlanders settled along the carapace. With information, Drelyth was accepted into Ald'ruhn, and eventually more people came to Ald'ruhn. It eventually became the vast city of Ald'ruhn.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20414\"&gt;3E 414&lt;/a&gt;, the Vvardenfell Territory of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; was under &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; protection as per order of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt;. No settlements were constructed in the territory other than cities built by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind such as the cities of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. It was until in 3E 414, that &lt;a href=\"King%20Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;King Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; revoked a Temple ban on trade and settlements in Vvardenfell. The camp of Ald'ruhn was established as a large city under the control of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and used the carapace of Skar as the &lt;a href=\"Manor%20District\"&gt;Manor District&lt;/a&gt; of Ald'ruhn. The town of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt; was established north of the city and was built somewhere near the &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Isra\"&gt;Bal Isra&lt;/a&gt; landmark. Ald'ruhn was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Mistress Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; and the Redoran Council of Vvardenfell. The Imperial stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Buckmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt; was built south of Ald'ruhn, near the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ramimilk\"&gt;Ramimilk&lt;/a&gt;."}

This quest is unmarked and will not appear as a quest or miscellaneous objectives in the journal.\nWalkthrough.\nBirna in Winterhold tells the Dragonborn about Yngol Barrow and a bad deal she made. She wants to get rid of the Coral Dragon Claw that she offers for sale for 50 . As the Dragonborn explores the barrow, non-hostile glowing blue balls of light emerge one by one and start following them. However, no enemies appear until the end of the dungeon.\nIn the last room, a powerful, leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; is encountered. If no &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Quests\"&gt;radiant quest&lt;/a&gt; is active for this location, this draugr will be &lt;a href=\"Yngol%27s%20Shade\"&gt;Yngol's Shade&lt;/a&gt;.

The Ashpit consists of nothing but dust, ash and smoke; there is no ground, sky, or air. Of the realms accessible to mortals, it is considered one of the hardest to reach, and on it levitation and magical breathing are an absolute necessity.\nOverview.\nWhile not one of the original planes of Oblivion, it was created along with Malacath himself during the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt;. It was designed according to Malacath's spheres\u2014emptiness, betrayal, broken promises, and anguish. Such is the opinion of mainstream scholars. However, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;orcs&lt;/a&gt; and those loyal to &lt;a href=\"The%20Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;The Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt; believe they are rewarded in this realm with immortality, drink, food, and constant battle, all with their father Malacath. The Mages Guild are known to fill vials with the thick vapor of this realm. The Ashen Forge sits at the center of Malacath's own stronghold in the Ashpit. The Ashen Forge fills the endless space within Malacath's smithy, a massive hearth that burns with a fire said to be hotter than the sun. What keeps this fire alive is the adherence by the Orcs of Tamriel to the Code of Malacath. Within this fire, every Orc must undergo the ritual of tempering when first they cross from this life to the next. They are thrust into the coals so that every grudge that he or she carried into the afterlife can be heated, melted, and eventually forged into the next generation of mortal Orcs. With the grudges of Tamriel tempered and returned to the mortal world, the immortal Orcs are now free to begin collecting a new set of grudges related to their new existence. Some particularly memorable grudges can also be hammered and worked into weapons or armor of legendary stature upon the Ashen Anvil, the gigantic work bench that stands beside the Ashen Forge. \nAs described in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Doors%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;The Doors of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\", one can see from one end of the world to the other in a million shades of grey. There are Palaces of Smoke, and certain vaporous creatures reside in the realm."}

Ashurnibibi is situated towards the Inner Sea, in the low wetlands that are partially sunken and muddy. Ashurnibibi itself contains towers and wall that were able to withstand the test of time. Unlike other shrines, the walls have not decayed, at least for the most part. As one delves into Ashurnibibi, the ruins soon end and begin with natural caverns. Some of the temple is located in the shrine, and river ways flow throughout the inner ruins, possibly leaking from the Inner Sea. It is not far from the minor township of &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of Ashurnibibi was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20Fanatics\"&gt;Malacath Fanatics&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group of Orsimer that hailed from the region of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. The group was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Curate%20Sneg\"&gt;Curate Sneg&lt;/a&gt;, who rose to prominence in western Vvardenfell, prompting an assassination mark on the Orcish priest. The &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; was hired to assassinate Sneg and to disband the fanatics, so they sent &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Naryu Virian&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known Agent throughout Tamriel. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt;, the two were able to defeat Sneg and disrupted the fanatics' plans throughout Vvardenfell. This incident, however, would not be the last time Malacath's followers would occupy the ruins of Ashurnibibi.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; outbreak in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the ruins of Ashurnibibi was occupied by other Orcish followers of Malacath, who were notorious throughout the area for being kidnappers. The Malacath cult was led by &lt;a href=\"Durgash%20gro-Rushub\"&gt;Durgash gro-Rushub&lt;/a&gt;, who had his followers kidnap people for sacrifices. At one point, the Orcs had kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Joncis%20Dalomax\"&gt;Joncis Dalomax&lt;/a&gt;, who was a knight of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of a fellow member, the Orcs were defeated at Ashurnibibi, and Dalomax was returned to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Buckmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Buckmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt;, located in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown whatever happened to Ashurnibibi, it was likely reoccupied by another Orcish cult, as it has been throughout the eras."}

Like all in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; in those days, he was a simple planter of the fields. But while others only grew enough to sustain their immediate kin, even distant cousins of the Dirennis worked together. They would decide as a group which fields were best for wheat, orchard, vine, livestock, or apiary, and thereby always have the best yields of any farm which worked alone, doing the best as it could with what it had. Asliel wrote a book known as \"Compendious Almanac of Reagents,\" and became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; sometime in his life."}

Locks hold no doors shut for them. Assassins are very adept at taking the lives of others, and are able to find the weak points of opponents, often able to fell those much more powerful than themselves. Because of their training, assassins are typically adept at using a wide variety of weapons; however, to maintain their stealthy cloak, assassins typically stick with &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt; and rarely carry shields. Most assassins work outside of the law. However, some factions such as the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;Shadowscale&lt;/a&gt;s are assassins for their ruler.\nDescription and use.\nAssassins are killers who rely on stealth and mobility to approach victims undetected. Execution is with ranged weapons or with short blades for close work. Assassins include ruthless murderers and principled agents of noble causes.\nThe assassin is a stealthy combat-oriented character. It is based on a simple tactic: kill the enemy before the enemy gets a chance to strike back. Even though this does not always work, the assassin's best tactic is to use a few extremely damaging attacks.\nSecurity and &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; are two skills that make it quite easy for a skilled assassin to go places others cannot, such as on rooftops. &lt;a href=\"Sneak\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; is an exceptionally important skill to an assassin. All fights should be started with a Sneak attack and preferably ended with one. At level 100, a sneak attack will do 12 times more damage, and ignore any armor the target might wear. Sneaking is also useful for getting into places you are not supposed to be. Pickpocketing is also an essential part of the Sneak skill, as many guards and citizens of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; have keys or other items you might need.\n&lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; are the combat-oriented skills of the assassin. They are meant for fighting. This does not, however, mean charging the heavily armored orc with a giant battleaxe is a good idea. Sneak, attack, flee, repeat. If you have enough arrows, you can stand far away and sneak attack with your bow.\nThe Assassin class is favored by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can also create your own assassin-like special class that may be more effective for your play style than the standard assassin. Assassins do not require physical strength or combat skills as much as they need high alchemy, sneak, and lockpick skills. A light and fast dagger strike against a sleeping target will end with them usually getting up, running away, then collapsing a few seconds later as nightshade or another deadly ingredient does its work. Killing quickly and efficiently is the assassin's way of life, whether using bows or daggers, they will get the job done."}

If the battle for Skyrim comes to Whiterun, I will be forced to redraw. \nBut there will come a time when he sits idly by in his grand hall, unbothered by the world. \nIn that moment, when the Jarl has a chance to finally breathe, I will sneak my way to the upper floors and make sure that breath is his last. And when I take my leave cloaked in her shadow, all anyone will hear is a rattle."}

He was killed by assassins unknown. At the same time, in separate locations, the late emperor's three sons and heirs (Crown Prince &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall&lt;/a&gt;, 56; Prince &lt;a href=\"Enman%20Septim\"&gt;Enman&lt;/a&gt;, 55; Prince &lt;a href=\"Ebel%20Septim\"&gt;Ebel&lt;/a&gt;, 53] were slain by other assassins. An investigation into the identity and motives of the assassins is under way, but the Elder Council, &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Guard, and &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; Guard have forbidden the publication of reports and rumors concerning the event until further notice.\nBy ancient precedent, the Elder Council rules the empire until a new emperor is crowned. No direct heirs survive, and the council has proposed no list of candidates. &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, speaking for the Elder Council, presented an appeal to the empire's citizens for calm, and asked that the people remember the Emperor, his sons, and the Elder Council in their prayers.\nEmperor Uriel's early reign was marked by peace and prosperity. The Empress &lt;a href=\"Caula%20Voria\"&gt;Caula Voria&lt;/a&gt; bore him three healthy sons, was a loving companion to the Emperor, and a great favorite of the people. However, the emperor and the empire suffered terribly during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; (3E 389-399], when he was held captive in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; while the usurper &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; assumed his appearance and ruled in his stead. Emperor Uriel was finally rescued and restored and the impostor defeated by the agency of the sorceress &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and her shadowy prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but the affairs of the empire were in great disorder, and Empress &lt;a href=\"Caula%20Voria\"&gt;Caula Voria&lt;/a&gt;, exhausted by her ordeal, withdrew from public life.\nThe decades following the Restoration were once again peaceful and prosperous, but increasing political tensions among the petty states of northwest Tamriel finally erupted in the Wars of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;s, resulting in the establishment of the modern borders of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, and culminating with the remarkable events associated with the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe latter years of the Emperor's reign have seen a flourishing of &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; influence in the provinces, and with the fortunate resolution of the religious wars and the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and with the wise and firm guidance of &lt;a href=\"King%20Helseth\"&gt;King Helseth&lt;/a&gt; and his mother, Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, an extension of high Imperial culture even into the more remote parts of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Emperor's murder, and the murder of his three sons, is a terrible crime, and a great tragedy for the Empire. Battlemage Ocato assures us that all the resources of the Elder Council, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Legions&lt;/a&gt;, the Guard, the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battle%20College\"&gt;Imperial Battle College&lt;/a&gt; are being employed to bring the assassins to justice. But, in the meantime, the greatest tribute we citizens can offer to the memory of our beloved Emperor is to go earnestly and diligently about our daily affairs, honoring the life of the great Empire he loved so much, and served so faithfully for so long."}

The city has recently been opened and occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Warrior\"&gt;Celestial Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and drew to it several types of people; &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; pilfering stones to retrieve pieces of their ancestral home, traders looking for a fabled freeway that once passed through the Citadel, and Undaunted which came after rumors of their disappearances.\nBackground.\n\"People venturing into Hel Ra Citadel have mysteriously vanished, including a group of Undaunted led by Kailstig the Axe. I should enter the Citadel to find out what happened to them.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest is initiated from Kailstig the Axe in either the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads%20Tavern\"&gt;Crossroads Tavern&lt;/a&gt; or Hel Ra Citadel itself:\n\"They say something terrible has awoken\u2014or occupied\u2014Hel Ra Citadel, abandoned by the Yokudans since they invaded Tamriel. Scholars have been disappearing inside since the door to the Citadel, sealed by the Yokudans for thousands of years, opened.\"\nAlternatively, at the entrance chamber to Hel Ra Citadel:\n\"What's this? Another motley band come to steal my glory? You don't have the guts!\"\nOne can then ask Kailstig about the information at hand:\nNow that Kailstig the Axe has told of Hel Ra Citadel, a lost Yokudan stronghold, sealed for eternity, and opened up by the Warrior, the Undaunted delvers must defeat his &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra\"&gt;Anka-Ra&lt;/a&gt; forces which occupy the ancient fortress. Undaunted delvers, the greatest on Tamriel, must challenge the Celestial Warrior's army and defeat him in the Hall of the Warrior, deep within the Citadel. They will encounter several powerful adversaries during their endeavor:\n&lt;a href=\"Ra%20Kotu\"&gt;Ra Kotu&lt;/a&gt;.\nRa Kotu is an &lt;a href=\"Air%20Atronach\"&gt;air atronach&lt;/a&gt; of enormous size, and is accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra%20War-Priest\"&gt;Anka-Ra War-Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and an &lt;a href=\"Anka-Ra%20Destroyer\"&gt;Anka-Ra Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Ra Kotu is defeated, the delvers must split up before continuing the trial, as there are now two gates that are open\u2014southeastern, and north\u2014western (right and left).\nThe southeastern group encounters three locked portcullis that must be opened up by the other group in the battlements. The first portcullis that must be passed after the entrance, where in it, oil is spilt in area-of-effect damage, and hordes of Anka-Ra warriors will descend from the gates, and will keep doing so until the portcullis is opened. The next portcullis introduces Gargoyles, exploiting their ability to petrify delvers in a cone attack, and smashing the ground nine times with periodically-increasing damage. The northwestern group climbs to the battlements on which various catapults and ballistae are located, meeting various Anka-Ra and Gargoyles near these siege weapons. The group will also encounter levers on the battlements, indicated by purple lanterns and a few deceased Undaunted lying near them. They are used to open the portcullis of the other group, and it is crucial for them to use these levers for the assault to carry on.\n&lt;a href=\"Yokeda%20Rok%27dun\"&gt;Yokeda Rok'dun&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Yokeda Rok'dun appears, he will cry out an order; \"Unleash our Ra Gada against the intruders! Crush them as we did the Nedes of old!,\" and subsequently the southeastern group must defeat, in order, the first wave, the second wave, and the third and final wave. The first wave is composed of an Anka-Ra War-Priest, and and two pockets composed of one Anka-Ra warriors and two welwae each, coming from the edges of the arena, emerging from sandy tombs. The next wave is composed of two pockets of Anka-Ra Destroyers leading two armored welwae each. The third and final wave is composed of a horde of welwae, both armored and unarmored, several Anka-Ra archers and two Anka-Ra Flame-Shapers.\nAfter these waves are defeated, Yokeda Rok'dun emerges, accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"Enraging%20Welwa\"&gt;Enraging Welwa&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Yokeda%20Kai\"&gt;Yokeda Kai&lt;/a&gt;.\nYokeda Kai is an Anka-Ra Flame-Shaper who, like Rok'dun, emerges from a gate after various enemies have been defeated.\nAfter these battles, both groups open their respective gates to the next section and reunite, but must now face a great army of Anka-Ra and two Gargoyles, along with pairs of War-Priests, Flame-Shapers, and Destroyers. Each of these enemies are guarding the stairs leading to the Hall of the Warrior, the delvers' final destination\nWhen the army is defeated, the delvers must enter the Hall of the Warrior.\n&lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Warrior\"&gt;The Celestial Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere, the delvers travel through a cave tunnel, meeting on the way the Undaunted who came before, &lt;a href=\"Ludippe%20Guegan\"&gt;one of which&lt;/a&gt; is still clinging to life. The delvers must then enter the Hall itself.\nIn the hall, there are two statues that create circles, the right one from the Warrior increasing damage output, while the left one increasing health recovery.\n\"The Shehai of a first rank Ansei sank Yokuda. This Warrior's Shehai is beyond first rank.\"\nThe Celestial Warrior is a fearsome opponent and masterful fighter, and has several abilities in his arsenal. He will make a quote about most abilities while attacking.\nAt the end of the battle, with the Celestial Warrior defeated, he turns into dust and encounters the &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20%28Celestial%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, and, depending on completion of the other two trials in Craglorn, &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Ophidia\"&gt;Sanctum Ophidia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aetherian%20Archive\"&gt;Aetherian Archive&lt;/a&gt;, the following dialogue may differ and include the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Mage\"&gt;Celestial Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Warrior: '\"The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. My sword will claim his neck.\"\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent belongs in the natural order. We will stop him, not murder him.\"\nThe Warrior: \"All talk and no action. Fall in behind me. The Serpent will learn his lesson.\"\nThe Warrior: \"My eyes are finally clear. My sword will claim the Serpent's neck.\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent belongs in the natural order. The three of us will contain him, not end him.\"\nThe Mage: \"Then we should return him to his Apex Stone. And seal it properly. Thrice\u2014if we have to.\"\nThe Warrior: \"To the Serpent's Stone, then. Fall in behind me. The snake will learn his lesson.\"\nThe Warrior: \"My mind is free of the Serpent's thrall. My sword hungers for his neck.\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent has been confined to his Stone. Now, come. There is still the Mage to free from his influence.\"\nThe Warrior: \"That is hearty work\u2014for a Thief. Fall in behind me. I will lead us to glory.\"\nThe Warrior: \"The Serpent no longer clouds my mind. Eyes clear, my sword will claim his neck.\"\nThe Thief: \"The Serpent has been confined to his Apex Stone, and the natural order is restored. But his attention will turn elsewhere. We should depart.\"\nThe Warrior: \"Surprisingly efficient. For a Thief and a Mage. Fall in line behind me. I will take charge from here.\"\nThe Mage: \"How gracious of you.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mindil%20the%20Untested\"&gt;Mindil the Untested&lt;/a&gt; and Kailstig the Axe then meet the delvers once more. Mindil will give the reward for defeating the Celestial Warrior if the quest was not done for a week, Kailstig if the quest was done. The Hall itself is left in ruins.\nIf spoken to Mindil:\n\"My friend, you're victorious! I hope Hel Ra Citadel was fierce enough for you!\"\nIf spoken to Kailstig the Axe:\n\"You've got all your limbs, and you're victorious to boot! My Undaunted friends have yet to arrive. Roaring Romavel must have found a tavern.\""}

It must be dealt with near the end of the &lt;a href=\"Forging%20the%20Future\"&gt;related quest&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt; attempts to hack the main console. \nThe Assembly General attacks two ways with its feet. One is a stomp that sends out grasping limbs, and the other, called Quake, is an attack that knocks all players off their feet and back a few meters. Quake is indicated by the General jumping in order to perform the attack, and this move will only be used if the General has no players actively attacking him. The General will launch bombs out of his back in sets of three, homing in on random players. Two arms, the Truncating Arm and the Enkindling Arm, operate independently of the General's body, and these will attack players on the top platforms. When enough damage is done to an arm, the arm will fall off, and the stump will begin to emit highly damaging sparks. Two factotums will spawn at this time and attack the players. Periodically, the General's head will begin to glow, and he will announce that he is scanning a player. A &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Fascimile\"&gt;Tactical Fascimile&lt;/a&gt; will then be created at the scanned player's location. At 85%, 65%, and 45% health, the General will move into his second phase.\nIn the second phase, the General will move to the center of the arena and begin to launch rockets out of his Enkindling Arm. Four terminals will spawn at each end of the arena, as well as traps such as toxic coolant, spinning blades, and shock fields. Players must defeat the terminals within a short period of time, or they will be subject to a massive amount of shock damage. Standing on the top platforms will cause the players to take shock damage, and standing on any surface except the spinning blades' tracks will cause the players to take damage from the toxic coolant. At 25% health, the General will enter his third phase. \nIn the third phase, the General will again move to the center of the arena and begin to fire guided rockets. These rockets increase gradually in frequency with time."}

When the Hall is done (with or without Cellar) additional wings can be constructed at the &lt;a href=\"Drafting%20Table\"&gt;Drafting Table&lt;/a&gt; that connect to the Main Hall. A maximum of three wings can be added, and each wing has three possible choices. This allows for twenty seven possible combinations on each &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Homestead&lt;/a&gt;, however the choice for each wing once construction is started is permanent.

There are three choices for every wing as is listed below.\nStructure.\nThe main hall consists of ten components that are spilt into seven stages of construction.\nDownstairs Furnishings.\nThe following is a list of all furnishings that can be added to the Main Hall. Furnishings can be built manually at the indoor &lt;a href=\"Carpenter%27s%20Workbench\"&gt;Carpenter's Workbench&lt;/a&gt; or added over a period time if done via a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt;. The cost of asking a steward to furnish entire \u00a0Main Hall is 3,500 .\u00a0The total base cost of buying all the materials and crafting the furnishings oneself is a fraction of the cost, albeit more time consuming.\nAll furnishings are fixed in position and cannot be removed once they are built. The name of the furnishing option does not always accurately describe what will be added, as in some cases additional containers and accessories may be added, along with the main piece of furniture.\nThese furnishings can be built from the &lt;a href=\"Carpenter%27s%20Workbench\"&gt;Carpenter's Workbench&lt;/a&gt; located on the ground floor in the Main Hall. The first \"Square Table\" will appear automatically (beneath the west staircase) if \"Remodel House into Entryway\" is selected at the &lt;a href=\"Drafting%20Table\"&gt;Drafting Table&lt;/a&gt; after building the \"Square Table and Chairs\" inside the small house.\nFor items such as chests and square tables that have multiple instances, the amount given is per instance, but the total reflects all instances combined.\nUpstairs Furnishings.\nThese furnishings can be built from the &lt;a href=\"Carpenter%27s%20Workbench\"&gt;Carpenter's Workbench&lt;/a&gt; located on the second floor of the Main Hall. The Double Bed, Tall Shelf with Display Case, and three Wall Shelves will each appear automatically if \"Remodel House into Entryway\" is selected at the Drafting Table after building the furnishings with those same names inside the small house.\nBack Room Furnishings.\nThese furnishings can be built from the &lt;a href=\"Carpenter%27s%20Workbench\"&gt;Carpenter's Workbench&lt;/a&gt; located in the back room on the ground floor.\nConversion Table.\nThe following table lists the raw materials of building components that can be crafted or the purchase price of raw materials that can be bought. Fractional values indicate that a single unit of raw material will produce multiple units of the product, e.g., a single iron ingot produces ten nails, so a single nail is a tenth of an ingot."}

The populace started calling the known land, the place of their sorrow, the \"Arena.\" &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;389&lt;/a&gt; years after Tiber Septim's conquest, Tamriel has a new threat. Tamriel's Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, celebrates his forty-third birthday. But a &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;jealous heart&lt;/a&gt; desires the throne, and after months of plotting his downfall, he puts his plan into action...\nLocations.\n\"Note: arranged in order of appearance.\"\nCharacters.\nUnnamed.\n\"Note: The following can be found everywhere, depending on level. Not in order of appearance.\"\nIntroduction.\n&lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Talin&lt;/a&gt; awoke in the darkened cell, his head pounding from the blow it had received. A single candle guttered and flamed in one corner. Occasionally the clink of chains could be heard as they swung in a slight, fetid breeze. He knew where he was now. It came back to him even as he struggled to his feet. Fighting off the nausea he made his way to a crude stone bench.\nI have been taken by the Emperor, but for what? His thoughts were interrupted by a low moan that came drifting down the corridor outside his cell door. Suddenly he was glad for the obvious strength of his cell door. I have been left to die, he thought incredulously. They did not even bother to strip me of my possessions. Indeed, upon self-examination Talin found that he still carried his dagger and his pouch of money. It seemed that the Emperor had no fears of his escape. And why should he? He did a quick circumspection of the room, finding that except for the slime covered walls and floor, no water or food had been left. A slow death indeed.\nSuddenly the air near the center of the cell seemed to brighten, slowly coalescing into a globe of brilliance. Talin fell back, shielding his eyes from the glare. The light receded, and in the purple afterimages of that burst he could see the shimmering form of a woman floating, her body draped in gossamer and blown by an unseen wind.\n\"Do not fear Talin, for it is I, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTalin looked on in shock as the figure of his friend took on form and substance, though somehow it did not seem to lose its edge of etherealness. \"Ria! What in the name of the Lady has happened?\"\nRia's face seemed etched in grief, drawn by a sadness he could not comprehend. \"Talin, do you remember the last time we saw each other? It was at the Mid Year's festival. I fear that is where the evil took form.\"\n\"What happened to you?\" Talin asked in a shocked whisper. He had known Ria since he had been summoned to court to learn under her tutelage the ways of Sorcery. Ria had been the senior apprentice to Jagar Tharn, the Imperial Battle Mage of Tamriel.\n\"I am dead, Talin. Only my powers keep me in this form, though the pull to the afterlife is strong. I can resist, but only for a time. It is imperative that someone know the truth; that someone stop the evil which has struck from the heart of the Imperial Seat.\" Talin sat down once more, his legs seeming to no longer obey. Left to die in a cell, my\nfriend already dead? What has happened to us all?\n\"The Emperor is not who he seems to be, Talin. He is in fact, Jagar Tharn. The &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;true Emperor&lt;/a&gt; was captured by Tharn and shifted to another dimension, a prison in which time runs much slower than on this plane of existence.\"\nTalin looked up, his face a mask of shock and outrage, \"But what of the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"The Emperor is not dead. Only in the event of his demise would the Amulet warn the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn was meticulous in his planning. With time in the dimension in which the Emperor has been imprisoned running at a fraction of what it does here, it will be centuries before the true Emperor dies. And when he does, who will care? Those people will have seen the glorious rule of Uriel Septim VII end generations in their past. Tharn must be stopped, here and now.\" Ria's face had a resolute set, one that if Talin had noticed, would have sent shivers of foreboding through his body.\nTalin looked around, \"Why are you here? I am but one, and not skilled in much of anything. Why not go to &lt;a href=\"General%20Warhaft\"&gt;General Warhaft&lt;/a&gt;, or the Imperial Guard?\"\nRia shook her head, \"They have been captured along with the Emperor, and Tharn has transmorphed others to take their places, those who are loyal to him only. I cannot trust anyone else with this Talin. As you said, Tharn will not search for you as he would someone he considered a threat. Most of them are dead already. You can see the disdain the Wizard has for you, not bothering to even bind you in this cell. He does not see you as a threat, and in that arrogance he has made his first mistake.\" For the first time the ghost of Ria Silmane smiled, and to Talin it was as if the sun had come from behind a cloud.\n\"I wish to escape, that is sure. Beyond that I know not what I can do, Ria.\"\n\"Take this,\" at Ria's gesture a &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;ruby key&lt;/a&gt; flashed into being in a niche in the northern wall of the cell, \"it will unlock the cell door. You are in the sewers of the Imperial City. If you make your way west, then south, I can effect your escape.\"\nTalin thought a moment, \"It will not do to have me surface in the City itself, for I would be quickly captured. I think it an uncommon occurrence to see a man pull himself through a grating on a city street. The guards at the least will have questions, ones I will be unable to satisfactorily answer.\"\nRia smiled again, \"I am not as helpless as you may suppose. Even in this form I am able to work my magic, but to do so depletes the energy I use to remain on this plane. Your escape however is paramount to all other considerations. Get to the south-west corner of this sewer. There you will see a Shift Gate. It will transport you to another city, where you will appear inside their city gates. Teleportation between cities is common enough, I doubt you will come under scrutiny. With that you will be far enough from the center of the Empire to begin.\"\nTalin felt a faint fear gnaw in the pit of his stomach and he whispered, \"Begin what?\"\n\"Your training, of course.\"\nThere was an uncomfortable silence as Talin looked at his friend. He did not entirely trust his ability to help her; to really make a difference. The alternative however was to allow the man who had killed his friend to continue the charade. Talin was not one to let a lie go unanswered. Ria concerned him however. Even now he could see the fringes of her form dissipating, and her face took on a worn and lined expression, as if she were tiring. He did not relish the idea of being alone in this, not knowing who he could trust. \"Will I see you again?\"\n\"If you survive these sewers and escape, I will come to you again. There is much I must investigate first so that we may find a way to free the Emperor from the dimension in which Tharn has placed him. Only by his release will the truth come to light. Remember Talin, Tharn has taken on the form of the Emperor, and no one will gainsay his word for yours. Had I been able I would have appeared to the Elder Council, but my body lies close by, forgotten and decayed. In this form I cannot travel far from my mortal remains.\" Ria looked down, her once wheaten tresses hanging limply as the ethereal wind diminished, \"I cannot come to you again as I have now. It takes energy I dare not squander.\"\nShe reached out and touched Talin on the forehead. He felt a slight tingling, like an itch behind his eyes. A moment later it was gone. \"I have linked us so that I can appear to you regardless of the distance, but I will only appear to you henceforth in your dreams. The way is safer and less costly. It is very important that you rest now and again, when you are safe. It will only be during those time that I can reach you.\" Ria looked into Talin's eyes, \"You are entering a dangerous arena, my friend. One in which the players are beings beyond your mortal comprehension. I see in your destiny the ability to transcend. There is a power within you as yet untapped. Look for me when you have gained some experience in the world. You are my last and best hope, Talin.\"\nBefore Talin could respond the form of Ria faded from view. In the deepening gloom Talin could feel the icy fingers of fear creeping slowly back into his flesh. Then the glint of ruby caught his eye. He walked over to the niche and picked up the key. It felt warm to the touch, and strangely comforting. He thought about his friend Ria, dead now though she clung to unlife for the sake of justice. He thought about Jagar Tharn, who had killed his friend and\nattempted his own life. Such evil could not be permitted to grow, or go unchecked. Looking about the cell his purpose became clearer, as if his ruminations had opened a door to the beginnings of understanding. Perhaps Ria had ensorcelled the key to produce this reaction, he knew not, but a litany from his old Armsmaster came to mind and he whispered, \"Given the outcome of certain death, die with a blade in hand.\"\nThe cell door was a massive construction of iron and steel. He paused only a moment to listen. The moaning was gone, but from the darkness he could hear dozens of tiny claws skittering and scratching the damp mossy brownstone. Occasionally red eyes gleamed out at him. Talin inserted the key to the lock and turned it. With a groan the mechanism released and the cell door swung open on rusty hinges. Despite the noise nothing flew out from the darkness to attack. It was as if the sewer itself had decided he was no threat, and turned its back on him.\n\"Tharn,\" he thought, \"you will not escape me so easily.\" Grabbing the candle from its holder Talin drew both breath and dagger as he ventured into the darkened hall..."}

She had a penchant for battle, for testing her skills against stronger opponents. In addition, she practiced dark magics and was a necromancer of the highest order. Unfortunately, the House she belonged to had no love of dark magic and even less tolerence for necromancy. But Mal Sorra didn't care. In fact, her blatant disregard of customs and mores thrilled her and made her blood run hot.\nAs Mal Sorra's need for greater thrills and constant danger drove her to new heights of cruelty and depravity, the necromancer took greater and greater chances. She flaunted her power, even in the face of House officials and Tribunal dignitaries, daring them to scold her or punish her or attempt to stifle her primeval urges. The first to take her unspoken challenge was her own father, the leader of her House and a powerful mage in his own right. Mal Sorra relished the contest, eager to see if she could hold her own against the man who raised her. In the end, Mal Sorra didn't just survive the challenge, she killed her father in a duel of magicka.\nNot content to simply beat her father, Mal Sorra slew him with a barrage of spells and then raised him as a zombie. She commanded the undead creature to follow her and obey her every command. The rest of her house was horrified by this terrible desecration and demanded that Mal Sorra be punished for her blatant use of dark magic. This made Mal Sorra laugh, for she loved showing off her power and displaying her disregard for the current leadership.\nAs Mal Sorra became more difficult and dangerous, her mother decided that enough was enough. She mourned for her child, but refused to allow her evil to continue unchecked. Mal Sorra was surprised when her mother and a cadre of mages entered her private chambers. She was amused by the audacity of the action, but she felt no fear or anxiety. When her mother began casting a ritual, however, Mal Sorra felt the first pangs of danger. And, as always, it exhilarated her. But then the other mages joined in, and for the first time she could remember, Mal Sorra was afraid.\nHer mother drew on dark magic to punish her daughter. She couldn't abide ending her daughter's existence, but she knew she had to end the threat that Mal Sorra posed to the Houses. The dark magic engulfed Mal Sorra, binding her. Trapped within her own dark magic, Mal Sorra was sealed alive inside the very place she spent so much of her time\u2014within the family tomb. Then the mages combined their magic to open a portal. It swallowed the tomb.\n\"I curse you, daughter,\" her mother proclaimed with tears in her eyes. \"I banish you and your evil to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. May the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; show you the mercy you denied your victims.\" And with that, Mal Sorra was never seen on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; again."}

It is the deepest heart of the &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;, where little light reaches the forest floor. The region is dotted by many ancient ruins and &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Orc\"&gt;Wood Orc&lt;/a&gt; settlements. Three major cities are located in this region: the legendary city of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Baandari%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;Baandari Trading Post&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Velyn%20Harbor\"&gt;Velyn Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River\"&gt;Xylo River&lt;/a&gt; runs through this region.\nBackground.\nThe capital of Malabal Tor is Silvenar which is considered to be the spiritual home of all &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;, and serves as the seat of power for the &lt;a href=\"The%20Silvenar\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Voice of the People\" of Valenwood. In the thickness of the region's jungle, where little light penetrates the trees, Bosmer hunters climb to the tops of the trees to see the stars in the night sky.\nIn the summer season, the walking tree city of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; travels to the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Summer%20Site\"&gt;Summer Site&lt;/a&gt;. While most of the population of Malabal Tor are Bosmer, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; (Wood Orcs) also have a presence in the region at the &lt;a href=\"Baandari%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;Baandari Trading Post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dra%27bul\"&gt;Dra'bul&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. The &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; had also situated themselves on the coastal &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Island\"&gt;Tempest Island&lt;/a&gt; and battled the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; there.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Malabal Tor and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nMalabal Tor features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Aldmeri Dominion's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Malabal Tor. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Malabal Tor totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-one books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Malabal Tor and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Malacath's teachings put a large emphasis on conflict, and he seems to enjoy watching mortals fight one another.\nThe summoning date of Malacath is 8th of Frost Fall. However, Malacath can also be summoned at his shrine, if the summoner offers &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Troll Fat&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlane of Oblivion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt; is Malacath's plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. While typically seen as a desolate and unwelcoming place, this spartan landscape is considered a good thing in orc religion, and that orcs who revere Malacath reside in the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Forge\"&gt;Ashen Forge&lt;/a&gt;, a place of perpetual feasting, drinking and battle, where every orc is a chief, and has many wives. The Backbone of Ashpit has also been called an actual backbone, alluding to the possibility that Ashpit may be made from Malacath himself.\nHistory of Malacath.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalacath was created when &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; attempted to stop the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; from leaving the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, who was the mastermind behind the exodus, confronted Trinimac. Details of the account vary, with some claiming Boethiah swallowed Trinimac and spoke with his voice to encourage and teach the Chimer while at the same time mocking the opposed Aldmer, before excreting Trinimac out and the remains becoming Malacath. His followers then became the orcs, who fled from the Isles in shame. However, when &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus Mede&lt;/a&gt; told this story to Malacath disguised as an old woman, the Prince remarked that, \"[y]ou people are always so literal-minded\", indicating that this may not be the whole truth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; calls this version of events \"anti-orc propaganda\". The orcs tell a tale whereby Trinimac was defeated by the treachery of Boethiah and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, and cast into the Ashpit by a curse. Trinimac then tore the shame from his skin, and was reborn as Malacath thanks to that disfigurement and shedding of blood.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; received Malacath's hammer, &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, around 3E 417, after he dealt with a troublesome &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Seducer\"&gt;Daedra Seducer&lt;/a&gt; for the Daedric Prince. After wandering throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the hammer returned to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and came to be in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;, the last living &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, who had the hammer in his closet. At that time all the enchantments on the hammer had vanished, for no apparent reason. It was just a mundane hammer. However, in 3E 433 the hammer came into the possession of Malacath again, and all its powerful enchantments returned. Volendrung is best known for the paralyzing and strength leeching effects it has when hitting an enemy.\nMalacath's mace &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was found in the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt; during time of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;. It changed owners, and finally the mace came to the possession of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; lord, &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;. As any of Fyr's artifacts, it was free for the thieves to steal \u2013 if they could. It might have passed into the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; was an orc leader and the founder of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; the Orc Capital established in 3E 399. Gortwog gro-Nagorm created controversy among orcs because he accused Malacath of being a false god and created a priesthood dedicated to Trinimac the ancient champion of the Aedra. This view contradicted the common belief that Malacath was Trinimac after he was devoured by Boethiah. Gortwog believed that Trinimac was still alive and that Malacath was a demon. His views were regarded as heresy by most orcs.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; crisis, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Attrebus\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; confronted &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; in Umbriel. They discovered Vuhon could not be defeated without recovering the &lt;a href=\"Umbra%20Sword\"&gt;Umbra Sword&lt;/a&gt;. Sul noticed that Vuhon had mentioned that Umbriel was part of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, so he opened a gate so that Attrebus and him could escape. They ended up in another Oblivion plane.\nWhen Attrebus woke up, he was greeted by female elf. The woman told Attrebus she was Silhansa, and that they were in Malacath's realm. Silhansa had healed Attrebus' wounds. Attrebus was shocked that she was naked. Her hair was rosy gold, her skin alabaster white, and her eyes twin emeralds. She had the slender, pointed ears of an elf.\nAttrebus told Silhansa about his adventure to stop Umbriel from destroying &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. He also told her about a tale he had heard about Malacath while he was seven years old. When he finished, Silhansa started to grow, and she transformed into Malacath. Malacath now held both Attrebus and Sul in his hands. Malacath reveals that Sul had sworn an oath to him once. Attrebus manages to convince Malacath to release them and teleport them to Solstheim so that Sul could fulfill his oath. Before leaving his realm Malacath told Attrebus that if he ever had use for him, the prince would know it.\nPersonality.\nDespite his ferocity, Malacath is genuinely caring towards his followers. He refers to his enslaved Ogre followers as his \"little brothers\" and ensures their safety. He has also been known to curse orc chiefs for their negligence. Malacath also allegedly showed sorrow over the death of his mortal son.\nOther mentions.\nMalacath is one of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; Four Corners of the House of Troubles, gods that are sent to test the Dunmer in various ways by inflicting trials upon them. Malacath, or Malak, is considered to be a god-king who tests the Dunmer for physical weakness He is also a demon for the Nords, who typically refer to him as Mauloch.\nQuests.\nMorrowind.\nDuring the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, Malacath was summoned by the Nerevarine in his Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Assurdirapal\"&gt;Assurdirapal&lt;/a&gt;. The Prince of Curses asked the Nerevarine to track and kill the last of the &lt;a href=\"Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt; family line. He was upset that Oreyn Bearclaw took all the glory of a hero while in fact all the deeds were done by Kharag gro-Khar, Oreyn's &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; companion. The target was finally killed by the Nerevarine and Malacath rewarded him the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Oreyn%20Bearclaw%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;. However Malacath was wrong in believing that the Oreyn Bearclaw's family line had ended, as one of the family members was still alive. This person, named &lt;a href=\"Modryn%20Oreyn\"&gt;Modryn Oreyn&lt;/a&gt;, became a rather important person in the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; after his role in the quest to eliminate the dangerous competitor of the guild, the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion.\nMalacath's quest in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; involves the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;'s rescue of another group of outcasts, namely, a group of enslaved &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ogres&lt;/a&gt;. He requires an offering of &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Troll Fat&lt;/a&gt;, and the Hero must be level 10 to start the quest. He will send them to the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Drad%27s%20Estate\"&gt;Home of Lord Drad&lt;/a&gt;, the slave owner, with instructions to free the Ogres without harming them. After speaking with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Drad\"&gt;Lord Drad&lt;/a&gt; and then his wife, an easy way to complete this quest is to simply walk into the mine and ignore the guards. As long as they are not attacked, they will tolerate the Hero's presence, and in a simple manner, go to the two Ogre cages and pick the locks of each of the cell doors. Once freed the Ogres and the guards will fight each other, leaving the Hero to simply pick what he likes from the dead bodies of the fallen. Neither side will attack the Hero as long as he remains passive, and even if one or more of the guards survive they will not care as the Hero loots the chests throughout the mine. Note that even if all the Ogres are killed during the battle with the guards, this will not affect the outcome of the quest.\nAs a reward for finishing the quest, Malacath gives the Hero &lt;a href=\"Volendrung%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, his enchanted two-handed warhammer.\nSkyrim.\nIn , an Orc named &lt;a href=\"Atub\"&gt;Atub&lt;/a&gt; asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to bring her &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;troll fat&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra heart&lt;/a&gt; so that she can pray to Malacath to end the curse he put on her tribe. After doing so, Atub suggests that Yamarz the chief and the Dragonborn join in the summoning. Yamarz begrudgingly accepts, and Atub begins the ceremony. Malacath then speaks to Yamarz, angrily berating him for allowing &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; to desecrate his shrine. He commands Yamarz to go and bring back the giant leader's warhammer. Yamarz orders the Dragonborn to come along with him, stating that the Dragonborn got him into this mess. At the shrine, Yamarz will say that he will pay the Dragonborn to kill the giant. The Dragonborn can accept the deal, but Yamarz will betray them. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can let Yamarz attempt to kill the giant. The chief may die in the process, unless the Dragonborn helps kill the giant. If Yamarz survives, he will betray the Dragonborn in order to claim sole credit for killing the giant. Regardless, once the giant and Yamarz are dead, Malacath speaks again telling the Dragonborn to take Shagrol's Warhammer back to the stronghold. The Dragonborn can either lie to Atub and conceal Yamarz's cowardice/betrayal or reveal the truth of his fate. Malacath speaks once more telling the tribe that they have earned a second chance and appoints a new chief from within the stronghold. Finally, he tells the Dragonborn they have earned his favor with their valorous conduct and to place Shagrol's Warhammer on the shrine to accept their reward. The hammer then transforms into &lt;a href=\"Volendrung%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;."}

Interacting with the statue will cause the Nerevarine to be contacted directly by the Prince of the Spurned and Ostracized about an ancient lie. According to Malacath, a \"hero\" by the name of &lt;a href=\"Oreyn%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt; took the credit for the deeds done by his &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; friend Kharag gro-Khar.

Oreyn is guarded by two others and will openly admit that the \"hero\" that was Oreyn Bearclaw was false. However, if the Nerevarine tells him that they were sent by Malacath, Oreyn will attack (as will his guards). Once Oreyn is dead, the Nerevarine may return to Malacath to end the quest. Malacath will then reward the Nerevarine with the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw."}

Once there, speak with &lt;a href=\"Shobob%20gro-Rugdush\"&gt;Shobob gro-Rugdush&lt;/a&gt;. If the Hero is not an Orc, he may need to be persuaded before he'll give you the quest. Either way, he'll tell you to leave Malacath an offering of &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Fat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Troll Fat&lt;/a&gt;. \nTroll Fat can be obtained from many alchemists throughout Cyrodiil, or harvested from any trolls you slay. Two places where one is guaranteed to find trolls are &lt;a href=\"Swampy%20Cave\"&gt;Swampy Cave&lt;/a&gt; southeast of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tidewater%20Cave\"&gt;Tidewater Cave&lt;/a&gt; on the coast southeast of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have the Troll Fat, return to the Shrine.\nActivate the shrine and Malacath will speak to the Hero. He describes an indignity that has been done to him: a nearby noble has captured several of Malacath's 'servants', &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;, and put them to work as slaves. Malacath finds this distasteful, as only he is allowed to have ogres as slaves, and tasks the Hero to free them.\nLord Drad's Estate.\nHead south east to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Drad%27s%20Estate\"&gt;Lord Drad's Estate&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Drad\"&gt;Lord Drad&lt;/a&gt; and he'll tell the Hero how he earned his riches: enslaving ogres and putting them to work in the &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; underneath his property. As Lord Drad is unwilling to part with his lucrative servants, the Hero will have to free them themselves.\nIf the Hero upsets him by advocating freedom, talk to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Drad\"&gt;his wife&lt;/a&gt; and she'll name the mine which is due east of the manor.\nInstead of picking the easy lock on the mine door, the Hero may enter the house at night and steal the key to the mine. The key is sitting on a small table to the left of the front door.\nBleak Mine.\nEnter the mine and the Hero will encounter several &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Mine%20Guard\"&gt;mine guards&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Mine%20Guard%20Captain\"&gt;captain&lt;/a&gt;.\nEither get a key from the guards by killing them or pickpocketing or pick the lock to the cages which hold the ogres.\nCombat strategy.\nAs the guards are clustered near the front of the mine, the Hero can kill the guards before beginning to free the ogres. This will not count as &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;murders&lt;/a&gt;, nor raise a bounty. Guard kills do count towards the Dark Brotherhood admission, however. Also, they will not go hostile to the Hero unless they see them fighting another guard, so it is easier to just kill the guards one by one before opening the two cells and freeing the six ogres.\nStealth strategy.\nIf the guards are ignored, they will not attack so the Hero can proceed to the cages where the ogres are held. When the ogres are freed, the guards will start to attack them. Then it is six or more armed guards versus fewer ogres. If too many ogres die, the quest fails.\nMalacath's Shrine.\nAfter freeing the ogres, head back to &lt;a href=\"Malacath%27s%20Shrine%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Malacath's Shrine&lt;/a&gt; for the reward: the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20artifact\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Volendrung%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the quest is completed, the Hero can visit Lord Drad and his wife working in the fields night and day and they are being watched over by the freed ogres. When speaking to Lady Drad she will say that she has never seen her husband working so hard in her life. Lord Drad will say that he's terrified of what the ogres might do to him."}

But before Malacath, at least according to certain traditions and a few noted scholars, there was &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; reverberates with the intellectual debate and reverent faith of both sides of the argument: Who is the true god of the Orcs?\nFor traditionalists, there is no question. Malacath is lord and god. He personifies the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. His portfolio includes conflict, battle, broken promises, and anguish. Everything an Orc feels concerning his or her place in the world comes from the Furious One. The Orcs see themselves as a people betrayed, and Malacath reinforces this belief. For Malacath, clans must stand powerful but alone in their ancestral strongholds. The strongest rules and weakness is cast out with extreme intolerance.\nClan chiefs such as &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bazrag\"&gt;Chief Bazrag&lt;/a&gt;, who oppose the idea of an Orsimer king, hold to the teachings of Malacath.\nFor the new Orsimer, Trinimac is the culmination of their dreams and desires. The warrior god personifies culture and civilization. He calls for unity, not discord; for strength, not malicious chaos. He stands for unifying the Orsimer. For elevating us above our baser nature and making us equal to the other races.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt; and the Orsimer of Orsinium follow the teachings of Trinimac."}

The Lord of Ash and Bone doesn't care for any of us. This worship of him is folly and will be the ruin of us all.\nTake this token, for example, this Vengeful Eye my tribe searches so fervently for in dank tombs. The blood that has spilled needlessly for this meaningless trinket is beyond measure. The feud between the Orcs and my tribe has gone on for centuries.

From this point onwards, the Dragonborn no longer receives any more help from Malborn as he needs to get back to the party before Elenwen or her Altmer guards become suspicious.\nAfter infiltrating the Solar and finding a prisoner, two Thalmor guards will enter the dungeon with Malborn in custody. His cover was blown. If Malborn survives, he will go to the &lt;a href=\"New%20Gnisis%20Cornerclub\"&gt;New Gnisis Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, joined by &lt;a href=\"Brelas\"&gt;Brelas&lt;/a&gt; if she had been captured by the Thalmor as well as part of the earlier distraction at the party and survives the escape as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Find%20the%20Thalmor%20Assassin\"&gt;Find the Thalmor Assassin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf he is kept alive during your escape, Malborn can be found in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. He says he wishes to escape to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, but believes the Thalmor have sent a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"J%27datharr\"&gt;J'datharr&lt;/a&gt; to assassinate him. If you kill J'datharr he will award the player a leveled amount of gold and leave Windhelm. When followed, he disappears when he reaches the \"&lt;a href=\"Decree%20of%20Monument\"&gt;Decree of Monument&lt;/a&gt;\" at &lt;a href=\"Refugees%27%20Rest\"&gt;Refugees' Rest&lt;/a&gt;, which means he has crossed the Skyrim-Morrowind border into Morrowind. Though if there are enemies present along the way, he will likely be killed.\nDialogue.\nIn the Winking Skeever:\n\"Yes?\"\nIn the embassy:\n\"What can I get for you? You made it in. Good. As soon as you distract the guards, I'll open this door and we can get you on your way.\"\nConversations.\nMalborn: \"Madame Ambassador, I'm so sorry to interrupt...\"\nElenwen: \"What is it, Malborn?\"\nMalborn: \"It's just that we've run out of the Alto wine. Do I have your permission to uncork the Arenthia red...\"\nElenwen: \"Of course. I've told you before not to bother me with such trifles.\"\nMalborn: \"Yes, Madame Ambassador.\"\nTsavani: \"Who comes, Malborn?

Since there are similar insects with blue wings, the Blue Butterfly is distinguished by the darker coloring along the top edge of the wing and its black body. Catching one yields two &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Butterfly%20Wing\"&gt;Blue Butterfly Wing&lt;/a&gt;s, which are useful as Alchemy &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nBlue Butterflies may be found in temperate areas of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. A good place to look is the tundra around Whiterun, in daylight, during fair weather. In particular the area from &lt;a href=\"Chillfurrow%20Farm\"&gt;Chillfurrow Farm&lt;/a&gt; east to the river will often spawn 6 or 9 or more butterflies. Note that most spawn points spawn a random combination of Blue Butterflies and &lt;a href=\"Monarch%20Butterfly\"&gt;Monarch Butterflies&lt;/a&gt;. Butterflies most commonly spawn in groups of three, although the road from Helgen to Riverwood and down toward Whiterun has several single-spawn points. Unlike plants Butterflies will respawn fairly quickly if the player moves away after collecting them. These locations are the same areas where &lt;a href=\"Torchbugs%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Torchbugs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Luna%20Moth\"&gt;Luna Moth&lt;/a&gt;s may be found in the early nighttime hours. Several such places are near the &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew Meadery&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Whitewatch%20Tower\"&gt;Whitewatch Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The butterflies are also frequently found in clearings and groves."}

They are one of many &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; found living in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarvesting.\nLike most flying insects, the process of harvesting dartwings can be slow-going, although two wings are added to the inventory for each successful catch. Unlike butterflies, dartwings startle easily, and once the player moves near to them it will not be long before they flee the area entirely\u2014thus, they must be captured quickly upon approaching them.\nEarly in the game, a reasonable quantity of dartwings can be obtained in relative safety and without the aid of magic by swimming around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt;. Swimming around the perimeter of the lake, one will encounter groups of 3 small fish swimming near the surface; these fish can be caught for reagents as well, but there will be a group of 3 dartwings hovering just overhead above the surface. It is best to catch the dartwings before the fish, as the former quickly dart away once disturbed whereas the fish will remain. Since this process involves swimming, it may be easiest to carry it out in the first person view. Spotting the group of fish from a distance while under water, then surfacing to line up with the dartwings, then rushing forward to grab as many as possible can be an effective technique. The fish will not startle or swim away and can be harvested themselves for additional reagents afterwards.\nFor faster harvesting later in the game, one can use the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; which will speed the process up significantly. This is because insects caught in this spell's \"field of effect\" are not flung away, but rather remain frozen in place then fall directly to the ground where they may be easily picked up. &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; is great for retrieval or to simply locate items in grassy areas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fish%20hatchery\"&gt;fish hatchery&lt;/a&gt; included in the add-on is the best known location for harvesting. Just cast Ice Storm so that it skims over the water and the frozen dartwings will fall to the bottom. The unique color of the lake floor makes this location ideal for easily locating the frozen dartwings.\nThis technique can also be used inside the garden wing (if built) and if aimed carefully will cause little to no chaos with the placed items. Sometimes casting straight up will cause insects previously unseen to fall."}

They want me to trap some game and return to the Stronghold, probably for a celebratory test. It shouldn't be too hard. I already set up a snare by the water. Now I can just sit back and let the food come to me.\nDay 2\nMy snare trap doesn't seem to be working. I tied it to a stick just like they said, but &lt;a href=\"Lob\"&gt;Lob&lt;/a&gt; gave me a flimsy rope. Either that or the sticks out here are no good. I don't know how they expect me to hunt with such broken tools.\nDay 3\nIt's only been a few days, but I already feel like giving up. I'm hungry and I've gone through all the &lt;a href=\"Bread%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Atub\"&gt;Atub&lt;/a&gt; gave me. By &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, they really expect me to die out here.\nDay 5\nThe &lt;a href=\"Rabbit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;rabbits&lt;/a&gt; here are too nimble to chase down. I thought I could just grab one if I put some bait in my pockets, but the problem is, I don't have any bait. I shouldn't have eaten all the &lt;a href=\"Carrot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;carrots&lt;/a&gt; in my sack but I was hungry.\nDay 6\nMalacath's blessings, I'm alive! I found a cave south of my camp full of &lt;a href=\"Steel-Blue%20Entoloma%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;strange blue mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;, which I immediately ate. I remember Atub saying something about some mushrooms being poisonous, but I didn't get sick so what does she know. Anyways, I ended up filling my sack with them. If I come back with a full stomach maybe I can convince the others we don't need to hunt.\nDay 7\nI came back to &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt; with my sack full of mushrooms and one by one they spit them out and mocked my hunting skills.\nIf that wasn't humiliating enough, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Yamarz\"&gt;Chief Yamarz&lt;/a&gt; took a hammer and crushed the sack, then dumped the contents on my head. None of my tribe mates bothered to defend me, they just stood there and laughed.\nNow Yamarz says I have to go back out there and catch something with some legs. It's not fair. When was the last time he caught anything?\nDay 8\nI'm so hungry. Hunting is impossible. Maybe I'll just die. That'll teach them to leave me out here alone.\nDay 9\nBy Malacath, what just happened? I went back to the cave to pick some more mushrooms, when something must've tripped me because I fell into a pit.\nI yelled out for help, but instead of getting rescued, I was quickly surrounded by a horde of green monsters, hissing and gnashing their teeth. I figured that was it. They were going to eat me.\nBut before I could scream, one of them dropped to his knees and started bowing! The others followed.\nCould they be goblins? You never see them this far north. In any case, they seem to be treating me like an honored guest.\nDay 11\nBlessings of Malacath, it turns out they think I'm a god! They don't seem to treat other Orcs the same, so it must be the blue stains on my face. I need to thank Yamarz for dumping that sack on my head. I think I'll do that, right before I have my goblins claw open his face.\nDay 15\nMy army grows by the day. Soon we'll have enough numbers to overrun the Stronghold. For now I have them collecting the blue mushrooms from Cyrodiil so I can maintain the ruse, although some of them might be starting to suspect.\nThe other day I think one of them saw me use a stick to spread blue paint on my back. I'll need to keep a close eye on him.\nDay 18\nI figured out who it was that saw me, it's that nasty little runt with the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;funny-looking spear&lt;/a&gt;. He reminds me of every Orc back at Largashbur who laughed in my face.\nI tried to grab the spear from him but he must've done something to it because it was too heavy to lift. I don't know if it's &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; or Malacath that's protecting him, but he needs to learn that goblins only have one god. The Blue God. Me.\nDay 21\nThe tunnel the goblins were using to come here from Cyrodiil's collapsed. No matter. My army is nearly big enough to take on the Stronghold, and once that's done I can sell Yamarz's things for a whole wagon full of paint. Before I do that though, I need to make an example of the non-believer.\nOnce he's dealt with, it'll show all the other goblins what happens when you question your god."}

{"id": "1976", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1976", "title": "Boethiah", "text": "Boethiah or Boethia (in &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric script&lt;/a&gt;, ) is the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of deceit, conspiracy, murder, treachery, and sedition who rules over the realm of &lt;a href=\"Attribution%27s%20Share\"&gt;Attribution's Share&lt;/a&gt; and whose sphere is the unlawful overthrow of authority. A violent Daedric Prince, Boethiah is known for their enjoyment in the suffering of mortals.\nThey are worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, who count them among the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;Three Good Daedra&lt;/a&gt; in their pantheon. They can be summoned on the 2nd of Sun's Dusk.\nPersonality and traits.\nLike all Daedric Princes, Boethiah has no absolute gender, and, as such, chooses to appear as male at some times and female at other times. According to their followers, Boethiah acts the most overtly out of all the Daedric Princes. They appear to enjoy battle and conflict, and their cults often stage huge tournaments to the death to win the Prince's favor.\nEven among scholars, who frequently reject the common notion that &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; are all demons, Boethiah is one of the Daedric Princes consistently viewed as evil in most of Tamriel. The Prince uses their followers for bloodsport, even turning on their champion seemingly without reason at times. Like &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah delights in visiting death and destruction upon mortals, whom they actively strive to torment. Yet despite being feared and vilified by most mortals, a markedly different perception is popularly held by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; who, while acknowledging Molag Bal and Mehrunes Dagon to be members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, worship Boethiah as a good Daedroth: one whom they credit with guiding and advancing Dunmeri civilization.\nRelation to the Dunmer.\nCultural development.\nBoethiah is one of the three Daedric Princes (along with &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;) directly responsible for the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; as a distinct race.\nDuring the Merethic Era, some of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedroth&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; as their chief god. These early &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; generally lamented their mortal existence as being caused by the trickery of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who manipulated the gods into giving up their immortality to create &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Boethiah approached a group of Trinimac's followers and began preaching to them an alternative viewpoint: the Aldmer were weak and unworthy of their immortality, and their mortal existence was a trial which all mer had to endure. (The Dunmer often refer to their mortal lifetime as \"The Testing\".)\nTrinimac attempted to stop Boethiah, but Boethiah, being the Prince of Plots, 'tricked Trinimac into going into [their] mouth.' Boethiah then took on the form of Trinimac himself and spoke with Trinimac's own voice. Thus, the Prince was able to convince a group of mer, who took the name &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; (\"Changed Ones\"), and these mer followed their leader &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; to make a new home in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. As for the fallen Aedroth, 'the reanimated dung that was Trinimac' became the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the House of Troubles, infamous as the keeper of the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. Trinimac's remaining followers were consequently changed and became the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. \nBoethiah taught the Chimer many ways to be different from the Aldmer. The source of all manner of cultural advances by the Chimer is credited to Boethiah, ranging from philosophy and magic to their architecture, as well as their current clan-based political system. In most versions of the legend, Azura and Mephala merely aided the Chimer in implementing Boethiah's ideas.\nRoles in religion.\nBoethiah continued to play a key role in the religious practices of the Chimer, even after they became the Dunmer. Along with Azura and Mephala, Boethiah is worshipped as one of the three \"good\" Daedra, in opposition to the four \"bad\" Daedra of the House of Troubles. According to &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; dogma, Boethiah was the Anticipation of Almalexia, and submitted to Tribunal rule. However, given Azura's attitudes towards the Tribunal, who make the same claim about her, this is most likely more propaganda than history.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; following the eruption of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, a new religious movement for the Dunmer people arose, dubbed the \"Reclamations\". This new doctrine declared the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of their previously named Anticipations as the objects for worship. These Reclamations included Azura, Mephala, and Boethiah, who were \"reclaiming their status from the Tribunal.\" Boethiah's role as a Reclamation is to show the Dunmer people the \"true way\" from the Old Tribunal's \"misguided teachings.\" However, it is as yet unknown what this entails exactly.\nEtymology.\nLike many of the Daedric Princes, Boethiah's name appears in numerous variations across many eras and cultures. Their shrine in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; (in the &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; near the border into Morrowind) is called \"&lt;a href=\"Boethia%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;Boethia's Shrine&lt;/a&gt;\", and the spelling Boethia occasionally appears in writings. This spelling appears most often associated with the Daedra's feminine form; though the shrine in Cyrodiil speaks with a masculine voice. Most scholarly texts, such as \"&lt;a href=\"On%20Oblivion\"&gt;On Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20Daedra\"&gt;The Book of Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\", use the form Boethiah.\nAssociations.\nDaedric Artifacts.\nOther than &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah is associated with the artifacts &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fearstruck\"&gt;Fearstruck&lt;/a&gt;. The Ebony Mail can still be found to this day, though it is difficult to obtain. The last known wearer could have been the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Fearstruck on the other hand, according to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20of%20Lyrisius\"&gt;The Story of Lyrisius&lt;/a&gt;\", was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invasion, around &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;.\nEbony Mail.\nEbony Mail is one of the most powerful armor pieces known on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer invulnerability to most common magical attacks and a form of drain health.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; was said to be one of the owners of the mail. It was hidden in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; after the previous owner, a warrior named &lt;a href=\"Helath%20Stormbinder\"&gt;Helath Stormbinder&lt;/a&gt;, lost Boethiah's favor. Following a strange map, the Eternal Champion eventually found the resting place of the mail and retrieved it for their battle against &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, Boethiah also rewarded the Ebony Mail to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; after they finished an elimination job.\nDuring the events of , the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was said to have obtained the Ebony Mail after completing a &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple%20Quests\"&gt;Temple quest&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Tholer%20Saryoni\"&gt;Tholer Saryoni&lt;/a&gt;, during which the Mail was found atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Assarnibibi\"&gt;Mount Assarnibibi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ebony Mail appeared once again during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, this time at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Boethiah requested that the Dragonborn kill the former &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Boethiah\"&gt;Champion of Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, who used the armor for personal gain, rather than in the name of Boethiah. After killing the Champion, the Dragonborn was rewarded with the Ebony Mail.\nGoldbrand.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Apotheosis%20%28Term%29\"&gt;Apotheosis&lt;/a&gt; of the Tribunal, Boethiah's shrine in Morrowind lay forgotten and unused in the northwest of &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, left in disrepair underwater. Boethiah tasked the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; with making a new shrine for worshippers to visit. The Nerevarine asked &lt;a href=\"Duma%20gro-Lag\"&gt;Duma gro-Lag&lt;/a&gt;, a famous sculptor of &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, for assistance. Using the sketch in the book \"&lt;a href=\"Boethiah%27s%20Glory\"&gt;Boethiah's Glory&lt;/a&gt;\", the Orcish sculptor built a new shrine for Boethiah over at &lt;a href=\"Khartag%20Point%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khartag Point&lt;/a&gt; in Vvardenfell. After the new shrine was finished, the Nerevarine was rewarded with &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was also rewarded with this Goldbrand after they finished Boethiah's test\u2014The Tournament of Ten Bloods\u2014a test of combat skill, where the Champion of Cyrodiil had to defeat nine of Boethiah's champions, with the \"Tenth Blood\" being the Champion.\nBy the time of , Goldbrand was rumored to be in the ownership of &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt; when retaking the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther Daedra.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoethiah, along with Azura and Mephala, was responsible for directly influencing the direction of the Dunmer people. Boethiah convinced the Chimer to change from the Aldmer and adopt a new style of life. Azura taught the Chimer the mysteries to be different, while Mephala taught them how to evade their enemies or to kill secretly. Mephala also worked with Boethiah to establish the Dunmer clan-based system.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; doctrine, Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala were named the Anticipations of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nTheir positions changed with the new Reclamations dogma. The former Anticipations became known as the \"Reclamations\" in the face of the new Dunmer religion.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoethiah and Molag Bal have developed a sort of rivalry between each other. The cause is unknown, although it could be because Molag Bal is the Prince of domination and enslavement, whereas Boethiah encourages treason and deceit against authority.\nThe rivalry takes place between Molag Bal and Boethiah, and the two may use their followers to mock the other, which is evident in when Molag Bal requests revenge against a &lt;a href=\"Logrolf%20the%20Willful\"&gt;priest of Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; who desecrated Molag Bal's shrine in the name of Boethiah. However, the extent of their rivalry is unknown.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunger\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hunger is a violent Lesser Daedra associated with Boethiah. It has paralyzing powers and is known to even disintegrate armor.\nThe Hunger also appears in the &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt; part of the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for it being found in the Shivering Isles could allude to Sheogorath\u2019s chaotic nature, thus having another &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince's&lt;/a&gt; lesser Daedra could be normal to him."}

And now you must perform the task for which I created you. You have already proven to possess the needed skills. Go to Solitude. Stalk the Jarl and slay her. I have spread rumors of an assassin. It will make your job harder, but will allow me to place blame where I desire it. You will need stealth and lies to get past her guards. You will assassinate her swiftly and quietly. And if combat finds you, survive the escape. Succeed, and you may keep your title and my armor, and I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Blackness. Failure is not an option.\"\"\nGuards in the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; will initiate the following dialogue when spoken to while this quest is active:\n\"I've been instructed to tell all visitors that the Lady Elisif isn't feeling well. She wishes you a good day, and please call again another time.\"\n\"Yes. Are you enjoying our little walk together? Or perhaps you'd like to come back when the Lady is taking visitors?\"\nIf the Dragonborn tries to run away from the guard, they will say:\nIf they successfully evade the guard, they will say:\nIf the Dragonborn approaches Elisif's room prior to speaking with Falk Firebeard, she will have the following dialogue, spoken through the door:\nHowever, if the Dragonborn speaks to &lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt;, he will have the following dialogue available:\nWhat's wrong with the Jarl? \"She's telling everyone she's sick. But she's really locked herself in her room because she fears an assassin is out to get her.\"\nThe Dragonborn will then be taken to Elisif's chambers, where the following scene will take place outside her room:\nFalk Firebeard: \"Elisif...\"\nElisif the Fair: \"Go. Away. Please!\"\nFalk: \"I've brought a friend. Someone who can help. A bodyguard. To protect you.\"\nElisif: \"I thought you didn't believe I was in danger!\"\nFalk: \"It doesn't really matter what I believe, now does it? I've brought you someone who can protect you. That's what you want, isn't it?\"\nElisif: \"(Sounds of unlocking and unbarring a door) Well, what are you waiting for?!\"\nAfter opening the door, Elisif will hurriedly shout, \"Come in, come in! Shut the door behind you!\" When the Dragonborn approaches her, she will say the following:\n\"I'm glad they finally believed me. About the assassin I mean. It's been so hard since my Torygg passed. No one takes me seriously. So how's this work exactly? Do you just kind of stand there on the look out? That's what Bolgeir does. Well, he sort of looms more than stands. Bolgeir's loyal, but even he doesn't do what I ask. Case in point, this whole assassin thing. Well at least I have you now. Look at me ramble... Well, I guess I'll go about my business sulking in here. You can stand over there in the corner watching for assassins.\"\nThe Dragonborn must then kill Elisif and return to Boethiah. During combat, she will scream, \"Help! Assassin!\" After she is dead and Boethiah is spoken to, the Daedric Prince will have the following dialogue for the Dragonborn:\n\"You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about it. Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you. Remember always this: You need answer to no authority, neither mortal, nor divine... As you will it, so it shall be.\"\nAt this point, the quest will end.\nPost-quest dialogue.\nFollowing the completion of \"Boethiah's Bidding\" (i.e. when the \"DA02Post\" flag has been activated), the player has the following dialogue with Erikur, indicating that he was involved in the plot to kill her.\nAre you doing well, serving as Jarl? \"Ahhh. Quite fine my friend. Quite fine. So sad what happened to young Elisif. Tragic really. Such a young and pretty girl. Was in over her head, I'm afraid. But we should be done with murders in the Blue Palace. I've stepped up security around here.\"\nThe script notes for each piece of Erikur's dialogue are:\nI'm having some difficulties with the guards. Can you take care of that? \"Hmm... Yes, I've heard about all that fuss. I myself know it's all a terrible, terrible misunderstanding. I'm quite sure you're innocent in all this. This one time only, I'll grant you special immunity for any past transgressions, real or perceived. But going forward, I'm sure you realize that your fate is in your own hands.

Upon reaching &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 30, the book \"&lt;a href=\"Boethiah%27s%20Proving\"&gt;Boethiah's Proving&lt;/a&gt;\" will begin spawning in various locations. Once read, the quest will start. Alternatively, if a &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; follower is killed, there will be a copy of the book on the corpse. Another way to start the quest is to go straight to the &lt;a href=\"Sacellum%20of%20Boethiah\"&gt;Sacellum of Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing the first objective of finding the shrine.\nBackground.\n\"I am to lead someone to the Shrine of Boethiah, instruct them to touch the Pillar of Sacrifice, and once trapped by it's magic, slay them. If I do this Boethiah will appear.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest can begin once the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is at least level 30. Upon reaching level 30, the book Boethiah's Proving will spawn in various locations:\nAfter finding the book, reading it will activate the quest, and the location will appear on the map. The Dragonborn will then need to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Sacellum%20of%20Boethiah\"&gt;Sacellum of Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. This step can be easily bypassed simply by approaching the shrine once level 30 is reached. After reaching level 30, it may be necessary to wait for a few days, to ensure all the proper characters spawn.\nAfter finding the Sacellum, Boethia's priestess will speak to the Dragonborn, asking the player to lure an unwitting character to be a sacrifice. At this time, the &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Blade of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; will be given to the Dragonborn.\nHello. \"We are Lord Boethiah's faithful. Have you come to test your mettle?\"\nAny &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; can be taken to the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Pillar of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; to be killed except for &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential characters&lt;/a&gt;. Any of the initiates from any guilds, excluding the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, as their initiates are essential, will also work. Creature followers, like the &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"armored%20troll\"&gt;armored troll&lt;/a&gt;s, do not work, as the sacrifice needs to be a humanoid follower. The Dragonborn should bring the chosen victim to the pillar and tell him or her to use it. The victim will become stuck to the pillar, allowing the Dragonborn to perform a sacrifice. The Blade of Sacrifice can be used, but any other weapon or even a spell will suffice. The &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt; claimed from &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"The%20Whispering%20Door\"&gt;The Whispering Door&lt;/a&gt; can also be used to slay the sacrifice, and is a good choice to restore its enchantment.\n\"Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful. You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise. Tell me, why have you slain this one, who trusted you, here upon my shrine?\"\nAlternatively, one may kill all of the cultists. This will also cause Boethiah to appear, though with slightly different dialogue. When the Priestess is killed, there is a brief moment when her body is lootable before being possessed by Boethiah and drops dead after the conversation below. When she drops dead, her possessions respawn on her body, allowing a second looting.\n\"Ahhhhgh. Wearing flesh is so... distasteful. You have caught my attention, mortal. That is most unwise. Tell me, why have you slain those who profess to follow in my ways?\"\nIf this option is taken, they still tell you to bring a thrall to the altar for sacrifice.\u00a0If\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Knifepoint%20Ridge\"&gt;Knifepoint Ridge&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is traveled to without making a sacrifice, &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Lock%20Outs\"&gt;the lower portion of the mine will still be caved in&lt;/a&gt;. This means that no matter what way you choose, someone has to be sacrificed to complete the mission.\nBoethiah will use the sacrificed body as a conduit. The corpse will be reanimated and the Daedric Prince's will speak through it. After listening to the speech and following the other cultists down the stairs, everyone present will be told to fight to the death in a free-for-all. One strategy is to observe that the other cultists will fight amongst themselves, so holding back and waiting for them to kill each other off before finishing the remainder can reduce the difficulty of the fight. The player can also use ranged attacks.\nIf the Dragonborn has multiple followers active, they can prove to be a formidable line of defense. Essential followers will also be helpful as they cannot be killed.\nCultist 1: \"Our Lord! She has come!\"\nCultist 2: \"(Gasps)\"\nCultist 3: \"She is here, among us.\"\nCultist 1: \"Shhh! Be still. Beware her anger!\"\nBoethiah: \"Listen. All of you! Hear me! I have need of a warrior. Only the most ruthless, cunning, and agile will do. You have gathered here night after night, sacrificing fools upon my shrine, and sparring aimlessly with yourselves. But which among you truly exceeds the rest? Prove yourselves to me! I have a special task for whichever of you is left standing.\"\nAfter defeating them, Boethiah will use the last killed person as a conduit, saying she is bored of her current champion, who now runs his own gang at Knifepoint Ridge. She orders the Dragonborn to kill them all silently, thus denying the current champion any opportunity whatsoever to defend himself.\n\"Well done. You have proven the strength of your will and your tongue's gift for lies. You have shown ferocity and prowess in combat. Now the time has come for a final proving. Are you able to cast aside your honor and strike with the hidden blade?\"\nDespite Boethiah specifying to kill her previous champion in silence, it does not matter whether the Dragonborn achieves this through stealth or otherwise.\nTips for killing the gang silently:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Boethiah\"&gt;Champion of Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; is wearing &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;, a unique cuirass that excretes poison.\u00a0The poison effect does not begin until the champion notices the Dragonborn. Once he is defeated, Boethiah tasks the player with recovering, and wearing, the Ebony Mail. Boethiah will speak to the Dragonborn. Depending on how the Dragonborn conducted the kill, what she says may differ. If you have not killed her Champion in secrecy she will express her annoyance, but ultimately name the Dragonborn her new Champion and reward the Ebony Mail.\n\"I desired stealth and secrecy, but you executed the task with as much subtlety as a enrage mammoth. But my purpose was ultimately gained. My previous champion was erased, and a new one born. If you can learn to be subtle in rendering death, perhaps I will share more of my power with you. You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with your talents. Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you. Remember always this: As you will it, so it shall be.\"\nHowever, if one follows her instructions and uses stealth, she will appear very pleased.\n\"You have done well, my Champion. You have earned my respect, a feat few manage and live to tell about. I shall write your name upon the Tablet of Absolute Darkness. You may keep my Ebony Mail, a token of my appreciation to my new champion. Its gifts will resonate with your talents. Now go. I have strings to pull that require my full attention. You may pursue your own course wherever it leads you. Remember always this: As you will it, so it shall be.\"\nAfter she finishes her speech to the Dragonborn for one final time, the quest will end.\nAlternative methods.\nThere are some alternatives to being forced to sacrifice a companion:\nBoethiah's Bidding.\nThe game files reveal an unused quest called \"Boethiah's Bidding\" (\"DA02KillObj\") which has the objective \"Assassinate the Jarl of Solitude,\" &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;, and the log entry, \"Lord Boethiah has sent me, her champion, to assassinate the Jarl of Solitude using guile, deception, and stealth.\" The activation of the subsequent quest \"DA02Post\" would have made &lt;a href=\"Erikur\"&gt;Erikur&lt;/a&gt; the new Jarl of Solitude."}

How shall I measure the worth of your existence?\"Stunned by the power of her voice, he bowed before her darkening visage.She clapped her hands, and he too was gone.To the third:\n\"And you, tell me, how shall I know you apart from such as were they, of whom there is no trace?\"Shaken and speechless from the nullifications of his brethren, he whispered:\n\"Have mercy upon us!\"She blinked twice. Once, he was in agony. Twice, he was destroyed.She cast a withering glance across those remaining and said:\n\"I do not grant mercy.\"And so it was with the others. She putting them to proof, they offering none.Finally she came to me, eyes aglow with anger, tongue wet with hate, and said:\n\"Of all my believers, but two remain. Tell me, second-to-last, with what shall you prove your existence?\"Without hesitation I drew forth my blade and buried it in the chest of the other who stood beside me, and without fear replied:\n\"Ask him whose blood now sprouts from my blade if I exist.\"She smiled. And the gates of Oblivion opened between her teeth. Then she said:\n\"Tell me, now-last of my followers, wherefore do you remain where the others do not?\"I retrieved my blade, and offered it up saying:\n\"I am alive because that one is dead. I exist because I have the will to do so. And I shall remain as long as there are signs of my handwork, such as the blood dripping from this blade.\"Accepting my gift, she nodded and said:\n\"Indeed.\"\n~If in reading, your blood boils in your veins, and your mind blazon with fire, then Boethiah calls you. It is then most wise to heed her call. Find her on the mount which overlooks Windhelm. Meet us there and be tested.~"}

The quest is given to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; at his ruined shrine.\nBackground.\n\"\"What do you want with me, mortal? My shrine is in ruins, my priests have forgotten me. Will you rebuild my shrine, mortal? Restore it in all its glory? Accomplish this, and I will reward you. You will be the bearer of Goldbrand, my sword of legend. There is one who can help you do this for me. Listen... Rough hands to smooth stone, Carving rock instead of bone, In Caldera an artist waits, His masterpiece to create. Find the one who may shape the rock. Go.\" \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest may be obtained in two ways. One way is to locate the &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Shrine%20to%20Boethiah\"&gt;Ruined Shrine to Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; during exploration and activate the shrine to speak with &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; directly. The ruined shrine is underwater off the western coast, west of &lt;a href=\"Ashurnibibi%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashurnibibi&lt;/a&gt;. The other method is by encountering a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; while exploring the &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt; region, named &lt;a href=\"M%27aiq%20the%20Liar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;M'aiq the Liar&lt;/a&gt;. Who will inform the Nerevarine of a sunken shrine to a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;. Investigation of the area offshore, of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, near Hla Oad does, indeed, reveal a sunken Daedric Shrine, in the middle of which, lies a broken statue of Boethia. The Nerevarine must swim to the bottom of the sea to activate the statue's head. Then the voice of Boethia will be heard, requesting that the Hero restore his shrine to all its glory, and in return, will offer the legendary sword, &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolving Boethiah's riddle.\nAt this point Boethiah gives the Nerevarine a riddle to solve, referring to Boethiah's chosen sculptor, who must rebuild the shrine. The riddle specifies the town of &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, asking locals about a sculptor, the Nerevarine will be directed to &lt;a href=\"Verick%20Gemain\"&gt;Verick Gemain&lt;/a&gt;, the trader, who may know of one. Verick will mention that there is an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; who \"likes to carve up some stones\" living in &lt;a href=\"Ghorak%20Manor\"&gt;Ghorak Manor&lt;/a&gt;. On the top floor of the manor, lives &lt;a href=\"Duma%20gro-Lag\"&gt;Duma gro-Lag&lt;/a&gt; who is standing next to a large stone. The Orc will inform the Hero, that he is, indeed, a sculptor. Duma will agree to build the new shrine, however he will request that the Nerevarine both fund the project, and obtain a 'statue book' for him, to use as reference. He does not know the name of the book, and will say: \"Ask book guys.\"\nThe statue book.\nAny bookseller will give the same information, although, the nearest bookseller is &lt;a href=\"Dorisa%20Darvel\"&gt;Dorisa Darvel&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;. They will advise to check with &lt;a href=\"Jobasha\"&gt;Jobasha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, as he deals in hard-to-find books. After finding &lt;a href=\"Jobasha%27s%20Rare%20Books\"&gt;Jobasha's Rare Books&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Quarter%20Lower%20Waistworks\"&gt;Foreign Quarter Lower Waistworks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;., the Nerevarine will ask Jobasha about a \"statue book.\" Jobasha will indicate a book that he sells called &lt;a href=\"Boethiah%27s%20Glory\"&gt;\"Boethiah's Glory\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhartag Point.\nHaving obtained the funds (2,000 ) and the book, the Hero must return to Caldera and speak with Duma again about the statue. Duma, then, tells the Nerevarine that he will begin construction of the shrine at &lt;a href=\"Khartag%20Point%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khartag Point&lt;/a&gt; and to meet him there after twenty one days have passed.\nThe new shrine.\nTwenty one days later, the Nerevarine may head to Khartag Point, which is just north of &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt;, to find the new shrine. To complete the quest, the statue of the Daedric Prince must be activated. Then, Boethiah will thank the Nerevarine and give the legendary sword, Goldbrand, as reward."}

The Hero is informed by one of Boethia's followers that in order to summon the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, they must give a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedra heart&lt;/a&gt; as an offering to &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Boethiah\"&gt;the statue&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nBoethia's shrine.\nObtain a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedra's Heart&lt;/a&gt; and go to &lt;a href=\"Boethiah%27s%20Shrine\"&gt;Boethiah's Shrine&lt;/a&gt; which is southeast of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; and just southeast of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Naso\"&gt;Fort Naso&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter activating the shrine, Boethiah speaks for a while and then opens a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Boethia\"&gt;Realm of Boethia&lt;/a&gt;, for the Hero to compete in the \"Tournament of Ten Bloods.\" In the tournament the Hero must defeat all of Boethia's potential champions. Each one of the champions represents a different race. Enter the gate by activating the gate pillar on either side and select the \"I'm ready\" option.\nOblivion plane.\nIn the Oblivion Plane there are several large gates one after another. Behind each of these gates is a levelled, hostile opponent called a Boethiah's Chosen. The Hero must defeat each in turn to open the next gate. Before each gate appears Boethia will give them some information on each of them.\nThe Hero can rest an hour between fights to recover &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;, as long as they don't get too close to the next gate to trigger Boethia's pre-battle introduction. This is fairly easy to do by simply standing in front of each gate and letting the Chosen charge out, in effect having the combat in the zone belonging to the previous Chosen.\nAfter the Hero has defeated them all, Boethiah will open another portal, for them to return to his shrine. Upon activating the portal there is the option of either going through or to go back to loot the bodies of the slain Chosen. An alternative strategy is to drag the first Chosen onto the bridge to use as a container and then, after the defeat of each subsequent Chosen, ferry the desired items back to the container Chosen. Chosen left in areas other than on bridges may vanish (tested, PC) after traversing enough gates to enter a different zone and seeing a loading area message along the way back to the starting area. After the final combat, the Hero can then pick and choose which items to return with. The container body will not return even if grabbed while activating the gate.\nBack at the shrine.\nWhen coming back to Boethia, approach the shrine and he will reward the sword &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;.\nTournament of Ten Bloods.\nDuring the Tournament, Boethia will announce each of the Chosen, both when encountered and when killed. They may appear in any order.\nThe Altmer Chosen:\n\"Your High Elf opponent is cool and confident. Go! Let the contest begin.\"\n\"The price of failure? A final fanfare for the High Elf. Farewell.\"\nThe Argonian Chosen:\n\"Beyond this gate is my Argonian challenger. She is a clever thing, and eager for your blood.\"\n\"How sad. The Argonian was a poor thing. Let her go.\"\nThe Breton Chosen:\n\"Here you face the swift and subtle Breton. Go through the gate, Chosen, and test your fate.\"\n\"What a pity. For the Breton, it is over.\"\nThe Bosmer Chosen:\n\"Through the gate, my Wood Elf waits! Hurry, and do not disappoint me.\"\n\"Alas, for the honor of Valenwood, the Wood Elf has fallen.\"\nThe Dunmer Chosen:\n\"The Dark Elves are my favored people. But I am fair-minded... the outcome is in your hands.\"\n\"A valiant effort, Dark Elf, but take comfort. Your spirit is mine.\"\nThe Khajiit Chosen:\n\"My Khajiit is quick and cunning! Go! Seek him out! See whose blood is quicker.\"\n\"Another one bites the dust. The Khajiit is done.\"\nThe Nord Chosen:\n\"This Nords is an animal... a glorious beast. Watch her teeth... she bites!\"\n\"I must confess... that Nord was a disappointment.\"\nThe Orc Chosen:\n\"The gate is open. Go forth and greet my Chosen Orc.\"\n\"Alas, poor Orc. This was not your finest hour.\"\nThe Redguard Chosen:\n\"Greet the war-hardened Redguard! Fight for my glory, Chosen One!\"\n\"In the scales of testing, Redguard, you are tried and found wanting\"\nAfter the last one is killed, Boethiah says:\n\"\"The others are dust! You alone, &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29%23Playable_races\"&gt;&lt;Player Race&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, remain. First and last! Go now! Beyond the next gate, your portal waits.\"\""}

These avatars, always tricky and often unpredictable, can appear as males or females, &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; or some other race. They usually insert themselves into important or momentous events, working behind the scenes to drive such events to a conclusion that serves the will of their secretive master.\nAvatars of Boethiah often issue challenges and trials intended to test the mettle of worthy heroes and common folk alike. Their motivation is never clearly stated and usually obfuscated, but are always assumed to be a part, either small or large, of the greater machinations of their master.\nWhen these challenges and trials come to an end, usually when the task assigned by the masked avatar is accomplished, it is common for the avatar to disappear without a trace. This often leads to mysterious stories, strange legends, or, at the very least, a level of confusion among those who participated in the challenge."}

Pelagius was effectively removed from the throne in 3E 153 due to his ailing mental health. Katariah assumed regency in that year, and her husband died soon thereafter. She then assumed full rule over the Empire, the first to have no relation whatsoever to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to do this. Many assert that the true Septim line ended with Katariah due to her race; however, her defenders are quick to point out that she had a son by Pelagius, thereby continuing the true Septim bloodline. She is the third woman to hold power over all of Tamriel in the Third Empire, first as Regent and later as Empress. Despite racist claims to the contrary, her forty six-year reign was arguably the most glorious in Tamriel's history.\nKatariah was uncomfortable in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and during her reign traveled extensively throughout the Empire. Such a cosmopolitan attitude had not been seen since Tiber Septim's day. She repaired the damage her eccentric husband had caused on the diplomatic front, and she strengthened foreign ties and alliances. She was a very popular monarch; the people came to love her far more than the nobility did.\nKatariah died in a minor skirmish in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20200\"&gt;3E 200&lt;/a&gt;. This event is a favorite source for conspiracy-minded historians. The sage Montalius' discovery of a disenfranchised branch of the Septim family's involvement with the skirmish proved a revelation. She was succeeded by her son &lt;a href=\"Cassynder\"&gt;Cassynder&lt;/a&gt;."}

Determined to use its divine powers to create a new god for the exclusive benefit of the Dwemer, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; forged three great enchanted artifacts, which are called Kagrenac's Tools. &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted gauntlet to protect its wearer from destruction when tapping the heart's power. &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted hammer to strike the heart and produce the exact volume and quality of power desired. &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; is an enchanted blade that is used to flay and focus the power that rises from the heart.\nOne account states &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; used this dagger to slay King &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and cut out the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; from his body.

Unbeknownst to them, Voryn Dagoth did not die from their conflict but had secretly connected himself to the Heart long ago, turning into &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a divine being himself.\nSunder, along with Keening, was subsequently lost during an annual pilgrimage to the Heart some time in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dagger came into the possession of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Odros\"&gt;Dagoth Odros&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;.

With the help of a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious warrior&lt;/a&gt;, Mel Adrys was able to destroy the Vampires of Shademist Moors, freeing the town of Longhaven from torment. But remnants of the Keerilth Clan had survived the ordeal, some remained in the Shademist Moors while others expand their group to the business side of things. &lt;a href=\"Galereth\"&gt;Galereth&lt;/a&gt; was a member of the Keerilth Clan and is commonly known through myth as the Wild Witch. The only person who can cure people of &lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.

There have been several moments where the Keerilth Clan had encountered the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; of the faraway city-state of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;. The Keerilth Clan had delved into the &lt;a href=\"Glittering%20Grotto\"&gt;Glittering Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, in search of rare gemstones, for whatever reason they see fit. But unfortunately, the Thieves Guild was able to bypass their guards and take the gems for the Guild. At one point, the Thieves Guild Agent had encountered the Maiden in the Mist, though it is unknown whether the two had fought each other. Whatever happened to the Keerilth Clan is unknown, they have likely continued their search for gems and other oddities."}

In appearance, they were humans with tan brown skin. They inhabited central &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the Cyrod hinterlands by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and were described, along with the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, as \"barbaric\" races.\nCulture.\nTheir culture was at one point almost entirely oral, though they had developed glyphs and amulets inscribed with markings. According to Seif-ij Hidja of Black Marsh, the barbarous tribes that inhabit the \"\" (as he puts it) of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; all share strikingly similar tastes in apparel. In his book series, \"Racial Motifs\", he states that the tribal, clannish races \"simply disdain all ideas of tasteful restraint, preferring the lurid and bizarre,\" rather than being less sophisticated than other cultures. He also mentions typical accouterments common in the different tribes, such as \"skulls, antlers, feathers, strings of teeth, accents of beaten copper, and weapons ostentatious in size and number,\" although nothing is specifically connected to the Keptu. The Keptu were among the races enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zuathas%20the%20Clever-Cutting%20Man\"&gt;Zuathas the Clever-Cutting Man&lt;/a&gt; was described as \"a &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt; with a Keptu name\" during \"Slave Queen\" &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;'s uprising in 1E 242\u2013243.\nHistory.\nThe Keptu lived in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; eras, alongside many of the other early &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic peoples&lt;/a&gt;. Though unpolished and barbaric, the Keptu were far from primitive, and were among the earlier pre-&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; civilizations to discover techniques for refining stone.\nThey constructed the &lt;a href=\"Bloodroot%20Forge\"&gt;Bloodroot Forge&lt;/a&gt; atop a large source of &lt;a href=\"nirncrux\"&gt;nirncrux&lt;/a&gt; in a secluded Jerall valley with &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s assistance, a massive and powerful magical forge rivaling the architectural feats of the Ayleids and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. It harnessed the power of lava flows to smelt the tribe's ore and heat their metals, though also served a more occult purpose as a temple to worship dark gods and practice dangerous rites of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Magic\"&gt;Blood Magic&lt;/a&gt; with the use of iron, nirncrux, and lava. The &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s enslaved many Keptu around the &lt;a href=\"Niben\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt; during the early First Era before their empire fell. Due to the usage of \"Nede\" as a catch-all term for Merethic Era humans, the Keptu are inconsistently described as being Nedes and as a separate race from Nedes. &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; to the Nedic healer Zuathas the Clever-Cutting man, who had a Keptu name, and tended to the wounds he received after a battle with the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow the Keptu people faded from prominence is unclear, but most Nedic cultures were already in decline by the time the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; set foot in Volenfell by &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;. It is suggested that they had ancient cultural interchange with the clans of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, who adopted parts of their cultural styles.\nLegacy.\nIn the \"Long Night\" after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; circa &lt;a href=\"1E%202762\"&gt;1E 2762&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; priestesses of &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Diblashuut&lt;/a&gt; painted their ankles in the same fashion as the extinct Keptu. By the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, ancient Keptu sites had become ruins and were shunned by the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;s as places of evil. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; descended from the Keptu formed the &lt;a href=\"Dreadhorn%20Clan\"&gt;Dreadhorn Clan&lt;/a&gt; and reclaimed the Bloodroot Forge, meddling with the long slumbering smithies to infuse themselves with nirncrux. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Gherig%20Bullblood\"&gt;Gherig Bullblood&lt;/a&gt; met with the &lt;a href=\"minotaur\"&gt;minotaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Domihaus%20the%20Bloody-Horned\"&gt;Domihaus the Bloody-Horned&lt;/a&gt;, who recognized his Keptu amulet, and together they used blood magic to awaken the forge."}

{"id": "1439", "revid": "54004261", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1439", "title": "Khajiit", "text": "Khajiit are one of the ten default playable races in . They are one of the &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;beast races&lt;/a&gt; which inhabit the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, primarily their home province of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. They are known for their natural agility, stealth, and their production of &lt;a href=\"moon%20sugar\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt;, which can be refined into &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;. Khajiit differ from humans and elves not only in their skeletal form and the fur that covers their bodies, but in their metabolism and digestion as well. Khajiit lifespan is similar to humans. They travel around selling their wares but are not usually trusted, due to the racial prejudice of many of the races in Tamriel, resulting possibly from the belief that most Khajiit are thieves. They usually talk about themselves in the third person, such as with &lt;a href=\"J%27zargo\"&gt;J'zargo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nThe Khajiit religion, while quite different from that of men and mer, is still clearly derived from the old &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The Khajiit creation myth includes references to powerful ancestor cats with strikingly familiar names. Their legends start with the original litter mates, Ahnurr and Fadomai (&lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;). These two gave birth to all of the great spiritual children, including Alkosh the first cat (&lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;), Khenarthi (&lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;), Magrus (&lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, and S'rendarr (&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;). A second litter of children soon followed, including Merrunz (&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;), Mafala (&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;), and Sangiin (&lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;), among others. Ahnurr did not want further children, but Fadomai was persuaded by her elder children to birth one more litter, this final group containing Azurah (&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;), Nirni (&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;), and the moons. At this, Ahnurr became angry at Fadomai, who fled to the void, and birthed one last child, Lorkhaj (&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;). Fadomai knew she was dying, her life having been drained by her birth, but she gave to Nirni a gift, that she would birth children of her own.\nNirni went to Lorkhaj, asking him to form a dwelling place for her children. This he did, but he tricked his siblings, forming the mortal plane and trapping many of them there with him. Most of Fadomai's first litter were trapped, while her second litter saw the danger and fled. Into this dwelling, Nirni birthed many children, the various human and mer races of Tamriel. However, one of Fadomai's children, Azurah, had also been given a gift by their mother. She was given permission to take one of Nirni's children, and reshape them to her own liking, so long as she made them the fastest, cleverest, and most beautiful of all creatures. Azurah chose a group of forest dwellers among Nirni's children, and from them, she formed the Khajiit. Nirni was furious at this, and asked her sibling &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffer\"&gt;Y'ffer&lt;/a&gt; to punish the Khajiit. He did this by turning their grasslands into a dry desert, and their forests into poisonous marshes. The Khajiit, however, were protected by Azurah, who taught them the secret of the moons (the Lunar Lattice in Khajiiti terms), and how to change their shapes to survive. Those forest dwellers who stayed true to their mother, Nirni, were turned into the Bosmer, and given the lush forests of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; as their home.\nThere is some speculation as to how accurate this creation myth truly is. What is known is that Khajiit were present on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; first explored the region, presumably long before there was any established &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; kingdom. What is not known is how long those Khajiit were in the area, nor how many other mer expeditions landed on Tamriel prior to the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i immigration (evidence suggests at least one other mass immigration of elves to Tamriel, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;). Some &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; scholars believe the Khajiit evolved naturally from non-sapient cats, much like they believe the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; evolved from non-sapient lizards. &lt;a href=\"Topal\"&gt;Topal&lt;/a&gt; described the Khajiit as two and four legged cats with only primitive behaviors, and no clear signs of intelligence. However, Ayleid legend tells of bartering ownership of the forests of Cyrodiil from the Khajiit in exchange for the secrets of literacy, and Pelinal Whitestrake, early in the First Era, claims to have fought and killed thousands of clearly organized, sapient Khajiit warriors, believing them to be Aldmeri.\nThe moon is very important to the Khajiit, for the moon decides what body type they take on.\nCulture.\nThe Khajiit, along with the Argonians, inhabited Tamriel long before the elves arrived (which could mean the two beast races are possibly native to Tamriel, unlike humans or mer, which migrated to Tamriel. However, some sources say life originated in Tamriel). Topal the Pilot, founder of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20empire\"&gt;Ayleid empire&lt;/a&gt;, described a primitive but intelligent race of feline humanoids inhabiting the forests around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; when he arrived there with his expedition in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the elves and humans drove the beast races into the southern extremes of Tamriel, into the forests and marshes that humans considered uninhabitable.\nThere are conflicting records about the relationship between the different tribes before and after their agreement to form a unified race and the foundation of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20309\"&gt;2E 309&lt;/a&gt; by two powerful factions. Older studies claim that there was constant warfare between the tribes before that date, and a rebellion against the union only ended when an alternate rule, depending on the states of the moons, between the different tribes was agreed on. The \"\" disagrees with this view and instead places the time of harmony through alternate rule before the union of 2E 309, claiming it stabilized the region for thousand years. The balance was only disrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, which decimated the Khajiiti population and forced them into two opposed faction, which then were united in the year 2E 309. Soon after, the Cyrodilic Empire began making diplomatic overtures with Elsweyr, leading up to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s unification of the entire continent.\nImperial influence has chiefly been felt in the southern regions of Elsweyr, where relatively large, semi-permanent cities have sprung up along trade routes. These cities are known to move around frequently, but within a small region in the jungles near the river basins. The primary source of income in Elsweyr is their export of moon sugar, which is used to make the highly addictive drug &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, a sizable portion of the Khajiiti southern population are \"sugar tooths,\" slang term for a skooma addict, although they seem to be more able to function under the influence than other races. The fertile grounds near the southern rivers are also well suited for other crops, particularly saltrice, which makes up the bulk of the legal trade. The northern regions, still mostly dry grassland, have not progressed far from their tribal origins, and rarely consider themselves united in any meaningful way.\nThe government of the Khajiit consists primarily of the &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Mothers\"&gt;Clan Mothers&lt;/a&gt; of each clan of tribes. These wield power mostly due to their control of moon sugar harvests, but also maintain a hereditary position of power. The nominal head of the Khajiiti religion is a unique form of Khajiit known as the Mane. Khajiit legend claims that it is only possible for one mane to live at a time, and his birth is triggered by the birth of a newborn Khajiit when the two moons have fully aligned in the sky. The Mane is apparently bipedal, and clearly has the power of speech, but does not fall into any of the defined Khajiiti subtypes: he is simply unique. While he is, in theory, a neutral, unbiased religious leader, the Mane is the true power in Elsweyr, and was ultimately responsible for the success of the attempted unification of the province in the last Second Era.\nKhajiit, like &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, are still considered little more than beast-men by many human and mer cultures. They are not usually trusted by\u2014mostly\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, but also by people in general, as stated by &lt;a href=\"Ysolda\"&gt;Ysolda&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. They were oppressed and enslaved by rich families and primary industries in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, until very recently when King &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; finally outlawed slavery. They also have a strong racial dislike for Argonians (one which is shared in return), which causes tension in the southern Cyrodilic cities of Leyawiin and Bravil, where Elsweyr and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; are both fairly close, and which have strong populations of both races.\nThe settled Khajiit of southern Elsweyr are noted for their mercantile traditions and a stable agrarian aristocracy based on sugarcane and saltrice plantations. They were also quick to adopt Imperial ways. The nomadic tribal Khajiit of the north are aggressive and territorial tribal raiders who cling to their warlike barbarian tradition. They are periodically united under tribal warlords.\nRacial advantages and disadvantages.\nMany Khajiit disdain weapons in favor of their natural claws. They make excellent thieves due to their natural agility and unmatched acrobatic abilities. Many Khajiit are also warriors, although this is mainly true of the Cathay and Cathay-raht, while the other breeds are quadrupedal - either muscular and extremely hardy or lithe and very agile. In addition to their native quickness, Khajiit have developed a natural proficiency in stealth, and have the added benefit of native night vision. These skills, combined with the general tendency of humans and elves to look down on them as \"beasts,\" lead many Khajiit outside of their home province to become bandits or professional thieves and assassins, such as the hired Khajiit assassins from the Dark Brotherhood.\nMany Khajiit like to adorn themselves in piercings, and interestingly after are the only race other than Argonians that still do.\nKhajiit are rarely seen at sea, preferring instead to trade via land routes. If necessary they may take a boat for the purpose of the movement of skooma, however most hold little love for the ocean, viewing sailing as a grueling task.\nNames.\nMany Khajiit names contain a prefix or suffix (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Vasha\"&gt;Vasha&lt;/a&gt;). Khajiit names do not necessarily contain an apostrophe, but are most commonly written that way. Common prefixes and suffixes are shown below:\nFemale prefixes and suffixes\nMale prefixes and suffixes\nNonspecific prefixes and suffixes\nMoons and the Khajiit breeds.\nPhases of the Moons.\nBoth a Khajiit's appearance and physiology depend on the Lunar Lattice of &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; during the time of its birth. These appearances can vary drastically from one breed to another, with some Khajiit resembling the common house cat, other Khajiit resembling huge bipedal jaguars, and others being almost indistinguishable from Men or Mer.\nThe main variants of Khajiit can be separated into four distinct groups, each depending on the phases of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;'s larger moon, Masser. Depending on the phase of Masser, the Khajiit will take on one of four main appearances.\nWithin the four groups are more variants which depend on the phase of Nirn's smaller moon, Secunda. The variations due to Secunda are more subtle than the variations due to Masser. Secunda's phases determine how bestial any born Khajiit appears; during its waxing phase a Khajiit appears less bestial, while during its waning phase a Khajiit will appear more bestial.\nKhajiit breeds.\nIn all, there are seventeen known breeds of Khajiit, though there are supposedly more than twenty:"}

Many Khajiit in Morrowind are &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;, usually alongside &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. It should also be noted that in Morrowind, Khajiits along with Argonians do not have the ability to bear helmets covering the face and bear any boots due to the limitation of their physical attributes.\nStrategy.\nKhajiit start off with a &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Class%29\"&gt;thief-based&lt;/a&gt; skills. In battle, they rely on speed and quickness to deliver small amounts of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Short%20Blade%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;short swords&lt;/a&gt;. Hand-to-hand combat cannot be underestimated either when caught in a fight without a weapon, a skill that the Khajiit are famous for using due to their clawed hands."}

The Khajiit found in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; are mainly &lt;a href=\"Cathay\"&gt;Cathay&lt;/a&gt;.

In addition to their natural agility, Khajiit have the benefit of &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;night vision&lt;/a&gt;. These skills, combined with the general tendency of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; to look down on them as \"beasts,\" leads many Khajiit outside of their home province to become &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; or professional thieves and assassins.\nUsage.\nProficient with &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;unarmed&lt;/a&gt; combat, Khajiit perform best in close-range stealth situations. Their Night-Eye &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Power\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt; allows them to see in dim illumination, augmenting their inclination toward stealth tactics. Their stunted &lt;a href=\"Willpower%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Willpower&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and lack of proficiency in magic skills makes them ineffective &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The willpower weakness can however be offset by choosing the birthsign of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Lady\"&gt;The Lady&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Demoralize\"&gt;Demoralize&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Schools%20of%20Magicka\"&gt;school of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; works well for Khajiit. Because Khajiit function best when undetected, demoralize causes foes to flee, giving Khajiit the opportunity to play to their advantages when they can no longer rely on stealth. But even when all hope for stealth is lost, the Khajiit still perform fairly well in combat, with their agility decreasing the chances of being staggered, increasing the damage they deal with bows and their proficiency with blades and light armor serving them well in a fight.\nHand to Hand benefits.\nMuch like &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, Khajiit can have incredibly high Hand to Hand (85\u2013100) skill at very low levels (1\u20132) through use of certain acquirable items, racial bonuses, &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, and taking it as a major skill."}

They revere &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn's&lt;/a&gt; two moons &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, and have a weakness for anything sweet.

Most Khajiit will also refer to themselves in the Third Person and, depending on war faction, swear allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;."}

Khajiit are one of the &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;beast races&lt;/a&gt; which inhabit the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, primarily their home province of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. The Khajiit have feline appearance and sly accent common to &lt;a href=\"Cathay\"&gt;Cathay&lt;/a&gt;, however their type is not specified. Most Khajiit in Skyrim speak in third person. Along with the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, they are referred to as the beast-races of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, Khajiit have a negative public image. They are the rarest race encountered in \"Skyrim\", most commonly found only in &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20Caravans\"&gt;caravans&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities and professions.\nKnown for their natural agility and &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;, many Khajiit disdain &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; in favor of their claws. When involved in &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, they will flatten their ears, narrow their eyes, and show their teeth (similar to a real-life cat). Due to their stealth &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt;, beguiling wit, and latent agility, they make adept &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMany Khajiit are also &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;, although this is mainly true of the &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt;, a breed taller and more powerful than the Cathay that are rarely found outside Elsweyr. The Cathay found in Skyrim are much more agile and in addition to their natural agility and proficiency in stealth, they have the added benefit of &lt;a href=\"Night%20Eye%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;night vision&lt;/a&gt;. These skills, combined with the general tendency of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; to look down on Khajiit and \"beasts,\" leads many Khajiit outside of their home province to become professional assassins, thieves or bandits in other lands.\nOther Khajiit in the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; find their cunning nature suitable for &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mercantilism&lt;/a&gt; and trade. Still more are involved in the illegal smuggling of &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Narcotics\"&gt;narcotic&lt;/a&gt;.\nPublic image and history.\nKhajiit are typically viewed as second-class citizens due to their bestial appearance. Due to stereotypes, many are viewed as cheats, liars, thieves, and drug addicts. The distrust displayed to their race makes finding an honest living difficult. Because of this, citizens have difficulty trusting Khajiits. Racial slurs for Khajiits have emerged from this negative stereotype, being called \"cat,\" or threatening to make them into a rug or carpet.\nKhajiit are the subject of racial discrimination all across Skyrim, as they are thought to be more criminally inclined than other races. According to &lt;a href=\"Ahkari\"&gt;Ahkari&lt;/a&gt;, a female Khajiit trader who sells in almost every hold in Skyrim, \"...it is the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;. They do not like outsiders in their land, and so we are forbidden to enter the cities. When they look upon us, they see only pickpockets and Skooma dealers.\" Thus, Khajiit caravans are forced to conduct business and encamp entirely outside of city walls.\nThey were oppressed and &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; by rich families and primary industries in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, until very recently when &lt;a href=\"King%20Helseth\"&gt;King Helseth&lt;/a&gt; outlawed slavery. Many Khajiit have a strong racial dislike for Argonians (a feeling required by their eastern neighbors). This causes tension in the southern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; cities of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; are both fairly close, and which have strong populations of both races.\nThe Confederation of Elsweyr was the third kingdom taken by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, with its secession in &lt;a href=\"4E%2099\"&gt;4E 99&lt;/a&gt;, after the moons disappeared for three years. This change of leadership, however, did not rectify the racism that the mer and men have for the Khajiit, and many are still considered nothing more than second-class citizens and petty brutes.\nBiology.\nThe most notable characteristic of the Khajiit is their feline appearance. Being based upon real-life cats, they resemble them, and the range of facial feature combinations enable them to have numerous and varied faces. Some resemble New World mountain cats, such as , , and , while others display features tantamount to those of Old World cat species, including tigers and leopards, and more yet resemble domestic cats.\nTheir faces are often speckled with spots or dashed with stripes, although they are relatively faint, especially in comparison to the bold markings of real-world cats. Their range of accessories includes hair, similar to human and Mer, in many compliments, along with some unique to Khajiit, such as lynx-like fur extensions of the ear tips. They also customize themselves with earrings and facial hair, most being similar to standard beards or mustaches and including tiger-like sideburns, optionally with beads tied in.\nDifferences from other games.\nUnlike the Khajiit of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, \"Skyrim\"'s Khajiit most resemble lynxes, due to their pointed ears, angular faces, and thick cheek fur; whereas Khajiit in and earlier games resembled jungle cats like jaguars and leopards, with smaller, blunt-shaped ears and softer, rounder features. It is not certain if the character designers intended to do this, or if it is simply due to a change in graphics, though it is known that there are as many types of Khajiit as there are cats on Earth. Like \"Oblivion\" and unlike , Khajiit in \"Skyrim\" may wear headgear and footwear.\nLunar influences.\nThe appearance and physiology of a Khajiit is based on the lunar calendar of &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;. The Khajiit seen in Skyrim are Cathay and only encompass some of the possible forms they can assume at birth, ranging from a general house cat, to giant feral beasts or even small &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nPopular usage and unique gameplay.\nClasses and builds.\nKhajiits excel in stealth roles, making them extraordinary assassins, thieves, and &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s. Their excellent Sneak level coupled with certain Archery and Sneak perks make them very deadly archers, especially when sneak attacking. They also have skill in melee combat, with their natural claws offering them 22 points of unarmed damage, 5.5 higher than the normal unarmed damage of most races. This ability makes them ideal for &lt;a href=\"brawling\"&gt;brawling&lt;/a&gt; as they out-damage their foes. This trait, if paired with the &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29%23Heavy%20Armor%20Perks\"&gt;Fists of Steel&lt;/a&gt; perk, makes a Khajiit formidable even without weapons. Before this perk is unlocked, though, the &lt;a href=\"Gloves%20of%20the%20Pugilist%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Gloves of the Pugilist&lt;/a&gt; can be used to augment hand-to-hand combat. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthrope&lt;/a&gt; Khajiit makes better use of hand-to-hand than other races.\nGuilds.\nAlthough guilds extend membership to all races, the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; often employ Khajiit for their skills and abilities.\nNight vision.\nAlthough the intrinsic Night Eye ability may be considered useless apart from certain situations during which visibility is unfavorable, it comes in handy when sneaking in dimly lit areas. Night Eye works under water and while on horseback, but must be triggered before mounting the horse and cannot be restarted or turned off without dismounting. This ability can be used to explore caves and other areas that lack illumination without the need for light-casting spells or torches. It also allows players to forgo becoming a vampire.\nRole-playing advantages.\nSince Khajiit are rare in Skyrim, role-playing as this race might be interesting to players interested in this type of experience. Some Khajiit are prohibited from cities because of this. On the other hand, a Khajiit &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is never barred from entering settlements, but still receives racial slurs by the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s and others.\nNotable Khajiit.\nThe following is a list of some of the more notable Khajiit that can be found in Skyrim."}
