They can be found walking the roads of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; in between their campsites, and will even pause to do business with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; while on the move. Their camps are usually found near the stables of several settlements.\nOverview.\n&lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; caravans in Skyrim are small bands of roving traders that sell a wide variety of items - from &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt;. They then usually hire two to three Khajiit mercenaries to protect the merchandise. Suspicion due to racial stereotypes has caused &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; locals to forbid Khajiit travelling bands from entering the cities, so they must make camp outside the walls. This policy applies only to the caravans, as there are other known Khajiit characters, such as &lt;a href=\"J%27zargo%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;J'zargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shavari\"&gt;Shavari&lt;/a&gt;, who live in cities.\nCaravans.\nThe Caravan system in Skyrim consists of the following three roving bands of Khajiit merchants, and their respective entourages:\nRi'saad's Caravan.\nThe caravan led by &lt;a href=\"Ri%27saad\"&gt;Ri'saad&lt;/a&gt; is the wealthiest of the three, and enjoys the most lucrative trade route. Ri'saad's route travels back and forth between &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. The caravan features a variety of wares and offers a tanning rack for &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; purposes. Ri'saad is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Atahbah\"&gt;Atahbah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ma%27randru-jo\"&gt;Ma'randru-jo&lt;/a&gt;. The trio is protected by &lt;a href=\"Khayla\"&gt;Khayla&lt;/a&gt;, who also offers &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; up to 50 (Adept). Ri'saad and Atahbah can both become fences.\nAhkari's Caravan.\nThe caravan led by &lt;a href=\"Ahkari\"&gt;Ahkari&lt;/a&gt; follows a route that includes &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.

Ahkari is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Zaynabi\"&gt;Zaynabi&lt;/a&gt;, and the pair are protected by &lt;a href=\"Dro%27marash\"&gt;Dro'marash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kharjo\"&gt;Kharjo&lt;/a&gt;. Ahkari also offers training in &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; up to level 50 (Adept) and Dro'marash offers training in &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; up to level 50 (Adept). Zaynabi can become a fence and Kharjo is also available as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, provided his stolen &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Amulet\"&gt;Moon Amulet&lt;/a&gt; is retrieved from the bandits who took it.\nMa'dran's Caravan.\nThe caravan led by &lt;a href=\"Ma%27dran\"&gt;Ma'dran&lt;/a&gt; has profited greatly from the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Stormcloak rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, as weapons and armor are the caravan's speciality and their route runs from &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; abhor restraint and encumbrance, and their craftsfolk are diligent about providing armor to augment their prowling form. At its lightest, Khajiiti armor is often mistaken for well-appointed (but flamboyant) clothing. Quilted or padded cloth adorns the midriff and vital areas. This is augmented with vivid patterns of color and accented with a loose shawl, ribbons, or trinkets\u2014an outfit that would result in mocking insults if worn by a race less decadent and hedonistic.\nFor battles where the Khajiit expects punishment, they favor cloth and leather greaves, gauntlets, and a light helmet; this allows for supremely agile movement without sacrificing speed (or fashion).\nFor this race of acrobats, even the heaviest Khajiiti armor is loose-fitting but actually has lacquered metal plates laced together with leather, under which is an embroidered tunic, completed with a helmet of fluted silver and durable linen. It is only under the most harrowing of conditions that the Khajiit will don full battle armor.\nAs for weaponry, curved scimitars, sabers and knives, or punch daggers serve as an elongation of their own slashing, clawed hands. Occasionally these claw shapes extend to ritual tridents and the savage points on their longbow arrows or javelins."}

A most polite and correct mer, who was horrified when I informed him that he'd applied a most improper suffix to my name, instead of the appropriate \"dra.\" (To spare him further embarrassment, we shall not go into details\u2014but ask me sometime after I've had a couple of glasses of tawny port.)\nSo it seemed like a good idea to this one to compile a list of the most common Khajiiti name-titles\u2014at least the proper ones\u2014for the benefit of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Aldmeri%20Propriety\"&gt;College of Aldmeri Propriety&lt;/a&gt;, and all our new allies from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeminine Honorifics.\n\"-dra\" is a title of respect awarded to one known for her wisdom and wit, or as a consolation to one who has achieved a venerable age. I prefer to think that, in my case, it is the former condition that applies.\n\"-daro\" is for one who has achieved excellence in the nimble manipulation of loose articles, such as small decorative objects and unattached coinage. It may also be awarded to one who is lithe of tongue.\n\"-do\" is for one who has earned renown as a warrior\u2014usually male, but occasionally (too occasionally, in this one's opinion) a female.\n\"-ko\" is an appellation for respected healers, mages, and scholars, and is also sometimes added to the names of learned ancestors. Perhaps, once this one has passed on, her children will refer to her as \"Radurra-ko\"? \u2026Well, it is a warm thought.\n\"-la\" is an oh-so-fleeting title applied to graceful maidens who are unmarried, or behave as if they were. This one remembers fondly when she was \"Radurra-la\"\u2014just last year, no?\n\"-ma\" is for a young child of either gender, a term of endearment, except when it is shouted or snarled.\nMasculine Honorifics.\n\"-dar\" is perhaps the most ancient of all Khajiiti titles, an appellation earned by those who are nimble in fingers and wits, and are both inquisitive and acquisitive. I have heard that it is also sometimes applied to politicians, but such usage would surely be jocular (and never employed by me, sweetness!).\n\"-do\" is an honorific for one who has earned distinction on the field of battle or in personal duels. Beware of those strutting lions who apply the title to themselves, not waiting for others to award it.\n\"-dro\" is a title applied to wise elders, patriarchs, grandfathers, and those who walk too slowly in front of one in the marketplace.\n\"-jo\" is an appellation for respected physicians, scholars, and mages, though it is also frequently adopted by charlatans and mountebanks. I remember a handsome, dark panther in Corinthe who wanted to sell me a string of \"enchanted\" pearls \u2026 but that is a story for another moon.\n\"-ra\" is for an esteemed leader of soldiers, trade, or governance. A cat-ra often has a harem of kitten-las, sometimes ostentatiously so, especially if he is making up for a deficiency in his short-tail.\n\"-ri\" is a title rarely awarded, as it is reserved for great leaders of our people, Speakers, Kings, and Manes\u2014and perhaps for a virile lover whilst wrestling amongst the pillows. Or so I have heard.\nThis one has also heard that among the faddish youth of &lt;a href=\"Alabaster\"&gt;Alabaster&lt;/a&gt;, it is the fashion to place the honorific before the name, rather than after. &lt;a href=\"Radurra-dra\"&gt;Radurra-dra&lt;/a&gt; likes to be fashionable, but she fears she cannot approve of this practice, as it will tend to make Khajiiti names sound far too alike. That would be boring\u2014and we do not wish to be boring, yes?"}

Akha explored the heavens in the earliest days and his trails became the \"Many Paths\". He was told by &lt;a href=\"Ahnurr\"&gt;Ahnurr&lt;/a&gt; to mate and find love.

Alkosh is credited with defeating and repelling &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; during a massive attack on the Khajiit.

Azurah is a central figure in Khajiiti mythology, as she is credited with the creation of the Khajiit themselves. In some stories, Azurah was the favored daughter of Fadomai and was gifted her greatest secrets before her mother's death.\n&lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaan Dar is the \"Bandit God\" of the Khajiit, and is the representation of the cleverness of the people.

He is described as being constantly hungry in Khajiiti myth.\n&lt;a href=\"Ius\"&gt;Ius&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnown as the Agitated and God of Animals, this god is worshipped in certain parts of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, where he is represented as a misshapen humanoid carrying a rod.\n&lt;a href=\"Ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;Ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;.\nJa-Kha'jay, or the Lunar Lattice, is a Khajiiti god that has two aspects: Jode and Jone. His motions protect Nirni from Ahnurr.\n&lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;.\nJode is the Khajiiti god of Nirn's larger moon, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;. In Khajiti religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.\n&lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt;.\nJone is the Khajiiti god of Nirn's smaller moon, &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;.

According to myth, Lorkhaj was Fadomai's final child to be born before her death, alongside the \"Great Darkness,\" &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;. In some stories, Nirni asked Lorkhaj to create a home for Nirni to give birth. Lorkhaj obliged and tricked the other spirits into helping him, causing many of them to die. The remaining spirits cursed him to \"walk Nirni for many phases.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt;.\nMafala is the Khajiiti equivalent to Mephala, Daedric Prince of Sex, Lies, and Secrets. Mafala is the mate of Boethra and she watches over Eight of the Many Paths.\n&lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagrus is the Khajiiti god of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and the sun, revered by wizards across Elsweyr.

She remains virtually unchanged by the Khajiit when compared to her counterparts in other mythology.\n&lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;.\nMasser and Secunda are the Moons and their Motions.\n&lt;a href=\"Merrunz\"&gt;Merrunz&lt;/a&gt;.\nMerrunz is the Khajiiti variant of Mehrunes Dagon, Daedric Prince of Destruction, and is commonly associated with natural disasters.\n&lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;.\nNamiira is the Khajiiti variation of the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, she is referred to as \"The Eldest Spirit\" and \"The Great Darkness\". She is associated with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and the consumption of rotten flesh.\n&lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;i.\nNirni is the Khajiiti interpretaion of the planet Nirn itself. In Khajiiti mythology, Nirni and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;h fought for the favor of their mother, Fadomai.\n&lt;a href=\"Noctra\"&gt;Noctra&lt;/a&gt;.\nNoctra is the Khajiiti equivalent to the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, she was born from the black blood of Lorkhaj. Azurah spared Noctra and allowed her to live so long as she served Azurah and the ja-Kha'jay, but due to her being rebellious by nature, she stole &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;one of Azurah's keys&lt;/a&gt; and fled to the Void.\n&lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;.\nRajhin is the thief god of the Khajiit, who is said to have grown up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.\n&lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt;.\nRiddle'Thar was introduced into the Khajiiti pantheon by the Mane Rid-Thar-ri'Datta. The Riddle'Thar is called the \"Cosmic Order deity,\" and is akin to a set of guidelines by which to live instead of an actual god. The creation of Riddle'Thar greatly diminished the worship of Alkosh in Elsweyr.\n&lt;a href=\"Sangiin\"&gt;Sangiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nSangiin, otherwise known as \"The Blood Cat,\" is the equivalent to Sanguine, Daedric Prince of Revelry and Hedonism.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheggorath\"&gt;Sheggorath&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheggorath is the Khajiiti version of Sheogorath, Daedric Prince of Madness and Insanity. Sheggorath is also called the \"&lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; Cat\" by the Khajiit.\n&lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt;.\nS'rendarr is the Khajiiti variant of Stendarr, the God of Mercy.\n&lt;a href=\"Varmiina\"&gt;Varmiina&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarmiina is the Khajiiti interpretation of the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, she was born from Fadomai's fear of losing her children. She was killed by Azurah, and haunts Khajiit when they dream.\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffer\"&gt;Y'ffer&lt;/a&gt;.\nY'ffer is the brother of Nirni, who was asked to punish the Khajiit. He did this by turning the forests of Elsweyr into deserts and jungles, but the Khajiit were protected by Azurah who taught them to adapt."}

If this occurs then it is still possible to obtain it via &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing and using the &lt;a href=\"Misdirection%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; perk. It is also possible to use the Misdirection perk to give weapons of greater value and stats to Falas Selvayn through pickpocketing. Once this step is completed, it will be necessary to steal back a couple of the weapons given to him until he unequips the bow, thus making it purchasable through his inventory.\nAnother option is to give him an melee weapon and then attack him. He should then pull out the dagger instead. Use the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout and talk to him to buy it from him.\nThe easiest method can be done without pickpocket perks and without Bend Will. Give him a dagger and attack him. Once he is hostile, keep attacking him until he gets on his knees. Once he is on his knees, open the map menu and fast travel at the same place (Ramshackle Trading Post). You can now buy the bow normally. \nAnother option if the above does not work is to give him a dagger by reverse pickpocketing and then lead an enemy to him to trigger melee combat.\nEnchantment.\n\"\"Wielder receives an increasingly powerful blessing for every 20 &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29%23Animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; killed by the bow. x animals killed\"\nWielding the bow grants an ability called \"&lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20the%20Stag%20Prince\"&gt;Blessing of the Stag Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\"\" This blessing becomes increasingly powerful for every twenty animals killed by the bow. \nInitially, the blessing grants an additional 5 points of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; while the bow is equipped.

Some witches of Glenmoril can turn themselves into animal forms, such as ravens. They are seen as rivals of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20Vampyrum%20Order\"&gt;Cyrodiil Vampyrum Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Glenmoril Wyrd Coven are known to be &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; worshippers. Unlike other covens the Glenmoril are everywhere, mostly in the cities, while other witches live in seclusion.\nThe witches of the coven know how to cure lycanthropy through two ways. One method is a ritual called the 'Rite of the Wolf Giver', in which an innocent person is required to be slaughtered by the afflicted lycanthrope. The other is the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20the%20Wolf%20Ender\"&gt;Scroll of the Wolf Ender&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0which the witches can make. However, even though the witches of Glenmoril know how to make the scroll, they still choose to do the ritual.\n&lt;a href=\"Melisande\"&gt;Melisande&lt;/a&gt; is rumored to be one of the last witches of Glenmoril. She knows how to cure &lt;a href=\"vampirism\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, and she offers this to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; in .

This great power turned out to be &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;. The pact also stated that the lycanthropy was meant to be temporary, but for reasons unknown this was untrue and the Companions were deceived into becoming &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; permanently.\nThis endured up to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, Harbinger of the Companions, viewed the lycanthropy as a curse and strove to cure himself and the other members with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. However, other members viewed it as a blessing, and therefore, the tradition held, much to the distaste of Kodlak. Kodlak's final request to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; before dying at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is that they hunt down and kill the Coven and bring back their heads, which are then used to cure Kodlak posthumously of his lycanthropy by casting out and killing the werewolf's Wolf Spirit.\nLocations.\nGlenmoril witches can be found at:\nMembers.\nKnown members of the Glenmoril Wyrd:"}

Glenpoint is known to be the regional driving point of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Glenpoint is located in the northcentral area of the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Glenpoint\"&gt;March of Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, which is a landlocked march surrounded by several important regions including the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to the south and the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20the%20Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Barony of the Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The city of Glenpoint is rather close to the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Barony of Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;, the border is located northwest. A large mountain takes a large portion of the southeastern march, and it extends into the Ilessan Hills and &lt;a href=\"Shalgora\"&gt;Shalgora&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the March of Glenpoint was annexed into the Kingdom of Daggerfall, which extends into the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the northern coast. Several battles were fought on the Glenpoint Foothills, which is located in the Glenpoint mountains near the Kingdom of Daggerfall. The local deity and temple are the &lt;a href=\"Resolution%20of%20Z%27en\"&gt;Resolution of Z'en&lt;/a&gt;, which is found in other areas including the &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Totambu\"&gt;Fiefdom of Totambu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"County%20Leyawiin\"&gt;County Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. The local knightly order of Glenpoint is the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Owl\"&gt;Knights of the Owl&lt;/a&gt;. The regional &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; clan is the &lt;a href=\"Vraseth%20Clan\"&gt;Vraseth Vampire Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the sudden fall of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of High Rock began to rise into prominence, and the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; was no exception. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20609\"&gt;1E 609&lt;/a&gt;, the Daggerfall Army under the control of &lt;a href=\"King%20Thagore\"&gt;King Thagore&lt;/a&gt;, marched into the region of Glenpoint and garnered control over the southern reaches of High Rock. Daggerfall became the number one leading force in the military, economy, and politics of the southern &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; regions. Daggerfall has since established this, even today. Daggerfall's grand military would eventually partake in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;, the Duchy of Glenpoint was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Mentin\"&gt;Duke Mentin&lt;/a&gt;. Mentin was friends with &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20III\"&gt;Uriel III&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, both of which ruled over the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; at this point. After the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, Potema started a war with the Empire known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred throughout Northern Tamriel, in the human provinces. Potema and Mentin hatched a plot to kill Kintyra II, by baiting her into Glenpoint with a plea for help. Kintyra II traveled across the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and was captured somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;. She was held in a Castle somewhere in Glenpoint, where she was promptly executed. This injustice made the denizens of Glenpoint and the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; very infuriated, leading to a manhunt for the person responsible and the location of the execution, destroying Red Diamond banners, leaving Broken Diamonds in the snow of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, the people of both nations mourned the death of Kintyra II by singing &lt;a href=\"Sepharve\"&gt;Sepharve&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bretic\"&gt;Old Bretic&lt;/a&gt;. This would become a tradition known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Diamonds%20%28Holiday%29\"&gt;Broken Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Glenpoint in their quest to recover the pieces.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; fought each other for the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate%20of%20Betony\"&gt;Protectorate of Betony&lt;/a&gt;, located at the mouth of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The war took place mainly in the High Rock regions, and one such battle took place in Glenpoint. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bluffs\"&gt;Battle of the Bluffs&lt;/a&gt; was a victory for the Daggerfall Army, which was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bridwell\"&gt;Lord Bridwell&lt;/a&gt;, who was an exceptional warrior and tactician that made Daggerfall successful in the conflict. The battle took place in an area between the Kingdom of Daggerfall and the March of Glenpoint, and it left the Sentinel Army damaged. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20K%27avar\"&gt;Lord K'avar&lt;/a&gt; was horribly disfigured by the battle, due to a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"Nightblade\"&gt;Nightblade&lt;/a&gt;. The war eventually reached the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, where it had promptly ended.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the March of Glenpoint was under the reign of an unknown Marquis, whose name was not recorded in the history books. Glenpoint existed among the twenty-three other nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Glenpoint, itself is in a mainland march that is next to the Kingdom of Daggerfall, one of the three great kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the same year, the Warp in the West resulted in the Kingdoms expanding their territories, absorbing the smaller nations. The March of Glenpoint was annexed into the Kingdom of Daggerfall along with other regions on the northern coast of the Iliac."}

In 3E 433, he was a member of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII's&lt;/a&gt; Blades guard who attempted to spirit him from the palace in response to the assassinations of the emperor's sons. Under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Renault\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt;, he and fellow Blade &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; took the emperor through the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City's&lt;/a&gt; secret escape route, at which time he met the prisoner who would one day become the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlenroy treated the Hero with disdain, believing them to be a nuisance and, later on, an assassin. But the emperor, who knew of the Hero's true importance, bade the prisoner to accompany them. As they fled through the escape route, the group was ambushed by assassins serving the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Renault was killed, and Glenroy took command. In the Imperial Sanctum, they were trapped and ambushed, and in the fighting that followed, Glenroy was killed, and thus unable to prevent the &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20of%20Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;emperor's murder&lt;/a&gt; as well.

The Daggerfall Cliffs are the home of several natural caves that people of Daggerfall are known to inhabit. &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Man%27s%20Hallows\"&gt;Bad Man's Hallows&lt;/a&gt; is one of these caverns and the people living in it worship the &lt;a href=\"Bad%20Man\"&gt;Bad Man&lt;/a&gt;, a deity obscure in the Breton culture. The &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Guardians\"&gt;Vale of the Guardians&lt;/a&gt; is an ancient site dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, the descendants of the Aedra and the ancestor of the modern races of Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe King's Guard region is situated at the base of the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard%20Mountains\"&gt;King's Guard Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain range separating Glenumbra from the rest of High Rock. Glenumbra is rather mountainous at each end of the region. The shores of King's Guard are at sea level as opposed to the mainland, which is at a much higher level than the rest of Glenumbra. There are no cities in King's Guard, but the township of &lt;a href=\"Crosswych\"&gt;Crosswych&lt;/a&gt; is extremely important in Glenumbra, serving as a gateway between Glenumbra and &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;. The crypt of &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt; serves as a burial ground for the Kings of High Rock, from Daggerfall to Jehanna.\nFauna.\nWolves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel are a common enemy throughout the wilds of the continent, the ideal predator throughout most societies. Typically, Wolves are found throughout the hills of Cambray and areas in the King's Guard plains. Most of the time, Wolves are feral creatures, constantly on the hunt and in packs. One Wolf will leave you occupied by various wolves can be overwhelming. Most of Glenumbra's wolves are found in the &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Pass\"&gt;Cambray Pass&lt;/a&gt; and in the several caves. These quadripedal creatures are fast and relentless, constantly on the hunt and looking for unsuspecting animals and travelers. When they are fighting, their tactic is to confuse the opponent by running circles around them and striking them where it counts. They are not particularly hard to kill, but they are a burden nonetheless.\nHarpies.\n&lt;a href=\"Harpies\"&gt;Harpies&lt;/a&gt; are avian creatures that live throughout windy areas in the Iliac Bay or near the ocean in general. They resemble a small woman with several red or black feathers all over them, essentially a bird woman. Harpies are found in the &lt;a href=\"Shrieking%20Scar\"&gt;Shrieking Scar&lt;/a&gt; hills, located in Daenia. Harpies congregate in Nests, and their leaders are called Harpy Matriarch, which is differentiated by their black feathers. These creatures are rather large, almost as tall as the common Breton and being able to carry people away. In their attacks, they use their sharp claws and a swift gust of winds. Though it may sound like screeching, the Harpies have their own language called Harpy which can be learned and used against them.\nGhosts.\nThe mystical forests of Tamriel are prone to &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s and areas such as the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westtry\"&gt;Westtry&lt;/a&gt; are no exception. Ghosts only appear when the spirit of the deceased is bound for whatever reason, and they can vary on race such as &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. Typically, Ghosts are common in King's Guard, though the more notable and historical ones are the Ghosts found in Southern Cambray. In a sense, Ghosts come in two different variations, one where the spirit had recently passed, taking an ethereal version of their physical body while another is where the spirit has remained so long to the point where they have lost sanity, where they take a more ghastly and haunting appearance. Historically, the Ghosts in the Glenumbra Moors date back to the first era, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; Soldiers and &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; Warriors, among other third-party factions that took part in the battle.\nSpriggans.\nThe region of Daenia is home to all sorts of creatures about the forest since the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; in the region has a deep connection with the forest and &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures vary such as the &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Lurcher\"&gt;Lurcher&lt;/a&gt;, but a common creature in Daenia is the &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;. Spriggans are known as Nature's Guardian, and their abilities revolve around this fact. Spriggans take the form of a humanoid made out of wood and leaves, moving elegantly throughout the land. They can easily camouflage themselves inside the trees and attack with sharp branches. These creatures can be found in groves and secluded meadows, such as the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Guardians\"&gt;Vale of the Guardians&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Hag%20Fen\"&gt;Hag Fen&lt;/a&gt;. Spriggans possess the ability to control wild animals in the area, and it varies between the &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Bear\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of a Spriggan can be used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href=\"Taproot\"&gt;Taproot&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Belladonna%20Berries\"&gt;Belladonna Berries&lt;/a&gt;. Spriggans are susceptible to fire and lightning, anything that can burn the wood.\nWerewolves.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt; invaded Glenumbra, he resurrected &lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Changeling\"&gt;Faolchu the Changeling&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. Through Faolchu, &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; spread throughout the denizens of Camlorn and the Cambray Hills. In the province of High Rock, the common forms of Lycanthropy are the Werewolf and the &lt;a href=\"Wereboar\"&gt;Wereboar&lt;/a&gt;. Werewolves are hulking bipedal wolves with superhuman strength and razor-sharp claws. They can run at an opponent with great speed, lunging at them and ripping them to shreds. Werewolves are related to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, who has a connection with the Hunt and animals. Werewolves are susceptible to Silver, which is used by supernatural hunters, like the undead, etc. Groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Dawn\"&gt;Order of the Silver Dawn&lt;/a&gt; are known for hunting werewolves.\nFlora.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; congregate around the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd%20Tree\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd Tree&lt;/a&gt;, located in the region of Daenia, which is filled with dense forests. It is the heart and soul of the forest. The tree is smaller than a standard &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, but larger than any trees in Northern Tamriel. The heavy forests in Daenia are able to shroud the Beldama Tree from the outside. Beyond that, the forest takes a large portion of Daenia, leaving open areas in &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and the Western Coast. South from there is the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Guardians\"&gt;Vale of the Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Guardians\"&gt;Elemental Guardians&lt;/a&gt; reside, watching over the forest and the Beldama Wyrd. All the while to the north is &lt;a href=\"Hag%20Fen\"&gt;Hag Fen&lt;/a&gt;, the most prominent marshland of High Rock, situated east of Camlorn. Hag Fen is known for their population of &lt;a href=\"Hag\"&gt;Hag&lt;/a&gt;s in the area, elder witches with corrupted magic, essentially the opposite of the Beldama Wyrd. The hollow and decrepit flora in Hag Fen puts a huge tone shift from either Daenia or &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nGovernment.\nThe city-states of Camlorn and Daggerfall are prominent Kingdoms in the province of High Rock, one of the eight that govern the entire province. In Glenumbra specifically, both Camlorn and Daggerfall are the most populated settlements, with the latter being the capital. As the name suggests, leaders of a Kingdom are called Kings, or Queens if they are women. They acquire the position from either heritance or showing great devotion to the people and land in the domain. &lt;a href=\"House%20Deleyn\"&gt;House Deleyn&lt;/a&gt; had ruled over Daggerfall throughout the early-mid second era. And for quite some time, &lt;a href=\"King%20Gothryd\"&gt;King Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;'s dynasty had ruled over Daggerfall, with the earliest known leader being &lt;a href=\"Arslan%20II\"&gt;Arslan II&lt;/a&gt;, whose reign began in &lt;a href=\"3E%20130\"&gt;3E 130&lt;/a&gt;. But even before the Breton Kings, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; have held vast control over High Rock, ruling out of the faraway &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region of Glenumbra takes up the entire western portion of High Rock, which is most of the Northern &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. And in that area, there have been several minor nations inhabiting the area. The largest ones being the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Kingdom of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Anticlere\"&gt;Fiefdom of Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, with a history dating back to the Nordic Occupation and modern conflicts such as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Camoran Usurper's Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. But there are other notable regions in the Glenumbra-area of the Iliac, including the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Glenpoint\"&gt;March of Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;. Areas are not ruled by a King but instead, a Baron or a Marquis respectively. Other types of lands include the County and the Duchy. When another country takes a nation control, such as the case with Daggerfall and &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, the land taken over would be called a Protectorate, like with Betony. Before the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, there were about twenty-four regions in the Daggerfall Iliac, but when the Warp came about, Kingdoms such as Daggerfall absorbed neighboring nations, like Anticlere or Glenpoint in Daggerfall's case.\nReligion.\nThe various regions in Glenumbra have temples dedicated to one of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the religious pantheon that generalizes each of the other racial deities celebrated in Tamriel. The religious temple connected with Glenumbra is the &lt;a href=\"Benevolence%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Benevolence of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the group worshipping &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of Love and Fertility. Out of all the Divines, Mara is the most universally praised, with variations in every pantheon, except for the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. Mara's teachings revolve around the concept of love and being a good patron in general. Love gives people nourishment and life to everyone. In the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, she is worshipped as &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt;. A notable Aedric artifact to Mara is the &lt;a href=\"Chalice%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Chalice of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, which was supposedly a wedding gift from Mara to &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, when she married &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;. The Benevolence of Mara has their own militant force that enforces the goddess' word called the &lt;a href=\"Maran%20Knights\"&gt;Maran Knights&lt;/a&gt;. The more notable chapters of the Benevolence of Mara include the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Rising Power of Daggerfall &amp; Nordic Occupation.\nThe city-state of Daggerfall has influenced the province of High Rock in various events, from the beginning of Bretony history to the modern age. During the first era, &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt; expanded the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;Nordic Empire&lt;/a&gt; to various corners throughout Northern Tamriel, from modern-day Glenumbra to the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, to the western-half of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The first recorded use of the name \"Daggerfall\" was in &lt;a href=\"1E%20246\"&gt;1E 246&lt;/a&gt;, among other Nordic cities such as &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. Several years later in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Borgas\"&gt;High King Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was killed, prompting the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this time; the natives of each region retook their home from the outsiders of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; pushed back the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic Opposers and established domains throughout High Rock. Daggerfall thrived in this new age, their military expanded, turning them into a major political power in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. While the Direnni occupied the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, they used Daggerfall as a minor base of operation for defense in Daggerfall. At this time, Daggerfall was the only modern-day Kingdom that ruled in the Iliac Bay, other superpowers such as Sentinel and Wayrest had yet to be established, giving Daggerfall a monopoly in the military and trade. It is also worth noting that the Redguards had yet to escape &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fall of the Alessian Order; The Battle of Glenumbra Moors.\nThe Kingdom of Daggerfall served as a minor base of operations for the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt; herself had used the original &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Overlook\"&gt;Castle Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; as a base for her magical studies. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20478\"&gt;1E 478&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; had rebelled against the Alessian Empire by driving them out of &lt;a href=\"County%20Skingrad\"&gt;County Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, to reclaim his original domain from the Alessians. This prompted a large-scale conflict where the allied forces of the Alessian Empire had rebelled against them. The most notable battle was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbria%20Moors\"&gt;Battle of Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20482\"&gt;1E 482&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place in the center of Glenumbra, near the city-state of Camlorn. The Alessian Order under the command of &lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Changeling\"&gt;Faolchu the Changeling&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the Direnni Hegemony, which was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, among other Direnni Clansmen (i.e., Raven Direnni and &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Direnni\"&gt;Aiden Direnni&lt;/a&gt;). On the Direnni's side were many champions that were against the Alessian Empire, including &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;, the Last King of the Ayleids and &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt;, the then High King of Skyrim. In the end, Aiden Direnni led an assault onto Faolchu's stronghold, defeating the &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; and securing victory for the Direnni. The Alessians were expelled from High Rock, but the Direnni Hegemony had lost a substantial amount of power, prompting the Bretons to take over and establish the Breton's High Rock. The Bretons had spread across the province, establishing settlements along the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; and the frontier of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Daggerfall had risen to power especially, when &lt;a href=\"King%20Thagore\"&gt;King Thagore&lt;/a&gt; had conquered the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Glenpoint\"&gt;March of Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom had become the major militaristic power of the Iliac.\nThe Siege of the First Orsinium.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of West Tamriel have had a troubled history, dating back to their inception to the first era with the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; invasion. When the Orcs were driven out of Hammerfell, they sought refuge in the rugged lands of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, where they established strongholds and chiefdoms across the land. For years they remained divided and outcasted from general society. Out of this came an Orcish visionary in the form of &lt;a href=\"Torug%20gro-Igron\"&gt;Torug gro-Igron&lt;/a&gt;, who yearned for the dream of a united Orcish kingdom and that would come in the form of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Orcs. But with this grouping power, controversy would soon arise from their neighboring races. The Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Bagrakh\"&gt;Clan Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Igron\"&gt;Clan Igron&lt;/a&gt; would unleash their wrath onto the Breton villages of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;, one of them included the minor fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20Raids\"&gt;Bjoulsae Raids&lt;/a&gt;, and it prompted &lt;a href=\"King%20Joile\"&gt;King Joile&lt;/a&gt; to take action. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, King Joile sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, situated in the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Sentinel\"&gt;Kingdom of Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. In the letter, Joile talks about his utter disdain for the Bjoulsae Raids and desires a joint attack on Orsinium. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20950\"&gt;1E 950&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; had commenced.\nThe Siege of Orsinium was not just a single siege against an impenetrable fortress, it was a war that transpired across the Wrothgarian Mountains, from the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Fharun\"&gt;Fharun&lt;/a&gt; to the boreal forests of &lt;a href=\"Western%20Wrothgar\"&gt;Western Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdoms of High Rock participated in the Siege, but the Kingdom of Daggerfall was a juggernaut amidst the siege. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; had partaken in the conflict, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;, who was an honorable man that recognized his opponents as mighty warriors. Trystan was well-acquainted with Gaiden Shinji and was present alongside him at his duel with &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Sons\"&gt;Savage Sons&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, King Joile did not care for the safety of his people, but he craved conquest, taking out Orsinium was his first step to totalitarian control over West Tamriel. He employed &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; in his attack on Orsinium. The duel between Gaiden Shinji and Baloth Bloodtusk was legendary, both sides did not interrupt this duel of iron might. Until Mercedene had ungraceful shot both warriors with a bow and arrow, which ultimately led to her demise at the hands of the Knights of the Dragon. The Siege of Orsinium ended when King Joile had severed the head of &lt;a href=\"Golkarr%20gro-Igrun\"&gt;Golkarr gro-Igrun&lt;/a&gt;, the then leader of Orsinium. Orsinium was lost and the Orsimer scattered. The Redguards advanced south to &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; with Joile's Army following suit.\nDemise of King Joile &amp; the Siege Aftermath.\nKing Joile had planned out his conquest with the Siege of Orsinium being the first step. The Siege of Orsinium had left the Redguard Army weakened, forcing them to retreat into the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;, which is located south of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;. Of the Redguard warriors was &lt;a href=\"Makela%20Leki\"&gt;Makela Leki&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"Sword-Singer\"&gt;Sword-Singer&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the likes of &lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ansei%20Satameh\"&gt;Ansei Satameh&lt;/a&gt;. It was at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;, Makela Leki had fought against the Daggerfall warriors, and killed King Joile with her blade. It was there Makela Leki was revered in Hammerfell history. The lost of their king was not the only thing that affected Daggerfall. The destruction of Orsinium caused an influx of people to enter Wayrest, bring it to the status of a Kingdom, rivaling Daggerfall. The monopoly that Daggerfall had held for years had come to an end. Regardless, Daggerfall had continued to become a major political superpower amidst the Iliac Bay, along with Wayrest and Sentinel.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nordic Incursion; the Tragic Tale of Westtry.\nThe township of &lt;a href=\"Westtry\"&gt;Westtry&lt;/a&gt; is located in the southern hills of Cambray, though it currently resides in the Duchy of Daenia. At one point in time, Westtry was sacked by &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic invaders, who killed off a majority of the people. &lt;a href=\"Rosalind%20Milielle\"&gt;Rosalind Milielle&lt;/a&gt;, the Captain of the Guard, lead the defense against the invaders, but it proved to be pointless. In a last-ditch effort, &lt;a href=\"Leon%20Milielle\"&gt;Leon Milielle&lt;/a&gt;, the local Priest of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; had summoned &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the attackers. With his benevolent power, Molag Bal killed the Nords, turning them into Skeletal Thralls. This came at a cost, the people of Westtry did not pass into the afterlife, and Rosalind turned into a shade. The town of Westtry remained haunted ever since, becoming a local legend throughout Glenumbra and the Cambray Hills. Sometime later, an adventurer arrived on the haunting grounds of Westtry, lifting the curse from the town. Eventually, the township of Westtry became re-inhabited by the local populous and being incorporated into the Duchy of Daenia.\nThe Great House Deleyn of Daggerfall.\nFor various years, the Kingdom of Daggerfall has been ruled by the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Deleyn\"&gt;House Deleyn&lt;/a&gt;, a family of Bretons prominent during the second era. The Deleyn Dynasty had ruled over Daggerfall for years beginning with &lt;a href=\"Donel%20Deleyn\"&gt;Donel Deleyn&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled the Kingdom of Daggerfall from &lt;a href=\"3E%20342\"&gt;3E 342&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20401\"&gt;3E 401&lt;/a&gt;. Before they were Kings, the Deleyn-folk were expert horse breeders, farm hands, and culinary experts. &lt;a href=\"Erric%20Deleyn\"&gt;Erric Deleyn&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Ivory Lord in legends, fought against the Alessian Order during their campaign on Glenumbra in the first era. As time went on, House Deleyn rose to power when Donel Deleyn became the King of Daggerfall and married &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvie%20Garclay\"&gt;Lady Sylvie Garclay&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;. This escalated further when his sister, &lt;a href=\"Genevieve%20Deleyn\"&gt;Genevieve Deleyn&lt;/a&gt; married &lt;a href=\"Serge\"&gt;Serge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northmoor\"&gt;Northmoor&lt;/a&gt;, who was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Adlam%20Mining%20Conglomerate\"&gt;Adlam Mining Conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;. The unions solidified House Deleyn's place on Daggerfall's throne. Eventually, Donel Deleyn passed away, and his descendant, &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Deleyn\"&gt;Bergamot Deleyn&lt;/a&gt; took the throne. When the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; had passed through Glenumbra, Bergamot had passed away, and his son, &lt;a href=\"Folbert%20the%20Wide\"&gt;Folbert the Wide&lt;/a&gt; took the throne of Daggerfall, where he eventually passed, giving it to Casimir Deleyn. The Deleyn Dynasty continued several years after.\nThe Black Drake and the Daggerfall Covenant.\nSeveral years after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Granden%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Granden Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdoms of High Rock had remained in peace, and the trade throughout the Iliac Bay was flourishing amidst these peaceful times. But things would take a turn for the worst with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Drake Emperor had brought his wrath upon the residents of High Rock, beginning with his conquest over Bangkorai. Both the city-states of &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; had fallen to the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Black Drake's Invasion&lt;/a&gt; continued across the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt; and into the Kingdom of Wayrest, being unable to bypass the walls that had safeguarded the city, forcing them to continue onto Glenumbra. At this time, the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; had become independent, after being subjugated to Nordic rule, ever since High Rock's inception. Camlorn had fallen under Reachmen hands at the blink of an eye. They had set their eyes for Daggerfall. &lt;a href=\"Bergamot%20Deleyn\"&gt;Bergamot Deleyn&lt;/a&gt;, the then King of Daggerfall had amassed his army to defeat the Horde. The two factions had fought perilously for the city, but the Horde had finally given way when &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; had attacked them from the rear with Wayrest's Grand Army. Durcorach was slain by the hands of Earl Emeric. Knowing that future threats can harm the peace among High Rock, the Kings of the province signed the first iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First Daggerfall Covenant had consisted of most of the Kingdoms in High Rock. The city-states of Daggerfall, Wayrest, Camlorn, Evermore, and &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; had each signed the treaty that had bound them. But eventually, the Daggerfall Covenant had absorbed the province of Hammerfell, when High King Emeric had married &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Hammerfell. The ensuing conflict known as &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; had the Daggerfall Covenant face the combined might of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, though it ended with &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;'s death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, and founder of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Promising peace among the realms, the Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;ia had joined the Daggerfall Covenant. It was at this point; the Greater Daggerfall Covenant had rivaled the likes of which no one has ever seen, hoping to continue the traditions set forth from the previous &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant took arms under the command of High King Emeric at the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, against the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bloodthorn's plot on King Casimir of Daggerfall.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Daggerfall was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Casimir\"&gt;King Casimir&lt;/a&gt;, who hails from House Deleyn. Casimir Deleyn is a loyal ally of the Daggerfall Covenant, though he is more occupied with protecting his own, which is understandable. Because of his word, the Knights of the Dragon works separately from the Covenant, though the alliance still has a presence in Daggerfall. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; had appeared throughout Glenumbra. After their operation on &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;, the group had begun to make an appearance in Daggerfall and the rest of Glenumbra. Casimir's intelligence network had uncovered the Bloodthorn Cult's presence in Glenumbra with the help of a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious traveler&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aresin\"&gt;Captain Aresin&lt;/a&gt; of the Daggerfall Guard had utilized the traveler in the investigation, where they learned that there was an assassination plot on King Casimir. Eventually, the Bloodthorn Cult under the command of &lt;a href=\"Verrik\"&gt;Verrik&lt;/a&gt; had assaulted Castle Daggerfall, with the intent of murder. In the end, Verrik was defeated by the mysterious traveler. This plot had exceeded beyond the walls of Daggerfall. The Bloodthorn Cult had begun to wage war with the Daggerfall Covenant for control over Glenumbra, beginning with an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Raze of Deleyn's Mill and the Beldama Wyrd.\nThe Bloodthorn Cult had tempered the life in the forests of Daenia, by infiltrating the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd%20Tree\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd Tree&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting it. The &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt; traveled all across the region, to protect the people. The township of &lt;a href=\"Deleyn%27s%20Mill\"&gt;Deleyn's Mill&lt;/a&gt; would be attacked by the local creatures of Daenia, including the &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Jehanne\"&gt;Wyress Jehanne&lt;/a&gt; had protected the people of the village with her magic, as the wildlife was burning the town. The mysterious traveler had arrived into Deleyn's Mill and lent their hand to the Wyrd in Deleyn. In the end, the traveler had saved the village, though the Wyrd needed the travelers help in defeating the Bloodthorn Cult. Deep in the forests of Daenia, the mysterious traveler communed with the Beldama Wyrd, who guided them through the ritual of summoning &lt;a href=\"the%20Elemental%20Guardians\"&gt;the Elemental Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; that the Beldama worship. According to the Guardians, the Bloodthorn Cult had corrupted the Beldama Wyrd Tree, ensnaring the Guardians and have them lose their connection to the Beldama. The mysterious traveler was successfully able to free the Guardians at the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20the%20Guardians\"&gt;Vale of the Guardians&lt;/a&gt;. The Beldama Wyrd would prepare for the retaking of the Beldama Wyrd Tree.\nCorruption at the Beldama Wyrd Tree.\n&lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Gwen\"&gt;Wyress Gwen&lt;/a&gt; of the Beldama Coven had tasked the traveler with infiltrating the Beldama Wyrd Grove, which was under the control of the Bloodthorn Cult. Using the &lt;a href=\"Corruption%20of%20the%20Tree\"&gt;Corruption of the Tree&lt;/a&gt;, the Bloodthorn had harnessed the power of the Beldama Tree. The traveler and a group of Wyress had traversed the Wyrd, defeating the various corruptions of the Elemental Guardians. Throughout the grove, the Wyrd was able to destroy the Corrupted stones of the Guardians, as well as, defeating various Bloodthorn warriors along the way. Wyress Gwen and the Guardians would then task the traveler to enter the Beldama Wyrd Tree and to take out the Corruption of the Tree, which eventually free the Beldama. In the end, the Corruption was dissolved, and the Beldama gained control over the Wyrd Tree, though the Bloodthorn's plot would continue with the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Changeling\"&gt;Faolchu the Changeling&lt;/a&gt; and the city-state of Camlorn.\nThe Resurrection of Faolchu; Tension in Aldcroft.\n&lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Reborn\"&gt;Faolchu the Reborn&lt;/a&gt; had taken the city-state of Camlorn with the help of &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Telwin\"&gt;Jonathan Telwin&lt;/a&gt;, who had contracted &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; from Faolchu and pledged his allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Bloodthorn Cult. Through Telwin, the disease had spread among the denizens of Camlorn, each contracting the gift that Faolchu had beheld onto Telwin. A majority of Camlorn's populous had become &lt;a href=\"Werewolves\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; and had razed city from within. To take extra precautions, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Sebastien\"&gt;Duke Sebastien&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Camlorn, had to be escorted to the nearby township of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;, located along the Iliac Bay. It was here Sebastien would be kidnapped by the Bloodthorn Cult and taken to the outskirts of town, in an isolated street. Both he and his bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Gloria%20Fausta\"&gt;Gloria Fausta&lt;/a&gt; were both captured. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious traveler&lt;/a&gt; from before had arrived onto Aldcroft and met with &lt;a href=\"Chamberlain%20Weller\"&gt;Chamberlain Weller&lt;/a&gt;, the Duke's advisor. From there, the traveler had rescued both the Duke and Fausta, bringing them to Aldcroft. The Duke was among the many Camlorn refugees that came to Aldcroft, and he believes that among them, are agents of Faolchu. Both the traveler and Fausta were able to uncover several werewolves.\nAt this point, the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; (which is the Knightly Order of the Covenant), had fought alongside the Camlorn Guard for the retaking of Camlorn. The Lion Guard had utilized Aldcroft as a base for the Lion Guard, as well as the outskirts of Camlorn, which was used as the staging grounds for the siege. Gloria Fausta had fortunately uncovered a plan to learn more about Faolchu, by taking a deceased Werewolf using their spirit for Intel. It was in this ritual; the group had discovered that Duke Sebastien had contracted Lycanthropy, posing a threat to the royal lineage of Camlorn. The only known way to cure the Duke of the disease was for Gloria to give her untainted blood for the Duke to drink. The traveler was given the choice of killing Gloria for the cure or letting her live and having the Duke continue with the bloodthirst, all the while looking for a treatment. It is unknown if either solution was cared out. But with the help of Gloria's werewolf plan, the Lion Guard learned that Faolchu was resurrected, so they ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;, where the mysterious traveler saw visions of the past, with help from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. It was there; the traveler learned that Faolchu was weak against fire.\nThe Siege of Camlorn &amp; the Fall of Faolchu.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Gautier\"&gt;General Gautier&lt;/a&gt;, the Lion Guard attempted to retake the city-state of Camlorn from Faolchu and his legion of &lt;a href=\"Werewolves\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt;. The Werewolves were powerful and overwhelming to the Lion Guard, taking their Siege Camp in the process. The mysterious traveler from before arrives onto the scene and is tasked by Gautier with recapturing the Siege Camp. The warrior defeated the lycanthropes, and the Lion Guard was able to reuse the Siege Camp under the command of &lt;a href=\"Shaza%20gra-Dasik\"&gt;Shaza gra-Dasik&lt;/a&gt;. The traveler would then open the gates of Camlorn from the western gate, causing the Lion Guard to pour into the city. An enclave of civilians was hiding in Camlorn West, under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt;, who was the Captain of the city guard. Both the traveler and Gautier were able to find more civilians and bring them to the local Inn, taking equipment caches throughout Camlorn.\nInside the Inn, &lt;a href=\"Alinon%20the%20Alchemist\"&gt;Alinon the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt; had uncovered a unique way to cure Lycanthropy, by collecting the blood of the werewolves and having them drink it, as a way to cancel it out. The traveler gathered vials of the blood and gave it to several people turned into Werewolves by Telwin. More citizens were rounded up, and all of the survivors banded together to help the Lion Guard in the battle for Camlorn. Volunteers in the resistance were stationed in four watchtowers to light signal fires for the final assault on Faolchu. Once the towers were lit, the Siege Camp unleashed a barrage of fireballs against Castle Camlorn, leaving a fire to envelop the Keep. The traveler and Faolchu fought each other, ultimately leaving Faolchu burning amidst the fire. The Lion Guard were able to recapture Camlorn, though the Bloodthorn Cult continued to fight against the Lion Guard, all the way to the north in &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. The Lion Guard advanced beyond Camlorn to begin the next battle for Glenumbra.\nThe Battle of Cath Bedraud; Holding the Redoubt.\nAngof the Gravesinger and the Bloodthorn Cult had taken control of the King's Guard region in Glenumbra, setting their sights on &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt;, a royal tomb for the Kings of High Rock. The &lt;a href=\"Zombie\"&gt;Zombie&lt;/a&gt;s of the Bloodthorn had riddled the landscape, prompting the Lion Guard to establish a &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard%20Redoubt\"&gt;Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of the Cambray Hills. Throughout the Redoubt, there are hives of Zombies that the Lion Guard faced, from the local &lt;a href=\"Gaudet%20Farm\"&gt;Gaudet Farm&lt;/a&gt; and the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Merovec%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Merovec's Folly&lt;/a&gt;. A member of the Mages Guild, &lt;a href=\"Gabrielle%20Benele\"&gt;Gabrielle Benele&lt;/a&gt; had offered her help to the Lion Guard, by giving them information on the &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Talisman\"&gt;Midnight Talisman&lt;/a&gt;, which was stored in Merovec's Folly. Both the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious warrior&lt;/a&gt; and Benele had delved into the fortress and recovered the Midnight Talisman. With the Talisman, Benele believes that the Lion Guard will be able to defeat Angof the Gravesinger. Both warriors were able to charge the Talisman and defeat the Undead Horde in the area, thus moving to Cath Bedraud to begin the final assault.\nThe Battle of Cath Bedraud; Storming the Tomb.\nWith the King's Guard region secured, the Lion Guard advanced to the north, to the ancient cemetery of &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt;. The assault was led by &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Lanis%20Shaldon\"&gt;Sir Lanis Shaldon&lt;/a&gt;, who was a member of the Knights of the Dragon. Entrance to Cath Bedraud was guarded by a powerful mist that was excreted by the vines. The mysterious traveler, Agent of the Covenant, was able to gather medallions of the Bloodthorn Cult, breaking the barrier to Cath Bedraud, with the power of the Midnight Talisman. The Agent was sent by Benele to traverse the crypt and to find a safe place for the portal to be stored, as well as, finding knights that were lost in the labyrinth. Angof was sealed away in the Inner Sanctum, which was sealed. Darien Gautier learned that the door requires three shard-keys and so the party searched the ruins for these specific keys. With the keys, the party was able to defeat Angof the Gravesinger and save Glenumbra from the Reachmen. Though a new threat would arise in the region of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Death of Kintyra Septim &amp; Broken Diamonds.\nWith the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; declared civil war with the Empire, in an event called the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Forces of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; fought against the Kingdom of Solitude and their various allies. Of these allies was the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Glenpoint\"&gt;March of Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;, a nation with ties to the Glenumbra Moors. The war had reached a new height in &lt;a href=\"3E%20123\"&gt;3E 123&lt;/a&gt; when Kintyra II was executed by Potema Septim and &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Mentin\"&gt;Duke Mentin&lt;/a&gt; of Glenpoint, who sent a call for help to the Empress, which revealed to be a trap. &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; was named the Emperor, ultimately ending the war in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;. The people of both Glenpoint and the Glenumbra Moors were dedicated citizens of the Empire and were furious when they learned of this betrayal caused by the leader of their March. Kintyra II's execution was on the 19th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt; and on that day, the people gathered in mobs, searching every Imperial castle throughout the land for the people responsible, burning flags of the Red Diamond, leaving Broken Diamonds across the snowy land. It is unknown whether they were successful, but that day became a tradition in both nations, being called &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Diamonds%20%28Holiday%29\"&gt;Broken Diamonds&lt;/a&gt;. On the 19th of Frostfall, Breton families would gather at Imperial ruins, forming a circle and singing &lt;a href=\"Sepharve\"&gt;Sepharve&lt;/a&gt;, a song in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Bretic\"&gt;Old Bretic&lt;/a&gt;. This tradition continued throughout Glenpoint and Glenumbra.\nOthrok of Dwynnen &amp; the Battle of Firewaves.\nSometime during the third era, &lt;a href=\"Haymon%20Camoran\"&gt;Haymon Camoran&lt;/a&gt; had usurped the throne of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; from his superior, &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Kaltos\"&gt;Camoran Kaltos&lt;/a&gt; after he had attempted to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;, beginning with &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;. Haymon Camoran would take the name of the Camoran Usurper, beginning his conquest over West Tamriel, beginning with the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The Usurper had taken various city-states including &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;. With Hammerfell out of the way, the Usurper had set his sights on the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Camoran Usurper had spread the &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Host\"&gt;Nightmare Host&lt;/a&gt; onto the &lt;a href=\"Barony%20of%20Dwynnen\"&gt;Barony of Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, taking control of the minor nation, located in modern-day Glenumbra. On the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt;,\na man had emerged from the wilderness, with the intent of freeing Dwynnen from the tyranny of the &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Othrok\"&gt;Othrok&lt;/a&gt; was blessed by the Gods with an army of warriors and animals,\nfighting against the horde of &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; that lived in Dwynnen. Othrok was born to be a true hero of High Rock. Othrok captured Dwynnen in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Wightmoor\"&gt;Battle of Wightmoor&lt;/a&gt;, being named its Baron. Dwynnen's borders had expanded, reaching the Iliac Bay.\nAt the time, the more important nations of the Iliac were unable to fight against the rising threat. The throne of Daggerfall was being challenged for between two claimants to the throne. Both the Kings of Sentinel and Wayrest were only in their minorities. The only other nation strong enough to resist was the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Fiefdom of Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, their leader was deathly ill, dying by the end of &lt;a href=\"3E%20266\"&gt;3E 266&lt;/a&gt;. Baron Othrok took the initiative and assembled an army of the Iliac's nations. The Barony of Dwynnen amassed a navy with the nearby countries of &lt;a href=\"Kambria%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Kambria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phrygias%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Urvaius%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Urvaius&lt;/a&gt;. This combined force was able to rival the invasion force led by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;, which was founded several years later. The &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Camoran Usurper's Invasion&lt;/a&gt; would end with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;. The navy was able to destroy Haymon's armada, freeing the land of his wrath. Though Haymon would remain dead, his legacy lived on in the form of &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, who was born sometime around the destruction of Rihad.\nGlenumbra and its cities during the Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and casted both him and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn had a mighty staff called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which was the key to releasing Uriel and Warhaft from the Deadlands. To secure his control, he broke the Staff of Chaos into several pieces and hid them across the provinces in Tamriel. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and planned to tell the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tharn killed her with his vile magic. Ria Silmane's spirit sought the aid of a warrior also kept imprisoned by Tharn. Silmane help the warrior escaped and tasked them with finding the pieces of the Staff of Chaos throughout Tamriel. At one point, this warrior traveled to the cities of Daggerfall and Camlorn during their quest to gather the pieces. The warrior defeat Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed both Uriel VII and Talin Warhaft, this young warrior was named the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;. The region of Glenumbra was undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. Smaller townships such as &lt;a href=\"Moonguard\"&gt;Moonguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Wastes\"&gt;Ebon Wastes&lt;/a&gt; existed in the area.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Camlorn on their quest to find the fifth piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the western hills, to the city of Camlorn in the province of High Rock. There the traveler ventured to the local &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Seth\"&gt;Brotherhood of Seth&lt;/a&gt; where they met &lt;a href=\"Halfas%20Varn\"&gt;Halfas Varn&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Brotherhood. Varn gives the Eternal Champion a proposition where if they retrieved a tablet taken by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Barnabas\"&gt;Brother Barnabas&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Mines%20of%20Khuras%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Mines of Khuras&lt;/a&gt;, then he would reveal the location of the piece. After bringing the tablet and finding Barnabas dead, Varn showed the way to the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient castle located in the central mountains. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the fifth piece of the staff. The Champion had moved on to find the sixth piece of the staff somewhere in Tamriel.\nConflict across the Iliac; The War of Betony.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20403\"&gt;3E 403&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Mogref\"&gt;Lord Mogref&lt;/a&gt; had contacted &lt;a href=\"King%20Lysandus\"&gt;King Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall with the intent of making Betony a vassal kingdom for Daggerfall, for monetary reasons. Lysandus was pressured for this deal by &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt;, who was the High Priest of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; in Daggerfall. Betony was seen as the holy land of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, known to be the spiritual-protector of the Kingdom. However, &lt;a href=\"King%20Camaron\"&gt;King Camaron&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; had objected to this deal, citing a two-hundred-year-old treaty claiming that Betony belongs to Sentinel. And so, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; had begun, all across the Iliac Bay. Most of the conflict took place throughout the islands of the Iliac and areas in High Rock. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bridwell\"&gt;Lord Bridwell&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Knights of the Dragon, had fought countless victories against Sentinel, from the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Craghold\"&gt;Siege of Craghold&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Bluffs\"&gt;Battle of the Bluffs&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt;. The battle had begun to involve the other minor nations in the Iliac Bay, prompting a third party to create a peace treaty between the two factions. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Graddock\"&gt;Lord Graddock&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; would host a summit in his city to determine an end to this two-year war.\nThe Scribes of Daggerfall under the supervision of Vanech created the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Treaty of Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, which would have ended the conflict. Vanech, persist in claiming Betony, took the original treaty and re-worded it to give Betony to Daggerfall, without making it blatant. At the meeting, King Camaron was given the parchment. Camaron knew better. As he read it, he realized Vanech's trickery, and he reacted in anger, prompting the &lt;a href=\"Riot%20in%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Riot in Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. It was in this conflict, the Royal Guards of both Daggerfall and Sentinel attacked each other in the Castle, ending in the death of Lord Graddock and his family. This caused the throne of Reich Gradkeep to be passed to &lt;a href=\"Auberon%20Flyte\"&gt;Auberon Flyte&lt;/a&gt;, who was Graddock's cousin. Both forces moved deep into the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Fiefdom of Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;, where they eventually fought at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Battle of Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the war, &lt;a href=\"Nulfaga\"&gt;Nulfaga&lt;/a&gt;, Lysandus' mother had prophesized her son's death in this conflict. To prevent this, Nulfaga used her &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; familiar, &lt;a href=\"Skakmat\"&gt;Skakmat&lt;/a&gt; to unleash a thick fog throughout the battlefield. Amidst the conflict, King Lysandus was stricken down by a Sentinelian arrow. Because of this, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Gothryd\"&gt;Prince Gothryd&lt;/a&gt; was named the King of Daggerfall as the battle persisted. In revenge, Gothryd descended into battle and defeated King Camaron. In the end, the battle and war were over. The Kingdom of Daggerfall had won the war. Because of her husband's death, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Akorithi\"&gt;Queen Akorithi&lt;/a&gt; was named the Regent Queen of Sentinel. To establish a peaceful relationship with Sentinel, Gothryd married &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Aubk%27i\"&gt;Princess Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime after, the ghost of King Lysandus had begun to appear in the Iliac Bay, calling for the death of his killer. This caused &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; to send an &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; to the Iliac Bay in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Miracle of Peace; the Warp in the West.\nKing Gothryd continued to rule over Daggerfall ever since the War of Betony. Uriel Septim VII had sent an Agent of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt; to the Kingdom of Daggerfall when news of Lysandus' ghost begun to appear throughout the area. The Agent was sent to Daggerfall to meet with &lt;a href=\"Brisienna%20Magnessen\"&gt;Brisienna Magnessen&lt;/a&gt;, who was posing as a member of the Court of Daggerfall. Unfortunately, the Agent crash-landed in the &lt;a href=\"Privateer%27s%20Hold\"&gt;Privateer's Hold&lt;/a&gt;, a bandit alcove on the Bay. From there the Agent continued their business. The Agent traveled throughout the Iliac Bay, gathering information on King Lysandus, as well as, interact with the leading figures of the Bay. At one point, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Woodborne\"&gt;Lord Woodborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; had garnered possession of the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that can activate &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, the Brass-God of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. The Blades sacked &lt;a href=\"Woodborne%20Hall\"&gt;Woodborne Hall&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of taking the Totem, but it was gone before they arrived. The Agent was then tasked to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Castle Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; to steal the Totem. With the Totem in hand, the bidding soon began for the Totem. Only those of royal blood can activate Numidium, so various notable figures throughout the Iliac contacted the Agent to give them the Totem. It is unknown who got the Totem, but the Kingdoms waged war with each other, attempting to take complete control over the Iliac.\nSometime later, on the 10th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, a magical anomaly called the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; had occurred. Before the event, the four kingdoms of the Iliac waged war for the overall land of the Iliac. The Kingdoms of High Rock razed the forested lands from &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Phrygias\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt; and the, riverside fiefdom of &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt; was fallen asunder by the Kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. Within one day, the forty-four different nations of the Iliac Bay went down to four kingdoms. The Kingdom of Daggerfall expanded from the western end of &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;, all the way to the &lt;a href=\"Fiefdom%20of%20Ykalon\"&gt;Fiefdom of Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;. The years of conflict the Iliac Bay had undergone, had officially ended. King Lysandus' ghost was put to sleep when the Agent murdered his killer. Both Gothryd and Aubk'i continued to rule over the Kingdom of Daggerfall, further bring peace to the region. Other places in Glenumbra such as &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; were also at war with other Kingdoms such as &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiplomatic Resolve; the Rise of King Gothryd.\nAs time went on, the older generation of leaders seen around the War of Betony had left. King Gothryd and Queen Aubk'i have maintained peace throughout the western province, having their first child, &lt;a href=\"Camaron%20II\"&gt;Camaron II&lt;/a&gt;. Aubk'i's youngest brother, &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, had taken the throne of Sentinel when both his mother, Akorithi and his older brother, &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt; had died from a disease. Both the Kingdoms of Daggerfall and Sentinel established an alliance, maintaining order throughout the Iliac. As of &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, Camaron II married &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Kelmena\"&gt;Lady Kelmena&lt;/a&gt;, who was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Senhyn\"&gt;Duke Senhyn&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the city-state of Camlorn. This marriage established relations across the region Glenumbra and Western High Rock, bringing peace along the western coast. The alliance between three major kingdoms would last for several years, all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown how long this alliance had lasted considering King Lhotun's conflict in Hammerfell with &lt;a href=\"the%20Crowns\"&gt;the Crowns&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;."}

While its true that most people in the region take their cues for culture, architecture, food, and dress from a common &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; template, it would be foolhardy to dismiss the cultural differences between the larger populations and the multitude of diverse subcultures present throughout the region.\n&lt;a href=\"Daenia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt;: Dominated by the cultural influence of Daggerfall, Daenia is the home and heartland of Breton's quest obsession. For those unfamiliar with the term, it refers to the practice by which young members of the poor and serf classes can partake in heroic tasks to elevate themselves to the ranks of the nobility. The cultural narratives of Daenia are filled with tales of the lowly taking on a great quest to win the respect and accolades of those above them. It is my suspicion that the famed independent spirit of the Daenian people is an extension of this narrative of upward mobility. Of note, this area is also home to the Wyrd subculture, and several witches' covens dedicated to the worship of nature inhabit the vast forests of Daenia.\n&lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Hills\"&gt;Cambray Hills&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding villages are a hodgepodge of different Breton cultures. The noblity of Camlorn fancy themselves an aristocracy of poets and artists. Often taking a pacifistic tact in their dealings between Daggerfall and Wayrest, Camlorn has benefited much as a go-between from both Iliac Bay and the Etheric Ocean. The Cambray Hills are well-known for being haunted, and any given member of the populace usually has a unique ghost story or two to share. The largest subculture of note are the swamp-dwelling Bretons of the eastern bogs that stretch from the &lt;a href=\"Hag%20Fen\"&gt;Hag Fen&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;: This region is so named for the mountainous ridge the form a natural barrier between Glenumbra, &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Crosswych%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crosswych&lt;/a&gt; is a crossroads for trade moving between these major regions of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and the place has become a melting pot of dress, food, and culture of the Breton city-states. Not so much a subculture, but a subgroup of note for King's Guard is the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rook\"&gt;Red Rook&lt;/a&gt; bandit clan. While the Red Rooks are present throughout Glenumbra, they originated in the mountains and foothills of King's Guard as a loose collection of hunters and highwaymen that preyed upon caravans moving across the pass."}

Any traveler would do well to buy provisions in Daggerfall, as the services in this bustling city are second to none.\n&lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;: A small town between the forests of &lt;a href=\"Daenia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; and the coastal swamplands of &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Hills\"&gt;Cambray Hills&lt;/a&gt;, Aldcroft has come to prominence in recent years as a key port that services &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; from trade routes along the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Aldcroft is well known for its spicy stews, a treat that I recommend those travelers with weak constitutions to avoid.\n&lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;: A city that has grown in recent times to rival Daggerfall in size and cultural influence, Camlorn is in the west center of Glenumbra. The citizens of Camlorn see themselves as more urbane and metropolitan than their neighbors to the south. Travelers are advised to try Camlorn's excellent pastries and baked goods, as they are worth the trip. Ignore the haughtiness of the locals, as this is just their way and they usually don't mean any offense.\n&lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Brook%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eagle's Brook&lt;/a&gt;: Whereas Aldcroft serves as Camlorn's primary connection to Iliac Bay, Eagle's Brook is its corresponding port on the &lt;a href=\"Eltheric%20Ocean\"&gt;Eltheric Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the artisans and craftsmen that serve the high houses of Camlorn actually live in nearby Eagle's Brook. Travelers are advised to sample the excellent seafood brought in daily by Eagle's Brook's fishing boats.\n&lt;a href=\"Crosswych%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crosswych&lt;/a&gt;: Straddling the mountainous border pass marking the end of Glenumbra and the beginning of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, Crosswych makes much of its gold from travelers passing back and fourth between the two most populous regions of High Rock. Travelers heading to Wayrest from Daggerfall must pass through Crosswych, which is as good a place as any for rest and resupply."}

From the center to the south of Glenumbra, one can find lush countryside and verdant forests, whilst disgusting, fetid marshes exist in the eastern regions north of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; have been sighted increasingly more in the woods and are a menace to the locals.

In doing so, the Vestige became a valuable asset to the Lion Guard and assisted them in retaking the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; from Faolchu's werewolves. The Vestige also assisted the &lt;a href=\"Wyress\"&gt;Wyress&lt;/a&gt;es of the region in purifying the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd%20Tree\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd Tree&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding lands from the infesting roots of the Bloodthorn. With assistance from both the Lion Guard and the Wyresses, the Vestige was able to defeat both Angof and Faolchu, ending the crisis imposed on Glenumbra.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Glenumbra and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map.

Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nGlenumbra features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;'s overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Glenumbra. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Glenumbra totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Glenumbra and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The battlefield has many ruins that date back to the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; and even further. &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; crypts are located in the western Moors and are well underground. Large pockets of water are found throughout the battlefield, and battle equipment is riddled all across the area. The closest settlements near the Glenumbra Moors are the towns of &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Westtry\"&gt;Westtry&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are located on the other side of the mountains that circle the Moors.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20479\"&gt;1E 479&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;King Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; and inspired many heroes of Tamriel to follow in his footsteps and rebel against &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorieus\"&gt;Gorieus&lt;/a&gt; of the Alessian Empire. &lt;a href=\"Ryain%20Direnni\"&gt;Ryain Direnni&lt;/a&gt; accumulated an army of &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; Elves, Bretons of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; to fight the Alessian Army advancing across &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; region of High Rock. The Alessian Army led by &lt;a href=\"Faolchu%20the%20Changeling\"&gt;Faolchu the Changeling&lt;/a&gt; moved into the Glenumbra Moors with his army of Alessian warriors and &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolven&lt;/a&gt; berserkers. &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt; utilized powerful magic to battle-harden the Direnni soldiers and it proved to be extremely helpful. Faolchu was defeated by a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Nameless Soldier&lt;/a&gt; by using fire to burn the Werewolf. Eventually, the Alessian Empire fell, and new Empire rose up in the Second Era, the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; ruled up until &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; waged war with the Bretons of Glenumbra to destroy and corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to do his bidding. The leader of the Cult, &lt;a href=\"Angof%20the%20Gravesinger%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Angof the Gravesinger&lt;/a&gt;, resurrected Faolchu the Changeling and his army of Werewolves to wreak havoc across the Cambray Hills. They managed to capture the city of Camlorn and the surrounding settlements. Many refugees from Camlorn arrived into Aldcroft until the &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; was able to recapture Camlorn. The Lion Guard and the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; advanced to the Camlorn Foothills and the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Camlorn\"&gt;Siege of Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; commenced. The way to defeat Faolchu was lost in time and the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; was hired to learn how to beat him, they traveled to the Glenumbra Moors, his former resting place. A mysterious traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; traversed the Glenumbra Moors and discovered the way to defeat Faolchu, the Vestige moved to Camlorn to defeat him.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Glenumbra Moors remained untouched for years. A Barony on the western coast of High Rock was named after the Glenumbra Moors, and it was independent of the forty-four other kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; was constructed in the Barony, and it was named after the larger scale region of Glenumbra. Later in the same year, the Glenumbra Moors was annexed into the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;."}

These champions revered &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, engraving their blades with the wings of a hawk. The bird's keen sight, accuracy, and rending claws inspired their sword-songs, and references to the sun and light are numerous. Sadly, little remains of their tradition, aside from what I have pieced together from crumbling tablets and monuments deep in the desert.\nIt is clear that these warriors, the Glinting Talons, wielded a sword in each hand. They are mentioned often in inscriptions dating to the arrival from &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; for their great deeds\u2014driving off warbands of Orcs when sorely outnumbered, capturing strongholds in surprise attacks, and many other heroic tales. Of their style, though, very little is known. This partial inscription I located at the site of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Six%20Hands\"&gt;Battle of Six Hands&lt;/a&gt; is all that has been recovered regarding their way of the blade:\n\"Face the burdensome sun.

I have no greater desire than to restore this lost way of the blade, but the fragments are so few. The mystery compels me to continue my travels in hopes that, perhaps, I will be led by Tava's grace to discover more, and return this shamefully lost knowledge to our people."}

It can also be Soul Summoned for 100 &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nBoth of Gloom Wraith's attack and defense values increase by 1 for every card you have in play. Therefore, it can be increased to a maximum of 10/10 attack and defense points when summoned, if you have the board filled with 7 other endurance cards.\nIt is suggested to combine it with other cheap Endurance cards to easily get the bonus. Cards like &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Speaker\"&gt;Hist Speaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Minder%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Tree Minder&lt;/a&gt; can also be put in play so that more endurance cards can be summoned before placing Gloom Wraith.\nAttacking.\nGloom Wraith can become powerful if it reaches 6\u201310 attack power. It is suggested to use this when attacking the enemy directly, or attacking creatures with high defenses.\nWhen attacking the opponent, try to use Gloom Wraith in such a way that runes are destroyed immediately. For example, if the enemy is at 24 health and Gloom Wraith is at only 3 attack points, use it first to bring the enemy down to 21 health, and use a more powerful card to destroy the rune. This is done so that if the enemy draws a &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; and destroys Gloom Wraith, its attacks have already been inflicted.\nDefending.\nIf Gloom Wraith reaches a high value, it will be a primary target by opponents. It can instantly be destroyed if an action like &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20Javelin%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Piercing Javelin&lt;/a&gt; is inflicted on it. Placing &lt;a href=\"Ward%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Ward&lt;/a&gt; on the card can easily reduce the damage inflicted upon it, and is very good for countering &lt;a href=\"Lethal\"&gt;Lethal&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nIf one wants to use Gloom Wraith for defense rather than attacking, the card can also become a &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; if a card like &lt;a href=\"Yew%20Shield\"&gt;Yew Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Barded%20Guar\"&gt;Barded Guar&lt;/a&gt; is used on it, forcing the enemy to attack it. This is very useful as it can instantly kill many cards if it reaches a high defense and attack value. It is suggested to silence powerful enemy cards so that Gloom Wraith can remain longer."}

Otherwise, if one does not want to have to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgemaster%27s%20Fingers%20%28Item%29\"&gt;The Forgemaster's Fingers&lt;/a&gt; to gain access, sneak along the ledges on the right side of the entrance to Narzulbur. Alternatively, one can also clear &lt;a href=\"Kolskeggr%20Mine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Kolskeggr Mine&lt;/a&gt; and talk to the Orc in the Miner's Barracks after turning in the quest to &lt;a href=\"Pavo%20Attius\"&gt;Pavo&lt;/a&gt;. He will give access to the strongholds and will mark two strongholds in The Reach on the map. There is a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20Forging\"&gt;Heavy Armor Forging&lt;/a&gt;\" in a small hut to the right of the entrance.\nSeveral Orc miners work in the mine throughout the day and will not stop anyone else from mining the ore veins. If one is not an Orc or Blood-Kin, they will tell the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to leave. The mine itself has sixteen ebony ore veins, six &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ore&lt;/a&gt; veins, three pieces of ebony ore laying on the ground, one ebony ore on a dark barrel, and two pieces of ore in the bucket at the far end of the mine. Taking the pieces of ore from the ground counts as theft and will incur a bounty. There is a bucket with a piece of ebony ore in the cart going across the bridge to the mine. There is an &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;orichalcum ore vein&lt;/a&gt;, four pieces of ebony ore, an ebony ingot, a &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill book&lt;/a&gt; and an apprentice level &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; (under the bed), outside the mine in a small hut. There is also a full set of smithing facilities outside.\nThis results in a total of fifty-five lumps of ebony ore and an ingot, or twenty-eight ingots when all the ore has been &lt;a href=\"Smelting\"&gt;smelted&lt;/a&gt;. This is more than enough for a full set of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt;, including a melee weapon and a bow or shield, or two &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;one-handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons for &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;dual-wielding&lt;/a&gt;, assuming the other materials needed are on hand.\nThere are pockets of gas throughout the mine. Equipping a fire &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Torch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; is enough to cause an explosion. If an explosion injures any of the orcs, it will be considered assault and they will consequently turn hostile and attack.\nThere is a spot in the mine where loose rocks can fall through and kill or injure miners on the level below, causing them to turn hostile. In addition, should any of the loose pieces of ebony ore be stolen\u2014even if the theft is undetected\u2014a group of &lt;a href=\"hired%20thugs\"&gt;hired thugs&lt;/a&gt; may be sent after the Dragonborn by Dushnamub. This will occur whether or not the Dragonborn is Blood-Kin to the orcs, as the ebony ore is flagged as stolen regardless.\nAfter mining all the ores, it will be marked as \"cleared\" on the map; afterwards, ten days of in-game time must pass so the ores can regenerate.\nMining.\nThere are sixteen ebony ore veins, six iron ore veins and five loose ebony ore that can be found in the mine; in order relative to the entrance:\nThe loose ebony ores' locations are:"}

After many hours of difficult travel through tangled hawthorn hells and limberlosts, I was suddenly struck dumb by the aspect of five pure white columns rising from a jade-green mound of vines to perfect V-shaped arches and graceful capitals towering above the verdant forest growth. This spectacle caused me to meditate on the lost glories of the past, and the melancholy fate of high civilizations now poking like splinter shards of bone from the green-grown tumulus of time-swept obscurity.\nWithin the forest tangle I discovered an entrance leading down into the central dome of a great underground edifice once dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Sight, Light, and Insight. Dimly lit by the faded power of its magical pools, the shattered white walls of the enclosure shimmered with a cold blue light.\nThe marble benches of the central plaza faced out across the surrounding waters to tall columns and sharp arches supporting the high dome. From the central island, stately bridges spanned the still pools to narrow walkways behind the columns, with broad vaulted avenues and limpid canals leading away through ever- gloom into darkness. Reflected in the pools were the tumbled columns, collapsed walls, and riotous root and vine growth thriving the dark half-light of the magical fountains.\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s recognized not the four elements of modern natural philosophy -- earth, water, air, and fire -- but the four elements of &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; religion -- earth, water, air, and light. The Ayleids considered fire to be but a weak and corrupt form of light, which Ayleid philosophers identified with primary magical principles. Thus their ancient subterranean temples and sanctuaries were lit by lamps, globes, pools, and fountains of purest magic.\nIt was by these ancient, faded, but still active magics that I knelt and contemplated the departed glories of the long-dead architects. Gazing through the glass-smooth reflections of the surrounding pools, I could see, deep below, the slow pulse, the waxing and waning of the &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20stone\"&gt;Welkynd stone&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe chiefest perils of these ruins to the explorer are the cunning and deadly mechanisms devised by the Ayleids to torment and confound those would invade their underground sanctuaries. What irony that after these many years, these devices should still stand vigilant against those who would admire the works of the Ayleids. For it is clear... these devices were crafted in vain. They did not secure the Ayleids against their true enemies, which were not the slaves who revolted and overthrew their cruel masters, nor the were they the savage beast peoples who learned the crafts of war and magic from their Ayleid masters. No, it was the arrogant pride of their achievements, their smug self-assurance that their empire would last forever, that doomed them to fail and fade into obscurity."}

The Vestige and Count Verandis manage to destroy the portal, but Reezal-Jul escapes.\n&lt;a href=\"Dream-Walk%20Into%20Darkness\"&gt;Dream-Walk Into Darkness&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough reliving Verandis' memories, the Vestige learns that Reezal-Jul served as court mage and adviser to Baron Montclair. When Montclair's wife Leila fell mortally ill and refused Verandis' offer to make her a Vampire, Reezal-Jul offered an alternative: he had in his possession a fragment of an Aylied relic known as the Lightless Relic, and claimed it could heal Leila. Desperate, Montclair agreed, for a while it seemed as if the relic indeed worked, but as time passed Leila's health began to falter once again. In desperation, Montclair, Verandis, Leila, Lleraya and Reezal-Jul ventured to the Doomcrag, where the remains of the Lightless Remnant lay.

The Vestige and Countess Tamrith track down Reezal-Jul in Shadowfate Cavern and finally slay him. His journal reveals that he had known the truth of the Lightless Remnant from the start, and manipulated Montclair into awakening its power as part of his plan to take revenge on the Daggerfall Covenant for King Ranser's death.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Traitor%27s%20Tale\"&gt;A Traitor's Tale&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a flashback, Reezal-Jul is mentioned by General Dathieu as one of King Ranser's mages who seem to have influenced King Ranser to go mad and hold out of Traitor's Tor against the orcs.\nDialogue.\n\"This is hopeless!

Some called him mad. I know him as the genius and he was. A man ahead of his time. Did he care that I enjoyed the occasional experiment? That I saw a path to power in the intricacies of the dark arts? No. He encouraged me! I will always be to King Ranser for that.\nBut sometimes other paths must be followed. I knew that I had to find a new direction as the High King's forces closed upon &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;. That's why, regretfully, I left my beloved king's side before the end came. Someone had to survive to carry on our work. Someone had to survive to make &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt; pay for his insults and injuries. I just wish it could have been my king instead of me. Ah, well, that's the way the river runs.\nI offered my services to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Montclair\"&gt;Baron Montclair&lt;/a&gt; at the first opportunity. We had made each other's acquaintance at one of the king's functions, and he seemed the most suitable for my ultimate plans. I knew that &lt;a href=\"Count%20Tamrith\"&gt;Count Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; would have nothing to do with me or my special talents, and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Dorell\"&gt;Baron Dorell&lt;/a&gt; was too stubborn to take any suggestions I made seriously. But Montclair, he could be swayed. He could be manipulated. He could be forged into the weapon I needed to enact King Ranser's revenge.\nIt was easy enough to convince &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis\"&gt;Count Verandis&lt;/a&gt; to aid my cause. And a simple forget-me draught was enough to wipe the memories from him. Getting his blood vassal to imbibe the potion was child's play. And when Verandis fed, the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; concoction passed from the vassal to him. It was just my good fortune that the Baron's wife was as ill as she was. They were all so worried about her and desperate for a miracle that they accepted what I offered them without question.\nBut enough of the past! It is the future I am more interested in right now. My living &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; experiment worked! I was able to take the living flesh of others and create a totally different living creature. Even now, it grows more powerful in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Crestshade\"&gt;Crestshade&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting my orders to head out and ravage the countryside. It isn't bogged down by the intelligence or demeanor of those who gave their living flesh to its creation\u2014it is a new and unique entity ready to obey my every command! Imagine what I can do with an army of such creatures!\nSoon, all of Rivenspire will be under our control. Then I will convince the Baron to send his undead army and my creations south. This time, the outcome will be much different from &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;. This time, the High King will fall. I have foreseen it. The power of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; relic told me so."}

It comes in two types: \"Reflect Damage\" and \"Reflect Spell\".\nReflect Damage.\nReflect Damage works by reflecting a percentage of afflicted damage back at your opponent, thus reducing the actual damage you receive. It reflects only \"physical\" damage, so magicka-based damage still fully damages you. For example, if you have a Reflect Damage with a spell magnitude of 95%, then 95% of damage inflicted upon you would be returned onto your opponent. The other 5% would actually damage you.\nAt higher levels, it's possible to collect high leveled apparel and armor that grants a 100% Reflect Damage effect. This renders one completely invulnerable to physical attacks, but will not change the damage caused by spells, traps, arrows, or falling.\nThere are no normal means to obtain spells that grant the ability to reflect damage. However, it is possible to learn one through the Shivering Isles quest. Upon making the new gatekeeper, select the \"Heart of Wound Sharing\" body part and later on, you can obtain the spell and maximize it by making a more powerful version through an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;.\nApparel.\nItems that bear the Reflect Damage enchantment are:\nReflect Spell.\nReflect Spell works by reflecting a cast spell back to the caster. The value of reflect spell ranges anywhere from 0\u2013100, with the value representing the percent chance to reflect the spell back. Thus, having \"Reflect Spell 100% for 10 secs\" renders the player invulnerable to all enemy-based magic for 10 seconds."}

For us, cults are first and foremost social and economic organizations. We typically think of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; in the most abstract terms -- as powerful but indifferent spirits to be propitiated, and do not think of their relationships as personal. Notable exceptions include minor charismatic sub-cults of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; also has a significant charismatic sub-cult.\nWith the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, which Heartlanders regard as a dark age, religious cults have played only minor parts in Heartlander and Imperial history. The Septim emperors have made it a policy to limit the influence of cult authorities in aristocratic, military, and bureaucratic affairs. Cult worship is regarded as a private and practical matter, and public pronouncements by religious figures are not welcomed.\n&lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; hero-cults provide a strong counter-current to the dominant secularism of the Empire. The Imperial cult of Tiber Septim is just such a hero-cult, and among the military, provincial colonists, and recently assimilated foreigners, the cult is particularly strong and personal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and its predecessor, house ancestor cults, are, by contrast with Imperial cults, extremely intimate and personal. In ancestor cults, the worshipper has a direct relationship with a blood family ancestor spirit, and the Temple cultist's relationship with the Tribunal is a relationship with a living, breathing god who walks the earth, speaks in person with priests and cultists, and whose daily actions are prescribed models for the daily actions of their followers.\nThe differences in religious temperament between Heartlanders and Morrowind &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; accounts in large part for consistent political and social misunderstanding between the two cultures. Heartlanders do not consider cult affairs as serious matters, where the Dunmer consider cult affairs, and in particular, ancestral spirit veneration, to be very serious matters indeed.\nHeartlanders are casual and tolerant in religious matters; Dunmer are passionate and extremely intolerant. Heartlanders do not speak with their gods, and do not think of their actions as under constant review and judgement by their gods; the Dunmer feel that all they think and do is under the ever-watchful eye of the Tribunal and family ancestor spirits...\""}

From what &lt;a href=\"Josajeh\"&gt;Josajeh&lt;/a&gt; tells me, he is an atypical character, but one that may be of great interest to us.\nThe candidate is one Thorn Blackstaff, an &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and likely an autameld. The name is one he probably chose for himself after exile from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, but that is merely an educated guess. I have not yet unearthed the history he has with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, but there is no doubt that there is little love lost between him and his former kin. Fighting under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, he has shown them no quarter.\nUnder most circumstances, that kind of deep-rooted enmity would disqualify him from consideration, but the man Josajeh described to me from her scrying is both noble and charitable. He often acts as a mentor and a guardian to those in need of guidance for no other reason than it is in his nature. His council isn't only valued by the inexperienced, however. On more than one occasion he has been entrusted with matters of great importance by both the Arch-Mage of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the Mage Lords of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;.\nI believe Blackstaff has great potential to become a &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt;.

This means that an increase to magicka is usually preferable to an increase to magicka regeneration, as the former naturally comes with a certain amount of the latter. For instance, if a character with 100 magicka gains an extra 100% magicka regeneration, that character will regenerate their 100 magicka at 6% per second, or 6 points. If that same character gains an extra 100 magicka instead, they will regenerate their 200 magicka at 3% per second, or 6 points. While the magicka bar will appear to refill more slowly, this is simply because there is more total magicka to regenerate.\nHowever, magicka regeneration items will be preferable if the Dragonborn has already been investing a lot in base magicka as they level up. For example, a character with 300 base magicka and 100% magicka regen bonus will regenerate 18 points per second (300 * 6%). If that same character gains an extra 100 magicka instead, the regeneration rate will be 12 points per second (400 * 3%).\nUse a mix of regenerate and fortify magicka effects for optimal results. Starting with 300 base magicka, plus 50 from &lt;a href=\"Highborn%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Highborn&lt;/a&gt; and 50 from &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Savos Aren's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, results in 400 magicka and 12 points regenerated per second. Adding 300% regeneration (from &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Apprentice Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morokei%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Morokei Mask&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%27s%20Robes\"&gt;Archmage's Robes&lt;/a&gt;), gives recovery of 12% of the Dragonborn's magicka or 48 points per second, which is sufficient to cast powerful spells without worry of being vulnerable for long periods of time.\nSources of this effect unrelated to alchemy or enchanting include the Highborn &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ability&lt;/a&gt;, The Apprentice Stone, and the Recovery &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlchemy.\n&lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt; with Regenerate Magicka can be made at an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;. When consumed, they temporarily increase the rate at which &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; regenerates. The strength of the effect is determined by the Dragonborn's alchemy &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and any &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Alchemy\"&gt;fortify alchemy&lt;/a&gt; enchanted gear equipped.\n&lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following ingredients contain this effect:\nEnchanting.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chest pieces&lt;/a&gt;, headwear, and &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt; can be enchanted with Fortify Magicka Regen at an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.

Sardecus was a near-legendary figure, having fought in countless campaigns, and had distinguished\u00a0himself as both a soldier as well as a general. He was everything that Bucco was not. He was stout, humorless, had hawk-like features, and walked with a limp (a lingering injury from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Battle of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;). He spoke in short, gravely sentences that commanded obedience. He deliberately\u00a0avoided using all formal dress and regalia, preferring to wear a simple centurion's panoply with a white crest to signify his station.\nThe Blackwater War.\nBy &lt;a href=\"1E%202823\"&gt;1E 2823&lt;/a&gt;, Sardecus and his Legion had regained all the territory that Bucco had lost when he had retreated. His success is attributed to his adaptability and tactical creativity. For instance, Sardecus ordered that all &lt;a href=\"legionnaires\"&gt;legionnaires&lt;/a&gt; abandon their metal armor, in favor of padded leather jackets. &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Imperial Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;s coordinated with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0irregulars and scouts, and learned how to subsist on food procured from the swamp alone. &lt;a href=\"Centurion\"&gt;Centurion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"legate\"&gt;legate&lt;/a&gt;s were also given additional authority, such that they could fight independently when the legion became fractured. Sardecus' greatest success, however, was in the diplomatic arena. Early in the conflict, he reached out to disenfranchised Argonian tribes, and offered them rewards for joining the war effort and fighting for the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. He secured solid alliances with several influential tribes, including the treacherous\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Archein\"&gt;Archein&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Shoss-kaleel\"&gt;Shoss-kaleel&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, his forces nearly tripled. The war for\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was finally swinging in the Empire's favor. Sardecus' command strategy hinged on one fundamental principle - the swamp was the true enemy, not the\u00a0Argonians.\nNew war doctrine and \"The Great Burn\".\nDisease accounted for roughly half of all fatalities in the first campaign, followed closely by mysterious disappearances. By Sardecus' estimation, Argonian raids had taken a distant third. With these facts in mind, he created a new war doctrine and disseminated it to all of his officers. The crux of the strategy was simple: the only way to conquer\u00a0Black Marsh\u00a0was to destroy it. Sardecus deployed entire cohorts of engineers and sappers to the front lines. While\u00a0legionnaires\u00a0launched raids on border villages, the supporting troops drained swamps, salted rice paddies, and felled hundreds of trees. The most well-known event of this portion of the war was the \"&lt;a href=\"Great%20Burn\"&gt;Great Burn&lt;/a&gt;\" of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%202828\"&gt;1E 2828&lt;/a&gt;. Records indicate that in early\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;\u00a01E 2828,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elissia%20Mallicius\"&gt;Elissia Mallicius&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(one of Sardecus' most-trusted legates) ordered a unit of sappers to set fire to a peat bog outside of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;. The sappers followed the orders, not knowing that the bog was just one part of a massive underground network. Months passed before legionnaires started reporting random fires, some as far away as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Soulrest\"&gt;Soulrest&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;. It took several more months before the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; realized that the entire region was on fire. An inferno of burning peat and detritus raged underfoot for more than three years. The already deadly marsh became so dangerous that the Legion was forced to give ground for the first time in the better part of a decade. Hundreds of soldiers were lost to \"&lt;a href=\"swamp%20lung\"&gt;swamp lung&lt;/a&gt;\" and gas explosions before they escaped the scalding heat of the fire. It was a devastating blow to both the Legion and the Argonians. This marked the end of the second campaign, and the end of Sardecus' tenure as general.\nDeath.\nSoon after the legion's retreat, Sardecus fell ill and died\u00a0before reaching the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The official diagnosis was a severe infection from a wound he had sustained on the way out of the marsh. However, the true circumstances of Sardecus' death are still a matter of historical debate. The &lt;a href=\"author\"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Blackwater%20War\"&gt;The Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt;\" believes that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowscales\"&gt;Shadowscales&lt;/a&gt; played some role in his death, as Sardecus was a high-ranking general, and had died shortly after the Great Burn."}

Veloth saw fit to set aside this weapon when he vowed to turn his attention from war to the task of building a new home for the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the Judgment resides in the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; and is said to have powers related to cleansing corrupted souls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tear%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Tear of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;: This radiant crystal is believed to be a tear shed by Veloth when he first laid eyes upon the land of Resdayn, the new homeland he had seen in his visions. According to the legend, the tear froze as it slid down Veloth's cheek. Kept by the monks of the monastery of Muth Gnaar, this crystal has great healing and restorative powers\u2014provided the monks maintain a constant vigil and pattern of prayer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Vessel%20of%20Veloth\"&gt;Holy Vessel of Veloth&lt;/a&gt;: Used by Veloth to carry water to quench the thirst of his sick followers during the exodus, and then later to irrigate the young crops of the new homeland, the Holy Vessel now resides in the temple in Selfora.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Reliquary of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt;; The Reliquary that stands in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Saint%20Veloth\"&gt;Shrine of Saint Veloth&lt;/a&gt; in Deshaan is not a relic, per se, but instead contains perhaps the most powerful and holy relics associated with Veloth\u2014his skull and bones. The bones of the saint are said to have many magical properties, and pilgrims travel from across Morrowind to receive the saint's blessing. Legends claim that the most faithful sometimes receive visions of the saint while meditating and praying before the Reliquary."}

She is the creator of the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; who guards the gates and has their &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation.\nShe can sometimes be found in one of the rooms in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wastrel%27s%20Purse\"&gt;The Wastrel's Purse&lt;/a&gt;. It is suggested that she had a relationship with &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, who helped her create the Gatekeeper. She considers the Gatekeeper her child, visiting him every night at midnight. She talks to him and cries (the Gatekeeper does not attack her). Her tears, which remain on the ground, are poisonous to the gatekeeper.\nPersonality.\nShe seems to be sadistic, as well as having a very high opinion of herself. She is overly critical of her assistant, &lt;a href=\"Nanette%20Don\"&gt;Nanette Don&lt;/a&gt;, constantly belittling her absentmindedness. She shows very little emotion about her \"test subjects,\" and her home is littered with her failed experiments. In the beginning of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Rebuilding the Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;\" she is in &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Vivisection\"&gt;Sanctum of Vivisection&lt;/a&gt;, torturing people with fire, darts, and trapdoors. It is also heavily implied that she had a rather close relationship with Sheogorath at some point prior to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Champion's&lt;/a&gt; arrival.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Fringe%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Through the Fringe of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero must find a way to defeat the Gatekeeper and fully enter Sheogorath's realm.\n&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Rebuilding the Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelmyna orders the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to bring her four &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild the Gatekeeper from the &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Flesh%20and%20Bone\"&gt;Gardens of Flesh and Bone&lt;/a&gt;. Once they have been obtained, she performs the incantations to build the new Gatekeeper.\nThe Gatekeeper.\nWhen Relmyna approached the Gatekeeper, she will speak to it, using a combination of the following lines:\n\"Well, my child, how are you this evening?\", or, \"My dearest, how are you feeling tonight, child?\", or, \"I'm so glad to see you, my dear child. How are you?\"\n\"I see you have been playing rough with the other boys. They are weak and you are strong!\", or, \"Look at all the bones around you! You have been a busy little boy, haven't you?\", or, \"I'm so proud of you, my child. You crush our Lord's enemies into dust.\"\n\"Just looking at you reminds me of... Him. Why has He forsaken us?\", or, \"You are strong like Him. I made you for Him. But still He refuses me. Why?\", or, \"Seeing you warms my cold heart. Why has He forsaken us?\"\n\"No, it's too much. I don't know why I keep coming to visit you!\", or, \"I'm sorry child, it's just too much for me. I must leave now!\", or, \"Why does it still hurt, after all these years? Why?\"\n\"No. You mustn't come near me when I'm crying... you remember what happened last time you touched my tears!\", or, \"No, not now! Don't you remember what happened last time you touched my tears? Keep away!\", or, \"Stay away. My tears, they burn you! Don't you remember? Stay back, child!\"\nThe new Gatekeeper.\n\"First, place the Gatekeeper's Body into the Cistern of Substantiation. At the beginning of the worlds were five. Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and Light. Darkness turned into day, the void took form. Hidden away, by virtue of its own self-awareness, was the sixth, containing within it the five which birthed it. Flesh! Meat with the desire to consume like Fire... Place the Dermis Membrane into the cistern. Blood, liquid nutrient, that ocean which casts pearls of life upon the shores of existence... Place the Blood Liqueur into the Cistern of Substantiation. Bone, branch, and stone of the body, giving shape and structure... Place the Osseous Marrow into the cistern. Breath, child of air, bestowing movement, the stirring of spirit... Place the Essence of Breath into the Cistern of Substantiation. And last, the light of Flesh, the illumination of Soul -- perception, thought, memory, imagination... I summon thee, walker in Flesh! Flesh of true Flesh! From those waters of Oblivion which sire thy kind. Come to this altar. Join with this body. Quintessence of Flesh joined with the Essence of Flesh. Absolute in mortal. Immortal bound to contingent. Stand clear of the cistern. Over here by me. Honored Daedra, fear not thy abasement! Thou shalt be the Holy in this Temple! I bind thee Atronach to this body, henceforth Gatekeeper of the Shivering Isles. My child. It is time to fulfill your destiny. Stand guard in this land against all those who seek entry not bearing the mark of Sheogorath's favor. You shall know them by the coldness in their minds. A darkness of spirit. What's this? My child, they are coming. Destroy them! Show them your true power!\""}

Those who hope to destroy me must be of stout spirit and cunning mind, for if they simply forge ahead in these caves, they may meet a fate far worse than death.\nWhen we first discovered these caves and began our explorations, we were sure we had found refuge from our enemies. Little did we know, as we pushed into the interior galleries what we would find. In the final chamber, we came upon the ruined portal to a vast tomb. At first we were eager to chance upon some riches to fill our coffers, but instead we found ourselves within the nest of deadly creatures. By our wits and skill of arms, we were able to retreat from the dark lair. For a time we sealed the entry, but the threat continued to gnaw at us. It was &lt;a href=\"Giden%20Nelvilo\"&gt;Giden&lt;/a&gt; who conceived the plan with which we presented to those beings of darkness. In return for our right to dwell within these caves, we provide \"sustenance\" for these creatures.

She is probably somewhere around Tel Mithryn.\"\nWalkthrough.\nSpeaking to Neloth after completing one side quest for him will make this quest available. He begins it by asking if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has seen his steward, Varona.\n\"Have you seen Varona? I'm hungry.\"\nNo, I haven't seen Varona. \"Well find her. Tell her I want apple cabbage stew, with some canis root tea.\"\nFind Varona.\nTalk to &lt;a href=\"Elynea%20Mothren\"&gt;Elynea Mothren&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn%20Apothecary\"&gt;Tel Mithryn Apothecary&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ulves%20Romoran\"&gt;Ulves Romoran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn%20Kitchen\"&gt;Tel Mithryn Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;. They both reveal she left for &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; a few hours ago to arrange for supplies. Next, a quest marker will appear on the map with the location of Varona. Follow the quest marker to locate Varona's corpse. She will be surrounded by &lt;a href=\"ash%20spawn\"&gt;ash spawn&lt;/a&gt;, indicating she was ambushed by the creatures.\nReturn to Neloth.\nGo back to Tel Mithryn and inform Neloth that Varona was killed on the way to Raven Rock. In his typical selfish manner, Neloth remarks:\nVarona is dead. \"Dead? Well that's annoying. How did she die?\"\nFind a new steward.\nHead to Raven Rock in search of a new steward. Almost everyone in town will refuse to become Neloth's new steward for &lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward%23Raven%20Rock%20rejections\"&gt;various reasons&lt;/a&gt;, however &lt;a href=\"Drovas%20Relvi\"&gt;Drovas Relvi&lt;/a&gt;, a worker at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Retching%20Netch\"&gt;The Retching Netch&lt;/a&gt;, will gladly accept the position.\nWhen asked he replies: \"Uh... you mean leave Raven Rock? For good? To go work for a crazed Telvanni wizard? Sure. Just let me get my things. On second thought, nevermind. I can get new stuff.\"\nAsking why he seems so eager, he replies: \"Well, I've never been one to pass up an opportunity. Sorry to run, but I'm off to my new job.\" Keen to begin, Drovas immediately leaves Raven Rock and makes his way to Tel Mithryn.\nReturn to Neloth to complete the quest and earn a reward of leveled gold and access to his &lt;a href=\"Staff%20Enchanter\"&gt;Staff Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;.\nI've found you a new steward. \"That Drovas man? I suppose he'll do. He makes dreadful canis root tea though. But, I should be grateful. Here, take this for your efforts. Oh, and you may use my staff enchanter if you want.\"\nLater, during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Old%20Friends\"&gt;Old Friends&lt;/a&gt;,\" Neloth can be asked how Drovas is getting along. Neloth replies:\nHow is Drovas working out? \"The man makes a dreadful cup of canis root tea. However, he seems to run the place well enough. Oh. Were you fishing for a compliment? A sign of gratitude? Don't waste your time. Those things are for the weak and foolish.\""}

He is known to have conquered &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; during his lifetime.\nHistory.\nEarly life.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the divine crusader &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; was said to have screamed out Reman Cyrodiil's name during a battle, millennia before the future leader's birth. According to a mythical source, Reman was conceived by King Hrol and the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. The mound on which Reman was conceived would soon turn into a large hill over the span of nine months, later dubbed &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. The shepherd Sed-Yenna would climb the hill after hearing an infant's cries, allegedly finding him with the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; upon his forehead and naming him Reman, meaning \"Light of Man.\" She would place him on the throne uncontended and he would declare, with the voice of a grown man, \"I AM CYRODIIL COME.\" It is said that he crushed a major Colovian revolt at age twelve, with all Colovian kings swearing fealty to him at age thirteen.\nAkaviri invasion.\nReman rallied the Colovian armies and the Nibenay armies in order to face the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. He would wage war with the invaders in all the northern provinces, and is credited for erecting many old forts that still dot &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s landscape. Eventually, this war would culminate in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Reman guessed that they would invade Cyrodiil through the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and would station his armies throughout the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. His guess would turn out to be correct, and his armies halted the Akaviri's main force while &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; armies swooped in from behind and cut off their supplies and reinforcements. After a short skirmish, seeing no other option, the Akaviri suddenly surrendered en masse. They proclaimed Reman as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; they so desperately sought.\nEmperorship.\nAfter their victory at Pale Pass, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; would be loosely formed, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Reman gladly accepted the Akaviri's surrender and accepted them into his army, this made the army into a disciplined and effective fighting force. Reman is said to have wanted to unite Tamriel under his banner. It is said that Reman appointed &lt;a href=\"Kantus%20Jeril\"&gt;Kantus Jeril&lt;/a&gt; to be the first &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. Reman now found himself dealing with Skyrim and High Rocks's problems. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202704\"&gt;1E 2704&lt;/a&gt; he split &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; between the two provinces, splitting the mines in between them and taking away the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;'s ability to rally and plot against him. He would send small armies to pacify Skyrim and High Rock's wild populace and introduce them to a proper economy. Reman would once again start human conquest, founding a stronger Cyrodiil.\nThe elves began to be wary of Reman's rapid expansion. Likewise, Reman would also be wary of the elves. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt; Reman took advantage of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt; and easily invaded &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. He deposed the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and split Valenwood to various &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt;s so that they would never find a common enemy. Reman would also invade and take the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nReman would take the surname of \"Cyrodiil\" to try and inspire pride and connection to his people. Although his surname was Cyrodiil, the province was not actually named after him. Rather he took the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; name of the heartlands\u2014\"Cyrod\"\u2014as his surname. Reman would establish the coronation rites that succeeding emperors would use, including the ritual geas of the Amulet of Kings.\nDeath.\nReman Cyrodiil died in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%202762\"&gt;1E 2762&lt;/a&gt; under unknown causes. He was known to have possessed the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and passed it onto his successors. Upon his death, he was entombed within &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. His supposed son, &lt;a href=\"Kastav\"&gt;Kastav&lt;/a&gt;, would become the first official Emperor.\nWorship.\nReman Cyrodiil is known as &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; the Worldly God, worshiped by &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; as a cultural &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;-hero of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. As late as the first century of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, Reman is known to have been worshipped, alongside &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, as a \"conqueror god.\" By the late Third Era, very few citizens of the Empire revered Reman as a god."}

Reman's first move as Emperor was to put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; that his predecessor had recklessly started, and did so using swift negotiation tactics.\nReman quickly revealed that he was a skilled tactician and politician and always showed respect to his own men and to his enemies. Whenever he conquered new territory he did so with a careful hand, as to not disrupt local culture and traditions, but mostly to establish good trade. He gathered many advisors from the conquered territories to help him figure out how to rule it correctly. Reman was known as the Emperor who focused on his people more than any other. Under his rule, &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; Worship was abolished and the Second Empire thrived. However, Reman desired more.\nAround the 2830s he ordered the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legions&lt;/a&gt; of the Empire to launch a full-scale offensive into &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;, an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt;. The campaign proved to be very difficult with many casualties and losses. Only the northeastern parts of the province were captured resulting in Reman declaring an end to the offensive in &lt;a href=\"1E%202837\"&gt;1E 2837&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot content with the annexation of Black Marsh, Reman invaded &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202840\"&gt;1E 2840&lt;/a&gt;, engaging in a long series of battles that would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;. He died fighting the Dunmer around &lt;a href=\"1E%202843\"&gt;1E 2843&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"1E%202851\"&gt;2851&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 57. He was succeeded by &lt;a href=\"Brazollus%20Dor\"&gt;Brazollus Dor&lt;/a&gt; and his descendant &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; who would continue fighting the War until its conclusion in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;."}

In fact, it was the Akaviri who did the most to promote his standing as Emperor, although Reman himself never took that title in his lifetime. During his rule, Reman Cyrodiil unified Cyrodiil and conquered &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;.

The hostages were housed and trained. Later, in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"1E%202804\"&gt;1E 2804&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor Kastav ordered the Dragonguard to suppress the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0but the Master refused to do so. In response, Kastav ordered for their supplies to be cut off.

Reman II annexed &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to do the same to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; but died in battle fighting the Dunmer.\n&lt;a href=\"Brazollus%20Dor\"&gt;Brazollus Dor&lt;/a&gt; (reign: &lt;a href=\"1E%202762\"&gt;1E 2762&lt;/a&gt;\u2013?).\nBrazollus Dor ascended to the throne after the death of Reman Cyrodiil II.

Dor had generally little interest in matters of the state, and was not considered a particularly capable ruler, preferring to spend most of his time in his county estate near &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;.

And the earth was sick with this sundering. Once-worthy western kings, of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sarchal\"&gt;Sarchal&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Delodiil\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt;, became through pride and habit as like thief-barons and forgot covenant. In the heartland things were no better, as arcanists and false moth-princes lay in drugged stupor or the studies of vileness and no one sat on the Throne in dusted generations. Snakes and the warnings of snakes went unheeded and the land bled with ghosts and deepset holes unto cold harbors. It is said that even the &lt;a href=\"Chim-el%20Adabal\"&gt;Chim-el Adabal&lt;/a&gt;, the amulet of the kings of glory, had been lost and its people saw no reason to find it. And it was in this darkness that King &lt;a href=\"Hrol\"&gt;Hrol&lt;/a&gt; set out from the lands beyond lost Twil with a sortie of questing knights numbered eighteen less one, all of them western sons and daughters. For Hrol had seen in his visions &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;the snakes to come&lt;/a&gt; and sought to heal all the borders of his forebears. And to this host appeared at last a spirit who resembled none other than El-Estia, queen of ancient times, who bore in her left hand the &lt;a href=\"dragonfire\"&gt;dragonfire&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;aka-tosh&lt;/a&gt; and in her right hand the jewels of the &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt; and on her breast a wound that spilt void onto her mangled feet. And seeing El-Estia and Chim-el Adabal, Hrol and his knights wailed and set to their knees and prayed for all things to become as right. Unto them the spirit said, I am the healer of all men and the mother of dragons, but as you have run so many times from me so shall I run until you learn my pain, which renders you and all this land dead.\nAnd the spirit fled from them, and they split among hills and forests to find her, all grieving that they had become a villainous people. Hrol and his shieldthane were the only ones to find her, and the king spoke to her, saying, I love you sweet &lt;a href=\"Aless\"&gt;Aless&lt;/a&gt;, sweet wife of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Auri-el\"&gt;Auri-el&lt;/a&gt; and the Sacred Bull, and would render this land alive again, not through pain but through a return to the dragon-fires of covenant, to join east and west and throw off all ruin. And the shieldthane bore witness to the spirit opening naked to his king, carving on a nearby rock the words AND HROL DID LOVE UNTO A HILLOCK before dying in the sight of their union.\nWhen the fifteen other knights found King Hrol, they saw him dead after his labors against a mound of mud. And they parted each in their way, and some went mad, and the two that returned to their homeland beyond Twil would say nothing of Hrol, and acted ashamed for him.\nBut after nine months that mound of mud became as a small mountain, and there were whispers among the shepherds and bulls. A small community of believers gathered around that growing hill during the days of its first churning, and they were the first to name it the Golden Hill, &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;. And it was the shepherdess Sed-Yenna who dared climb the hill when she heard his first cry, and at its peak she saw what it had yielded, an infant she named &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;, which is \"Light of Man.\"\nAnd in the child's forehead was the Chim-el Adabal, alive with the dragon-fires of yore and divine promise, and none dared obstruct Sed-Yenna when she climbed the steps of &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; to place the babe Reman on his Throne, where he spoke as an adult, saying I AM CYRODIIL COME.\nChapter 2: The Chevalier Renald, Blade of the Pig\nAnd in the days of &lt;a href=\"interregnum\"&gt;interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the Chim-el Adabal was lost again amid the petty wars of gone-heathen kings. West and east knew no union then and all the lands outside of them saw Cyrodiil as a nest of snakemen and snakes. And for four more hundreds of years did the seat of Reman stay sundered, with only the machinations of a group of &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;loyal knights&lt;/a&gt; keeping all its borders from throwing wide.\nThese loyal knights did go by no name then, but were known by their eastern swords and painted eyes, and it was whispered that they were descended from the bodyguard of old Reman. One of their number, called the &lt;a href=\"Chevalier%20Renald\"&gt;Chevalier Renald&lt;/a&gt;, discovered the prowess of &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; and then supported him towards the throne. Only later would it be revealed that Renald did this thing to come closer to &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, anon Stormcrown, the glorious yet-emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;; only later still, that he was under instruction by a pig.\nLong glory was wife to the all the knights of the dragon-banner, who knew no other and were brothers before beyond many seas and now were brothers under the law named the blade-surrender of Pale Pass. And having vampire blood these brother-knights lived for ages through and past Reman and then kept guard over his ward, the coiled king, &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt;. The snake-captain Vershu became Renald became the protector of the northern west when the black dart was hooked into &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;.\n[Here torn pages indicate that the rest of this ancient book has been lost.]"}

Soon, it would be over. He would return to the Hist. How embarrassing, though, for an Argonian to suffocate in mud.\nHis eyes opened suddenly. He'd had the same dream every night for weeks. Each night, he felt he was nearly at the cave's exit. Everything would be made clear once he reached it. And each morning, Scale-Song awoke, no closer to understanding the meaning of the imagery.\n\"Clearly, the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; speaks to you,\" said his egg-brother Gash-Tail. \"Tonight, ask what it wants. Talk to it.\"\"I'll try,\" said Scale-Song, \"but I never remember it's a dream until I'm awake.\"\nGash-Tail reached into an earthenware jar on the shelf beside him. He handed Scale-Song a thick roll of leaves tied with twine. \"Burn this,\" he said. \"The incense may clear your mind. If the Hist wants you, you must listen.\"\nScale-Song nodded. Advice like this was precisely why he sought Gash-Tail's help. For the first time in a long while, he couldn't wait for night to fall.\nThe burnt incense filled his hut with thick gray smoke that coiled heavily along the ground like fog. Scale-Song hadn't expected it to smell so horribly. Still, he watched the smoke spread slowly throughout the room, his eyelids growing heavier and heavier.\nA cave. A tunnel? Smoke drifted along the muddy floor. Scale-Song stopped running and reached out a hand toward the smoke. Talk. Ask. Speak.\n\"Are you trying to tell me something?\" he asked aloud.\n\"I am dead.\"\n\"Dead? Who are you?\"\nThe smoke coalesced into a shimmering figure, hooded and cloaked. Its tail twitched. \"I am dead,\" the figure said. \"Without it, all that I am will be lost forever. Find it. Remember.\"\n\"It? What is it?\"\nScale-Song followed the figure through the dark passage. His feet no longer sank into the mire, as in all the other dreams. They walked in silence. Scale-Song was alert, but untroubled.\nIt seemed like hours before the pair reached the tunnel's exit. The shimmering figure sighed deeply, pointing toward a shriveled tree.\n\"A Hist,\" said Scale-Song, surprised. \"Is this it? Dead \u2026 but how?\"\n\"Remember,\" said the figure, unfurling into the wind, but not before it pressed a Mnemic Egg into Scale-Song's hands."}

Despite its age, the Old Fort is considered one of the most impressive examples of Nordic architectural achievement. The Fort was known to have towering walls built out of enormous porphyry blocks fitted together without seam or mortar.\u00a0It was largely thought to be impregnable.\u00a0"}

If I walk around the grounds of Tel Mithryn, I might find a clue.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter Neloth assigns to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; the task of finding him a &lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;new steward&lt;/a&gt;, and after the withered part of Tel Mithryn is &lt;a href=\"Healing%20a%20House\"&gt;repaired&lt;/a&gt;, a third attack causes Neloth to reveal to the Dragonborn his suspicion that the attacks are organized\u2014the same suspicion that &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Veleth\"&gt;Captain Veleth&lt;/a&gt; has about the attacks on &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Neloth gives the Dragonborn the task of discovering the source of the attacks.\nThe quest becomes available once \"Healing a House\"\u00a0or \"Reluctant Steward\" and \"Briarheart Necropsy\" are completed. Travel to Tel Mithryn and encounter several\u00a0Ash Spawn outside. Upon killing them, head into the main tower and notify Neloth of the attack.\n\"There are too many coincidences. There must be someone behind all of my recent troubles.\"\nHe states that it is not a coincidence that the events that have taken place occurred, and that someone must be behind the attacks.\nSomeone is attacking you? \"Yes. I have enemies. Legions of them back in Morrowind. However, in this case I have reason to believe it is someone in Solstheim.\"\nFind the source.\nHe gives you &lt;a href=\"Neloth%27s%20Ring%20of%20Tracking\"&gt;Neloth's Ring of Tracking&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0which will help identify the culprit.\nHow does the ring work? \"Just wear it. It will light up the source when you get close to it. I enchanted the ring with a bit of ash from the last ash spawn attack. It can follow the magical link back to its summoner.\"\nPut on\u00a0the ring and head east of Tel Mithryn towards the coastline. You will find a small graveyard surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbells&lt;/a&gt; nestled against a lone pine. One of the tombs will glow a vivid blue-white when within a certain distance. This is &lt;a href=\"Ildari%20Sarothril\"&gt;Ildari Sarothril&lt;/a&gt;'s sarcophagus. Collect the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt; inside, then return to report your results. Neloth will believe his former apprentice, Ildari, is behind the attacks. He believed she was dead, but there is no body in the grave.\nThis heart stone is the source of the attacks. \"Hmm. I've known for decades that heart stones will animate the ash. But it would have to be very close by. Where exactly did you find this heart stone?\"\nNext, he casts a divination and finds that she is in &lt;a href=\"Highpoint%20Tower\"&gt;Highpoint Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"I call upon the powers of the sun, moons and stars. Ildari Sarothril, reveal yourself! She lives. Seek her in Highpoint Tower.\"\nHe reveals:\n\"So, Ildari does live after all. She thought she could hide from me, but she can't! She's holed up in Highpoint Tower. Go rip that thrice cursed heart stone from her chest.\"\nAsking if he is coming along, he replies:\nAren't you coming to Highpoint Tower? \"Me? No. Highpoint Tower will be filled with monsters and traps. It's much safer for me to risk your life. Don't worry. If you die, I'll find some other way to take care of Ildari.\"\nHe parts with: \"Be sure to bring back an amusing story of how Ildari died.\"\nHighpoint Tower.\nTraveling to Highpoint Tower, the entry was &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Lock%20Outs\"&gt;previously blocked&lt;/a&gt;, but the ash has been cleared. The path to the door can be reached by a nondescript crevice on the northern side of the mound. Ash spawn are guarding the entrance which will need to be taken care of. Upon entering Highpoint Tower, head down the stairs. If Dragonborn explores the caverns, there are numerous geodes including ruby, emerald and sapphire to the southwest upon descending the stairs. Deep underground, the fort contains a prison where\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Niyya\"&gt;Niyya&lt;/a&gt;, a miner, is locked up. If released, she reveals that she and the other miners took pity on Ildari, thinking she was badly injured, and she repaid their kindness by attacking them in the night. She imprisoned most of them for her personal experiments. Further exploration will reveal a large cavernous area where Ildari is holed\u00a0up with &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Guardian\"&gt;Ash Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and ash spawn. She taunts \"You've gone far enough. Neloth is a fool to think he could send some low life to finish me off.\" and retreats further into the ruins where there are further ash spawn. She can be found and fought in a final chamber, and the battle ends with the Dragonborn ripping out the Heart Stone that was keeping her alive, killing her once and for all.\nReturn to Neloth.\nUpon returning to Tel Mithryn, Neloth greets the Dragonborn with \"You're alive. I hope that bodes ill for Ildari.\" Inform him she is dead and he responds:\nIldari is dead. \"Well, well. You have proven to be a more valuable ally than I anticipated. I have a staff for you, but I would also like to make you a member of my household. A member of House Telvanni. No need to thank me. I know you are overwhelmed with gratitude.\"\nNeloth gives the Dragonborn a staff, and also makes them a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; as a reward. Asking him what it means to be a member of his house, he remarks: \"\"For now, not much. But in a few decades when I return to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, you would be seen as Morrowind nobility. In the mean time, we would keep a bed and chest here for you.\"\""}

While the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of West Skyrim embrace the cultures of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Nords of the Old Holds stick to the old ways that date back to the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; of the distant north.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe Old Holds consist of the eastern holds of Skyrim which include &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these regions has unique distinctions that separate them from each other, as well as the other holds in the west. The original capital of the East was the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, located on the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt;, leading into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of both the Old Holds and Skyrim was changed to the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, located in the northern reaches of the province. The Old Holds take up the less amount of area when compared to West Skyrim, although the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; has been considered a part of the region. There are several large landmarks across the Holds such as &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Honrich\"&gt;Lake Honrich&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Merethic Era, the Old Holds of Skyrim have been traditionally bound together, fighting alongside one another throughout the years.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; and was a close ally of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;. When Reman was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; in his chambers, many leaders of the Empire were killed as well; this included Logrolf. Logrolf's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt; was to assume the throne after Logrolf and the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; chose her to lead her people in the coming years. A &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was made in the city of Solitude, and the Jarls of Skyrim chose &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude to become the next &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;. Svartr had also claimed that Freydis was an illegitimate daughter to Logrolf and that she did not deserve the throne. This conflict resulted in the province of Skyrim to split into two separate kingdoms, one with Freydis being High Queen, and one with Svartr being High King. Freydis' Skyrim would become known as the Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Demons of &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; invaded the continent of Tamriel in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. Ada'Soom's army besieged eastern Tamriel from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to the tundra of Eastmarch. The city of Windhelm was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt; and would eventually be inherited to her eldest daughter, &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;. Things took a turn for the worst when the city was besieged by the Snow Demons, with both Flame-Hair and Nurnhilde died in its wake. &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Prince Jorunn&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the temple of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; to ask for the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; help in the matter. The Greybeards conjured &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; the Ash-King to assist the Prince in his battle against the Snow Demons. Both Jorunn and Wulfharth assembled an army at the gates of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, Ada'Soom's army was intimidated by the large numbers of angry &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, so they avoided the city and traveled into &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. His army was cornered at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt;. To the west was Jorunn and Wulfharth with their vast army, to the east was the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, and to the south was the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Vicecanon%20Heita-Meen\"&gt;Vicecanon Heita-Meen&lt;/a&gt;. The Snow Demons were defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, and amidst the conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; was formed, an alliance of the Nords of Eastern Skyrim, the Dunmer of Morrowind, and the Argonians of Black Marsh.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim dissolved sometime before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; first became the new &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the kingdom dissolving, remnants of this ideology still existed in Skyrim. The denizens of Eastern Skyrim were firm believers of the Old Ways and felt that Skyrim was meant to stick with their old traditions. Skyrim would not be split this way again at the beginning of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. The Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; defeats &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; in a duel that ultimately killed him in the process. Ulfric utilized the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to subsequently kill Torygg, which branded Ulfric, a murderer throughout the cities in Skyrim. The cities of Windhelm, Riften, &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, and Winterhold banded together to fight against Western Skyrim and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;. The city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; was in a gray area of the war, but it still saw support in the Empire. Western Skyrim and Eastern Skyrim would fight against each other in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;."}

The settlement was once the home of a large horde of Reachmen that held significant power throughout the Reach and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nOld Hroldan is located deep within the Reach, north of where the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; meets the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The overall fate of Greater Hroldan is unknown, but what remained was a single inn near the fort of &lt;a href=\"Sungard\"&gt;Sungard&lt;/a&gt;. Old Hroldan is located on the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt;. Old Hroldan was described as being a fortress with gates and such, implying it was much bigger than it is in the fourth era. The Greater Reach is collectively owned by both &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and Skyrim.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld Hroldan has been disputed territory between the Reachmen of the Reach and the Nords of Skyrim for centuries. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kastav%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Kastav Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the area known as Hroldan was once the site of a Nordic settlement. It has been ever since the reign of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Gjalund\"&gt;Jarl Gjalund&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; long before the Reman Empire's foundation. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202801\"&gt;1E 2801&lt;/a&gt;, Kastav utilized the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; to seize the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of Hroldan and &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that these leaders met their conscription quotas. These actions ordered by the Emperor weakened the relationship with the Dragonguard and the denizens of Skyrim. Things would take a toll for the worst with the events occurring at &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in the waning years of the second era, the area known as Old Hroldan was captured by the Reachmen. The Reach warriors situated in Hroldan had significant power in the region, threatening the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of Colovia were merely petty-barons and merchant-lords, unable to sustain unique power. &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt; of Falkreath sought to unite the Colovian Estates, but needed to secure the northern border, where Old Hroldan is located. Cuhlecain amassed an army under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic warrior from &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; to combat the Reachmen of Old Hroldan. Hjalti utilized the power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient art of combat originating from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;, Hjalti blasted the gates of the stronghold with his Thu'um and defeated the Reachmen. Hjalti would go on to establish the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; as Tiber Septim. The events that had transpired in Old Hroldan resulted in the populace viewing the Reachmen as savages.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the area called Old Hroldan has had a lack of interest by both the Reachmen and the Nords of Skyrim. What remained of this stronghold is a single inn referred to as the Old Hroldan Inn, owned by a Nordic woman named &lt;a href=\"Eydis\"&gt;Eydis&lt;/a&gt;, whose husband was fighting in the Civil War. An apparition from the Battle of Old Hroldan appeared before the inn-goers of Old Hroldan. A &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; that the ghost mistook for Hjalti was sent to retrieve their old sword. Upon giving the ghost the sword, the spirit ascended back into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, being put to rest."}

In his final moments, the Prince of Destruction cursed the mage, twisting the words of their deal into a nightmarish reality, plunging the Isle of Caecilly into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, killing its inhabitants, and trapping the conjuror there, where he would never die but continuously age.\nSometime later, after many failed attempts, Mehrunes Dagon successfully invaded the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a large complex of underground tunnels and ancient ruins located under the city of Mournhold in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Old Mournhold can be accessed from many trapdoors throughout the city. It is a very large labyrinthine series of sewers, tunnels, tombs and ruins. Several groups of assassins, bandits, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; can be found within.\nHistory.\nOld Mournhold, being built under &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, is said to be built over even older &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric shrines&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, mainland &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; and Mournhold were a combined city-state. It was ruled by &lt;a href=\"House%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Clan Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt;, whose royal house held the High Kingship of Morrowind. It was then split into the two separate city-states when Queen Lian's twin sons were left as joint heirs.\nDuring the end of the First Era, Mournhold was known to be the capital of Morrowind. The Royal City of Old Mournhold was destroyed in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; were too late to prevent its destruction, although, they succeeded in banishing Mehrunes Dagon back to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nThere are four main areas: the Sewers, the Temple Sewers, the dwemer ruin of Bamz-Amschend and the daedric ruins of Norenen-dur.\nThe Sewers.\nThese are large areas joined by sinuous corridors, often flooded ankle-deep, The further one delves deep into the sewers, the more likely to encounter hostile beings.\nFrom the surface, the Palace Sewers can be reached through the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace%23Basement\"&gt;basement&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Palace\"&gt;Royal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Doors lead to the Bazaar Sewers and the West Sewers. An underwater door leads to the Residential Sewers.\nThe Residential Sewers lie beneath &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt;. It can be accessed through trapdoors outside in Godsreach, or inside some of the buildings here.\nThe West Sewers are a maze-like area accessible from the Palace Sewers or the Residential Sewers.\nHome of &lt;a href=\"Dandras%20Vules\"&gt;Dandras Vules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;The Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. It is mostly made up of the ruins of Moril Manor.\nThe Bazaar Sewers can be reached from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Bazaar\"&gt;Great Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; through a trapdoor. Doors lead to the Manor District and the Palace Sewers.\nThe Battlefield is likely the area where the battle between Almalexia and Mehrunes Dagon took place. It is made of large caverns and is infested with &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Temple Sewers.\nThese sections of the sewers is beneath and reachable from &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20Temple%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold Temple&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to contain, scattered throughout, many half buried ancient buildings. Many underground, maze-like tunnels and caverns form this very large area. The Temple sewers is one of the few places where &lt;a href=\"Adamantium%20Ore\"&gt;Adamantium Ore&lt;/a&gt; can be mined.\nDwemer ruin of Bamz-Amschend.\nThe unique &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruins&lt;/a&gt; found under &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Plaza Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt;, and accessible once \"&lt;a href=\"An%20Attack%20on%20Mournhold\"&gt;An Attack on Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;\" has occurred.\nDaedric ruin of Norenen-dur.\nFrom Bamz-Amschend, this &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Daedric shrine&lt;/a&gt; can be accessed:"}

Oldgate is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Oldgate%20Lancers\"&gt;Oldgate Lancers&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most proficient militias in the province of High Rock.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nOldgate is located on the southernmost edge of Rivenspire, as it safeguards the region from the region of Stormhaven and vice versa. Oldgate is exactly what it is called, it is a fortified gate with twin towers on each side of the gate. The courtyard is rather large, befitting for the merchants stationed in the area. The highest floor has areas of rest where the soldiers have established a cooking fire.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Oldgate fortress has always been under the occupation of the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Shornhelm\"&gt;Kingdom of Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and generally the Kingdom of Rivenspire. When &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, Oldgate and the Oldgate Lancers fought alongside the Rivenspire Houses and King Ranser. The Oldgate Lancers were present at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20566%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the &lt;a href=\"House%20Cumberland\"&gt;House Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; Guard. Unfortunately, the Siege did not end in Ranser's favor and he was forced into Rivenspire and &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, where he would ultimately be defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Oldgate may have been a line of defense after the Siege of Wayrest, but based on events later, Oldgate did not hold the Covenant back.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Old Gate in their quest to recover the pieces."}

Like the rest of her family, she supports the Stormcloak Rebellion.\nBackground.\nGray-Mane.\nOlfina is the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Eorlund%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Eorlund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fralia%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Fralia Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;, sister to &lt;a href=\"Avulstein%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Avulstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorald%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Thorald Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; and niece of &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt;.\nFeud with Battle-Born.\nShe thinks that the feud between Gray-Mane and Battle-Born is stupid and wishes for it to end. One reason for this is that she is romantically involved with &lt;a href=\"Jon%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Jon Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;, as can be seen from the &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Jon\"&gt;Letter from Jon&lt;/a&gt; which can be pickpocketed from her.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Mission\"&gt;Rescue Mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nOlfina Gray-Mane is a possible target for the Rescue Mission where the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; needs to rescue her from a radiant location, and escort her back to Whiterun.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Fishing%20Job\"&gt;The Fishing Job&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin&lt;/a&gt; may ask the Dragonborn to pickpocket Olfina Gray-Mane for her &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Stormcloaks%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; and Whiterun is taken, Olfina becomes &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt; to the new &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, her uncle Vignar Gray-Mane and takes up residence in &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hunting%20the%20Monster\"&gt;Hunting the Monster&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gunmar\"&gt;Gunmar&lt;/a&gt; asks the Dragonborn to extract the location of a &lt;a href=\"Master%20Vampire\"&gt;Master Vampire&lt;/a&gt; from Olfina.\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"Anoriath\"&gt;Anoriath&lt;/a&gt;: \"Ah, Olfina.

Maybe I should sell swords and armor, instead.\"\nOlfina: \"Maybe, but they wouldn't taste as good as a loaf of fresh-baked pumpernickel.\"\nJon: \"So I'm, uh... writing a song for you...\"\nOlfina: \"Why, Jon Battle-Born, you're writing me a song? Does it somehow involve blood, or beheadings, or the honor of my forebears?\"\nJon: \"Well, that's where I started. But it turned into something of a ballad.\"\nOlfina: \"A ballad? Oh, now I know you're joking with me.\"\nJon: \"It's all true, I swear it. You can hear it when it's done. I'll just need a year or two to smooth the rough edges.\"\nOlfina: \"Ha! I thought as much.\"\nOlfina: \"So have you spoken to that man from the Bards College?\"\nJon: \"No, not yet. But I will. I just haven't... gotten around to it yet.\"\nOlfina: \"Oh Jon, stop dallying. You know you have to go. It's why Mara put you on this earth. You think a few miles can truly keep us apart?\"\nJon: \"You mean you won't forget about me the moment I'm out of sight? Get yourself a nice old rich husband, have sixteen babies?\"\nOlfina: \"Tsk. You've uncovered my master plan. Now I suppose you'll never leave.\"\nJon: \"Harlot.\"\nJon: \"I want to see you when you're done working.\"\nOlfina: \"\"I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my father is starting to suspect something.\" or \"I can't. Not tonight. I need to go home. I swear, my family is starting to suspect something.\"\"\nJon: \"That's your imagination running wild. Nobody knows how we feel about each other.\"\nOlfina: \"\"Don't talk about my father like that, Jon. And the answer's still no. But tomorrow, definitely.\" or \"Don't say that out loud. Not here. And the answer's still no. But tomorrow, definitely.\"\"\nJon: \"Sing you a special song tonight, beautiful lass?\"\nOlfina: \"Not now, I'm working.\"\nJon: \"Bah. You're always working. Why else would I spend so much time here?\"\nOlfina: \"\"Mikael is quite the songbird. Maybe he's the reason you're here all the time.\" or \"Perhaps it's because there's no better way to face the cold Skyrim nights than with a belly full of ale?\"\nJon: \"Aye, the bard's got talent, I'll give him that. You just make sure his music is the only thing you're admiring.\" or \"Oh, there's a better way. A buxom barmaid between the sheets will keeps me plenty warm. Better yet, she won't make my head ring the morning after.\"\"\nOlfina: \"Oh Jon, darling. You know you're the only stone-biting, knuckle-dragging Nord for me.\"\nJon: \"Ha!

The magnitude is the extra units of weight the target can carry. \nThis means that if a Feather effect of greater magnitude than the total weight of items already possessed is applied, the spillover magnitude is registered as a negative number. This can be observed by looking at the carrying capacity on the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Menu%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;character menu&lt;/a&gt;, which will show for example, -5/100 if the target has a capacity of 100 and five more points of feather than they have weight in carried items.\nMechanics.\nDifferent Feather spells can be stacked if they are differently named and the same for Feather enchanted items. For example, casting Pack Mule and Beast of Burden together adds the benefits of both. Using all four spells subtracts 525 points of encumbrance from carried items. Creating spells of different names at an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt; hypothetically allows infinite stacks of Feather, limited only by spell duration and overall &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; pool. Similarly, limited only by &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; and the number of slots to wear items, any combination of differently named Feather enchanted objects may be worn.\nSpell list.\nThe longest duration possible on custom Feather spells using the &lt;a href=\"Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spellcrafting&lt;/a&gt; altar is 120 seconds. Even the humblest bought spell lasts twice that long. Furthermore, the higher two bought spells have a greater magnitude than the custom spell maximum: 100 pts.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnless the &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; has Feather as its first effect, the ingredient must be combined with other related ingredients to make a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; that has the Feather effect. Potions contain this effect often have higher durations than custom and pre-made spells.\nEnchantment.\n&lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, and various other worn objects can be imbued with the Feather effect at an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, such as the ones located at the Arcane University. As with other forms of enchantment, the &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; energies of soul gems or &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sigil stones&lt;/a&gt; are required for the &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20item\"&gt;enchanted item&lt;/a&gt;s creation. Sigil Stones containing this effect are &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; and can provide high Feather scores when enchanting.\nWhen enchanting armor with Feather at an Altar of Enchanting, it's better to enchant the piece of armor with &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Attribute%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Attribute&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; 10pts). The reason for this is the maximum constant Feather effect achieved at an altar is 50 points. That's the same &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;carrying weight&lt;/a&gt; gained with +10 strength, which also increases &lt;a href=\"Fatigue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and melee &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;."}

Near the stables, &lt;a href=\"Kabrahla\"&gt;Kabrahla&lt;/a&gt; will tell you that the harpies are not actually dangerous, and that the mercenaries are a bigger threat to the townspeople. She will mention that they recently stole crates from someone called &lt;a href=\"Zihlran\"&gt;Zihlran&lt;/a&gt;. Head to the east and onto the rooftop there, and you will see a harpy looking at some crates; in these crates, you will find Zihlran. He will tell you that the harpies and the mercenaries are about as much of a problem for him, and that the mercenaries barely help against the harpies. \nAfter you have talked to these people, you should seek out &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Andrin%20at-Lehiel\"&gt;Magistrate Andrin at-Lehiel&lt;/a&gt;. He will be in the town hall, the building next to where you found Zihlran.

After Daneem leaves, speak with the Magistrate and he will refuse your help in the matter, saying that he does not want to endanger his relationship with the mercenaries. The moment you are done talking though, someone named &lt;a href=\"Leja%20at-Lehiel\"&gt;Leja at-Lehiel&lt;/a&gt; will show up; she will be dismissed by the magistrate, but will ask you to come talk to her in her home so you can find out what is really going on.\nLeja's home is in the northwest of town, past the smithy. Head there and talk to her, and she will tell you that the mercenaries have been causing the harpy troubles by stealing harpy eggs and hiding them across town. Hhe harpies are only being a nuisance because they want the eggs back. Leja will then tell you to follow her to the balcony, where she will show you a tame harpy; she does not think the harpies and the people of Kozanset have to be enemies. Speak with Leja again and she will tell you that this is why she wants your help in dealing with the mercenaries. She will ask you to help her look for the harpy eggs so that she has proof that the mercenaries are up to no good.\nHead into town and start looking for the harpy eggs. You will find many eggs around town; once you have four, meet up with Leja in the marketplace in the center of town. While you are discussing what to do with the eggs, Daneem will show up to intimidate Leja out of pursuing her inquiries; talk to Leja again and she will tell you that the mercenaries have a warehouse in the west of town; you should go there and eavesdrop on them while she takes the eggs back to her house. \nHead to the warehouse and hide in one of the crates. You will overhear Daneem extorting some of the townspeople for money. After they are gone, head back to Leja's house to report what happened. You will find the magistrate there; talk to him and he will tell you that Leja has been kidnapped by the harpies along with several other townspeople. He will direct you to their nests to the east of town and demand that you go rescue her to atone for your role in what is going on. Head east of town and search the area. You will find the body of a villager here; his body shows no signs of being grabbed by harpies but does show signs of being beaten up by humans and dragged here. \n\"&lt;The villager is in rough shape. It looks as if quite a few wild animals got to him before the end.&gt;\"\nHead east and you will find another such victim, then head north for the next one. You will find yourself at the base of a slope; head up and you will find Leja there. Talk to her and she will tell you that the mercenaries dragged her and a few others out here. Jackals came after the others, but Leja's tame Harpy and some other harpies defended Leja from them. Leja will ask you to bring this information to her father the Magistrate; you can ask the harpy outside to give you a ride to town.\n\"&lt;The harpy doesn't seem to be afraid or aggressive.&gt;\"\nThe harpy will drop you off in the center of town; the magistrate and Daneem will be just ahead, down the stairs. Speak with the Magistrate and tell him what happened. After you are done, Leja will also show up and corroborate your story; Daneem will be none too pleased with your meddling, but will not be able to do anything right now. After confronting Daneem, Leja will ask you to gather some townsfolk so that they may help you drive out these mercenaries. You will see several groups of townspeople around town; you can convince them to join simply by approaching them. Once you have gathered three of these groups, speak with Leja outside the guardhouse. \n\"That's the one Leja said to wait for. Let's go!\"\n\"About time we ran those charlatans out of town!\"\n\"Leja said you'd come. Let's head to the guardhouse!\"\nLeja will tell you that the harpies have been showing interest in the guardhouse, so there is probably something in there that means a lot to them. She will ask you to go in and bring whatever the mercenaries stole up to the rooftop. After you are done talking, you will witness a scene where Daneem and her mercenaries are dragged out of the guardhouse and thrown out of town; head in and you will find the body of the harpy matriarch. Take it up to the balcony, then speak with Leja there to finish the quest."}

He was extremely germophobic, not wanting anyone to breathe on him or touch him.\nBackground.\nArriving in the Isles.\nAt some unknown point he was granted entry into the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Realm of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. For his part, Felas was confined to the town of &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt;, which sat within &lt;a href=\"The%20Fringe\"&gt;The Fringe&lt;/a&gt;, an enclosed area designed to prepare its occupants for entry into the Isles proper. Exactly how long Felas was waiting there is unknown; in &lt;a href=\"4E%201\"&gt;4E 1&lt;/a&gt;, he and &lt;a href=\"Shelden\"&gt;Shelden&lt;/a&gt;, the self-proclaimed \"Mayor of Passwall,\" greeted the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; when he entered the Isles. Felas and Shelden explained that the Hero could only pass into the Isles either by obtaining Sheogorath's blessing, or else killing the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; who guarded the Gates of Madness. The Hero eventually succeeded in killing the Gatekeeper and was granted access into the Isles.\nRole in Greymarch.\nA short time later, the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt; officially began, and the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Order\"&gt;Daedric Forces of Order&lt;/a&gt; began their assault on the Shivering Isles, starting with the Fringe. Knights of Order overran Passwall, and both Shelden and Felas were taken prisoner in the Spire, Order's base of operations. In order to save himself, Felas swore allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt; and became a &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Order\"&gt;Priest of Order&lt;/a&gt;. It is highly feasible that he was instrumental in planning Order's numerous attacks on the Fringe, which were met by the Force of Madness, now led by the Hero. After Order's main offensive failed in the battle and the Spire was destroyed, Order was forced to retreat temporarily.\nFate.\nShortly thereafter, Felas led an assault on the Gates of Madness which, to his surprise and detriment, were guarded by a new Gatekeeper, reconstructed with the help of the Hero. In the fight that followed, Felas and his Knights were killed.\nDialogue.\n\"I'm Felas Sarandas.

This treasury room cannot be opened from this side without the key, and &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing it off The Caller is not possible. Note that the room can be accessed through a trapdoor if the Dragonborn goes back after taking the books, therefore the Caller does not have to be killed in order to acquire everything within. At higher levels, she will summon a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;storm atronach&lt;/a&gt;; even if she is apparently killed in one hit, the atronach will disappear just as it begins to attack."}

In previous iterations of the game, such as , there was no distinction between stolen and non-stolen property.\nWith very rare exceptions, fences are the \"only\" NPC &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt; who will buy stolen property. Stolen property in \"Oblivion\" is identified by a red hand over the icon in an inventory.\nSelling through fences is necessary for any character who plans on selling any stolen items at all. To gain access to decent fences one must join the Thieves Guild, so if one plans to live a life of &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt;, they should join the Thieves Guild and don't forget who the fences are. In , the only two non-Thieves Guild fences are &lt;a href=\"Manheim%20Maulhand\"&gt;Manheim Maulhand&lt;/a&gt;, an innkeeper, and &lt;a href=\"M%27raaj-Dar\"&gt;M'raaj-Dar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; merchant.\nFor each stolen item sold, the player has \"fenced\" gold into the guild coffers. This is extremely important, because in order to progress in the Thieves Guild total fenced gold must be to a certain value before receiving the next quest. For example, to receive the final Thieves Guild quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ultimate%20Heist%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Ultimate Heist&lt;/a&gt;,\" one must have fenced at least \"1000 gold\" in total."}

After the character creation, the Vestige frees Fennorian from a sarcophagus and also retrieve his &lt;a href=\"Fennorian%27s%20Flask\"&gt;flask&lt;/a&gt;. He then reveals that he is a vampire from House Ravenwatch investigating the &lt;a href=\"Icereach%20Coven\"&gt;Icereach Coven&lt;/a&gt; which he tracked from a burial site in &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. After entering &lt;a href=\"Deepwood%20Redoubt%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deepwood Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; and eavesdropping on the conversation between the Icereach Coven branch leader, &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Urgala\"&gt;Matron Urgala&lt;/a&gt;, and the vampire &lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt;, Fennorian suggests catching up with Urgala and investigating a &lt;a href=\"Harrowstorms\"&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; they mentioned, which has been summoned. After defeating Urgala and destroying the &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Pike\"&gt;Witch Pike&lt;/a&gt;. Fennorian then asks the Vestige to warn &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; while he informs the other members of House Ravenwatch and continues with their investigation. \n&lt;a href=\"The%20Gathering%20Storm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Gathering Storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nFennorian can be found on the way to &lt;a href=\"Kilkreath%20Temple\"&gt;Kilkreath Temple&lt;/a&gt;, who asks the Vestige to escort him to the Witch Pikes to investigate them and gather information from any survivors. After examining the Witch Pikes, he suggests that they investigate a cart he noticed as well as the Temple itself. They find nothing useful at both the cart and the Temple, so Fennorian decides to retrieve his alchemical equipment to study the &lt;a href=\"Alchemical%20Residue\"&gt;Alchemical Residue&lt;/a&gt; found on a Witch Pike. After retrieving his equipment and joined by &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, they pursue a member of the Coven, &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Ambritt\"&gt;Sister Ambritt&lt;/a&gt;, whom Lyris spotted prior. Lyris leaves the group following the defeat of Sister Ambritt, as the pair find exploded fragments of both the mysterious urns from Deepwood Redoubt and other larger vessels. They then part ways with Fennorian going off to see a clever woman named &lt;a href=\"Old%20Mjolen\"&gt;Old Mjolen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Clouds%20Over%20Solitude\"&gt;Dark Clouds Over Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige finds Fennorian at a camp with Old Mjolen, where he asks the Vestige to seek advice from Mjolen to find the assassin of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Gerhyld\"&gt;Queen Gerhyld&lt;/a&gt;. After Mjolen enchants the &lt;a href=\"Icereach%20Coven%20Medallion\"&gt;Icereach Coven Medallion&lt;/a&gt;, Fennorian and the Vestige follows the conjured vision to an abandoned campsite, where they follow another vision to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Depths%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chillwind Depths&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the dungeon, the assassin &lt;a href=\"Pentarch%20Khorb\"&gt;Pentarch Khorb&lt;/a&gt; injures Fennorian before escaping. They then track Khorb to &lt;a href=\"Silversnow%20Mine\"&gt;Silversnow Mine&lt;/a&gt; and enters &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; with Lyris, where they failed to gather much information, but managed to stop a Harrowstorm. The trio then follows Coven members into &lt;a href=\"Kagnthamz\"&gt;Kagnthamz&lt;/a&gt;, where they kill Khorb and defeat the Coven witch &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Tharda\"&gt;Sister Tharda&lt;/a&gt; after that. Fennorian then decides that he and Lyris continue to investigate the place while the Vestige returns to &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Vampire%20Scholar\"&gt;The Vampire Scholar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFennorian's screams can be heard as the Vestige progresses through &lt;a href=\"Tzinghalis%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Tzinghalis's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. He is found being tortured and experimented by &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Tzinghalis\"&gt;Exarch Tzinghalis&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating Tzinghalis and freeing Fennorian, he suggests checking Tzinghalis's Sanctum for more clues before they return to Solitude.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Host\"&gt;The Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;.\nFennorian decides to create an &lt;a href=\"Fennorian%27s%20Elixir\"&gt;elixir&lt;/a&gt; to prevent people from turning into &lt;a href=\"Harrowfiend\"&gt;Harrowfiend&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Harrowed\"&gt;Harrowed&lt;/a&gt;, which requires certain ingredients. The Vestige meets him at the &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Camp\"&gt;Coastal Camp&lt;/a&gt;, at which they discover that necrotic energy is used to create the Icereach Coven Medallions. Back at the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Fennorian completes the elixir following &lt;a href=\"Svana%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Svana&lt;/a&gt;'s and Lyris's return, as well as getting some of &lt;a href=\"Arkay%27s%20Sacred%20Oil\"&gt;Arkay's Sacred Oil&lt;/a&gt;. The four of them, including the Vestige, travels to &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Barrow\"&gt;Midnight Barrow&lt;/a&gt; to test it. The elixir turns out to be a success after they defeat &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Ulfra\"&gt;Exarch Ulfra&lt;/a&gt; and stop a Harrowstorm. \n&lt;a href=\"Greymoor%20Rising\"&gt;Greymoor Rising&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;, Fennorian suggests going to Blackreach to stop the Harrowstorm. At &lt;a href=\"Greymoor%20Keep\"&gt;Greymoor Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the four of them split up into two pairs with Fennorian and the Vestige as one of them. At the center of one of the rooms is a book containing Tzinghalis's notes, which Fennorian discovers that the whole tower is a Witch Pike. At the Central Overlook, Fennorian and Svana stay to stop Rada al-Saran from empowering Svargrim while Lyris and the Vestige continues. At the end of the Stone Husk Gallery, Fennorian attempts to unlock a door as the others protect him. Upon entering the door, Fennorian figures out that the only way to stop the storm was to kill Svargrim. The group then splits up again with Fennorian and Lyris heading east, and meets up once again at the bridge connecting the Keep and the Temple. Later at the Temple courtyard, they decide that Fennorian and Lyris stay there to hold off the Harrowfiends as the Vestige and Svana face Svargrim at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20the%20Wolf\"&gt;Tower of the Wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20the%20Wolf\"&gt;Daughter of the Wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Vestige returns to the Temple of the Divines courtyard, Fennorian tells them that he \"went wild\" when the Harrowfiends broke out. In &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Solitude Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, he informs the Vestige that he and Old Mjolen have come up with a theory to cure Harrowfiends and the Harrowed, as well as their progress in brewing the elixir.\nConversations.\nAt Kilkreath Temple, after retrieving his equipment:\nLyris Titanborn: \"That's close enough, leech.\"\nFennorian: \"Wait! Wait! I'm not part of the coven!\"\nAfter talking to Lyris:\nFennorian: \"Perhaps I could question the witch before you introduce her to your impressive axe blade?\"\nOutside &lt;a href=\"Silversnow%20Mine\"&gt;Silversnow Mine&lt;/a&gt;:\nLyris Titanborn: \"As evil lairs go, I'm not impressed.\"\nFennorian: \"I'll take that as a good sign.\"\nIn Silversnow Mine:\nLyris Titanborn: \"Scaffolding.

But why is there a town down there?\"\nAfter eliminating all enemies before the &lt;a href=\"Experimentation%20Chamber\"&gt;Experimentation Chamber&lt;/a&gt;:\nRada al-Saran: \"A shame he could not be recruited to our noble cause.\"\nExarch Tzinghalis: \"The machine will finish him momentarily, my lord.\"\nRada al-Saran: \"Finish your work here, Tzinghalis, then join me in the keep. You must bear witness when we make our move.\"\nExarch Tzinghalis: \"Of course, Rada al-Saran. I am eager to see the power of our ultimate harrowstorm.\"\nFennorian: \"&lt;Tortured sobbing.&gt;\"\nExarch Tzinghalis: \"New test subjects? Just in time. This one is about spent.\"\nAfter killing Exarch Tzinghalis:\nFennorian: \"It's too late\u2026for me\u2026.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Fenn's delirious. See if can free him!\"\nFennorian: \"Go\u2026warn Solitude\u2026.\"\nUpon entering &lt;a href=\"Tzinghalis%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Tzinghalis's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;:\nLyris Titanborn: \"Take your time. You've been through a lot.\"\nFennorian: \"They did whatever they wanted. I couldn't stop them. Exarch Tzinghalis was insane, but he was also a genius. If he kept records, they'll be here.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"I see a map and some papers. Hey, , take a look.\"\nAfter speaking to Lyris:\nLyris Titanborn: \"Come on, Fenn. Princess Svana herself requested your presence at the Blue Palace.\"\nFennorian: \"I don't believe I'm very good company right now.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Come on, Fenn.

Ah, here they come now. have the sacred oil? Add it to the cauldron.\"\nAt the entrance to the Undergrove:\nLyris Titanborn: \"This must be the place. I'll go back and get\u2014\"\nSvana: \"No need, we're here.\"\nFennorian: \"The princess insisted\u2026.\"\nSvana: \"We followed at a safe distance and only advanced after you cleared the way. From this point on, we stay together. And that's an order.\"\nFennorian: \"Um, yes. What she said. Now let's enter the Undergrove.\"\nUpon entering &lt;a href=\"The%20Undergrove\"&gt;The Undergrove&lt;/a&gt;:\nFennorian: \"We need to find where they're experimenting with the harrowstorms.\"\nExarch Ulfra: \"You honor me with your presence, my king.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Gray Host!

I need no help from the likes of you.\"\nSvana: \"Don't be a fool, father! This elixir will save our people!\"\nSvargrim: \"I didn't think you had it in you, daughter. You have actually surpassed my expectations. More's the pity. And I'll hear no more of talk of this miracle elixir.\"\nSvana: \"Father, no!\"\nSvargrim: \"The Gray Host is my true ally!

There aren't any witch pikes around the city.\"\nSvana: \"Then you missed something. They needed the witch pikes for every other harrowstorm they summoned.\"\nFennorian: \"Of course! Blackreach!

But that is a lie.\nA strong man would have ended his life long ago. He would have delivered &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;'s justice upon his soul. I am weak man, and so, I live.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigil&lt;/a&gt; teaches us that &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; are an abomination, to be destroyed without mercy. But in my cowardice I began to entertain the blasphemous, that &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; had a cure.\nNever has the subject been broached by the Keepers. After all, the very idea that these creatures were capable of salvation would threaten principles of the order. So to learn more, I sought the aid of the very monster I have sworn to oppose.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s price was too steep. I was to gather thralls and build an altar deep within the &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, for purposes that would only become clearer as the nights went on. To that shrine I was to sacrifice the lives of nine of my brothers and sisters, one for each &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt times my resolve has wavered, but the Prince has offered proof in the form of &lt;a href=\"Galur%20Rithari\"&gt;Galur Rithari&lt;/a&gt;. His excerpts prove that a cure exists, through a dream of being \"sliced by thousands of tiny knives from the inside out.\" As the town speaks of &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;nightmares&lt;/a&gt; and the presence of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, I now see why Dawnstar was chosen for this unholy vigil.\nWith only three sacrifices left, the ritual is nearly complete. No doubt Azarain will see this as treachery, which is why I cannot bring myself to sacrifice him. But with every Vigil that dies at our hand, it only calcifies my resolve. The weakness of my mind does not betray the strength of my will.\nFor all my cowardice, I am worth the souls of a dozen men. If I rejoin the Vigil, more lives will be saved in the end.\nPerhaps when the accounting is done, Stendarr will show me mercy."}

They can only be found inside &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Grotto\"&gt;Darkfall Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, accessed through the waterfall in the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;. They have slaughtered several Falmer and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt; inside the former Falmer village.\nThey are particularly notable because their body shape, particularly their heads, are distinctly more beast-like than normal Falmer, including such bestial features as a lack of lips, completely absent noses, and almost completely smooth upper heads where the regular Falmer have distinct eyebrows and eye sockets \u2014 a shape only shared by the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Falmer\"&gt;Frozen Falmer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, who were presumably frozen that way when they stormed it, (relatively) soon after their blinding by the Dwemer. This poses the idea that the Feral Falmer may be what the Falmer were before their relatively recent apparent rise in intelligence and cultural complexity.\nAlternatively, the Feral Falmer may in fact be Falmer who have become inflicted with a form of &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that they exhibit sharp fangs, elongated claws, and what appear to be the beginning formations of bat-like wings protruding from their backs support this theory, as their appearance bears a strong resemblance to that of Vampire Lords. This is supported by the observation that, when they are found in Darkfall Grotto, the Feral Falmer seem to have degenerated and feasted upon the members of their isolated village, lending credence to the idea that a few of the members of a particular colony have degenerated into the feral state, rather than the Falmer having developed from them.\nThis could also mean that the Chantry of Auri-El was stormed much more recently than assumed, and possibly by a group of Feral Falmer afflicted with Vampirism, accounting for the appearance of the Frozen Falmer within the Chantry itself as well as &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur's&lt;/a&gt; affliction.\nThey lack any form of apparel and move noticeably faster than their more heavily armored brethren. Feral Falmer only use their claws or &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Sword\"&gt;Falmer Sword&lt;/a&gt;s, although they might pick up the weapons of nearby corpses."}

Fervidius was, at one point, the highest-ranking member of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; and was even said to be the Arch-Prelate of the Alessian secret sect known as the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;, being given the title in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201188\"&gt;1E 1188&lt;/a&gt;. Fervidius was best known for writing the book \"Sermons Denouncing the Seventeen Leniencies\".\nIt is said that Fervidius Tharn began his role in the Alessian Order as a humble oblate, but quickly rose through the ranks of the order, becoming the Arch-Prelate of the Order with power rivaling even the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s. During this time, the Marukhati Selective, a split sect and internal threat to the Alessian Order, was formed, which was said to have been an enemy of Fervidius. Fervidius then apparently sent members of his order to find the missing pieces of the staff of towers to prevent the Selectives from getting their hands on them, but was eventually betrayed and killed by one of his own. However, other sources heavily imply that Fervidius Tharn was, in fact, the secret-master of the Selective responsible for the Middle Dawn &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; which occurred in &lt;a href=\"1E%201200\"&gt;1E 1200&lt;/a&gt;."}

It tells a story of the scribe Thaurbad and his enchanted quill, \"Feyfolken.\" The quill, having been enchanted by a &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, was a gift from &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. While at first assisting Thaurbad in his duties to the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, the quill eventually cursed its owner to write foreboding messages of suicide. Having sacrificed his only purpose in life, Thaurbad commits suicide and his soul is claimed by Clavicus Vile.\nContents.\nFeyfolken, Book I.\nFeyfolken\nBook One\nby\n&lt;a href=\"Waughin%20Jarth\"&gt;Waughin Jarth&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Great Sage was a tall, untidy man, bearded but bald. His library resembled him: all the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"books\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; had been moved over the years to the bottom shelves where they gathered in dusty conglomerations. He used several of the books in his current lecture, explaining to his students, Taksim and Volguldak, how the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; had first been founded by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. They had many questions about Galerion's beginnings in the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, and how the study of magic there differed from the Mages Guild.\n\"It was, and is, a very structured way of life,\" explained the Great Sage. \"Quite elitist, actually. That was the aspect of it Galerion most objected to. He wanted the study of magic to be free. Well, not free exactly, but at least available to all who could afford it. In doing that, he changed the course of life in Tamriel.\"\n\"He codified the praxes and rituals used by all modern potionmakers, itemmakers, and spellmakers, didn't he, Great Sage?\" asked Vonguldak.\n\"That was only part of it. Magic as we know it today comes from Vanus Galerion. He restructured the schools to be understandable by the masses. He invented the tools of alchemy and enchanting so everyone could concoct whatever they wanted, whatever their skills and purse would allow them to, without fears of magical backfire. Well, eventually he created that.\"\n\"What do you mean, Great Sage?\" asked Taksim.\n\"The first tools were more automated than the ones we have today. Any layman could use them without the least understanding of enchantment and alchemy. On the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, the students had to learn the skills laboriously and over many years, but Galerion decided that was another example of the Psijics' elitism. The tools he invented were like robotic master enchanters and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, capable of creating anything the customer required, provided he could pay.\"\n\"So someone could, for example, create a sword that would cleave the world in twain?\" asked Vonguldak.\n\"I suppose, in theory, but it would probably take all the gold in the world,\" chuckled the Great Sage. \"No, I can't say we were ever in very great danger, but that it isn't to say that there weren't a few unfortunate incidents where a unschooled yokel invented something beyond his ken. Eventually, of course, Galerion tore apart his old tools, and created what we use today. It's a little elitist, requiring that people know what they're doing before they do it, but remarkably practical.\"\n\"What did people invent?\" asked Taksim. \"Are there any stories?\"\n\"You're trying to distract me so I don't test you,\" said the Great Sage. \"But I suppose I can tell you one story, just to illustrate a point. This particular tale takes place in city of Alinor on the west coast of Summurset Isle, and concerns a scribe named Thaurbad.\nThis was in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, not long after Vanus Galerion had first founded the Mages Guild and chapter houses had sprung up all over &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, though not yet spread to the mainland of Tamriel.\nFor five years, this scribe, Thaurbad, had conducted all his correspondence to the outside world by way of his messenger boy, Gorgos. For the first year of his adoption of the hermit life, his few remaining friends and family -- friends and family of his dead wife, truth be told -- had tried visiting, but even the most indefatigable kin gives up eventually when given no encouragement. No one had a good reason to keep in touch with Thaurbad Hulzik, and in time, very few even tried. His sister-in-law sent him the occasional letter with news of people he could barely remember, but even that communication was rare. Most of messages to and from his house dealt with his business, writing the weekly proclamation from the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. These were bulletins nailed on the temple door, community news, sermons, that sort of thing.\nThe first message Gorgos brought him that day was from his healer, reminding him of his appointment on Turdas. Thaurbad took a while to write his response, glum and affirmative. He had the Crimson Plague, which he was being treated for at considerable expense -- you have to remember these were the days before the School of &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; had become quite so specialized. It was a dreadful disease and had taken away his voicebox. That was why he only communicated by script.\nThe next message was from Alfiers, the secretary at the church, as curt and noxious as ever: \"THAURBAD, ATTACHED IS SUNDAS'S SERMON, NEXT WEEK'S EVENTS CALENDAR, AND THE OBITUARIES. TRY TO LIVEN THEM UP A LITTLE. I WASN'T HAPPY WITH YOUR LAST ATTEMPT.\"\nThaurbad had taken the job putting together the Bulletin before Alfiers joined the temple, so his only mental image of her was purely theoretical and had evolved over time. At first he thought of Alfiers as an ugly fat sloadess covered with warts; more recently, she had mutated into a rail-thin, spinster orcess. Of course, it was possible his clairvoyance was accurate and she had just lost weight.\nWhatever Alfiers looked like, her attitude towards Thaurbad was clear, unwavering disdain. She hated his sense of humor, always found the most minor of misspellings, and considered his structure and calligraphy the worst kind of amateur work. Luckily, working for a temple was the next most secure job to working for the good King of Alinor. It didn't bring in very much money, but his expenses were minimal. The truth was, he didn't need to do it anymore. He had quite a fortune stashed away, but he didn't have anything else to occupy his days. And the truth was further that having little else to occupy his time and thoughts, the Bulletin was very important to him.\nGorgos, having delivered all the messages, began to clean and as he did so, he told Thaurbad all the news in town. The boy always did so, and Thaurbad seldom paid him any attention, but this time he had an interesting report. The Mages Guild had come to &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Thaurbad listened intently, Gorgos told him all about the Guild, the remarkable Archmagister, and the incredible tools of alchemy and enchanting. Finally, when the lad had finished, Thaurbad scribbled a quick note and handed it and a quill to Gorgos. The note read, \"Have them enchant this quill.\"\n\"It will be expensive,\" said Gorgos.\nThaurbad gave Gorgos a sizeable chunk of the thousands of gold pieces he had saved over the years, and sent him out the door. Now, Thaurbad decided, he would finally have the ability to impress Alfiers and bring glory to the Temple of Auri-El.\nThe way I've heard the story, Gorgos had thought about taking the gold and leaving Alinor, but he had come to care for poor old Thaurbad. And even more, he hated Alfiers who he had to see every day to get his messages for his master. It wasn't perhaps for the best of motivations, but Gorgos decided to go to the Guild and get the quill enchanted.\nThe Mages Guild was not then, especially not then, an elitist institution, as I have said, but when the messenger boy came in and asked to use the Itemmaker, he was greeted with some suspicion. When he showed the bag of gold, the attitude melted, and he was ushered in the room.\nNow, I haven't seen one of the enchanting tools of old, so you must use your imagination. There was a large prism for the item to be bound with magicka, assuredly, and an assortment of soul gems and globes of trapped energies. Other than that, I cannot be certain how it looked or how it worked. Because of all the gold he gave to the Guild, Gorgos could infuse the quill with the highest-price soul available, which was something &lt;a href=\"daedric\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt; called Feyfolken. The initiate at the Guild, being ignorant as most Guildmembers were at that time, did not know very much about the spirit except that it was filled with energy. When Gorgos left the room, the quill had been enchanted to its very limit and then some. It was virtually quivering with power.\nOf course, when Thaurbad used it, that's when it became clear how over his head he was.\n\"And now,\" said the Great Sage. \"It's time for your test.\"\n\"But what happened? What were the quill's powers?\" cried Taksim.\n\"You can't stop the tale there!\" objected Vonguldak.\n\"We will continue the tale after your conjuration test, provided you both perform exceptionally well,\" said the Great Sage.\nFeyfolken, Book II.\nFeyfolken\nBook Two\nby\nWaughin Jarth\nAfter the test had been given and Vonguldak and Taksim had demonstrated their knowledge of elementary &lt;a href=\"conjuration\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Sage told them that they were free to enjoy the day. The two lads, who most afternoons fidgeted through their lessons, refused to leave their seats.\n\"You told us that after the test, you'd tell us more of your tale about the scribe and his enchanted quill,\" said Taksim.\n\"You've already told us about the scribe, how he lived alone, and his battles with the Temple secretary over the Bulletin he scripted for posting, and how he suffered from the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plague%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Crimson Plague&lt;/a&gt; and couldn't speak. When you left off, his messenger boy had just had his master's quill enchanted with the spirit of a &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Feyfolken\"&gt;Feyfolken&lt;/a&gt;,\" added Vonguldak to add the Great Sage's memory.\n\"As it happens,\" said the Great Sage. \"I was thinking about a nap. However, the story does touch on some issues of the natures of spirits and thus is related to conjuration, so I'll continue.\nThaurbad began using the quill to write the Temple Bulletin, and there was something about the slightly lopsided, almost three-dimensional quality of the letters that Thaurbad liked a lot.\nInto the night, Thaurbad put together the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;'s Bulletin. For the moment he washed over the page with the Feyfolken quill, it became a work of art, an illuminated manuscript crafted of gold, but with good, simple and strong vernacular. The sermon excerpts read like poetry, despite being based on the archpriest's workmanlike exhortation of the most banal of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;. The obituaries of two of the Temple's chief benefactors were stark and powerful, pitifully mundane deaths transitioned into world-class tragedies. Thaurbad worked the magical palette until he nearly fainted from exhaustion. At six o'clock in the morning, a day before deadline, he handed the Bulletin to Gorgos for him to carry to Alfiers, the Temple secretary.\nAs expected, Alfiers never wrote back to compliment him or even comment on how early he had sent the bulletin. It didn't matter. Thaurbad knew it was the best Bulletin the Temple had ever posted. At one o'clock on Sundas, Gorgos brought him many messages.\n\"The Bulletin today was so beautiful, when I read it in the vestibule, I'm ashamed to tell you I wept copiously,\" wrote the archpriest. \"I don't think I've seen anything that captures Auri-El's glory so beautifully before. The cathedrals of Firsthold pale in comparison. My friend, I prostrate myself before the greatest artist since Gallael.\"\nThe archpriest was, like most men of the cloth, given to hyperbole. Still, Thaurbad was happy with the compliment. More messages followed. All of the Temple Elders and thirty-three of the parishioners young and old had all taken the time to find out who wrote the bulletin and how to get a message to congratulate him. And there was only one person they could go through for that information: Alfiers. Imaging the dragon lady besieged by his admirers filled Thaurbad with positive glee.\nHe was still in a good mood the next day when he took the ferry to his appointment with his healer, Telemichiel. The herbalist was new, a pretty Redguard woman who tried to talk to him, even after he gave her the note reading \"My name is Thaurbad Hulzik and I have an appointment with Telemichiel for eleven o'clock. Please forgive me for not talking, but I have no voicebox anymore.\"\n\"Has it started raining yet?\" she asked cheerfully. \"The diviner said it might.\"\nThaurbad frowned and shook his head angrily. Why was it that everyone thought that mute people liked to be talked to? Did soldiers who lost their arms like to be thrown balls? It was undoubtedly not a purposefully cruel behavior, but Thaurbad still suspected that some people just liked to prove that they weren't crippled too.\nThe examination itself was routine horror. Telemichiel performed the regular invasive torture, all the while chatting and chatting and chatting.\n\"You ought to try talking once in a while. That's the only way to see if you're getting better. If you don't feel comfortable doing it in public, you could try practicing it by yourself,\" said Telemichiel, knowing his patient would ignore his advice. \"Try singing in the bath. You'll probably find you don't sound as bad as you think.\"\nThaurbad left the examination with the promise of test results in a couple of weeks. On the ferry ride back home, Thaurbad began thinking of next week's temple bulletin. What about a double-border around the \"Last Sundas's Offering Plate\" announcement? Putting the sermon in two columns instead of one might have interesting effects. It was almost unbearable to think that he couldn't get started on it until Alfiers sent him information.\nWhen she did, it was with the note, \"LAST BULLETIN A LITTLE BETTER. NEXT TIME, DON'T USE THE WORD 'FORTUITOUS' IN PLACE OF 'FORTUNATE.' THE WORDS ARE NOT, IF YOU LOOK THEM UP, SYNONYMOUS.\"\nIn response, Thaurbad almost followed Telemichiel's advice by screaming obscenities at Gorgos. Instead, he drank a bottle of cheap wine, composed and sent a suitable reply, and fell asleep on the floor.\nThe next morning, after a long bath, Thaurbad began work on the Bulletin. His idea for putting a light shading effect on the \"Special Announcements\" section had an amazing textural effect. Alfiers always hated the extra decorations he added to the borders, but using the Feyfolken quill, they looked strangely powerful and majestic.\nGorgos came to him with a message from Alfiers at that very moment as if in response to the thought. Thaurbad opened it up. It simply said, \"I'M SORRY.\"\nThaurbad kept working. Alfiers's note he put from his mind, sure that she would soon follow it up with the complete message \"I'M SORRY THAT NO ONE EVER TAUGHT YOU TO KEEP RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND MARGINS THE SAME LENGTH\" or \"I'M SORRY WE CAN'T GET SOMEONE OTHER THAN A WEIRD, OLD MAN AS SCRIBE OF OUR BULLETIN.\" It didn't matter what she was sorry about. The columns from the sermon notes rose like the massive pillars of roses, crowned with unashamedly ornate headers. The obituaries and birth announcements were framed together with a spherical border, as a heartbreaking declaration of the circle of life. The Bulletin was simultaneously both warm and avant-garde. It was a masterpiece. When he sent it off to Alfiers late that afternoon, he knew she'd hate it, and was glad.\nThaurbad was surprised to get a message from the Temple on Loredas. Before he read the content, he could tell from the style that it wasn't from Alfiers. The handwriting wasn't Alfiers's usual belligerent slashing style, and it wasn't all in Alfiers's usual capital letters, which read like a scream from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Thaurbad, I thought you should know Alfiers isn't at the Temple anymore. She quit her position yesterday, very suddenly. My name is Vanderthil, and I was lucky enough (let me admit it now, I begged pitifully) to be your new Temple contact. I'm overwhelmed by your genius. I was having a crisis of faith until I read last week's Bulletin. This week's Bulletin is a miracle. Enough. I just wanted to say I'm honored to be working with you. -- Vanderthil.\"\nThe response on Sundas after the service even astonished Thaurbad. The archpriest attributed the massive increase in attendance and collection plate offerings entirely to the Bulletin. Thaurbad's salary was quadrupled. Gorgos brought over a hundred and twenty messages from his adoring public.\nThe following week, Thaurbad sat in front of his writing plank, a glass of fine Torvali mead at his side, staring at the blank scroll. He had no ideas. The Bulletin, his child, his second-wife, bored him. The third-rate sermons of the archbishop were absolute anathema, and the deaths and births of the Temple patrons struck him as entirely pointless. Blah blah, he thought as he scribbled on the page.\nHe knew he wrote the letters B-L-A-H B-L-A-H. The words that appeared on the scroll were, \"A necklace of pearl on a white neck.\"\nHe scrawled a jagged line across the page. It appeared in through that damned beautiful Feyfolken quill: \"Glory to Auri-El.\"\nThaurbad slammed the quill and poetry spilled forth in a stream of ink. He scratched over the page, blotting over everything, and the vanquished words sprung back up in different form, even more exquisite than before. Every daub and splatter caused the document to whirl like a kaleidoscope before falling together in gorgeous asymmetry. There was nothing he could do to ruin the Bulletin. Feyfolken had taken over. He was a reader, not an author.\nNow,\" asked the Great Sage. \"What was Feyfolken from your knowledge of the School of Conjuration?\"\n\"What happened next?\" cried Vonguldak.\n\"First, tell me what Feyfolken was, and then I'll continue the story.\"\n\"You said it was a daedra,\" said Taksim. \"And it seems to have something to do with artistic expression. Was Feyfolken a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"But the scribe may have been imagining all this,\" said Vonguldak. \"Perhaps Feyfolken is a servitor of Sheogorath, and he's gone mad. Or the quill's writing makes everyone who views it, like all the congregation at the Temple of Auri-El go mad.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; is the daedra of knowledge ... and &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; is the daedra of the wild ... and the daedra of revenge is &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;,\" pondered Taksim. And then he smiled, \"Feyfolken is a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, isn't it?\"\n\"Very good,\" said the Great Sage. \"How did you know?\"\n\"It's his style,\" said Taksim. \"Assuming that he doesn't want the power of the quill now that he has it. What happens next?\"\n\"I'll tell you,\" said the Great Sage, and continued the tale.\nFeyfolken, Book III.\nFeyfolken\nBook Three\nby\nWaughin Jarth\nThaurbad had at last seen the power of the quill,\" said the Great Sage, continuing his tale. \"Enchanted with the &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Feyfolken\"&gt;Feyfolken&lt;/a&gt;, servitor of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, it had brought him great wealth and fame as the scribe of the weekly Bulletin of the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. But he realized that it was the artist, and he merely the witness to its magic. He was furious and jealous. With a cry, he snapped the quill in half.\nHe turned to finish his glass of mead. When he turned around, the quill was intact.\nHe had no other quills but the one he had enchanted, so he dipped his finger in the inkwell and wrote a note to Gorgos in big sloppy letters. When Gorgos returned with a new batch of congratulatory messages from the Temple, praising his latest Bulletin, he handed the note and the quill to the messenger boy. The note read: \"Take the quill back to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and sell it. Buy me another quill with no enchantments.\"\nGorgos didn't know what to make of the note, but he did as he was told. He returned a few hours later.\n\"They wouldn't give us any gold back for it,\" said Gorgos. \"They said it wasn't enchanted. I told 'em, I said 'What are you talking about, you enchanted it right here with that Feyfolken soul gem,' and they said, 'Well, there ain't a soul in it now. Maybe you did something and it got loose.'\"\nGorgos paused to look at his master. Thaurbad couldn't speak, of course, but he seemed even more than usually speechless.\n\"Anyway, I threw the quill away and got you this new one, like you said.\"\nThaurbad studied the new quill. It was white-feathered while his old quill had been dove gray. It felt good in his hand. He sighed with relief and waved his messenger lad away. He had a Bulletin to write, and this time, without any magic except for his own talent.\nWithin two days time, he was nearly back on schedule. It looked plain but it was entirely his. Thaurbad felt a strange reassurance when he ran his eyes over the page and noticed some slight errors. It had been a long time since the Bulletin contained any errors. In fact, Thaurbad reflected happily, there were probably other mistakes still in the document that he was not seeing.\nHe was finishing a final whirl of plain calligraphy on the borders when Gorgos arrived with some messages from the Temple. He looked through them all quickly, until one caught his eye. The wax seal on the letter read \"Feyfolken.\" With complete bafflement, he broke it open.\n\"I think you should kill yourself,\" it read in perfectly gorgeous script.\nHe dropped the letter to the floor, seeing sudden movement on the Bulletin. Feyfolken script leapt from the letter and coursed over the scroll in a flood, translating his shabby document into a work of sublime beauty. Thaurbad no longer cared about the weird croaking quality of his voice. He screamed for a very long time. And then drank. Heavily.\nGorgos brought Thaurbad a message from Vanderthil, the secretary of the Temple, early Fredas morning, but it took the scribe until mid-morning to work up the courage to look at it. \"Good Morning, I am just checking in on the Bulletin. You usually have it in on Turdas night. I'm curious. You planning something special? -- Vanderthil.\"\nThaurbad responded, \"Vanderthil, I'm sorry. I've been sick. There won't be a Bulletin this Sunday\" and handed the note to Gorgos before retiring to his bath. When he came back an hour later, Gorgos was just returning from the Temple, smiling.\n\"Vanderthil and the archpriest went crazy,\" he said. \"They said it was your best work ever.\"\nThaurbad looked at Gorgos, uncomprehending. Then he noticed that the Bulletin was gone. Shaking, he dipped his finger in the inkwell and scrawled the words \"What did the note I sent with you say?\"\n\"You don't remember?\" asked Gorgos, holding back a smile. He knew the master had been drinking a lot lately. \"I don't remember the exact words, but it was something like, 'Vanderthil, here it is. Sorry it's late. I've been having severe mental problems lately. - Thaurbad.' Since you said, 'here it is,' I figured you wanted me to bring the Bulletin along, so I did. And like I said, they loved it. I bet you get three times as much letters this Sundas.\"\nThaurbad nodded his head, smiled, and waved the messenger lad away. Gorgos returned back to the Temple, while his master turned to his writing plank, and pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment.\nHe wrote with the quill: \"What do you want, Feyfolken?\"\nThe words became: \"Goodbye. I hate my life. I have cut my wrists.\"\nThaurbad tried another tact: \"Have I gone insane?\"\nThe words became: \"Goodbye. I have poison. I hate my life.\"\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\"\n\"I Thaurbad Hulzik cannot live with myself and my ingratitude. That's why I've put this noose around my neck.\"\nThaurbad picked up a fresh parchment, dipped his finger in the inkwell, and proceeded to rewrite the entire Bulletin. While his original draft, before Feyfolken had altered it, had been simple and flawed, the new copy was a scrawl. Lower-case I's were undotted, G's looked like Y's, sentences ran into margins and curled up and all over like serpents. Ink from the first page leaked onto the second page. When he yanked the pages from the notebook, a long tear nearly divided the third page in half. Something about the final result was evocative. Thaurbad at least hoped so. He wrote another note reading, simply, \"Use this Bulletin instead of the piece of trash I sent you.\"\nWhen Gorgos returned with new messages, Thaurbad handed the envelope to him. The new letters were all the same, except for one from his healer, Telemichiel. \"Thaurbad, we need you to come in as soon as possible. We've received the reports from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; about a strain of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plague%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Crimson Plague&lt;/a&gt; that sounds very much like your disease, and we need to re-examine you. Nothing is definite yet, but we're going to want to see what our options are.\"\nIt took Thaurbad the rest of the day and fifteen drams of the stoutest mead to recover. The larger part of the next morning was spent recovering from this means of recovery. He started to write a message to Vanderthil: \"What did you think of the new Bulletin?\" with the quill. Feyfolken's improved version was \"I'm going to ignite myself on fire, because I'm a dying no-talent.\"\nThaurbad rewrote the note using his finger-and-ink message. When Gorgos appeared, he handed him the note. There was one message in Vanderthil's handwriting.\nIt read, \"Thaurbad, not only are you divinely inspired, but you have a great sense of humor. Imagine us using those scribbles you sent instead of the real Bulletin. You made the archbishop laugh heartily. I cannot wait to see what you have next week. Yours fondly, Vanderthil.\"\nThe funeral service a week later brought out far more friends and admirers than Thaurbad Hulzik would've believed possible. The coffin, of course, had to be closed, but that didn't stop the mourners from filing into lines to touch its smooth oak surface, imagining it as the flesh of the artist himself. The archbishop managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a better than usual eulogy. Thaurbad's old nemesis, the secretary before Vanderthil, Alfiers came in from &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;, wailing and telling all who would listen that Thaurbad's suggestions had changed the direction of her life. When she heard Thaurbad had left her his quill in his final testament, she broke down in tears. Vanderthil was even more inconsolable, until she found a handsome and delightfully single young man.\n\"I can hardly believe he's gone and I never even saw him face-to-face or spoke to him,\" she said. \"I saw the body, but even if he hadn't been all burned up, I wouldn't have been able to tell if it was him or not.\"\n\"I wish I could tell you there'd been a mistake, but there was plenty of medical evidence,\" said Telemichiel. \"I supplied some of it myself. He was a patient of mine, you see.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Vanderthil. \"Was he sick or something?\"\n\"He had the Crimson Plague years ago, that's what took away his voice box, but it appeared to have gone into complete remission. Actually, I had just sent him a note telling him words to that effect the day before he killed himself.\"\n\"You're that healer?\" exclaimed Vanderthil. \"Thaurbad's messenger boy Gorgos told me that he had just picked up that message when I sent mine, complementing him on the new, primative design for the Bulletin. It was amazing work. I never would've told him this, but I had begun to suspect he was stuck in an outmoded style. It turned out he had one last work of genius, before going out in a blaze of glory. Figuratively. And literally.\"\nVanderthil showed the healer Thaurbad's last Bulletin, and Telemichiel agreed that its frantic, nearly illegible style spoke volumes about the power and majesty of the god Auri-El.\"\n\"Now I'm thoroughly confused,\" said Vonguldak.\n\"About which part?\" asked the Great Sage. \"I think the tale is very straight-forward.\"\n\"Feyfolken made all the Bulletins beautiful, except for the last one, the one Thaubad did for himself,\" said Taksim thoughtfully. \"But why did he misread the notes from Vanderthil and the healer? Did Feyfolken change those words?\"\n\"Perhaps,\" smiled the Great Sage.\n\"Or did Feyfolken changed Thaurbad's perceptions of those words?\" asked Vonguldak. \"Did Feyfolken make him mad after all?\"\n\"Very likely,\" said the Great Sage.\n\"But that would mean that Feyfolken was a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Vonguldak. \"And you said he was a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Which was he, an agent of mischief or an agent of insanity?\"\n\"The will was surely altered by Feyfolken,\" said Taksim, \"And that's the sort of thing a servitor of Clavicus Vile would do to perpetuate the curse.\"\n\"As an appropriate ending to the tale of the scribe and his cursed quill,\" smiled the Great Sage. \"I will let you read into it as you will.\""}

This book is part of a three book series. The others include:\nContents.\nFeyfolken\nBook One\nby\n&lt;a href=\"Waughin%20Jarth\"&gt;Waughin Jarth&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Great Sage was a tall, untidy man, bearded but bald. His library resembled him: all the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"books\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; had been moved over the years to the bottom shelves where they gathered in dusty conglomerations. He used several of the books in his current lecture, explaining to his students, Taksim and Volguldak, how the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; had first been founded by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. They had many questions about Galerion's beginnings in the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, and how the study of magic there differed from the Mages Guild.\n\"It was, and is, a very structured way of life,\" explained the Great Sage. \"Quite elitist, actually. That was the aspect of it Galerion most objected to. He wanted the study of magic to be free. Well, not free exactly, but at least available to all who could afford it. In doing that, he changed the course of life in Tamriel.\"\n\"He codified the praxes and rituals used by all modern potionmakers, itemmakers, and spellmakers, didn't he, Great Sage?\" asked Vonguldak.\n\"That was only part of it. Magic as we know it today comes from Vanus Galerion. He restructured the schools to be understandable by the masses. He invented the tools of alchemy and enchanting so everyone could concoct whatever they wanted, whatever their skills and purse would allow them to, without fears of magical backfire. Well, eventually he created that.\"\n\"What do you mean, Great Sage?\" asked Taksim.\n\"The first tools were more automated than the ones we have today. Any layman could use them without the least understanding of enchantment and alchemy. On the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Artaeum\"&gt;Isle of Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, the students had to learn the skills laboriously and over many years, but Galerion decided that was another example of the Psijics' elitism. The tools he invented were like robotic master enchanters and &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, capable of creating anything the customer required, provided he could pay.\"\n\"So someone could, for example, create a sword that would cleave the world in twain?\" asked Vonguldak.\n\"I suppose, in theory, but it would probably take all the gold in the world,\" chuckled the Great Sage. \"No, I can't say we were ever in very great danger, but that it isn't to say that there weren't a few unfortunate incidents where a unschooled yokel invented something beyond his ken. Eventually, of course, Galerion tore apart his old tools, and created what we use today. It's a little elitist, requiring that people know what they're doing before they do it, but remarkably practical.\"\n\"What did people invent?\" asked Taksim. \"Are there any stories?\"\n\"You're trying to distract me so I don't test you,\" said the Great Sage. \"But I suppose I can tell you one story, just to illustrate a point. This particular tale takes place in city of Alinor on the west coast of Summurset Isle, and concerns a scribe named Thaurbad.\nThis was in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, not long after Vanus Galerion had first founded the Mages Guild and chapter houses had sprung up all over &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, though not yet spread to the mainland of Tamriel.\nFor five years, this scribe, Thaurbad, had conducted all his correspondence to the outside world by way of his messenger boy, Gorgos. For the first year of his adoption of the hermit life, his few remaining friends and family -- friends and family of his dead wife, truth be told -- had tried visiting, but even the most indefatigable kin gives up eventually when given no encouragement. No one had a good reason to keep in touch with Thaurbad Hulzik, and in time, very few even tried. His sister-in-law sent him the occasional letter with news of people he could barely remember, but even that communication was rare. Most of messages to and from his house dealt with his business, writing the weekly proclamation from the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. These were bulletins nailed on the temple door, community news, sermons, that sort of thing.\nThe first message Gorgos brought him that day was from his healer, reminding him of his appointment on Turdas. Thaurbad took a while to write his response, glum and affirmative. He had the Crimson Plague, which he was being treated for at considerable expense -- you have to remember these were the days before the School of &lt;a href=\"Restoration\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; had become quite so specialized. It was a dreadful disease and had taken away his voicebox. That was why he only communicated by script.\nThe next message was from Alfiers, the secretary at the church, as curt and noxious as ever: \"THAURBAD, ATTACHED IS SUNDAS'S SERMON, NEXT WEEK'S EVENTS CALENDAR, AND THE OBITUARIES. TRY TO LIVEN THEM UP A LITTLE. I WASN'T HAPPY WITH YOUR LAST ATTEMPT.\"\nThaurbad had taken the job putting together the Bulletin before Alfiers joined the temple, so his only mental image of her was purely theoretical and had evolved over time. At first he thought of Alfiers as an ugly fat sloadess covered with warts; more recently, she had mutated into a rail-thin, spinster orcess. Of course, it was possible his clairvoyance was accurate and she had just lost weight.\nWhatever Alfiers looked like, her attitude towards Thaurbad was clear, unwavering disdain. She hated his sense of humor, always found the most minor of misspellings, and considered his structure and calligraphy the worst kind of amateur work. Luckily, working for a temple was the next most secure job to working for the good King of Alinor. It didn't bring in very much money, but his expenses were minimal. The truth was, he didn't need to do it anymore. He had quite a fortune stashed away, but he didn't have anything else to occupy his days. And the truth was further that having little else to occupy his time and thoughts, the Bulletin was very important to him.\nGorgos, having delivered all the messages, began to clean and as he did so, he told Thaurbad all the news in town. The boy always did so, and Thaurbad seldom paid him any attention, but this time he had an interesting report. The Mages Guild had come to &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Thaurbad listened intently, Gorgos told him all about the Guild, the remarkable Archmagister, and the incredible tools of alchemy and enchanting. Finally, when the lad had finished, Thaurbad scribbled a quick note and handed it and a quill to Gorgos. The note read, \"Have them enchant this quill.\"\n\"It will be expensive,\" said Gorgos.\nThaurbad gave Gorgos a sizeable chunk of the thousands of gold pieces he had saved over the years, and sent him out the door. Now, Thaurbad decided, he would finally have the ability to impress Alfiers and bring glory to the Temple of Auri-El.\nThe way I've heard the story, Gorgos had thought about taking the gold and leaving Alinor, but he had come to care for poor old Thaurbad. And even more, he hated Alfiers who he had to see every day to get his messages for his master. It wasn't perhaps for the best of motivations, but Gorgos decided to go to the Guild and get the quill enchanted.\nThe Mages Guild was not then, especially not then, an elitist institution, as I have said, but when the messenger boy came in and asked to use the Itemmaker, he was greeted with some suspicion. When he showed the bag of gold, the attitude melted, and he was ushered in the room.\nNow, I haven't seen one of the enchanting tools of old, so you must use your imagination. There was a large prism for the item to be bound with magicka, assuredly, and an assortment of soul gems and globes of trapped energies. Other than that, I cannot be certain how it looked or how it worked. Because of all the gold he gave to the Guild, Gorgos could infuse the quill with the highest-price soul available, which was something &lt;a href=\"daedric\"&gt;daedric&lt;/a&gt; called Feyfolken. The initiate at the Guild, being ignorant as most Guildmembers were at that time, did not know very much about the spirit except that it was filled with energy. When Gorgos left the room, the quill had been enchanted to its very limit and then some. It was virtually quivering with power.\nOf course, when Thaurbad used it, that's when it became clear how over his head he was.\n\"And now,\" said the Great Sage. \"It's time for your test.\"\n\"But what happened? What were the quill's powers?\" cried Taksim.\n\"You can't stop the tale there!\" objected Vonguldak.\n\"We will continue the tale after your conjuration test, provided you both perform exceptionally well,\" said the Great Sage."}

The others in the series include:\nContents.\nFeyfolken\nBook Two\nby\nWaughin Jarth\nAfter the test had been given and Vonguldak and Taksim had demonstrated their knowledge of elementary &lt;a href=\"conjuration\"&gt;conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Sage told them that they were free to enjoy the day. The two lads, who most afternoons fidgeted through their lessons, refused to leave their seats.\n\"You told us that after the test, you'd tell us more of your tale about the scribe and his enchanted quill,\" said Taksim.\n\"You've already told us about the scribe, how he lived alone, and his battles with the Temple secretary over the Bulletin he scripted for posting, and how he suffered from the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plague%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Crimson Plague&lt;/a&gt; and couldn't speak. When you left off, his messenger boy had just had his master's quill enchanted with the spirit of a &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Feyfolken\"&gt;Feyfolken&lt;/a&gt;,\" added Vonguldak to the Great Sage's memory.\n\"As it happens,\" said the Great Sage. \"I was thinking about a nap. However, the story does touch on some issues of the natures of spirits and thus is related to conjuration, so I'll continue.\nThaurbad began using the quill to write the Temple Bulletin, and there was something about the slightly lopsided, almost three-dimensional quality of the letters that Thaurbad liked a lot.\nInto the night, Thaurbad put together the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;'s Bulletin. For the moment he washed over the page with the Feyfolken quill, it became a work of art, an illuminated manuscript crafted of gold, but with good, simple and strong vernacular. The sermon excerpts read like poetry, despite being based on the archpriest's workmanlike exhortation of the most banal of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;. The obituaries of two of the Temple's chief benefactors were stark and powerful, pitifully mundane deaths transitioned into world-class tragedies. Thaurbad worked the magical palette until he nearly fainted from exhaustion. At six o'clock in the morning, a day before deadline, he handed the Bulletin to Gorgos for him to carry to Alfiers, the Temple secretary.\nAs expected, Alfiers never wrote back to compliment him or even comment on how early he had sent the bulletin. It didn't matter. Thaurbad knew it was the best Bulletin the Temple had ever posted. At one o'clock on Sundas, Gorgos brought him many messages.\n\"The Bulletin today was so beautiful, when I read it in the vestibule, I'm ashamed to tell you I wept copiously,\" wrote the archpriest. \"I don't think I've seen anything that captures Auri-El's glory so beautifully before. The cathedrals of Firsthold pale in comparison. My friend, I prostrate myself before the greatest artist since Gallael.\"\nThe archpriest was, like most men of the cloth, given to hyperbole. Still, Thaurbad was happy with the compliment. More messages followed. All of the Temple Elders and thirty-three of the parishioners young and old had all taken the time to find out who wrote the bulletin and how to get a message to congratulate him. And there was only one person they could go through for that information: Alfiers. the dragon lady besieged by his admirers filled Thaurbad with positive glee.\nHe was still in a good mood the next day when he took the ferry to his appointment with his healer, Telemichiel. The herbalist was new, a pretty Redguard woman who tried to talk to him, even after he gave her the note reading \"My name is Thaurbad Hulzik and I have an appointment with Telemichiel for eleven o'clock. Please forgive me for not talking, but I have no voicebox anymore.\"\n\"Has it started raining yet?\" she asked cheerfully. \"The diviner said it might.\"\nThaurbad frowned and shook his head angrily. Why was it that everyone thought that mute people liked to be talked to? Did soldiers who lost their arms like to be thrown balls? It was undoubtedly not a purposefully cruel behavior, but Thaurbad still suspected that some people just liked to prove that they weren't crippled too.\nThe examination itself was routine horror. Telemichiel performed the regular invasive torture, all the while chatting and chatting and chatting.\n\"You ought to try talking once in a while. That's the only way to see if you're getting better. If you don't feel comfortable doing it in public, you could try practicing it by yourself,\" said Telemichiel, knowing his patient would ignore his advice. \"Try singing in the bath. You'll probably find you don't sound as bad as you think.\"\nThaurbad left the examination with the promise of test results in a couple of weeks. On the ferry ride back home, Thaurbad began thinking of next week's temple bulletin. What about a double-border around the \"Last Sundas's Offering Plate\" announcement? Putting the sermon in two columns instead of one might have interesting effects. It was almost unbearable to think that he couldn't get started on it until Alfiers sent him information.\nWhen she did, it was with the note, \"LAST BULLETIN A LITTLE BETTER. NEXT TIME, DON'T USE THE WORD 'FORTUITOUS' IN PLACE OF 'FORTUNATE.' THE WORDS ARE NOT, IF YOU LOOK THEM UP, SYNONYMOUS.\"\nIn response, Thaurbad almost followed Telemichiel's advice by screaming obscenities at Gorgos. Instead, he drank a bottle of cheap wine, composed and sent a suitable reply, and fell asleep on the floor.\nThe next morning, after a long bath, Thaurbad began work on the Bulletin. His idea for putting a light shading effect on the \"Special Announcements\" section had an amazing textural effect. Alfiers always hated the extra decorations he added to the borders, but using the Feyfolken quill, they looked strangely powerful and majestic.\nGorgos came to him with a message from Alfiers at that very moment as if in response to the thought. Thaurbad opened it up. It simply said, \"I'M SORRY.\"\nThaurbad kept working. Alfiers's note he put from his mind, sure that she would soon follow it up with the complete message \"I'M SORRY THAT NO ONE EVER TAUGHT YOU TO KEEP RIGHT-HAND AND LEFT-HAND MARGINS THE SAME LENGTH\" or \"I'M SORRY WE CAN'T GET SOMEONE OTHER THAN A WEIRD, OLD MAN AS SCRIBE OF OUR BULLETIN.\" It didn't matter what she was sorry about. The columns from the sermon notes rose like the massive pillars of roses, crowned with unashamedly ornate headers. The obituaries and birth announcements were framed together with a spherical border, as a heartbreaking declaration of the circle of life. The Bulletin was simultaneously both warm and avant-garde. It was a masterpiece. When he sent it off to Alfiers late that afternoon, he knew she'd hate it, and was glad.\nThaurbad was surprised to get a message from the Temple on Loredas. Before he read the content, he could tell from the style that it wasn't from Alfiers. The handwriting wasn't Alfiers's usual belligerent slashing style, and it wasn't all in Alfiers's usual capital letters, which read like a scream from &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Thaurbad, I thought you should know Alfiers isn't at the Temple anymore. She quit her position yesterday, very suddenly. My name is Vanderthil, and I was lucky enough (let me admit it now, I begged pitifully) to be your new Temple contact. I'm overwhelmed by your genius. I was having a crisis of faith until I read last week's Bulletin. This week's Bulletin is a miracle. Enough. I just wanted to say I'm honored to be working with you. -- Vanderthil.\"\nThe response on Sundas after the service even astonished Thaurbad. The archpriest attributed the massive increase in attendance and collection plate offerings entirely to the Bulletin. Thaurbad's salary was quadrupled. Gorgos brought over a hundred and twenty messages from his adoring public.\nThe following week, Thaurbad sat in front of his writing plank, a glass of fine Torvali mead at his side, staring at the blank scroll. He had no ideas. The Bulletin, his child, his second-wife, bored him. The third-rate sermons of the archbishop were absolute anathema, and the deaths and births of the Temple patrons struck him as entirely pointless. Blah blah, he thought as he scribbled on the page.\nHe knew he wrote the letters B-L-A-H B-L-A-H. The words that appeared on the scroll were, \"A necklace of pearl on a white neck.\"\nHe scrawled a jagged line across the page. It appeared in through that damned beautiful Feyfolken quill: \"Glory to Auri-El.\"\nThaurbad slammed the quill and poetry spilled forth in a stream of ink. He scratched over the page, blotting over everything, and the vanquished words sprung back up in different form, even more exquisite than before. Every daub and splatter caused the document to whirl like a kaleidoscope before falling together in gorgeous asymmetry. There was nothing he could do to ruin the Bulletin. Feyfolken had taken over. He was a reader, not an author.\nNow,\" asked the Great Sage. \"What was Feyfolken from your knowledge of the School of Conjuration?\"\n\"What happened next?\" cried Vonguldak.\n\"First, tell me what Feyfolken was, and then I'll continue the story.\"\n\"You said it was a daedra,\" said Taksim. \"And it seems to have something to do with artistic expression. Was Feyfolken a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"But the scribe may have been imagining all this,\" said Vonguldak. \"Perhaps Feyfolken is a servitor of Sheogorath, and he's gone mad. Or the quill's writing makes everyone who views it, like all the congregation at the Temple of Auri-El go mad.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; is the daedra of knowledge ... and &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; is the daedra of the wild ... and the daedra of revenge is &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;,\" pondered Taksim. And then he smiled, \"Feyfolken is a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, isn't it?\"\n\"Very good,\" said the Great Sage. \"How did you know?\"\n\"It's his style,\" said Taksim. \"Assuming that he doesn't want the power of the quill now that he has it. What happens next?\"\n\"I'll tell you,\" said the Great Sage, and continued the tale."}

But he realized that it was the artist, and he merely the witness to its magic. He was furious and jealous. With a cry, he snapped the quill in half.\nHe turned to finish his glass of mead. When he turned around, the quill was intact.\nHe had no other quills but the one he had enchanted, so he dipped his finger in the inkwell and wrote a note to Gorgos in big sloppy letters. When Gorgos returned with a new batch of congratulatory messages from the Temple, praising his latest Bulletin, he handed the note and the quill to the messenger boy. The note read: \"Take the quill back to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and sell it. Buy me another quill with no enchantments.\"\nGorgos didn't know what to make of the note, but he did as he was told. He returned a few hours later.\n\"They wouldn't give us any gold back for it,\" said Gorgos. \"They said it wasn't enchanted. I told 'em, I said 'What are you talking about, you enchanted it right here with that Feyfolken soul gem,' and they said, 'Well, there ain't a soul in it now. Maybe you did something and it got loose.'\"\nGorgos paused to look at his master. Thaurbad couldn't speak, of course, but he seemed even more than usually speechless.\n\"Anyway, I threw the quill away and got you this new one, like you said.\"\nThaurbad studied the new quill. It was white-feathered while his old quill had been dove gray. It felt good in his hand. He sighed with relief and waved his messenger lad away. He had a Bulletin to write, and this time, without any magic except for his own talent.\nWithin two days time, he was nearly back on schedule. It looked plain but it was entirely his. Thaurbad felt a strange reassurance when he ran his eyes over the page and noticed some slight errors. It had been a long time since the Bulletin contained any errors. In fact, Thaurbad reflected happily, there were probably other mistakes still in the document that he was not seeing.\nHe was finishing a final whirl of plain calligraphy on the borders when Gorgos arrived with some messages from the Temple. He looked through them all quickly, until one caught his eye. The wax seal on the letter read \"Feyfolken.\" With complete bafflement, he broke it open.\n\"I think you should kill yourself,\" it read in perfectly gorgeous script.\nHe dropped the letter to the floor, seeing sudden movement on the Bulletin. Feyfolken script leapt from the letter and coursed over the scroll in a flood, translating his shabby document into a work of sublime beauty. Thaurbad no longer cared about the weird croaking quality of his voice. He screamed for a very long time. And then drank. Heavily.\nGorgos brought Thaurbad a message from Vanderthil, the secretary of the Temple, early Fredas morning, but it took the scribe until mid-morning to work up the courage to look at it. \"Good Morning, I am just checking in on the Bulletin. You usually have it in on Turdas night. I'm curious. You planning something special? -- Vanderthil.\"\nThaurbad responded, \"Vanderthil, I'm sorry. I've been sick. There won't be a Bulletin this Sunday\" and handed the note to Gorgos before retiring to his bath. When he came back an hour later, Gorgos was just returning from the Temple, smiling.\n\"Vanderthil and the archpriest went crazy,\" he said. \"They said it was your best work ever.\"\nThaurbad looked at Gorgos, uncomprehending. Then he noticed that the Bulletin was gone. Shaking, he dipped his finger in the inkwell and scrawled the words \"What did the note I sent with you say?\"\n\"You don't remember?\" asked Gorgos, holding back a smile. He knew the master had been drinking a lot lately. \"I don't remember the exact words, but it was something like, 'Vanderthil, here it is. Sorry it's late. I've been having severe mental problems lately. - Thaurbad.' Since you said, 'here it is,' I figured you wanted me to bring the Bulletin along, so I did. And like I said, they loved it. I bet you get three times as much letters this Sundas.\"\nThaurbad nodded his head, smiled, and waved the messenger lad away. Gorgos returned back to the Temple, while his master turned to his writing plank, and pulled out a fresh sheet of parchment.\nHe wrote with the quill: \"What do you want, Feyfolken?\"\nThe words became: \"Goodbye. I hate my life. I have cut my wrists.\"\nThaurbad tried another tact: \"Have I gone insane?\"\nThe words became: \"Goodbye. I have poison. I hate my life.\"\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\"\n\"I Thaurbad Hulzik cannot live with myself and my ingratitude. That's why I've put this noose around my neck.\"\nThaurbad picked up a fresh parchment, dipped his finger in the inkwell, and proceeded to rewrite the entire Bulletin. While his original draft, before Feyfolken had altered it, had been simple and flawed, the new copy was a scrawl. Lower-case I's were undotted, G's looked like Y's, sentences ran into margins and curled up and all over like serpents. Ink from the first page leaked onto the second page. When he yanked the pages from the notebook, a long tear nearly divided the third page in half. Something about the final result was evocative. Thaurbad at least hoped so. He wrote another note reading, simply, \"Use this Bulletin instead of the piece of trash I sent you.\"\nWhen Gorgos returned with new messages, Thaurbad handed the envelope to him. The new letters were all the same, except for one from his healer, Telemichiel. \"Thaurbad, we need you to come in as soon as possible. We've received the reports from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; about a strain of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Plague%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Crimson Plague&lt;/a&gt; that sounds very much like your disease, and we need to re-examine you. Nothing is definite yet, but we're going to want to see what our options are.\"\nIt took Thaurbad the rest of the day and fifteen drams of the stoutest mead to recover. The larger part of the next morning was spent recovering from this means of recovery. He started to write a message to Vanderthil: \"What did you think of the new Bulletin?\" with the quill. Feyfolken's improved version was \"I'm going to ignite myself on fire, because I'm a dying no-talent.\"\nThaurbad rewrote the note using his finger-and-ink message. When Gorgos appeared, he handed him the note. There was one message in Vanderthil's handwriting.\nIt read, \"Thaurbad, not only are you divinely inspired, but you have a great sense of humor. Imagine us using those scribbles you sent instead of the real Bulletin. You made the archbishop laugh heartily. I cannot wait to see what you have next week. Yours fondly, Vanderthil.\"\nThe funeral service a week later brought out far more friends and admirers than Thaurbad Hulzik would've believed possible. The coffin, of course, had to be closed, but that didn't stop the mourners from filing into lines to touch its smooth oak surface, imagining it as the flesh of the artist himself. The archbishop managed to rise to the occasion and deliver a better than usual eulogy. Thaurbad's old nemesis, the secretary before Vanderthil, Alfiers came in from &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt;, wailing and telling all who would listen that Thaurbad's suggestions had changed the direction of her life. When she heard Thaurbad had left her his quill in his final testament, she broke down in tears. Vanderthil was even more inconsolable, until she found a handsome and delightfully single young man.\n\"I can hardly believe he's gone and I never even saw him face-to-face or spoke to him,\" she said. \"I saw the body, but even if he hadn't been all burned up, I wouldn't have been able to tell if it was him or not.\"\n\"I wish I could tell you there'd been a mistake, but there was plenty of medical evidence,\" said Telemichiel. \"I supplied some of it myself. He was a patient of mine, you see.\"\n\"Oh,\" said Vanderthil. \"Was he sick or something?\"\n\"He had the Crimson Plague years ago, that's what took away his voice box, but it appeared to have gone into complete remission. Actually, I had just sent him a note telling him words to that effect the day before he killed himself.\"\n\"You're that healer?\" exclaimed Vanderthil. \"Thaurbad's messenger boy Gorgos told me that he had just picked up that message when I sent mine, complementing him on the new, primative design for the Bulletin. It was amazing work. I never would've told him this, but I had begun to suspect he was stuck in an outmoded style. It turned out he had one last work of genius, before going out in a blaze of glory. Figuratively. And literally.\"\nVanderthil showed the healer Thaurbad's last Bulletin, and Telemichiel agreed that its frantic, nearly illegible style spoke volumes about the power and majesty of the god Auri-El.\"\n\"Now I'm thoroughly confused,\" said Vonguldak.\n\"About which part?\" asked the Great Sage. \"I think the tale is very straight-forward.\"\n\"Feyfolken made all the Bulletins beautiful, except for the last one, the one Thaubad did for himself,\" said Taksim thoughtfully. \"But why did he misread the notes from Vanderthil and the healer? Did Feyfolken change those words?\"\n\"Perhaps,\" smiled the Great Sage.\n\"Or did Feyfolken changed Thaurbad's perceptions of those words?\" asked Vonguldak. \"Did Feyfolken make him mad after all?\"\n\"Very likely,\" said the Great Sage.\n\"But that would mean that Feyfolken was a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Vonguldak. \"And you said he was a servitor of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Which was he, an agent of mischief or an agent of insanity?\"\n\"The will was surely altered by Feyfolken,\" said Taksim, \"And that's the sort of thing a servitor of Clavicus Vile would do to perpetuate the curse.\"\n\"As an appropriate ending to the tale of the scribe and his cursed quill,\" smiled the Great Sage. \"I will let you read into it as you will.\""}

Members of the Fharun Clan were once leaders of the Kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Fharun is located on the northernmost point of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and the region of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Fharun itself is situated on a mountaintop with a road leading into the snowy forest and the Two Rivers of Wrothgaria. Fharun is also adjacent to the city of &lt;a href=\"Jehanna\"&gt;Jehanna&lt;/a&gt;, ideally making them the twin settlements of Wrothgar. Fharun's seat of power is Fharun Keep which is the highest building located in the city, on the highest peak of the fortress. The center of the stronghold has the Orcish Longhouse in the west and the feast hall in the east. The Fharun Prison is connected to the Fharun Keep and is deep underground. The only way to enter Fharun Prison from the outside is to the outside well, by dropping in. The closest settlement to Fharun is Jehanna, &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Spring\"&gt;Cloud Spring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dunlain%20Falls\"&gt;Dunlain Falls&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Morkuldin%20Haven\"&gt;Morkuldin Haven&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle of Fharun Pass &amp; Uzdabikh of Fharun.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20980\"&gt;1E 980&lt;/a&gt;, the First iteration of Orsinium was attacked by the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in the effort to quell the Orcish influence in the province of High Rock. In the nearby &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Pass\"&gt;Fharun Pass&lt;/a&gt;, an Orcish warrior named Uzdabikh defeated one thousand and one &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; warriors all by herself. By the time reinforcements arrived to help Uzdabikh, nothing had remained but a pile of Redguard corpses and Uzdabikh's Helm.\nThe Four Score War &amp; Lord Storig of Farrun.\nThe city of Farrun was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the Second Empire battled the Dunmeri Army of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. The Kingdom of Farrun was present at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt; along with other kingdoms among the Empire. The Vanguard against the Morrowind defense was led by &lt;a href=\"Storig\"&gt;Lord Storig&lt;/a&gt; of Farrun; his efforts proved to be successful since the Imperial Army was able to advance into the Morrowind province. The battle continued into the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ald%20Marak\"&gt;Battle of Ald Marak&lt;/a&gt;, and the fortress city of Ald Marak soon fell to the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fharun Clan &amp; the 2nd Orsinium.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Orsinium was established with the United trust of the major clans of Wrothgar. The &lt;a href=\"Fharun%20Clan\"&gt;Fharun Clan&lt;/a&gt; was among the five clans to join the city of Orsinium in the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of the Fharun Clan and the Orcish Stronghold was &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bazrag%20gro-Fharun\"&gt;Chief Bazrag gro-Fharun&lt;/a&gt;, a devotee of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; and a good friend of the leader of Orsinium, &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;King Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. While Kurog thrives to complete Orsinium in his lifetime and to enforce the religion of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, Bazrag believes that Orsinium would be completed generations after Kurog and that the old ways have made the Orsimer the way they are today. They are proud warriors of the Reach and Wrothgaria.\nThe Siege of Fharun &amp; Kurog's Betrayal.\nThe region of Wrothgar was under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Clan\"&gt;Winterborn Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; situated in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;. King Kurog decided to start a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; between the chieftains of Wrothgar other than Fharun for unknown reasons. Kurog tasked a traveler called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to gather the Orcish Chieftains of the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Clan\"&gt;Morkul Clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20Clan\"&gt;Shatul Clan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tumnosh%20Clan\"&gt;Tumnosh Clan&lt;/a&gt; to come to the &lt;a href=\"Scarp%20Keep\"&gt;Scarp Keep&lt;/a&gt; in Orsinium. While the Moot went underway, the Vestige was asked by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Solgra\"&gt;High Priestess Solgra&lt;/a&gt; to find Chief Bazrag at the city of Fharun. When the Vestige arrived, Fharun was under attack by a group of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; devotees called the &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;. The denizens of Fharun were either killed or fled. The Vestige and another agent of Orsinium, &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt; fought through the Vosh Rakh and reached the Fharun Prison to find Chief Bazrag in chains. It was revealed that King Kurog and &lt;a href=\"Forge-Mother%20Alga\"&gt;Forge-Mother Alga&lt;/a&gt; plan to assassinate the Chieftains and High Priestess Solgra to ensure his throne and to have a totalitarian rule over Wrothgar. The Vestige defeated King Kurog and Alga atop of Scarp Keep and Chief Bazrag became the new King of Orsinium.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fharun &amp; Solitude Disputes; the reign of King Lleromo.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf-Queen of Solitude. During this year, Uriel had a relationship with the Princess of Farrun, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Rakma\"&gt;Princess Rakma&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, both Solitude and Farrun had an unsteady relationship that was often noted in the history of the Reach. Farrun was also under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Lleromo\"&gt;King Lleromo&lt;/a&gt;, who was Rakma's father. This was also around the time when &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Emperor Antiochus Septim&lt;/a&gt; was dying on his deathbed.\nFharun during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Farrun in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Farrun was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Tristyrick\"&gt;King Tristyrick&lt;/a&gt;."}

She became &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt;'s lover and played a vital role in the &lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysical appearance.\nFhena was a young woman with the coloring of a Dunmer. She wore a broadbrimmed hat, knee-length pants, and a loose shirt. Her feet were bare. She appeared to be twenty years old, although she was probably no more than five or six years old.\nHistory.\nUmbriel Crisis.\nFhena met Mere-Glim exploring the trees in &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;. Glim talked about &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and how he ended up working in the sump. Glim asked her to ask her friend &lt;a href=\"Kalmo\"&gt;Kalmo&lt;/a&gt; how to reach the kitchens from there. Fhena agreed to help him, but she asked Glim to find orchid shrimp for her kitchen. They agreed to meet another time in the same place.\nGlim brought her a sack full of orchid shrimp the next time they met. Glim told her about the world below them. Fhena was excited by Glim's stories. Before leaving, Fhena revealed to Glim that Anna\u00efg had become very popular in the kitchen and was now working in &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen. Fhena offered to ask Kalmo where Toel's kitchen was, but Glim feared that it could raise many questions. Glim kissed Fhena to express his gratitude, but Fhena, who wasn't used to Tamrielic traditions thought that Glim was asking her to procreate.\nThe next time Glim met Fhena he brought her Kraken barnacles. Glim asked her about the trees in Umbriel because it reminded them of the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Fhena couldn't tell him much, but to Glim's surprise, she told him that the trees sang. Fhena took Glim's hand and pressed it to the bark. Glim didn't notice anything at first, but he recognised the same song that the Hist sang, in a bit simpler version.\nFhena took Glim branch riding through the trees of Umbriel. She told Glim that some Umbrielians just let it go and never coming back to Umbriel. They died to be born again, just as Argonians did in Black Marsh.\nGlim and the &lt;a href=\"skraws\"&gt;skraws&lt;/a&gt; were found responsible for sabotaging Umbriel. The guards wounded Glim, who managed to escape. He swam up to where he usually met Fhena. Fhena found him severely wounded, so she healed him. The medicines didn't seem to make any effect, so she asked the trees what to do. Glim woke up after three days sleeping. Glim intended to go back to help the skraws with their rebellion, but Fhena convinced him to stay with her. After a few days, Fhena couldn't hold Glim back any longer. When Glim jumped into the water he realized his body was being paralyzed.\nFhena tried to kill Anna\u00efg for poisoning Glim, but she was caught sneaking in from the pantry. Anna\u00efg showed her that she was recreating Glim as an Umbrielian. The drug she put in the water killed him, but it also made his body grow a crystal, a matrix containing his soul, his thoughts, memories. When the protoform grew Glim would be reborn conserving his thoughts and feelings. If Anna\u00efg hadn't killed Glim, someone else would have, and she wouldn't have been able to help him.\nWhen Glim came back to life, Fhena told him what Anna\u00efg had done. Glim didn't understand it at first, but when Anna\u00efg explained it to him he enraged and left for the Fringe Gyre. Fhena went after him to try to talk some sense into him. Glim realized that the trees had changed their song. Fhena told him that it had changed a pair of days after his death. Glim realized that the trees had shaped him to do something, to save Umbriel.\nGlim and Fhena tried to convince Anna\u00efg not to poison the trees. According to them, it would kill all the Umbrielians, including them. Anna\u00efg, and Fhena waited for Glim and &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; to come back and escape from Umbriel as soon as they could. When Glim returned, Fhena rushed to Glim. Glim explained that he had to take the trees home, to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;Realm of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlim and Fhena listened to the deeper, stranger music of the trees. They liked that place, they felt it was their home."}

The Green Lady represents, as I understand it, the ferocity, the strength, and the pure physicality of the Bosmer.\nDoes this mean she is their war-leader or chieftain? Not exactly. Certainly, much of the Green Lady's strength can be turned toward battle, but she is more a manifestation of the physical prowess and even health of her people. I would call her a demigod if I did not think it might offend the true &lt;a href=\"gods\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; as well as the Wood Elves themselves, but it might be an apt description."}
