She has become deeply depressed since then.\nIn a conversation overheard between her and Captain &lt;a href=\"Netanwe\"&gt;Netanwe&lt;/a&gt;, Velatosse originally agreed with bringing the mercenaries in to help keep order, but has since disproved of how Hendil and the mercenaries are handling the situation.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20First%20Patient\"&gt;The First Patient&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; arrives in Phear, she has become very distrustful of Hendil and &lt;a href=\"Amuur\"&gt;Amuur&lt;/a&gt; and believes there's something more to the plague then what they are letting on. She implores the Vestige to search Hendil's home to discover what he's hiding. After finding Hendil's journal and giving it to her, she asks one to infiltrate the mine and find out the truth of what is going on. After sneaking into the mine, they discover that the plague is being caused by &lt;a href=\"Tancano\"&gt;Tancano&lt;/a&gt;, Hendil's son, who had been turned into a vampire. And the \"plague\" was really people being turned into thralls after being fed upon.\nAfter Amuur and Tancano are defeated and Hendil surrenders, Velatosse learns that Iwelien had already been fed on, but Nelulin had not been fed on yet. In her grief over the loss of Iwelien, she demands to have Hendil handed over to her, which would result in his death. The Vestige can convince her, however, to let Captain Netanwe arrest him.\nDialogue.\n\"There's just something not right about this.\"\nUpon returning with Hendil's journal:\n\"They took him!

Once you have enough salloweed, return to Hendil and he will use it to make more salloweed Aloe.

However, we failed because we were required to stage an assault and simultaneously maintain the Ghostfence to prevent the threatened large-scale breakout of Dagoth Ur's blighted hosts. With the Nerevarine leading the assault, and the Tribunal free to devote their full energies to maintaining the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;, this plan has a greater chance of success. Unfortunately, however, the loss of the artifacts &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keening%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, and the recent increase in Dagoth Ur's strength, poses new problems for the execution of the plan.\nTherefore, our proposed plan has the following five phases:\nPhase 1: Raids inside the Ghostfence\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; are familiar with the terrain, and will provide maps and current intelligence reports. The region inside the Ghostfence is dangerous, and the Nerevarine will need to be familiar with its particular challenges. After measuring skills and resources against Dagoth Ur's defenses, the Nerevarine will know better how to pace a campaign, alternating raids with improving skills, getting better equipment, and stockpiling resources.\nPhase 2: Raids upon Ash Vampire Citadels\nDagoth Ur's kin have become markedly more powerful in recent decades, after remaining stable for thousands of years. If they can be individually isolated and destroyed, they will not be able to support Dagoth Ur in later stages of the war. It may also be that the dramatic increase in their power comes from items enchanted by Dagoth Ur. Salvage of such items might contribute to our resources.\nPhase 3: Assault on Gate Citadel Vemynal\nEssential to recover the artifact hammer Sunder for Phase 5. The &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt; Dagoth Vemyn has possession of Sunder, and probably seeks to discover the secrets of its enchantments. He may also have access to notebooks and journals of Kagrenac that have survived in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; workshops of Vemynal.\nPhase 4: Assault on Gate Citadel Odrosal\nEssential to recover the artifact blade Keening for Phase 5. The Ash Vampire Dagoth Odros has possession of Keening, and probably seeks to discover the secrets of its enchantments. He may also have access to notebooks and journals of Kagrenac that have survived in the Dwemer workshops of Odrosal.\nPhase 5: Assault on Citadel Dagoth\nAll the previous stages are preparations for this stage. Recent expeditions show that Citadel Dagoth has undergone extensive expansion; the location will need to be explored carefully. The known route to the Heart Chamber will be well-defended; alternative routes may exist. Dagoth Ur will have anticipated our plan to destroy him by attacking the Heart, and he will almost certainly personally oppose approach to the Heart Chamber. Together the Tribunal could not defeat him, and he has grown stronger since then. Admittedly, the Tribunal had the distraction of maintaining the Ghostfence simultaneous with fighting Dagoth Ur, but, even so, the challenge seems daunting.\nThe adoption of this phased campaign seems to offer the best chances for success. In retrospect, the Tribunal's decision to directly assault Citadel Dagoth rather than proceed step-by-step through lesser objectives must be seen to have been a serious error. The Tribunal did not feel it had the option of a slow-paced and deliberate campaign, given that they had many other competing priorities, not the least of which was the maintenance of the Ghostfence and the outer defenses surrounding Red Mountain. The Nerevarine, on the other hand, should be best served by a careful, step-by-step advance, with the additional advantage of building confidence along the way while successes would undermine Dagoth Ur's own assurance in his defenses.\nEmploying Kagrenac's Tools against Dagoth Ur\nThe source of Dagoth Ur's supernatural power is the Heart of Lorkhan. The Heart is also the source of the Tribunal's divine powers.\nDuring mythic times, the gods took and hid Lorkhan's heart beneath Red Mountain as a punishment for creating the mortal plane. The Dwemer discovered the heart while building underground colonies. High Craftlord &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; created enchanted tools intended to tap the power of the heart. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt; was fought to prevent this sacrilege. Kagrenac's use of these tools and the disappearance of the Dwemer race marked the end of the war. Kagrenac's tools were recovered by Lord &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and Dagoth Ur. Dagoth Ur was left to guard the tools while Nerevar came to consult with us, his advisors. In Nerevar's absence, Dagoth Ur experimented with the tools upon the heart, and was corrupted. We returned to discover a deranged Dagoth Ur who refused to turn over the tools. When he attacked us, we drove him away.\nWe left Red Mountain with the tools, and subsequently Sotha Sil discovered their secrets. Collectively we used the tools to establish a connection with the Heart, enabling ourselves to transform our mortal natures. Thus we became the Tribunal.\nDagoth Ur had survived our attacks, and without the tools, in a manner not well understood, Dagoth Ur also managed to establish a connection with the Heart and to transform himself into an immortal being.\nOur plan to destroy Dagoth Ur also runs the risk of destroying the Tribunal. The plan is to permanently disrupt Kagrenac's enchantments upon the Heart, severing connections with and ourselves, and rendering us all once again mortal. A mortal Dagoth Ur may then be destroyed by mundane means. The loss of godhood and the possible death of the Tribunal are judged a necessary risk and sacrifice.\nThe normal procedure for establishing connection with the Heart is a three-step process. The wearer of Wraithguard strikes the Heart with the hammer Sunder, causing the Heart to produce a pure tone. Then the wearer of the Wraithguard strikes the Heart with the blade Keening, shattering the pure tone into a prism of tone-shades. These tone-shades are then imprinted upon the substance of the wearer of Wraithguard, giving him an immortal and divine nature.\nThe Nerevarine will not be taught the secret rituals required to perform the third step. Instead, The Nerevarine will strike the Heart with Keening for a second time, causing its tones to diverge into unstable patterns of interference. Further repeated strikes with Keening will further disrupt the tones, with the ultimate result of shattering and dispelling Kagrenac's original enchantments binding the Heart, thereby severing the Heart's links with Dagoth Ur, and with any surviving Heartwights, and with the Tribunal. Destroying Kagrenac's enchantments on the Heart will also stop the corrupt effusion of the Heart's divine power, and end the Blight on &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nerevarine may be tempted to steal the power of the Heart. Dagoth Ur and Sotha Sil alone know this secret. Dagoth Ur may, in extremity, propose to teach the Nerevarine to use Kagrenac's tools to become a god. We doubt that the Nerevarine is fool enough to trust Dagoth Ur, and are content to take this risk.\nBe warned! The Nerevarine cannot safely equip either Keening or Sunder unless wearing Wraithguard. The Nerevarine will be injured every moment while holding either of these artifacts unless protected by Wraithguard; persistence will be rewarded with death. If Nerevarine can equip an item while not wearing Wraithguard and receive no injury, the item is a counterfeit.\nOne last note. Dagoth Ur must not get hold of Wraithguard. The Nerevaine must prepare and use a Recall or Almsivi Intervention if there is any risk of death or capture.\nThe Element of Surprise\nDagoth Ur will not expect you to destroy Kagrenac's enchantments on the Heart. He does not know it is possible, he would not do it himself, and he knows we have never tried it. He will not believe anyone would want to sacrifice the promise of such power. Further, advancement in House Dagoth, as in all Great Houses, is by challenge and confrontation within the hierarchy. The Nerevarine's challenges and defeats of ash vampires and battles with the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt; will be viewed in that light.\nDagoth Ur and his kin may assume The Nerevarine's ambition is to control the Heart. Given that assumption, it is only reasonable that the Nerevarine would try to defeat each of Dagoth Ur's subordinates in turn, working up to Dagoth Ur. If the Nerevarine can defeat Dagoth Ur, and control the Heart, so much the better. But logically the Nerevarine would wish rise as high in the hierarchy as possible before cutting a deal with head of the House.\nDagoth Ur should try to recruit the Nerevarine into House Dagoth. It may be possible to pretend to join him, then betray him. However, any attempt to deceive him will be very risky. House Dagoth has a tradition of subterfuge and treachery, and because he is a deceiver, he will expect deception.\nClosing Remarks\nWe place no compulsion upon the Nerevarine to adhere to the plans described here. We believe that they offer the best chance of destroying Dagoth Ur. But we have also chosen to place our trust in the Nerevarine's judgement and skill. Frankly, we see no alternative.\nIf there are doubts or questions, speak with Vivec. He has agreed to serve as the Nerevarine's guide and counselor for this campaign.\nIt may be that if the Nerevarine succeeds, the Tribunal will not survive. Such sentiments as might have been expressed to the Tribunal should, in that case, be addressed to the land and people of Morrowind.\nMay the happy convergence of fortune and prayer meet in our destiny.\nOn behalf of Lady &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and Lord &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;,\nVivec"}

The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; used his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt;, huge inter-dimensional machines, in an attempt to drag &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and into his own realm of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong before the Planemeld, &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; and Molag Bal were at war, using their &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; worshipers as proxies to fight. During one of their many conflicts, a city of Meridia's followers came under assault from Molag Bal. He opened many portals to Coldharbour outside the walls, and the defenders were driven back into the city. Within, the Ayleid King &lt;a href=\"Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt; led the defense, but the situation was quickly deteriorating. Knowing that the city would eventually fall, Meridia used several of her artifacts, known as Lights of Meridia, on the city to transport it into Coldharbour via the portals Molag Bal had opened. The city became a safe haven in which Molag Bal could not see or act. Meridia knew that one day this city may be a safe haven from which mortals may thwart her enemy. This city became known as the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;. Meridia herself remained there, taking the guise of a &lt;a href=\"The%20Groundskeeper\"&gt;groundskeeper&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure the city would remain safe.\nVaren's Rebellion.\nIn 2E 573, five years before the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, then-Emperor &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; legalized Daedra worship throughout the crumbling &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Empire of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. After hearing of this, &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; summoned the military forces of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to depose Leovic.\u00a0Varen based his rebellion out of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, from where he coordinated his troops as they liberated Cyrodiil's other cities to further weaken Leovic's control.\u00a0The rebellion claimed victory when Varen's forces stormed the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and Varen personally dispatched Leovic at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; before proclaiming himself &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five Companions.\nAfter Varen claimed the throne, he wanted to legitimize his claim to the Ruby Throne and thus end the Interregnum, which could only be done by a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. One of his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;, the necromancer lord &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, convinced Varen he knew a ritual which would allow the emperor to become Dragonborn. To do this, however, they needed the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;.\nThus, the Five Companions were formed in 2E 576: &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; himself, &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. They set out on a two-year quest to find the Amulet of Kings.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; were able to retrieve the Amulet of Kings and begin the ritual in the year 2E 578. The Five gathered at the Temple of the One in the Imperial City, and they began to perform the ritual. At that moment, Mannimarco used his dark magic to immobilize the others and reveal his true intentions: he was an agent of\u00a0Molag Bal, and the ritual in fact weakened the barriers between Nirn and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis event allowed Molag Bal to initiate the Planemeld, a forceful merging of worlds. Once the ritual was completed, aftershocks swept across every corner of\u00a0Nirn. Mages died or went mad,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0trembled in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, earthquakes shook &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and heavy storms devastated the coastlines of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The constellation of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"the%20Serpent\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0grew so large that it seemed to threaten every star sign at once.\nAfter the Soulburst, Varen mysteriously went missing. Lyris was captured by Mannimarco to be sacrificed, Abnur fled and Sai Sahan absconded with the amulet, managing to hide it in &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, the\u00a0Tharn\u00a0family, who were the rulers of Cyrodiil through the new Empress Regent\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0made a pact with\u00a0Mannimarco, The\u00a0King of Worms, who had agreed to supplement the Imperial's forces by resurrecting their soldiers, except for Clivia's father Abnur who deeply despised Mannimarco after the Soulburst.\nVaren and Lyris were sent to Coldharbour, where Varen was tortured to such an extent his appearance changed to that of a blind old man, barely able to walk.\nHistory.\nThe Vestige.\nThe Vestige was one of many mortals sacrificed by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; to Molag Bal, specifically by Mannimarco himself. They were sent to &lt;a href=\"the%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;the Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour. There the Vestige was contacted by Varen (who chose not to identify himself as such, instead referring to himself as \"The Prophet\"), who informed them that they had an important part to play in foiling Molag Bal's schemes. First, the Vestige had to escape and locate a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; named Lyris Titanborn to help free the Prophet. At that moment, the prisoners overpowered the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; guards and began liberating the other prisoners, including the Vestige. They fought their way through the prison, eventually finding Lyris and, with the aid of a mad &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul-Shriven&lt;/a&gt; knight named &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;, were able to locate the Prophet's cell. However, for him to be liberated, someone had to take his place in the cell. Lyris switched places with the Prophet, who vowed they would find a way to free her. The Prophet and the Vestige made their way to one of the Dark Anchors and, with the aid of the Prophet's magic, were able to return to Nirn.\nThe Harborage.\nThe Vestige and the Prophet were not returned to the same location on Nirn, but they eventually reunited at a place called &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Location%29\"&gt;the Harborage&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Prophet explained the events that led up to his capture and the Soulburst that had lead to the current crisis.\u00a0After his tale was done, the Prophet informed the Vestige that he needed more time to rest and to devise a way to free Lyris from Coldharbour.\nDaughter of Giants.\nShortly after, the Prophet contacted the Vestige and asked them to return to the Harborage, having found out where Lyris was being held in Coldharbour. Molag Bal had moved her to the Foundry of Woe and the Prophet opened a portal to Coldharbour. Once the Vestige located her, they were forced to aid her in retrieving several aspects of herself Molag Bal had removed to torment her: settle her regret over killing her mother at birth, assuage the solitude she would felt throughout her life, resolve her uncertainty and defeat her terror. The pair then escaped Coldharbour and returned to the Harborage.\nChasing Shadows.\nThe Prophet recalled the Vestige to him, having heard whispers of fear near the Harborage. The Vestige was tasked with locating a Worm Cult agent nearby. Locals pointed to a mysterious Imperial nosing around, leading the Vestige to a cellar infested with &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, Abnur Tharn appeared to them via the Orb of Discourse which was sowing fear in the nearby populace, thinking the Worm Cult agent was trying to contact him. Tharn was surprised to see the Vestige instead, but before they could speak further, the Worm Cult agent attacked. The Vestige defeated him, then brought the Orb to the Prophet, who believed he could use it to locate Sai Sahan. As Sai had fled with the Amulet, and the Amulet was the only way to stop Molag Bal, the Prophet desired to locate him.\nCastle of the Worm.\nWhile using the Orb of Discourse to locate Sai Sahan, the Prophet was contacted by Abnur Tharn, who desired to speak with the Vestige. Upon arriving at the Harborage, Tharn informed them that he had no desire to continue to serve Mannimarco, but that he was imprisoned in Coldharbour's &lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt; and needed to be rescued. In exchange, he offered knowledge of Sai Sahan's location. The Vestige and Lyris entered Coldharbour once more, where they were aided by Cadwell to enter the Castle undetected. Fighting their way through many Worm Cultists and undead minions, they eventually managed to locate Tharn and free him. However, Mannimarco appeared before them and attempted to slay them using several waves of summoned skeletons. After dispatching them, Tharn and Mannimarco began a magic duel, which Tharn won when the Vestige hit Mannimarco, breaking his concentration. The Prophet then opened a portal to the Harborage and the trio escaped Coldharbour. The Prophet then revealed that he was in fact Varen Aquilarios. He claimed had hesitated about revealing himself as he was not sure how the Vestige would react, since his actions ultimately lead to their death.\nTharn revealed that while he did not know Sai Sahan's exact location, he was willing to assist the Prophet in locating it. This angered Lyris, who punched Tharn so hard he fell over. Though furious with him, Varen was able to calm her, as they would need Tharn's help to locate Sai Sahan.\nThe Tharn Speaks.\nDuring their travels, the Vestige was contacted by a &lt;a href=\"banekin\"&gt;banekin&lt;/a&gt; bearing a message from Abnur Tharn requesting a meeting away from the Harborage, at a &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guildhall\"&gt;Mages Guildhall&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige found Tharn disguised as a guild mage. Tharn explained that Mannimarco stored artifacts and occasionally information in a nearby Ruin, and it may contain Sai Sahan's whereabouts. The two entered the ruins and discovered that Sahan was being held in Coldbarbour's &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt;, being tortured for the location of the Amulet of Kings.\nVaren informed the Vestige he will need time to determine the Halls of Torment's exact location in Coldharbour and would contact them when he knows.\nHalls of Torment.\nWhen Varen determined the location of the Halls, he sent the Vestige through a portal and made them choose whether to take Tharn or Lyris along. The two entered the Halls and found Sahan being tortured by a &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Duchess of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;, who was using doppelgangers of the Five Companions to torture Sahan both physically and mentally in an effort to reveal the location of the Amulet of Kings. After slaying the doppelgangers and the Duchess, the pair rescued Sahan and returned him to the Harborage. There, Sahan informed them that he had hidden the Amulet in the ruins of Sancre Tor. He requested a few days to recover from his ordeal before setting out.\nValley of the Blades.\nSai Sahan informed the Vestige that they required an item to unlock the chamber in which the Amulet was being kept: the Ring of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;'s Mercy. Sahan had left the Ring in the care of &lt;a href=\"Kasura\"&gt;Kasura&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; Blademaster and his old mentor. Varen opened a portal in the Abbey of Blades in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the Vestige, Tharn, Lyris and Sahan entered. Upon arriving, they discovered Molag Bal had sent a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Abbey. They were able to slay it, but it had already destroyed most of the Abbey and killed most of the students before they arrived. Kasura thanked her rescuers and led them to where she had stored the Ring: the ancestral crypt of Sai's ancestors. Within, a vision of Mannimarco appeared and raised the dead within the crypt in an attempt to stop them from retrieving the Ring, but they were stopped and the Ring was recovered. Sahan, Lyris and Tharn stayed behind to assist Kasura and her remaining students in burying the dead while the Vestige returned to the Harborage.\nShadow of Sancre Tor.\nAfter their Lyris, Sahan and Tharn returned from the Abbey of Blades, they joined the Vestige in venturing to Sancre Tor. As they entered the ruins, they encountered yet another vision of Mannimarco. This time, the King of Worms explained that he had placed a spell on Sahan to track his every movement. More importantly, he revealed that he planned to use the Amulet of Kings to trap Molag Bal and absorb his essence, turning himself into the next Daedric Prince of Domination. The wards of Stendarr that Sai Sahan had placed on the chamber containing the Amulet would conceal him from Molag Bal until he was ready to strike. The Vestige and their companions fought their way through the ruins before confronting Mannimarco himself in the Amulet chamber after removing the wards. After killing him, Molag Bal himself appeared and dragged Mannimarco's soul into Coldharbour, having known of his betrayal all along. The Vestige recovered the Amulet of Kings and returned to the Harborage.\nCouncil of the Five Companions.\nVaren asked the Vestige to join them at the Harborage once more. There, Sahan gave the Vestige the choice of joining the Five Companions or not. Afterwards, Tharn explained his plan for the Amulet: he believed that the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divine&lt;/a&gt; power of the Amulet could harm Molag Bal sufficiently to force him to relinquish all the souls he had stolen, including that of the Vestige. However, there was a price: the ritual needed to imbue the power would require a soul. Obviously the Vestige could not do this, neither could Tharn who would need to perform the ritual. Lyris, Sahan or Varen would need to sacrifice themselves to imbue the Vestige with the power of the Divines, and each of them volunteered to be the sacrifice when the time came. Varen then explained that forces would soon launch an assault on Coldharbour, and that the Vestige would need to join them.\nPlanning the assault on Coldharbour.\nThe Vestige was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Vanus told them that he and &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Hakruba\"&gt;Countess Hakruba&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; had a plan to attack Molag Bal's realm and end the Planemeld. To do so, they needed the cooperation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; in order to maintain the Guilds' neutrality. Vanus and the Vestige visited &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and convinced them to meet for a council on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;, off the western coast of Cyrodiil.\nThe negotiations quickly broke down as the leaders began to argue and insult each other. As Vanus and the Vestige attempted to restore order, Molag Bal appeared before them and opened portals to Coldharbour on the island and Daedra poured forth. The enemy was repelled, but Vanus and Hakruba realized that neither alliance leader would agree to send forces into Coldharbour for fear that the other two would take the opportunity to seize the Imperial City. The Guilds would need to do it on their own. They assembled all available Guild members on Stirk and entered Coldharbour.\nThe Army of Meridia.\nThe plan quickly fell apart as the force became scattered all over Coldharbour due to Molag Bal's defenses. The Vestige appeared alone and entered an intact, pristine yet abandoned city. They encountered Meridia, who kept her identity hidden from them, referring to herself simply as the Groundskeeper. She told them the history of the Hollow City, and how it would be a safe haven from which to gather their forces.\nThe Vestige then set out to gather the Guilds' assault force and rescued King Dynar, who had been kept alive by Molag Bal in order to torture him. They all assembled in the Hollow City and planned the assault, with King Dynar taking command of the Fighters Guild since their commander had died shortly after arriving. The Vestige also encountered and assisted several villages and settlements that had been sent to Coldharbour for various reasons over the centuries. In exchange, these damned souls agreed to join the force gathering at the Hollow City.\nDespite being separated and arriving alone, Vanus Galerion had set off on his own to destroy &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Forge%20%28Location%29\"&gt;The Black Forge&lt;/a&gt;, where Dark Anchors were built, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Shackle\"&gt;Great Shackle&lt;/a&gt;, which was powering the Planemeld. He failed and was captured, but was rescued by the Vestige who was then able to destroy both objectives. Cadwell assisted and revealed to them they were too late: the Great Shackle had already created a Planar Vortex which was quickly drawing Nirn into Coldharbour faster than ever before. They would need to reach the Planar Vortex and activate the Lights of Meridia within to destroy it.\nThe Final Assault.\nTo reach the Planar Vortex, the Guild force would need to cross &lt;a href=\"The%20Chasm\"&gt;The Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, a narrow and heavily defended strip of land, and capture the &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20Citadel\"&gt;Reaver Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige leads the charge, closing Daedric reinforcement portals and eventually defeating &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Grunda%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Grunda&lt;/a&gt;, the commander of The Chasm's forces. Upon capturing the Reaver Citadel and the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Stair\"&gt;Endless Stair&lt;/a&gt;, they then entered the Planar Vortex, where the Groundskeeper revealed herself to be the Daedric Prince Meridia. She assisted the Guild force in closing the Dark Anchors inside the Vortex, but was confronted by Molag Bal at the final Anchor. The two fought one another as Vanus prepared the Lights of Meridia. The Vestige and the remaining Guild forces fought wave after wave of Daedra and Dremora until Vanus finally activated the Lights. The Planar Vortex then collapsed.\nGod of Schemes.\nThe Vestige awoke back in the Hollow City's Chapel. Meridia congratulated them on their victory, but informed them that King Dynar had been mortally wounded in the final battle in the Planar Vortex. The Vestige heard the Ayleid King's last words and exited the Chapel, only to find Varen waiting outside informing them the time to reclaim their soul had come. The Five Companions assembled at the Harborage one last time and entered &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Grief\"&gt;Heart's Grief&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of Molag Bal's power in Coldharbour. Within, they found Mannimarco being tortured by undead. After speaking with them, the Vestige was given the choice of freeing the King of Worms or leaving him to his fate. Regardless of their choice, the Five Companions approached the Seat of Tyranny and prepared the ritual. The Vestige then had to choose whether to sacrifice Lyris, Sahan, or Varen. Tharn performed the ritual and imbued the Vestige with the power of the Divines. After the ritual, the Vestige glowed with divine golden light and carved a path through countless Daedra and Dremora. Finally, they reached Molag Bal and engaged in combat with the God of Schemes, finally cutting him in half with a blade of golden light.\nThe Vestige was transported to the &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, Meridia's &lt;a href=\"realm%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;realm of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige is reunited with their soul and is told by Meridia that whichever companion they had sacrificed is now part of their soul as well. Molag Bal appeared and spoke with them, calmly explaining that he was impressed with their prowess but that the Vestige had attracted the attention of the other Daedric Princes and that they could not comprehend the politics of Oblivion. Meridia then materialized and told Molag Bal to leave her realm, which he did after one last mockery. Meridia then congratulated the Vestige on their success but that the journey was far from over. She explained that Tharn fled after the ritual with the Amulet of Kings, that he would never be able to use its power for himself but that he would spend many frustrating years trying nonetheless.\u00a0\nWith the destruction of the Planar Vortex and the release of all the souls held by Molag Bal, the Planemeld was over. Though several Dark Anchors remained open across Tamriel, the continent itself was no longer in danger of being pulled into Coldharbour. The largest Dark Anchor, which was open above &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City, remained open. The city itself still remained under the control of Molag Bal's forces."}

A number of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Archer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Archers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Infantry\"&gt;Imperial Infantry&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Mender\"&gt;Imperial Mender&lt;/a&gt;s may be found here, guarding various passageways. &lt;a href=\"Sister%20Terran%20Arminus\"&gt;Sister Terran Arminus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; may be found having an argument at the foot of a staircase.\nClivia Tharn: \"My patience grows thin, sister.\"\nSister Terran Arminus: \"We've had our differences, but when have you ever known me to be wrong?\"\nClivia Tharn: \"\"Yes, yes, I suppose that's true. A few more moments then.\nAfter witnessing this, speak to Sister Terran Arminus:\n\"You're finally here! You stink of blood, but I thought you'd smell fouler with everything you've been through. You'd think I'd be used to it by now.\"\nIf you speak to Clivia Tharn, she will have the following dialogue:\nWho are you? \"\"Don't you recognize the ruler of the Imperial Empire when you see her? I am the Empress Regent, and I've returned to claim the Ruby Throne from these Daedra.\" \"They've sullied it long enough.\"\nIf you speak to &lt;a href=\"Micella%20Carlinus\"&gt;Micella Carlinus&lt;/a&gt;, she will have the following dialogue:\n\"Sister Arminus assures us you're to play a vital role, today. Of course, she also said that we have no idea how lucky we are we haven't been whisked into the cosmic beyond. And then she laughed about it.\"\nIf you speak to &lt;a href=\"Cordius%20Pontifio\"&gt;Cordius Pontifio&lt;/a&gt;, he will have the following dialogue:\n\"I don't care how great the Moth Priest says you are. The Palace should be reclaimed under the banner of the Empress Regent. Don't make a mess of this.\"\nWalk up the steps toward &lt;a href=\"Otho%20Numida\"&gt;Otho Numida&lt;/a&gt;, who will have the following dialogue:\n\"The Priest made us wait all this time... for you? I expected an army. I hope you know what you signed up for, stranger.\"\nContinue forward into the next room and walk up the ramp to your left. At the top, turn to your right and climb up the ladder to &lt;a href=\"Green%20Emperor%20Way%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt;. When you reach the outside, the White-Gold Tower will be visible a ways ahead of you. Walk forward, bearing right through the arch. There will be several enemies waiting beyond, including &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Foot%20Soldier\"&gt;Skeletal Foot Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Online%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn%20Lacerator\"&gt;Xivkyn Lacerator&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, the Lacerator will shout, \"White-Gold Tower is now the gravestone of the Empire.\" Defeat them and move forward, down the steps to your right.\nContinue down the path, now bearing left, and you will encounter additional enemies, including &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Assassin\"&gt;Skeletal Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s, zombies, and a &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn%20Flagellant\"&gt;Xivkyn Flagellant&lt;/a&gt;, who will say, \"The two thrones will be joined.\" From here, go right toward the columns near the outer wall, and go up the hill. Once there, you will encounter more zombies and skeletal assassins, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn%20Bulwark\"&gt;Xivkyn Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;. After killing these enemies, you will see a path directly to the entrance of the tower guarded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Iron-Swathed%20Glutton\"&gt;The Iron-Swathed Glutton&lt;/a&gt;, a unique &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Colossus\"&gt;Flesh Colossus&lt;/a&gt;. After killing him, enter the tower through the door labeled \"Imperial Throne Room.\"\nAt the center of the throne room are three &lt;a href=\"Prisoner%20%28Imperial%20City%29\"&gt;prisoners&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Adjudicator\"&gt;The Adjudicator&lt;/a&gt;, a unique &lt;a href=\"harvester\"&gt;harvester&lt;/a&gt;, who will say, \"The Throne belongs to Molag Bal now, your verdict is death, like the mortals before you!\" while killing the prisoners. The Adjudicator will not attack you if you are still near the door, but will become hostile when you get closer. It will launch balls of energy at you, and during the fight it will say, \"I sentence you to eternal suffering.\" Once you kill it, your objective will be to recover the scroll. Go through the hall on the south side of the room and enter the door labeled \"Imperial Guard Quarters.\"\nOnce inside, walk up the steps and down the hall to fight the skeletal foot soldiers and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Morikyn\"&gt;Dremora Morikyn&lt;/a&gt; ahead. Walk past the first wooden barricade and enter the doorway to your left, where Sister Terran Arminus will be waiting. When you reach her, she will say, \"Smash those rifts or be overwhelmed!,\" after which more Dremora Morikyn, &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Sunderer\"&gt;Dremora Sunderer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Churl%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora Churl&lt;/a&gt; will appear. One of the enemies will shout, \"Flank, now!\" Kill the Dremora and go through the northern doorway. In the next room, turn left and you will encounter skeletal foot soldiers, skeletal assassins, a Dremora Morikyn, a Xivkyn Bulwark, and a Xivkyn Lacerator. Once they are dead, continue south and enter the door labeled \"Lower Elder Scrolls Library.\"\nIn the library, walk up a small flight of stairs and follow the path. You will quickly encounter a Xivkyn Flagellant, skeletal foot soldiers, and skeletal assassins. Defeat them and move on. Later, you will have to kill the &lt;a href=\"Crematorial%20Guard\"&gt;Crematorial Guard&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;. After doing so, enter another door labeled \"Lower Elder Scrolls Library.\" The next chamber is much wider and has a stone pedestal at the center. Here, Sister Terran Arminus and Clivia Tharn will begin talking to each other:\nSister Terran Arminus: \"Hold. The Scroll is here.\"\nClivia Tharn: \"Where? There's nothing!\"\nSister Terran Arminus: \"This is where I left it. Give me a moment. You'll see.\"\nAfter saying that, Sister Terran Arminus will approach the pedestal and it will light up with blue energy, revealing the Elder Scroll.\nClivia Tharn: \"The Elder Scroll!\"\nSister Terran Arminus: \"It's not ready. Don't touch it!\"\nClivia Tharn: \"The Scroll is mine. Kill them all!\"\nMicella Carlinus: \"As you wish, Empress.\"\nClivia Tharn touches the Elder Scroll and a shockwave blasts the rest of the party back, and the ceiling of the library disintegrates. Clivia will then tell her personal guard (Cordius Pontifio, Micella Carlinus, and Otho Numida) to kill you and Sister Terran Arminus. Kill all of Clivia's guards. After doing so, Sister Terran Arminus will say, \"I had hoped the scroll was wrong about Clivia. Go. Find the Empress Regent.\" If you speak to her, she will say, \"I suppose the scroll is never wrong, but I had hoped... Go. You have to find her. All the pieces are in place to bring about a conclusion\u2014for good or ill.\" Head west and enter another door labeled \"Lower Elder Scrolls Library.\"\nIn the library, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Speaking%20Stone\"&gt;Speaking Stone&lt;/a&gt; to your left. Activate it, and an image of Clivia Tharn and &lt;a href=\"General%20Valerius\"&gt;General Valerius&lt;/a&gt; will appear:\nGeneral Valerius: \"Empress Regent, I arrived as soon as I could. How can the Imperial Legion serve, your highness?\"\nClivia Tharn: \"General Valerius, I need you to spare me a regiment of your elite.\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"I... of course, but for what purpose? The Imperial City is crawling with Daedra.\"\nClivia Tharn: \"Just a single regiment. Have them report personally to me. I require the upmost secrecy about this. They will serve in your name.\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"As you wish, Empress Regent.\"\nContinue through the passageway and enter the door labeled \"Shattered Void.\" Within, you will see a large amount of floating debris, with thunderclouds in the sky. Walk forward and you will be greeted by hostile &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Winged Twilights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grievous%20Twilight\"&gt;Grievous Twilight&lt;/a&gt;s. Sister Terran Arminus will say, \"Ready yourself! Daedra are coming through!\" After defeating the initial group, she will say, \"Prepare for battle!\" as even more appear alongside a Dremora Morikyn. She will then say, \"My spell has revealed the rifts. Destroy them!\" After doing so, enter the door to the north labeled \"Imperial Battlemage Quarters.\"\nIn the Imperial Battlemage Quarters, walk up a staircase and approach the second Speaking Stone. Activate it and listen to the resulting conversation between Clivia Tharn and General Valerius:\nClivia Tharn: \"General! I'm certain that you have plenty to do today, how can I help you?\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"My officers report you requested Legion members directed to your personal service. May I ask why? Do you intend to feed them to the Daedra as well?\"\nClivia Tharn: \"Mind your tone, I already apologised for the incident. I am no strategist, but your men did not die in vain.\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"I won't grant this request.\"\nClivia Tharn: \"It's an order from your Empress, general.\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"With all due respect\u2014\"\nClivia Tharn: \"I know of the personal posting you made, general. Wasn't your daughter injured in a recent attack?\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"Is that a threat? The healers say we can't risk moving her out of the city, and those guards\u2014\"\nClivia Tharn: \"Are the only thing keeping the Daedra away from your landship, but they're also a waste of military resources. I'd be happy to leave them be if you cooperate. Consider it.\"\nAfterwards, go forward and to the door on your left. Within the next room, you will have to fight several &lt;a href=\"Spiderling%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spiderlings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Then, enter a doorway on the western side of the chamber and kill the spiderling, Xivkyn Bulwark, and Spider Daedra in the hallway. Go down the hall southeast and kill the two Crematorial Guards you encounter. Then, go up the staircase and enter the door labeled \"Shattered Void.\"\nThere, Sister Terran Arminus will say, \"The Planemeld is as majestic as it is terrible. I guess it's mostly just terrible. To arms! The Daedra are coming!\" Several Dremora Morikyn, spiderlings, and Dremora Sunderers will have to be killed in this area. Sister Terran Arminus will continue, \"The Elder Scroll was right about you. Let's move!\" Go through the gate to the northwest and walk up the ramp to the right. Another Crematorial Guard will be in the way. After killing it, Sister Terran Arminus will say, \"Stay calm. Everything you see is just your mind trying to make sense of merging realities.\" Farther along the path is &lt;a href=\"The%20Scion%20of%20Wroth\"&gt;The Scion of Wroth&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt; which must also be killed.\nAfter defeating it, Sister Terran Arminus will begin talking to Clivia Tharn, who can be seen through the gate behind The Scion of Wroth. Clivia will activate a pedestal at the center of the next area and the &lt;a href=\"Inhibitor%20Pinion\"&gt;Inhibitor Pinion&lt;/a&gt; will appear from it. Additionally, a fireball will emerge from the pedestal, revealed to be a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"The%20Planar%20Inhibitor\"&gt;The Planar Inhibitor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSister Terran Arminus: \"This won't end well for you, your majesty. Leave the scroll. Stop this!\"\nClivia Tharn: \"You underestimate me, wretch!\"\nWhen this happens, speak to Sister Terran Arminus. She will say, \"The portal ahead will take you to the Tower's top, to Clivia and the Dark Anchor. You must face her before she completes her work!\" Then turn around and fight The Planar Inhibitor, who will say, \"I will burn your very souls!\" and \"Come! Face darkness and flame!\" In combat, she will say, \"How much can you endure?,\" \"Let the heat take you!,\" and \"Your will, against my flame!\"\nSister Terran Arminus will then say, \"She's calling for help! Attack the rifts!\" The Planar Inhibitor will release flames and say, \"All will perish here!,\" \"There are flames enough for all!,\" and \"Nowhere to run, mortal!\" The Planar Inhibitor will then engage with another attack of multiple flames in concentrated areas, saying, \"Become one with the fire of Coldharbour!\" \"Succumb to flame and shadow!,\" \"Weep in Coldharbour's light!,\" and \"Embrace my flame!\"\nLater, The Planar Inhibitor will release blue flames and say, \"Test your flesh against my flame!,\" \"Writhe in my flame!,\" \"Dance with me!,\" and \"Nothing will remain of you!\" Sister Terran Arminus will shout, \"My spell has revealed the rifts! Destroy them!\" After a number of attacks, the Planar Inhibitor will fall to the ground and stop fighting temporarily. At this time, she will say, \"I can't control it!\" She will quickly get up again and resume combat, after which point Sister Terran Arminus will say, \"There! Attack the rifts, she calls her allies!\"\nIf you are killed, The Planar Inhibitor will say, \"White-Gold belongs to Molag Bal. All Towers will follow!\" and \"White-Gold has fallen. Existence itself will follow.\" She will also say, \"You, and all of mortalkind will be forgotten.\" However, when she is eventually defeated, she will shout, \"I'll remember this!\" and \"Death won't stop me!\" Sister Terran Arminus will follow it up with, \"After her! The time has come. You must face her before she slays us all!\"\nJust after killing The Planar Inhibitor, or at the Pinnacle of the White-Gold Tower, speak to Sister Terran Arminus again. She will have the following dialogue:\n\"It's time for you to face Clivia Tharn. I don't know what stake she has in this, but it can't be in the Empire's interest. You'll find her through the portal ahead, at the top of the White-Gold Tower. Divines go with you. And my cat.\"\nAfterwards, go through the door behind her labeled \"Imperial Regent's Quarters.\" Inside, go up the staircase and defeat the spiderlings, Spider Daedra, and Crematorial Guard that appear around the bend. Continue and fight off yet another Crematorial Guard. Then, enter the doorway to the north and kill the Xivkyn Bulwark, Xivkyn Flagellant, and Xivkyn Lacerator inside. After doing this, activate the third Speaking Stone in the room. Another image of Clivia Tharn and General Valerius will appear:\nGeneral Valerius: \"Empress Regent, these troops movements, they're nonsensical.\"\nClivia Tharn: \"They are necessary. The Waterfront District must be defended.\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"Empress, that district holds no strategic value. You'd be sending these men to die for nothing.\"\nClivia Tharn: \"Why do you continue to oppose me?\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"Why do you insist on playing general? I must refuse this, Empress.\"\nClivia Tharn: \"Than the Elder Council will hear about the extra postings, your questionable command decisions.\"\nGeneral Valerius: \"Get in line.\"\nClivia Tharn: \"This means war, general.\"\nThere is also an \"&lt;a href=\"Investigation%20Note\"&gt;Investigation Note&lt;/a&gt;\" on the ground. Reading it will reveal that General Valerius may now be dead, and that a member of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; set up these Speaking Stones to capture evidence of Clivia Tharn's \"erratic\" behavior. Head through the eastern doorway and fight the Crematorial Guard there. Then, travel up the staircase and enter the door labeled \"White-Gold Tower Pinnacle.\"\nOnce through the door, walk up the hill toward the Dark Anchor. You can speak to Sister Terran Arminus now, and she will repeat the same dialogue about you having to face Clivia Tharn on your own if you had spoken to her right after defeating The Planar Inhibitor. After speaking to her, activate the glowing portal to the left of her. You will be transported to the very top of the White-Gold Tower, where you will finally face off against Clivia Tharn.\nAt the pinnacle, you will see four &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Aspect\"&gt;Lightning Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s directing energy toward the center of the tower, where a &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn\"&gt;Xivkyn&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Kena\"&gt;Molag Kena&lt;/a&gt; is standing. She will soon say, \"Do you fools still believe you're dealing with Clivia Tharn? She is as lost to you as the White-Gold Tower! Lord Bal, I have the Elder Scroll! The Planemeld Obverse begins!\" She will then hit the ground with her staff, sending a shockwave out in all directions. Kill the Lightning Aspects surrounding her and then begin fighting Molag Kena herself.\nDuring the battle, Molag Kena will say, \"Run for your lives!,\" \"Reduce the mortals to dust!,\" \"You cannot stop Lord Bal's will!,\" \"Silence the mortals!,\" \"Kneel!,\" \"My light will feast on your flesh!,\" \"Die!,\" \"Kill them!,\" \"Give up! Embrace my light!,\" and \"Be gone!\" After Molag Kena has been defeated, Sister Terran Arminus will say, \"I waited as long as I could before opening this portal. The scroll said I'd be skewered if... nevermind. I'll take this. Follow me!\" She will then walk to the center of the pinnacle and be lifted up into the air, traveling through the portal. Activate the portal yourself to exit the tower.\nYou will reappear in a pool of water in Green Emperor Way, where Imperial Infantry and Imperial Menders may be found alongside Sister Terran Arminus. \"&lt;a href=\"Terran%27s%20Notes\"&gt;Terran's Notes&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found by her side. When you speak to her in order to complete the quest, she will have the following dialogue:\n\"I'm sorry you had to face her alone. I read in the Scroll there would have been ... consequences for me had I gotten involved in that battle. Had to time that portal just right!\"\nAfter completing the quest, Sister Terran Arminus will have some additional dialogue:\n\"White-Gold belongs to the to the Empire again, but there's much work left to do. Where has the true Clivia gone? I must speak to the Imperial generals. They'll be ... interested to know a Daedra has been leading them. So many questions left to ask.\""}

Oblivion is an extension of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and is considered the dualistic inverse of &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, the utopian afterlife.\nThere are sixteen planes in total with each Daedric Prince presiding over one. However, it should be noted that the \"planes\" of Oblivion are actually just different places in one larger plane. Although most are extremely dangerous and nearly inhospitable to mortals, they differ in shape and size according to the ruling Prince. For example, the Plane of Oblivion that is encountered by the player in is the domain of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of destruction. In the expansion, the player is allowed access to Sheogorath's Plane of Oblivion known as the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Some Planes of Oblivion, such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Pits\"&gt;The Pits&lt;/a&gt;, are encountered during &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the one for &lt;a href=\"Peryite%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccessing Oblivion.\nOblivion Gates.\nThe only way to reach Oblivion from &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; is through &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s that are scattered throughout the game world. The chances for an Oblivion gate to spawn is mostly determined by what point in the main storyline you have reached. For example, there is a 0% chance for an Oblivion gate to spawn in front of Bruma at the very beginning of the game, but a 100% chance for it to spawn during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Bruma%20Gate\"&gt;Bruma Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\" However, there are some individuals who have the technology and arcane ability to construct a gate to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt; was able to construct a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valerica%27s%20Study\"&gt;her study&lt;/a&gt;. She was able to power and sustain the portal using &lt;a href=\"soul%20gem%20shards\"&gt;soul gem shards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"finely%20ground%20bone%20meal\"&gt;finely ground bone meal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"purified%20void%20salts\"&gt;purified void salts&lt;/a&gt;, and even a sample of her own blood.\nClosing a gate.\nIn order to close an Oblivion gate the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; must first enter it into the Plane of Oblivion. There, a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt; must be removed from the &lt;a href=\"Sigilum%20Sanguis\"&gt;Sigilum Sanguis&lt;/a&gt; (a room which is always at the topmost part of the largest tower in that particular area). Afterwards, the Hero and their companions are safely teleported back to Tamriel.\nRituals.\nAs outlined by the glyphs within \"&lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; can enter Oblivion with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts\"&gt;Daedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt; and the blood of an &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; entity. During the Oblivion Crisis, the last Septim &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; used his knowledge of Daedric occultism to perform the ritual with &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; and the blood of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; left on his breastplate.\nMeditation.\nAccording to the transcripts of &lt;a href=\"Morian%20Zenas\"&gt;Morian Zenas&lt;/a&gt;'s apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Seif-ij%20Hidja\"&gt;Seif-ij Hidja&lt;/a&gt;, the conjurer was able to enter a deep trance-like meditative state where he could mentally travel through the Planes of Oblivion, without his physical body entering the realms. The text also describes that the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; developed powerful &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;telepathic magic&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to communicate with beings in Oblivion, as well as there. Specifically, the Psijics knew of a place called &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;The Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt;, where travel into Oblivion was made possible, without an Oblivion Gate. &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, Nematigh, Morain Zenas himself, and many, many others traversed the veil and entered the realms in The Dreaming Cave."}

While most of them are in the realm of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; (also known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;\") the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20princes\"&gt;Daedric princes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Boethia\"&gt;Boethia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; have their own which the Hero may enter as part of their quests.\nThe Planes of Oblivion associated with the main quest are eponymously named such (except for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wayward%20Knight\"&gt;The Wayward Knight&lt;/a&gt;\" quest), while random ones found in the wilderness appear as \"Wastes of Oblivion\" on the map. For Daedric quests, the \"&lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20Boethia\"&gt;Realm of Boethia&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Pits\"&gt;Realm of Peryite&lt;/a&gt;\" are named respectively. With the exception of the Daedric quests, there is no apparent significance to the different names given to the landscape.\nIn most Oblivion worlds (except for those associated with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Quests%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric quests&lt;/a&gt;), the central tower is the objective. At the top of that tower is a room containing a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;; which once removed the Oblivion gate will close, and the Hero will be transported back to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. These realms consist of a relatively large ash-covered island surrounded by a sea of impassable lava.\nRegions.\nExterior.\nThe landscapes of Planes of Oblivion are largely hazardous, often a maze of lava pools, cliffs and rockslides. Plants such as &lt;a href=\"Bloodgrass\"&gt;Bloodgrass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harrada%20Root\"&gt;Harrada Root&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spiddal%20Stick\"&gt;Spiddal Stick&lt;/a&gt;s can be found growing here, though the latter two are hostile. Level-dependent &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; will periodically spawn. &lt;a href=\"Fleshy%20Pod\"&gt;Fleshy Pod&lt;/a&gt; containers found either on the ground or hanging from various rocks surfaces and structures contain potions, gold and random loot.\nVarious traps can also be found on the surface as well, including Claws, Avalanches, Fire Turrets and Land Mines.\nCaves.\nSome random Oblivion worlds contain cave sequences whose sections are randomly selected from a large series of possible caves, divided into three zones. Each cave section consists of a single entrance and a single exit. These go under many names including: \"The Hate Tunnels\", \"Worm Gut Channels\", \"Molten Halls\", \"The Fume Vaults\", \"Mire of Ash\", and \"The Scratch Paths\".\nThe Sigil Keep.\nEvery Random Oblivion Plane contains a tower that serves as the citadel of that world, the \"Sigil Keep\". The Hero will eventually have to visit this tower in order to close the Oblivion Gate they have entered. This tower contains the Sigil Stone that keeps the Oblivion Gate open. The Sigil Keep is generally the largest of the towers and can often be recognized by the yellow light emanating from the Sigillum Sanguis at the top of the tower.\nThe basic layout for this type of tower consists of a tall open base that leads almost to the top, afterwards one must pass through various hallways that circle around the base of the tower to reach the top. At the top there are two doors leading to the Sigillum Sanguis at the top of the tower. The base of the tower consists of a tall spire. Apart from the ground floor, there are various platforms attached to the walls. In the middle the Hero can find a pool of lava with a fire pillar leading upwards (to the Sigillum Sanguis). Coming into contact with the pillar or the pool of lava results in instant death.\nNon-Random Sigil Keeps.\nA number of Sigil Keeps can only be found in a specific Oblivion World. Entering the Sigil Keep in that specific world will always end up in a predetermined tower. The towers are:\nRandom Sigil Keeps.\nThe outside is that of a generic Sigil Keep. Its interior differs per visit.\nRandom towers are a set of Sigil Keeps from which one is selected randomly when entering a Sigil Keep from Oblivion Worlds 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7. The specific tower is only selected (randomly) when entering the \"Tower Portal\" door. After that the door will always lead to the selected tower.\nThe Hero determines the tower they have entered by the name that appears with the interior map:\nHallways.\nThe number of additional hallways in the tower vary between 1 and 3. They are can be named either \"Rending Halls, Corridors of Dark Salvation, Dead Halls\" or \"Desolations End\". The hallways usually consist of corridors leading upwards and are home to a number of hostile Daedra, as well as traps, located in the rooms that connect the various corridors. Typically located within are special activatable objects known as \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fountain\"&gt;Blood Fountain&lt;/a&gt;s\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Magicka%20Essences\"&gt;Magicka Essences&lt;/a&gt;\", which restore &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nSigillum Sanguis.\nThe uppermost room in the main tower is called the Sigillum Sanguis. This is where the Sigil Stone that serves as the anchor for the Oblivion Gate to Tamriel is kept. Removing the stone will cause the gate to permanently close and the tower to be destroyed. The Sigillum Sanguis is always located at the top of the Sigil Keep and is always guarded by Dremora. Within can also be found &lt;a href=\"The%20Punished%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Punished&lt;/a&gt;, containers with house high-quality loot.\nFlora.\nBloodgrass.\nFound growing abundantly throughout the wastes, &lt;a href=\"Bloodgrass\"&gt;Bloodgrass&lt;/a&gt; is a dark-red plant that grows to about 2-3 feet tall and is the only known flora of its kind to survive on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; even after an Oblivion Gate has been closed. It is completely non-hostile and acquiring a sample is a simple matter of activating the plant like an other.\nHarrada Root.\n&lt;a href=\"Harrada%20Root\"&gt;Harrada Root&lt;/a&gt;s are located both on the ground and hangings from walls and cliffsides. When approached, they will lash-out in the direction of the Hero, dealing moderate damage with each strike. Collecting a specimen without being harmed may require quick timing and exploiting its \"blind-spot\" on the opposite end of its growth where it tendrils cannot reach.\nSpiddal Sticks.\nOn the surface, &lt;a href=\"Spiddal%20Stick\"&gt;Spiddal Stick&lt;/a&gt;s appear like any ordinary flower, but in proximity releases a yellow gas that &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Speed\"&gt;drains speed&lt;/a&gt;. While more of an annoyance then a genuine threat, it effects can stack, making combat in and around them problematic. However some Spiddal Sticks are \"dead\" in that they slouch towards the ground and do not emit poison. These can be safely harvested from without apprehension.\nMana Bloom.\nThe Mana Bloom is an extremely rare flower, found only in &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;. They come in blue and purples varieties, giving the ingredients &lt;a href=\"Lichor\"&gt;Lichor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambrosia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ambrosia&lt;/a&gt; when gathered from, respectively. Unlike most alchemical components, these have only one effect each \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restore Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restore Health&lt;/a&gt;. They are perfectly harmless.\nFauna.\nThe creatures that the Hero encounters within Planes of Oblivion are always hostile level-dependent &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dremora&lt;/a&gt;:\nScamp.\nSmall creatures with an affinity to flame, the &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt; casts a basic fire damage spell called &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt; and attacks with its claws. They are encountered between Levels 1-10 and are only really a danger in groups. The Stunted Scamp is weaker and smaller version of the Scamp. They drop the alchemical ingredient &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20Skin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Scamp Skin&lt;/a&gt;.\nClannfear.\n&lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt; are feral reptiloid with a heavy strike and reflect damage ability, making them especially deadly to melee fighters. They are also resistant to fire. Clannfear Runts are a smaller and weaker version that does not drop &lt;a href=\"clannfear%20claws\"&gt;clannfear claws&lt;/a&gt;. They begin to appear between levels 5 and 10, except during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Siege of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; quest where they will always spawn regardless.\nFlame Atronach.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt; resembles a faceless humanoid female in body structure, covered in flame. The begin to spawn around level 10. They prefer to cast &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire bolts&lt;/a&gt; from a distance but are capable of &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;hand-to-hand&lt;/a&gt; combat as well. Although their melee attacks are fairly weak, they can punch rapidly. They are most easily dispatched with &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ice magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaedroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; are large, bipedal alligator-like creatures. In battle, they prefers to slash at opponents with their mighty jaws and huge, hooked claws. The also know the spells \"Fiery Breath\" (&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt; 20pts in 5ft on target) and \"Daedroth Shield \" (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Oblivion%20Spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; 20pts for 45sec on self). They have a natural 33% &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpider Daedra.\nWhile traditionally associated with &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt; also appears to serve Mehrunes Dagon as well during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. They are quite fast, using &lt;a href=\"Shock%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; spells, &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; spells, &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; spit and melee attacks. In combat they summon &lt;a href=\"Spiderling\"&gt;Spiderling&lt;/a&gt;s, smaller and weaker version of themselves with a &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt; attack. They drop &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Silk\"&gt;Daedra Silk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Venin\"&gt;Daedra Venin&lt;/a&gt; and start appearing around level 17.\nStorm Atronach.\nMade up of a swirling vortex of stone and kept together with magic, the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt; is the most powerful of all &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, having the most powerful close range attack and the longest reach. They also use both a &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shock Bolt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shocking%20Touch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shock Touch&lt;/a&gt; spell, &lt;a href=\"Reflect%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;reflect&lt;/a&gt; melee damage, immunity to shock themselves and a high rate of attack. Their only weakness appears to be ranged attacks. Once destroyed they will drop &lt;a href=\"Void%20Salts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Void Salts&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrost Atronach.\nGiant blue-white crystalline figures, the &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; unlike other daedra will not appear normally in the Deadlands but instead found in Mankar Camaron's Paradise. While strong, they are also quite slow. They know the spells \"Freezing Touch\" (Frost Damage 5pts for 5sec + 15pts on Touch) \"Atronach Frostbolt\" (Frost Damage 20pts on Target) and \"Freezing Heal\" (Restore Health 25pts for 2sec on Self.). Like all atronachs, they are immune to spells of their own alignment. At 40+pts melee, they are tied with Daedroth for having the highest unarmed attack. &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Salts&lt;/a&gt; may be gathered from their bodies.\nXivilai.\n&lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt; are monstrous, brutish beings, vaguely anthropomorphic in appearance. They have bluish skin, with red markings in their arms and legs. Their white eyes glow and they have black, mane-like hair with horns that protrude from their forehead. They usually carry a powerful axe or sword, ranging from &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;. The cast various spells including &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Ball&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Clannfear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Summon Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;. They also have a chance to &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt; any spell cast at them.\nDremora.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main article&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTraps.\nAvalanche.\nDistinguished by light brown rocks lying on the top of a nearby hill. When set off, a rumbling sound will be heard and the screen will shake, afterward the rocks will come tumbling down. Each rock does 10 points of damage.\nClaw Trap.\nSmall curved bone spikes bend vertically on both sides of the path. It main purpose is to block movement, although with a reasonable level in &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; they are easy to circumvent. The spikes themselves do no damage.\nClaw Lever.\nA yellow, claw-shaped lever placed on the wall. When pulled, the trap linked to the claw lever will be set off, resetting a few seconds after. Whether it has any effect to pull it again depends on the trap linked to, usually either the Citadel Guillotine Blade or Citadel Trident Blade.\nCitadel Guillotine Blade.\nThe guillotine is a huge blade perpendicular to the hallway, with yellow edges mounted on the ceiling. Unusual grooves, creases, or gaps can be found in the wall. When triggered, the blade will quickly descend. When the blade reaches \nthe ground, the screen will shake and a loud crashing sound will follow. The blade will stay down for a few seconds, and then slowly rise up again. Being struck by the blade causes 20 + 1.5 \u00d7 level damage. It will always remain active and cannot be disabled\nCitadel Spikes.\nLocated vertically on the walls of citadels, they are triggered in the target area will make spikes fly out of the holes, causing 20 + 1.5 \u00d7 level damage. After this trap has reset, it will take five seconds to re-arm.\nCitadel Trident Blade.\nA large, claw-like mechanism in the ceiling, usually near the entrance of a wide hall. Being struck by the swinging blade will cause 25 + 1.5 \u00d7 level damage. They will only release a single time.\nFire Turret.\nLarge pillars with spinning mechanisms on the top, these sentries attack with slow moving fiery projectiles which have an area effect that can be absorbed and resisted, but not reflected. They are unable to fire at their base and will only ever target the Hero. They are always active and cannot be disarmed in anyway.\nLand Mine.\nThese small, claw-like mechanisms embedded in the ground are triggered by proximity, doing Leveled &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt; within 14 ft. for 5 seconds. The effect cannot be absorbed or reflected, but can be resisted. They can be disarmed with a melee attack, detonated with a ranged one, set off and ran from or avoided entirely."}

It is a gold plate used for holding &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; and it can normally be found with different types of food on it.\nLocations.\nPlatters can be found in many different places in Skyrim. Amongst the common places are keeps, palaces and &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;houses&lt;/a&gt;. One particular place is &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, which has numerous assorted &lt;a href=\"Plate%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;plates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;goblets&lt;/a&gt;, and platters.

If the Dragonborn picks up the platter and places it flat against a wall, with the bottom of the platter facing towards them, they can walk into it and they will push through the wall. This can be used in many different ways such as, going through locked doors and getting to the \"Do Not Delete\" chests under shops.\nThis can also be exploited to pass through doors that require a key. One such exploit is in &lt;a href=\"Gyldenhul%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Gyldenhul Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, where the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Deathbrand%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Deathbrand&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0takes place. The room with the Cursed Treasure (see the Deathbrand quest link for more info) is locked, and requires a key. Before going through, the Dragonborn needs to have at least three platters in their Inventory. This is because the second is for getting out, door will still be locked, and the third will be when the metal gate lowers when the gold is activated. Using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; makes the glitch less tedious, as sometimes it can be stubborn.\nExploits.\nThe following is a list of areas that can be visited via the \"Platter Glitch\" that would normally be restricted or blocked. Note that while the list may not include every single area, it includes the most important and interesting spots."}

He cannot leave without his gear though; he mentions having buried it all by the levee, and will ask you to retrieve it. \nKnarstygg's Helm will be buried just south of your current location. It will be next to a hole in the wall, by a dead crocodile. Head northeast along the coast to find Knarstygg's Axe, which will be by the hole in the levee that looks out on &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon%20Dolmen\"&gt;Gavaudon Dolmen&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Knarstygg's Armor will be even further to the northeast, at the end of the levee. Once you have all of these, return to Knarstygg to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Predator%27s%20Heart\"&gt;A Predator's Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Written in celebration of the Battle of Hunding Bay, which marked the return of all human kingdoms to the unchallenged rule of the Cyrodilic Emperor, this pamphlet seeks to briefly describe the present provinces of the Empire and the surrounding regions-- their history, people and current condition. We strove to balance timeliness with accuracy and completeness; if we have erred in our zeal to place this valuable guide in the hands of interested citizens everywhere, we beg the kind reader's indulgence.\nThe Empire stretches across Tamriel, the largest known continent of the World. To the north of Tamriel is Atmora, from whence the Men of the World came. To the west is Yokuda, the lost native land of the Redguards. To the east is Akavir, whose armies invaded Tamriel in the previous era. To the south all is mystery and the whisper of a lost Elven homeland.\nTamriel itself is generally divided into eight major regions: Skyrim, Cyrodiil, High Rock, the Aldmeri Dominion of the Summerset Isles and Valenwood, Hammerfell, Morrowind, and the Elsweyr Confederacy. Some of these, such as Morrowind or Skyrim, have historically been unified into kingdoms; others, such as High Rock or Elsweyr, are looser groupings of many kingdoms, chiefdoms, village confederations, and so forth, united under a dominant race or culture. At its zenith, the Second Empire formally organized these disparate groups into the Imperial Provinces, which were administered by provincial governors, either dispatched directly from Cyrodiil or appointed from the native populations. (Morrowind is a notable exception, having never been conquered by the original Cyrodilic Empire and, thus escaping investment as an Imperial Province.). With the fall of the Cyrodilic Empire, control reverted to the individual rulers of each province, resulting in centuries of chaos, as many of the provinces devolved into independent kingdoms and petty statelets. Now, happily, all of the human kingdoms have been recovered by the Third Empire of Tiber Septim, and once again they all bear the proud title of Imperial Provinces.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion, the Elsweyr Confederacy, and Morrowind have yet to join the Empire, but are described in this book for the edification of the scholar, the fascination of the common citizen, and the preparation of the soldier. The Third Empire is yet in its youth, and who can predict what new horizons might yet greet the dawn under the Red Diamond Banner?\nSome regions escape provincial classification due to the primitive civilization of their beastfolk inhabitants. Collectively, these beastfolk 'states' are known as the Wild Regions, which may or may not be of interest to the Emperor. They are included only for the most intrepid of travelers, and to throw the achievements of Civilization into more brilliant relief by contrast with these benighted corners of Tamriel.\nNow, citizen, we entreat you to review our modest survey of the Empire's dominions. If it entertains and edifies, reflect not upon the humble labors of this scribe, but on the gracious benevolence of our beloved Emperor, whose very name is as ambrosia upon our tongues, who in his wisdom has ordained that this survey be created and distributed among the earnest and wise people of Tamriel, that they might better understand the glories and challenges of these Lands and Dominions, and that they might better appreciate the great burdens of rulership he bears in our names with such fortitude.\nA note on Elven designations: The Elves as a whole are sometimes referred to as the 'Aldmeri,' or 'the Elder Races.' Their individual pedigrees are likewise referred to by both their human and Aldmeri names; thus, High Elves are the 'Altmer,' Dark Elves the 'Dunmer,' Wood Elves the 'Bosmer,' etc., etc. 'Mer' is also used to denote a single Elf. Words that designate an Elven member of a profession or trade can therefore correctly be said as 'craftsmer,' for example, or 'noblemer.'"}

{"id": "16986", "revid": "53330232", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16986", "title": "Poison (Oblivion)", "text": "A poison is a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;damages&lt;/a&gt; one or more statistics over time. Poisons can applied to &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; for offensive use. Poisonous toxins can be removed from the body by allowing it to wear off, by casting a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;cures&lt;/a&gt; it, or by drinking a &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cure Poison&lt;/a&gt; potion.\nImmunities.\n&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and certain creatures are immune to poisons, though rare ingredients such as raw &lt;a href=\"Poisoned%20Apple\"&gt;Poisoned Apple&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"chokeberries\"&gt;chokeberries&lt;/a&gt; may bypass any poison resistance.\nMechanics and menus.\nPoisons can be made through &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. A potion with only negative effects counts as a poison and can be applied to equipped weapons. These potions are green in the inventory, and can be used to inflict extra health damage or other negative effects. With a melee weapon, the poison is only effective after a successful attack. If it is applied to a bow it remains in effect for a single arrow regardless of success. Poisons will always generate the same effects no matter what type of weapon they are applied to. Poisoned weapons appear with a green teardrop beside their icon in the item menu.\nStrategies for making poisons.\nPoisons should be thought of as more of a mass-manufacturing process than an effort to make single, very powerful potions. Although potions employing &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Damage Health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Damage Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Fatigue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Damage Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; would procure the best results in combat, such a poison would chiefly be used against a boss rather than the typical enemy\u00a0that may be\u00a0encountered. Given the rarity of true boss characters in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the bulk of poisons a player manufactures will be used against common &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, it is wise to make many simple damage health poisons instead of a few potent multi-effect poisons. At higher alchemy levels - even with poor equipment - poisons quickly become very deadly.\nDamage health.\nMass-producing damage health poisons is a straightforward process. For lower-level alchemists, &lt;a href=\"Nightshade%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt; is ideal. Particularly abundant in the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Irony\"&gt;Fort Irony&lt;/a&gt;, Nightshade is common all over Cyrodiil, with the exception of the mountains and swamps. Gathering up a large supply of Nightshade is useful, as it can act as a base for other more exotic damage health ingredients such as &lt;a href=\"Harrada%20Root\"&gt;Harrada Root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stinkhorn%20Cap\"&gt;Stinkhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20Stalk%20Caps\"&gt;Wisp Stalk Caps&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the expansion, it is possible to create an extremely strong poison by using\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ogre%27s%20Teeth\"&gt;Ogre's Teeth&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ectoplasm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bone%20Marrow\"&gt;Bone Marrow&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Salts&lt;/a&gt;. With all Master-level Alchemy tools and being level 100 in Alchemy it is possible for this poison to do over 900 damage.\nAt the Expert level.\nOnce at expert level, making poisons becomes very simple. The &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt; is home to many good sources of poison ingredients, including &lt;a href=\"Peony%20Seeds\"&gt;Peony Seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Tongue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dragon's Tongue&lt;/a&gt;. The vineyards just west of &lt;a href=\"Skingrad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; are the greatest single source of &lt;a href=\"crops\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; in all of Cyrodiil, and grapes have a damage health effect. Combine them with &lt;a href=\"Flax%20Seeds\"&gt;flax&lt;/a&gt;, a very common and colorful plant that grows nearly everywhere, and\u00a0poisons can be\u00a0mass-produced on a nearly limitless scale. The poisons will be very simple, but the sheer number of them will make short work of nearly any vulnerable enemy.\nNirnroot poisons.\nThe only ingredient compatible with &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Unrefined%20Greenmote\"&gt;Unrefined Greenmote&lt;/a&gt;, which, when mixed into a poison with Nirnroot, creates a potent poison that &lt;a href=\"Drain%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;drains&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fatigue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;.\nUndead.\nIt is important to have back-up methods of fighting, as poisons are ineffective against the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, and various other resistant enemies such as &lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Will-o-the-Wisps&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "988267", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=988267", "title": "Poison Song", "text": "The Poison Song is a book series in and .\nContents.\nBook I.\nIt was beginning again. Even though everything seemed serene (the last embers crackling in the hearth; young servant girl and her child slumbering in a chair by the door; a tapestry half-finished against the wall, waiting to be completed tomorrow; one of the moons visible through a milky cloud outside the window; a lone bird, out of sight in the rafters, cooing placidly), Tay heard the first chords of the Song strike dissonantly somewhere far away.\nThe bird in the rafters croaked and took flight through the window. The baby in the girl's arms woke and began to scream. The Song swelled in intensity, yet still remained subtle and stately in tempo. The movement of everything seemed to take on the rhythm of the music as if strange choreography had been staged: the girl rising to the window, the clouds reflecting back red from the inferno below, her scream, all muted, consumed by the Song. Everything that came thereafter Tay had seen so many times, it had almost ceased to be a nightmare.\nHe did not remember anything of his life before coming to the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, but he understood that there was something different in his past that set him apart from his cousins. It wasn't simply that his parents were dead. His cousin Baynarah's parents had also died in the War. Nor were the other Housemen on Gorne or nearby &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; unusually cruel to him. They treated him with the same polite indifference that any &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; has for every other eight-year-old boy that got underfoot.\nBut somehow, with absolutely certainty, Tay knew he was alone. Different. Because of a Song he always heard, and his nightmares.\n\u201cYou're certainly imaginative,\u201d his aunt Ulliah would smile patiently, before waving him away so she could return to her scriptures and chores.\n\u201cDifferent? Everyone in the world thinks they're 'different,' that's what makes it such a common sentiment,\u201d said his older cousin Kalkorith who was studying to be &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; priest and had a firm grasp on paradoxes.\n\u201cIf you tell anyone else that you keep hearing music where there's no music to be heard, they'll call you mad and bury you in the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d his uncle Triffith would snarl, before striding away to attend his business.\nOnly his nursemaid Edebah would listen to him seriously, and just nod with a faint look of pride. But she would never say another word.\nHis cousin and chief playmate Baynarah was by far the least interested in the stories of his Song and his dreams.\n\"How tiresome you are with all this, Tay,\" said Baynarah, after luncheon the summer of his eighth year. He, she, and a younger cousin Vaster walked into a clearing in the midst of flowering trees. The grass was very low, barely up to their ankles, and there were big black piles of leaves from the previous autumn. \u201cNow, shall we get back to it? What shall we play?\"\nTay thought for a moment. \"We could play the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"What's that?\" asked Vaster, their constant companion, three years their junior.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was the home of the orcs, off in the Wrothgarian Mountains. For hundreds of years, it kept growing bigger and bigger and bigger. The orcs would come down out of the mountains and rape and pillage all over &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. And then, King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; and someone else, I forget, from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; all joined together against Orsinium. For thirty years they fought and fought. Orsinium had walls made out of iron and, try as they might, they couldn't break through.\"\n\"So what happened?\" asked Baynarah.\n\"You're so good at making up things that never happened, why don't you make it up?\"\nSo they did. Tay was the King of the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, perched up in a tree they called Orsinium. Baynarah and Vaster played King Joile and Gaiden Shinji and they threw pebbles and sticks up at Tay while he taunted them in his most guttural voice. The three decided that the Goddess &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; (played by Baynarah in dual role) answered the prayers of Gaiden Shinji and drenched Orsinium in a torrent of rain. The walls rusted and dissolved. On cue, Tay obligingly fell from the tree and let King Joile and Gaiden Shinji mangle him with their enchanted blades.\nFor the most of that summer, the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20675\"&gt;675&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, Tay was nearly insensible by the power of the sun. There were no clouds, but it rained most every night, so the vegetation on the island of Gorne was bewildering lush. The stones themselves seemed to glow with sunlight, and the ditches burned with white meadowsweet and parsleydown; all around him were soft smells of flower and tree untroubled by wind; the foliage was purple green, blue green, ash green, white green. The wide cupolas, twisting cobbled streets, and thatched roofs of the little village of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, and massive bleached rock of &lt;a href=\"Sandil%20House\"&gt;Sandil House&lt;/a&gt; all were magical to him.\nYet the dreams haunted his nights and the Song continued whether he was awake or not.\nAgainst Aunt Ulliah's admonishments, Tay, Baynarah, and Vaster had breakfast outdoors every morning with the servants. Ulliah would hold an interior breakfast for herself and any visiting dignitaries: guests were rare, so she often ate alone. At first the servants would dine in silence, attempting gentility, but they broke down and would regale the children with gossip, reports, stories, and rumors.\n\"Poor Arnyle is laid up with a fever again.\"\n\"I'm telling you, they're cursed. The whole lot of 'em. Piss on the faerie and they piss right back on you.\"\n\"Doesn't Little Miss Starsia look, oh, just a wee bit tight around the belly region late-ly?\"\n\"She's not!\"\nThe only servant who didn't speak at all was Tay's nursemaid Edebah. She wasn't pretty like the other maids, but the scars on her face did not deform her. Her poorly set broken nose and her short hair gave her a certain alien mystique. She would merely quietly smile at the gossip, and look at Tay with almost frightening love and devotion.\nOne day, after breakfast, Baynarah whispered to Tay and Vaster, \"We have to go to the hills on the other side of the island.\"\nShe had used such imperatives before and always had something wonderful to show: a waterfall, tucked away behind ferns and tall rocks; a sunny grove of figs; a discreet still some peasants had set up; a sickly oak, twisted into a kneeling human figure; a collapsed stone wall that they imagined was thousands of years old, the last refuge of a doomed princess they named Merella.\nThe three walked across through the forest until they came to a clearing. A few hundred feet beyond, the meadow sank to a dry creek bed, filled with small, smooth stones. They followed that into the dark woods where trees canopied high over their heads. Sporadic red and yellow blossoms burst along the moist underbrush, but they became rarer and rarer as the children marched on under the umbrageous oaks and elms. The air crackled with birds ticking a staccato choral piece, a minor chord of the Song.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d asked Tay.\n\"\u201cIt's not where we're going, it's what we're going to see,\u201d replied Baynarah.\"\nThe forest surrounded the three children completely, bathed them in its tenebrous hues, and breathed on them with wet chirrups and sighs. It was easy for them to imagine that they were within a monster, walking along its twisted spine of stones.\nBaynarah scrambled up the steep hill and peered through the thick mass of shrub and tree. Tay lifted Vaster out of the creek bed and climbed out, gripping soft grass for support. There was no path through the forest here. Brambles and low hanging branches struck at them like the claws of chained beasts. The cries of the birds became ever more stentorious, as if angered at the invasion. One limb drew blood on Vaster's cheek, but he didn't cry out. Even Baynarah, who could pass like an ethereal creature through impenetrable forests, had a braid catch on a bramble, ruining the intricate pattern a servant had woven hours before. She paused to pull out the other braid, so her bright unruly tresses fell freely behind her. Now she was something wild, a nymph guiding the other two through her woodland domain. The Song began to beat like a wild pulse.\nThey were on a shelf of stone below a cliff overlooking a tremendous gorge, staring over an expanse of cinder. It looked like the scene of a tremendous battle, a holocaust of fire. Charred boxes, weaponry, animal bones, and detritus too annihilated to be identifiable littered the ground. Speechless, Tay and Vaster stepped into the black field. Baynarah smiled, proud that she had finally found something of true wonder and mystery.\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d asked Vaster at last.\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d Baynarah shrugged. \u201cI thought at first that it was some kind of ruin, but now I think it's a junk pile, just not like any junk pile I've ever seen. Just look at this stuff.\u201d\nThe three began an unorganized survey of the dusty mounds of refuse. Baynarah found a twisted sword only lightly blackened by flame and began polishing it to read the inscriptions on the blade. Vaster amused himself by breaking brittle boxes with his hands and feet, imagining himself a giant of unbelievable strength. A battered shield attracted Tay: there was something about it that reverberated with the sound of the Song. He pulled it out, and wiped its surface clean.\n\u201cI've never seen that crest before,\u201d said Baynarah, looking over Tay's shoulder.\n\u201cI think I have, but I don't remember,\u201d Tay whispered, trying to conjure the memory from his dreams. He was sure he had seen it there.\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d Vaster cried, interrupting Tay's thoughts. The boy was holding up a crystal orb. As his hand moved over the surface, brushing away grit and dust, a key in the Song rose which sent a shiver through Tay's entire body. Baynarah ran over to look at Vaster's treasure, but Tay felt paralyzed.\n\u201cWhere did you find that?\u201d she gasped, gazing into the swirl beneath the crystal surface.\n\u201cOver in that wagon,\u201d Vaster gestured toward a heap of blackened wood, barely discernible from the other piles but for its cart spokes. Baynarah began digging into the half-collapsed structure, so only her feet could be seen. The Song built in potency, sweeping over Tay. He began walking toward Vaster slowly.\n\u201cGive me that,\u201d he whispered in a voice he could barely recognize as his own.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Vaster whispered back, his eyes locked on the colors reflected in the heart of the globe. \u201cIt's mine.\u201d\nBaynarah dug through the remains of the wagon for several more minutes, but she could find no treasures like Vaster's. Most everything within was destroyed, and what remained was common-place by any standards: broken arrows, armor shards, guar bones. Frustrated, she pulled herself out into the sunlight.\nTay was alone, at the edge of the great gorge.\n\u201cWhere's Vaster?\u201d\nTay blinked and then turned back to his cousin with a shrug and a grin: \u201cHe went back to show everyone his new plunder. Did you find anything interesting?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Baynarah. \u201cWe probably ought to get back home before Vaster tells them anything that'll get us in trouble.\u201d\nTay and Baynarah started the walk back at a quick pace. Tay knew that Vaster would not be there when they got back. He would never be returning home again. The crystal globe rested snugly in Tay's satchel, hidden under a pile of junk he had picked up. With all his heart, he prayed for the Song to return and drown out the memory of the gorge and the long, silent fall down. The boy had been so surprised, he hadn't even time to scream.\n'I'm here. The Gorge will know me by Miz. And so will you.' said a voice inside Tay's head. 'You shall die as in the suffering slavery of Ann Marie...' Tay collapsed to the floor, unable to escape his uncontrolled terror 'Or... become a soldier, and you will become the most powerful, yet the most hated mortal in Tamriel.' After waking up a few moments after constant surroundings of the maids and Baynarath, Tay knew that he would be part of the siege. Tay heard the fading voice with the last words 'You. Are. Miz.'\n'What is to come is his inevitable, yet unpredictable fate. Through madness, therefore his corruption slowly builds, with the song.'\nBook II.\nTay felt no guilt, which frightened him. All through the long, fast walk away from the gorge, through the woods, across the dry creek bed, he chatted merrily with Baynarah, fully aware that he had just committed murder. Whenever his mind strayed from the conversation, and he thought back on the last moments of Vaster's short life, the Song would soar. He could not think of the boy's death, but Tay knew he was responsible.\n\u201cYou're a mess!\u201d cried Aunt Ulliah the moment she saw the two children emerging from the woods onto the grounds of Sandil House. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n\u201cDidn't Vaster already tell you?\u201d asked Tay.\nThe scene played itself out as Tay knew it would, every dancer in the Song performing their steps as choreographed. Aunt Ulliah saying that she had not seen Vaster. Baynarah, not yet frightened, making up an innocent lie about the threesome not having strayed far, saying he must have gotten lost. A slow but steady rhythm of panic intensifying as night began to fall, and Vaster had not yet returned. Baynarah and Tay tearfully (he was surprised how easy it was for him to cry without feeling) admitting where they had been, and leading Uncle Triffith and a crowd of servants to the junk pile and gorge. The tireless search through the woods as night turned to dawn. The weeping. The light punishment, merely cries of anger, that Baynarah and Tay suffered for losing their young cousin.\nIt was thought, from their stricken expressions, that the children felt guilty enough. They were sent to bed at dawn while the hunt through the woods continued.\nTay was drifting to sleep when his nursemaid Edebah came into his room. The look of unwavering love and devotion had not left her eyes, and he sank gratefully into his dreams and nightmares with her holding his hand. The Song wafted almost imperceptibly through his consciousness as he again had the vision of the room in the castle. The girl and her baby. The bird in the rafters. The dying fire. The sudden explosion of violence. Breathless, Tay opened his eyes.\nEdebah was stealing out the door, softly humming the Song to herself. In her hand was the crystal globe from his satchel. For a moment, he hesitated, about to cry out. How did she know the Song? Was she aware that he had murdered another boy to get the globe?\nSomehow he knew that she was helping him, that she knew all and loved him and sought only to protect him.\nThe next day, and the next week, and the next month were all the same. No one spoke very much, and when they did it was to suggest new places to look for the missing boy. Everywhere had been searched thoroughly. Tay was curious why they never looked in the gorge, but he understood how inaccessible it was.\nA side-effect of Vaster's absence was that the tutorial sessions with Kena Gafrisi took on a more serious, even academic quality. The younger boy's high spirits and meager attentiveness had always cut the lessons short, but sensible Baynarah and quiet Tay were ideal pupils. He was particularly impressed by how focused they became during a rather dry history lecture about the heraldic symbols of Houses of Morrowind.\n\"The crest of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; features a scale,\" he sniffed disdainfully. \"They see themselves as the great compromisers, as if that were something honorable. Many hundreds of years ago, they were the tribesmen following &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; who chose--\"\n\u201cPardon me, Kena,\u201d asked Baynarah. \u201cBut what is the crest with the insect on it?\u201d\n\u201cYou don't know &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;?\u201d asked the tutor, lifting up one of the shields. \"I know you have a sheltered life on Gorne, but you're surely old enough to recognize--\"\n\u201cNot that one, Kena,\u201d replied Tay. \u201cI think she means the other crest with an insect.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d nodded Kena Gafrisi, brow furrowed. \u201cYes, you would be too young to have ever seen the crest of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House of Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. Our enemies together with the accursed heretical &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;War of the Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, now totally destroyed, thanks be to Lord, Mother, and Wizard. That House was a curse on our land for millennia, and when at last their pestilence was snuffed out, the very earth itself breathed a cloud of fire and ash in relief, bringing night to day for over a year's time.\u201d\nBaynarah and Tay knew they could not speak, but they exchanged knowing glances at one another as the tutor enlarged on the theme of the great wickedness of the Dwemer and the House Dagoth. As soon as the lesson ended, they walked silently out of Sandil House until they were far from all ears and eyes.\nThe afternoon sun stretched out the shadows of the spear-like trees surrounding the meadow. Off in the distance, they could hear the sounds of the workers beginning their preparations for the autumntide harvest, yelling to one another unintelligibly in coarse and familiar accents.\n\u201cThat was definitely the symbol on that shield you found at the garbage heap,\u201d Baynarah said at last. \u201cEverything there must be a remnant of the House Dagoth.\u201d\nTay nodded. His mind was on the strange crystal globe. He felt a light vibration of soundless music touch his body, and knew he was discovering a new cadence of the Song.\n\u201cWhy would our people have burned and discarded all that?\u201d he asked thoughtfully. \u201cDo you think the House Dagoth was so evil that everything associated with them could have been cursed?\u201d\nBaynarah laughed. At the height of day, all talk of curses and the evil Sixth House were pure supposition: something to add romance to one's life, but nothing to worry about. The two children walked back to the castle for yet another in a series of cold, quiet dinners. As the night fell, Baynarah looked through the treasures she had picked up in the junk heap. By the light of the moons, the small jars, the torc with orange gemstones, the bits of tarnished silver and gold of no obvious purpose, all took on a sinister aspect.\nRevulsion overtook her feeling of admiration instantly. There was a strange energy to them, a tincture of death and corruption that was undeniable. Baynarah ran to the window and vomited.\nLooking out to the dark open lawn below, she saw a figure below lighting an arrangement of candles in the shape of a large insect, the symbol of the House Dagoth. When it looked in her direction, she pulled back, but she saw the face illuminated by the tallows. It was Edebah, Tay's nursemaid.\nThe next morning, Baynarah left the castle grounds early, bearing a large sack filled with her treasures. She carried them to the dumping ground and left them there. Then she returned, and told her Uncle Triffith what she had seen the night before, leaving out only what had made her sick in the first place.\nEdebah was banished from the isle of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; without discussion. She wept, begging to be allowed to say goodbye to Tay, but all believed that would be too dangerous. When Tay asked what had become of her, he was told she had to return to her family on the mainland. He had grown too old for a nursemaid.\nBaynarah never told him what she knew. For she was afraid.\nBook III.\nTay was eighteen in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20685\"&gt;685&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; when he first saw &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, the city of spires, home of the goddess. His cousin Kalkorith, already a senior initiate in the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, gave him a couple rooms on the ground floor of the house he had purchased. They were small and unfurnished, but bittergreen grew outside the windows, and when the wind blew, they filled his bedroom with a lovely spicy air.\nThe chords of the Song did not trouble him anymore. Sometimes he was even unconscious to it, so low and melodic it had become. Occasionally when he was passing through the streets on the way to the Temple for his instruction, someone would pass him and the Song would rise in intensity before falling away again. Whatever was different about those people, Tay never tried to ascertain. He remembered the last time he had let the Song lead him, and called for him to murder his young cousin Vaster. The memory did not trouble him unduly, but he did not want to hurt anyone again unless he had to.\nHouse couriers regularly brought Tay letters from Baynarah, still back in Sandil House on the island of Gorne. She might have gone to study at the Temple, she was certainly intelligent enough, but she chose not to. In a year or two at most, she would have to leave and assume her place in House Indoril, but she was not in a hurry. Tay welcomed the trivial gossipy news the letters brought, and responded back with news of his own studies and romances.\nIn his third month in Mournhold, he had already met a girl. She was also a student at the Temple, and her name was Acra. Tay wrote enthusiastically about her to Baynarah, describing her as having the mind of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, the wit of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and the beauty of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. Baynarah replied back merrily that if she had known how blasphemous students of the Temple were allowed to be, she might have become an initiate herself.\n\u201cYou are very devoted to your cousin,\u201d Acra laughed when Tay showed her the letter. \u201cAm I looking at the last remains of a thwarted romance?\u201d\n\u201cShe's lovely, but I never thought of her that way,\u201d Tay scoffed. \u201cIncest never particularly interested me.\u201d\n\u201cIs she a very close cousin then?\u201d\nTay thought for a moment: \u201cI don't know. Truthfully, no one spoke much of either her parents or mine, so I really don't know how we were connected. They were casualties of the War of the Red Mountain, that I know, and it seemed to cast rather a pall on the adults' humor whenever we asked about her parents or mine. After a while, we stopped asking. But you're an Indoril too. Perhaps you're a closer cousin to me than Baynarah.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d Acra smiled, rising from her chair. She uncoiled her hair, which had been pulled up in the formal arrangement reserved for well-born priestesses. As Tay watched transfigured, she removed the small brooch that fastened her robe to her shoulder cape. The soft silken fabric slipped down slowly, exposing her dark, slender body to him for the first time. \u201cIf we are, does incest particularly interest you now?\u201d\nAs they made love, the Song began a slow, rhythmic ascension in Tay's head. The vision of Acra before him darkened and was replaced by images from his nightmares before returning again. When finally he collapsed, spent, the room seemed filled with the fiery red clouds of his dream, and the scream of the woman and her child facing death echoed in his head. He opened his eyes, and there was Acra, smiling at him. Tay kissed her, grateful to have her in his arms.\nFor the next two weeks, Tay and Acra were never far apart. Even when they were at study in opposite wings of the Temple, Tay thought of her, and somehow knew she was thinking of him. They would rush to be together afterwards, ravishing one another in his rooms every night, and in a private corner of the Temple garden every day.\nIt was while Tay was rushing to see his beloved one afternoon that the Song rose up in powerful strident tones at the approach of an old, ragged woman. He closed his eyes and tried to quiet it, but when he looked again at her purchasing corkbulb papyrus from a street vendor, he knew who she was. His old nursemaid from &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, Edebah. She who had abandoned him without even a farewell to join her family on the mainland.\nShe didn't see him, and as she passed down the street, Tay turned and began to follow. They walked through shadowy passageways into the very poorest part of the city, a quarter which was as alien to him as the wildest principality of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. She unlocked a small wooden door on a street without a name, and he finally called out her name. She didn't turn, but when he followed, he found that the door had been left ajar.\nThe chamber was murky and damp like a cave. She stood facing him, her face even more wrinkled than he had remembered it, etched with lines of sorrow. He closed the door behind him, and she took his hand and kissed it.\n\u201cYou are so tall and strong,\u201d Edebah said, beginning to weep. \u201cI should have killed myself before I let them take me away from you.\u201d\n\u201cHow is your family?\u201d Tay asked coldly.\n\u201cYou are my only family,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; pigs forced me to leave, thrusting their blades in my face, when they discovered that I serve you and your family, not them. That bitch girl Baynarah saw me at a prayer of mourning.\u201d\n\u201cYou're speaking like a madwoman,\u201d Tay sneered. \u201cHow could you love me and my family, but hate the House Indoril? I am of the House Indoril.\u201d\n\u201cYou are old enough to know the truth,\u201d Edebah said fiercely. Tay had bitterly joked about her madness, but he saw something close to it burning in her ancient eyes. \u201cYou were not born of House Indoril; they brought you into their house after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;, like they and the other Houses brought in all the orphans. It was the only way they saw to erase history and remove all traces of their enemies, by raising their enemies as one of them.\u201d\nTay turned toward the door: \u201cI can see why you were taken away from Gorne, old woman. You are delusional.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Edebah cried, rushing to a musty cabinet. She retrieved from it a glass globe that shimmered with a spectrum of color even in the chamber's gloom. \u201cDo you remember this? You slew that little boy Vaster because he possessed it, and I took it from your room because you were not ready to face the facts of your inheritance and responsibility then. Did you not wonder why this bauble drew you so?\u201d\nTay gasped, and though he did not want to, he said, \u201cI hear a Song sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the Song of your ancestors, of your true family,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cYou must not fight it, for it is a song of destiny. It will lead you to do what must be done.\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Tay howled, \u201cEverything you say is a lie! You're insane!\u201d\nEdebah threw the globe to the ground with all her might, shattering it with a deafening retort. The shards melted into the air. All that was left was a small silver ring, simply wrought with a flat crown. The old woman quietly picked it up and handed it to him, while he stood with his back against the door, trembling.\n\u201cThis is your inheritance, as the bearer of the Sixth House.\u201d\nThe ring's crown was meant for stamping and sealing official House proclamations. Tay had seen his uncle Triffith's similar ring, crested with the wing which was the seal of House Indoril. This ring was different, with an insect design which he remembered from the day when Kena Gafrisi had taught the House heraldry to Baynarah and him.\nIt was the symbol of the accursed House Dagoth.\nThe Song took over all of Tay's senses. He heard its music, smelled its horror, tasted its sadness, felt its power, and the only thing he could see before him was the flames of its destruction. When he took the ring and placed it on his finger, his mind was not aware of what he was doing. Nor was Tay aware of anything but the Song when he removed his dagger from its sheath and thrust it into his old nursemaid's heart.\nTay did not even hear her final words, when Edebah fell bleeding to the ground, and groaned with a blood-streaked smile, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWhen the veil of the Song lifted, Tay did not realize at first he was no longer dreaming. Before him had been flames, the very ones that destroyed the home of his birth, and flames were before him again. But they were flames from a fire he had struck outside the crumbling tenement that were already bursting through walls, consuming the body of his old nursemaid.\nTay fled through the streets as people began to call for the guards.\nBook IV.\nAcra sat by the hearth in Tay's room, reading her book by the fire. It concerned some minutiae of theosophy that she did not believe in, but nevertheless found morbidly compelling. When the door opened and she heard Tay enter, she finished the paragraph she was reading before looking up.\n\u201cI've been here for hours, darling. If I knew you were going to be so late, I would have brought more books,\u201d she giggled. When she saw Tay's face and the state of his clothing, her manner lost all frivolity. \u201cWhat happened to you? Are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cI've been to see my old childhood nursemaid, Edebah,\u201d he said in a strange voice. \u201cIt was a sudden change of plans. I hadn't realized she was in Mournhold.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I had known where you were going,\u201d she said, rising slowly from her chair. \u201cI would have loved to have met her.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it's too late now. I've killed her.\u201d\nAcra inhaled deeply, studying Tay's frozen face. She took his hand. \u201cPerhaps you ought to tell me everything.\u201d\nTay let his beloved lead him to the hearth, where he sat blinking at the fire. He looked down at the silver ring on his finger. \u201cBefore I killed her, she gave me this. It's the sealing ring of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. She told me I was the bearer of the inheritance, and the Song I hear all the time in my head, the one that called me to kill another boy when I was young, and then Edebah herself, is the Song of my ancestors.\u201d\nTay fell silent. Acra knelt by his side, stroking his ringed hand. \u201cTell me more.\u201d\n\u201cMy tutor Kena Gafrisi taught us that the House Dagoth was a curse on &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He said that when they were all destroyed at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;, the very earth itself breathed in relief,\u201d Tay closed his eyes. \u201cI can see the obliteration. I can even hear it in the Song. Edebah told me that the five Houses adopted the orphan children of Dagoth, raising them in their own traditions. I thought she was mad or a liar, but the real lie was all those years I thought my family was &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Acra whispered.\n\u201cWell, Edebah told me to follow the Song to my destiny,\u201d Tay laughed bitterly. \u201cBut the Song led me to kill her, so I don't know if she'd still give me that recommendation now. I know that I need to leave Mournhold. Before I knew what I was doing, I set a fire in her tenement. The guards were called. I just don't know where I'd go.\u201d\n\u201cYou have many friends to shield you if you prove yourself to be the new leader of the return of the Sixth House,\u201d Acra kissed the ring. \u201cI will help you find them.\u201d\nTay stared at her. \u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you thought I was your cousin of the House Indoril, you did not mind having me though it might well have been incestuous,\u201d Acra replied, meeting his eyes. \u201cI have heard the Song too. It is not as strong with me as it was with you, but I never chose to ignore it. It taught me more than the ridiculous Temple priests and priestesses ever could. I knew that my true name was &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Acra\"&gt;Dagoth-Acra&lt;/a&gt;, and I knew that I had a brother.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tay said through gritted teeth. \u201cYou're lying.\u201d\n\u201cYou are &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\nTay shoved Acra hard against the wall and ran from the room. As he fled through the hall, he heard the sound of Kalkorith's footfall on the stairs behind him, a percussive instrument in the Song that was rising in his heart and head\n\u201cCousin,\u201d the senior initiate was saying. \u201cHave you heard about the fire--\"\nTay unsheathed his dagger and turned, burying it to the hilt in Kalkorith's throat. \u201cCousin,\u201d he hissed. \u201cI am not your cousin.\u201d\nThe streets of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; were lit by the red glow of the tenement fire, spreading through the tight alleyways by a steady and intense gust of wind. It was as if &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt; himself was looming over the city, fanning the flames his heir had struck. A House guard, running toward the blaze, stopped at the sight of Tay, standing uncertainly, swaying, before the front door of Kalkorith's house, a bloodied blade in his hand.\n\u201cWhat you done, serjo?\u201d\nTay ran for the forest, his cape whipping behind him by the force of the howling wind. The guard clambered after him, sword drawn. He had no need to investigate the house to see the murder. He knew.\nFor hours, Tay raced through the wilderness, the Song pushing him onward. The sound of his pursuer faded away. At last, the trees thinned, and he saw nothing before him but air and water. A cliff, a hundred foot long plunge into the Inner Sea.\nThe Song told him no. It pulled him north, sweetly promising a place to rest among friends. More than friends -- people who would worship him as the heir of Dagoth. As he slowly walked toward the edge of the cliff, the Song became more threatening, warning him not to seek to avoid his fate. There was no escape in death.\nTay spat a curse upon his House and threw himself head first over the cliff.\nIt was another glorious day on the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, the first one in weeks that Baynarah could truly enjoy. Uncle Triffith had important company, Housemen from far away, and she had been required to attend every dinner, every meeting, every ceremony. As a child, she remembered, she had hoped for some attention. Now nothing was more blissful than time away from her duties.\nThere was only one thing she wanted to do that she had to do indoors, and that was writing a letter to her cousin. But that could wait until the evening, she told herself. After all, he had not written her in many days. It was the influence of that girl, Acra. Not that she seemed disagreeable, but Baynarah knew how one's first love can be all-consuming. At least, she had read about it.\nAs she walked idly through the wildflower meadow, Baynarah was so distracted with her thoughts that she did not hear her maid Hillima calling. She was quite startled when she turned to see the young servant running up.\n\u201cSerjo,\u201d she said, breathlessly. \u201cPlease come! Someone has washed up on the shore! It's your cousin, &lt;a href=\"Serjo\"&gt;Serjo&lt;/a&gt; Indoril-Tay!\u201d\nBook V.\nFor two days, the House healers attended Tay in his bed, and Baynarah sat by his side, holding his hand. He was feverish, neither asleep nor awake, screaming at invisible phantoms. The healers complimented the young man's fortitude. Bodies had washed ashore on the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; several times, many during the War, but never once had they seen one that lived afterwards.\nAunt Ulliah came in several times to bring Baynarah food: \u201cYou must be careful, dear, or when he's all well, he'll have to attend you on your sickbed.\u201d\nTay's fever broke, and at last he was able to open his eyes and see the young woman with whom he had spent seventeen years, all but the first year of his life. She smiled at him, and called for food. In silence, she helped him eat.\n\u201cI knew you wouldn't die, cousin,\u201d she whispered fondly.\n\u201cI hoped to, but somehow I knew I wouldn't either,\u201d he groaned. \u201cBaynarah, do you remember all those nightmares I told you about? They're all true.\u201d\n\u201cWe can talk about it when you've rested some more.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he croaked. \u201cI must tell you everything now, so you'll know what kind of a monster you call your dear cousin Tay. If there was some way you could have known before, you might not have been so eager to see me well again.\u201d\nA tear rolled Baynarah's cheek. She had grown into a beauty, even in the few months he had been away in Mournhold. \u201cHow can you think I would stop loving you, no matter what you've done?\u201d\n\u201cI saw my old nursemaid Edebah, and spoke to her.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Baynarah had feared this moment. \u201cTay, I don't know what she told you, but it was all my fault. You remember when Kena Grafisi taught us about the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, and its corruption. That night, I saw your nursemaid making some kind of altar out on the north lawn, using the symbol of the Sixth House. She must have been doing it for years, but I never knew what it meant. I told Uncle Triffith, and he sent her away. I've wanted to tell you so many times now, but I was afraid to. She was so devoted to you.\u201d\nTay smiled. \u201cAnd didn't it frighten you even more to wonder if there was any connection between her devotion to me, and her devotion to the accursed House? I know you, Baynarah. You're not one of those women who doesn't choose to use her mind.\u201d\n\u201cTay, I don't know what she told you, but I think she was very troubled, and whatever she thought about you and the Sixth House was wrong. You have to remember that. The ramblings of one madwoman are proof of nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThere's more,\u201d Tay sighed, and held up his hand. For a moment he blinked, and then turned to Baynarah angrily. \u201cWhat happened to my ring? If you saw it, you must have known already that everything I'm saying to you is true.\u201d\n\u201cI threw the filthy thing away,\u201d Baynarah stood up. \u201cTay, I'm going to let you rest now.\u201d\n\u201cI am the heir of House Dagoth,\u201d Tay was wild-eyed, almost screaming. \u201cRaised after the War as &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, but driven by the Song of my ancestors. When we were young, I killed Vaster because the Song told me he had stolen my inheritance. When Edebah told me who I was and gave me this ring, I killed her and burned her house to the ground, because the Song told me she had served her purpose. When I returned to Kalkorith's house, my love was there, telling me that she was of the House Dagoth too, and my sister. I fled, and when Kalkorith tried to stop me, I slew him, because the Song told me he was an enemy.\u201d\n\u201cTay, stop,\u201d Baynarah sobbed. \u201cI don't believe a word of it. You've been feverish...\u201d\n\u201cNot Tay,\u201d he shook his head, breathing heavily. \u201cThe name my parents gave me was &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\n\u201cYou can't have killed Edebah, you loved her. And Vaster and Kalkorith? They were our cousins!\u201d\n\u201cThey were not my true cousins,\u201d Tay said coldly. \u201cThe Song told me they were my foes. Just as it's telling me now that you're my foe, but I won't listen. And I'll keep from listening... as long as I can.\u201d\nBaynarah fled from the room, slamming the door behind her. She took a key from the her startled maid Hillima, and secured the lock.\n\u201cSerjo &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;-Baynarah,\u201d Hillima whispered, with great sympathy. \u201cIs all well with your cousin, Serjo Indoril-Tay?\u201d\n\u201cHe'll be perfectly fine once he rests,\u201d Baynarah recovered her dignity, wiping the tears from her face. \u201cNo one is to disturb him under any circumstances. I'll take the key with me. Now I have much work to do. I don't suppose anyone's spoken to the fishermen about restocking Sandil House's supplies?\u201d\n\u201cI don't know, serjo,\u201d said the maid. \u201cI don't think so.\u201d\nBaynarah marched down to the docks, and relieved her troubled heart the only way she knew how, by concentrating on small things. Tay's words never left her, but she found temporary comfort talking to the fishermen about their haul, helping determine how much should be smoked, how much should be sent to the village, how much should be delivered fresh to the House larder.\nHer aunt Ulliah joined the discussion, oblivious to Baynarah's well-disguised agony. Together, they discussed how many provisions Uncle Triffith and his commanders had devoured during their weeks on the island, when they would be expected to return, and how best to prepare. One of the fishermen on the docks called out, interrupting.\n\u201cA boat is coming!\u201d\nUlliah and Baynarah greeted the visitor as she arrived. It was a young woman dressed in the robes of a Temple priestess. As she docked her small boat, Baynarah marveled at how beautiful she was, and strangely familiar.\n\u201cWelcome to Gorne,\u201d said Baynarah. \u201cI am Indoril-Baynarah and this is my aunt Indoril-Ulliah. Have we met before?\u201d\n\u201cI don't believe so, serjo,\u201d the woman bowed. \u201cI was sent by the Temple to inquire whether word had come from your cousin, Indoril-Tay. He has been missing from his classes for some days now, and the priests have become concerned.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we should have sent word,\u201d Ulliah fretted. \u201cHe came here a few days ago, half-drowned. He's better now. Let us escort you up to the house.\u201d\n\u201cTay's resting now, and I asked that he not be disturbed,\u201d Baynarah stammered. \u201cActually, I know it's dreadful manners, but I need to talk to my aunt for a moment. Would it be too terrible if I asked you to wait for us at the house? You have only to follow the path up the hill and across the lawn.\u201d\nThe priestess bowed again humbly, and began the walk. Ulliah was scandalized.\n\u201cYou know better than to treat a representative of the Temple that way,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou can't be so exhausted from tending your cousin to have lost all sense of civility.\u201d\n\u201cAunt Ulliah,\u201d Baynarah whispered, drawing the woman away from the ears of the fishermen. \u201cIs Tay truly my cousin? He believes himself to be ... of the House Dagoth.\u201d\nUlliah took a moment to respond. \u201cIt's true. You were just a baby yourself during the War, so you couldn't know what it was like. There was not a part of Morrowind that wasn't ravaged. There was even a battle here on the island. Do you remember that burned pile of wreckage you and Tay and poor little Vaster discovered so many years ago? That was the remains. And after the War, when that accursed House was finally defeated, we saw the little innocents, the orphans whose only crime had been born to wicked parents. I admit there were some in our armies, the combined forces of the Houses, who would have had them all slaughtered to annihilate the legacy of Dagoth. In the end, compassion prevailed, and the children of the Sixth House were adopted into the other five. And so we thought that we had won the war and the peace.\u201d\n\u201cBy the Mother, Lord, and Wizard, if all that Tay believes is true, then there is no peace,\u201d Baynarah trembled. \u201cHe claims that the Song of his ancestors called to him, and forced him to slay three people, two of them our Housemen. Cousin Kalkorith and ... when he was a little boy ... Vaster.\u201d\nUlliah held her hands over her tearful face and could not speak.\n\u201cAnd it is only beginning,\u201d said Baynara. \u201cThe Song still calls to him. He said there were others who knew, who would help him raise up the Sixth House. His sister...\u201d\n\u201cIt must be an evil fantasy,\u201d Ulliah murmured. She noticed that Baynarah's gaze was now upon the path leading from the docks towards the house. \u201cNiece, what are you thinking?\u201d\n\u201cDid that priestess give us her name?\u201d\nThe two women ran up the path, calling for guards. The fishermen, who had never seen the mistresses of the house so undone, looked briefly at one another and then followed quickly behind, pulling out their hooks and blades.\nThe front gate to Sandil House stood wide open, the first of the corpses lying close within. It was now an abattoir, painted fresh with blood. There was Aner, uncle Triffith's valet, gutted but still seated at the foyer table where he had been enjoying his afternoon glass of &lt;a href=\"Flin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;flin&lt;/a&gt;. Leryne, one of the chambermaids, had been decapitated while carrying some once-clean linens up the stairs. The bodies of guards and servants sprawled about the hall like blown leaves. At the top of the stairs, Baynarah had to hold back a sob when she saw Hillima. She lay like a broken doll, slain as she tried to pull herself out onto the narrow window ledge.\nNo one spoke, not Baynarah, nor Aunt Ulliah, nor the fishermen, as they walked slowly through the blood-drenched house. They passed Tay's sick-room, its door broken open, and no one within. When they heard the sound of footsteps in Baynarah's room down the hall, they approached slowly, cautiously, with great dread.\nThe priestess from the docks was standing by the bed. In her hand was the silver ring Baynarah had taken from Tay's finger. In her other hand was a long, curved blade, splashed like her once pristine gown, with gore. She smiled prettily and bowed when she saw she was no longer alone.\n\u201cAcra, I should have recognized you by Tay's description in his letters,\u201d Baynarah said in her steadiest voice. \u201cWhere is my cousin?\u201d\n\u201cI prefer to call myself &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Acra\"&gt;Dagoth-Acra&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d she replied. \u201cYour false cousin, my true brother, has already gone to fulfill his destiny. I'm sorry you were not here so he could give you a more permanent farewell.\u201d\nBaynarah's face twisted in fury. She motioned for the fishermen, who advanced with their weaponry. \u201cTear her apart.\u201d\n\u201cThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt; will rise again, and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt; will lead us!\u201d Acra laughed. Her words were still echoing as she gave the sign of &lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt; and vanished like a ghost.\nBook VI.\nThe magnificent sprawl of the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Indoranyon%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Indoranyon&lt;/a&gt; was aglow in the light of the setting sun. Commander Jasrat watched it slowly disappear into the horizon as he led the caravan southwestward. It was a strange practice for him to lead a night operation, but scarcely more bizarre than anything else he was facing. He was only seventy years of age, far from old for a Bosmer, and yet he felt like he belonged to another era.\nHe had known the land of east &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; his entire life. Every forest, every garden, every small village between &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; had been home to him. But now it was all different, twisted into a world he did not recognize since the eruption and the year of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;. It made night travel all the more treacherous, but it was a risk he was ordered to take.\nThe ashmire appeared quite suddenly. If a sharp-sighted scout hadn't seen it and given the signal, the entire caravan might have been swallowed whole. Jasrat cursed. It had not been on the map, but that was hardly surprising.\nIt was a huge unnamed scathe stretching as far as anyone could see. The commander considered his options. He might lead his party to the southeast toward &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; and then try an approach due west. As he consulted his map, he noticed a glimmer of a campfire in the distance. Accompanied by his lieutenants, Jasrat drove his guar forward to investigate what appeared to be an Ashlander man and woman.\n\u201cThis is no longer your realm,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cDon't you know it's been ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; that these are House lands now?\u201d\nThe couple shuffled to their feet, and began quietly walking away, toward a narrow ridge between hill and ashmire. Jasrat called them back.\n\u201cDo you know a way around the scathe?\u201d he asked. They nodded, their eyes still to the ground. Jasrat signaled to his caravan. \u201cYou will lead us then.\u201d\nIt was a treacherous winding crossing, almost too tight for the guars. The wagons themselves scraped as the drivers pulled to avoid the ashmire. The Ashlander man and woman whispered to one another as they led the caravan.\n\u201cWhat are you mumbling about, n'wah?\u201d Jasrat hollered.\nThe man did not turn around. \u201cMy sister and I were talking about the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; rebellion, and she was guessing that you were bringing arms to the stronghold at &lt;a href=\"Falensarano%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Falensarano&lt;/a&gt;, which is why you chose to cross the ashmire rather than taking a road.\u201d\n\u201cI might have known,\u201d Jasrat laughed. \u201cYou &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; are so hopeful whenever you see signs of trouble in the Houses and the Temple. I hate to dampen your spirits, but what you're speaking of is hardly a rebellion. Merely a few isolated incidents of... unpleasantness. Tell your sister that.\u201d\nAs they plodded onward, the narrow ridge began to taper even more. The Ashlanders found a low jagged crevasse in the hills, a crack from a lava flow even predating &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;. The caravan scored the rock walls at it moved through. Commander Jasrat, after twenty years of uncertainty in a land he did not understand, felt a twinge of his old instinct. This, he thought to himself, would be a fine place for an ambush.\n\u201cAshlander, how close are we?\u201d he shouted.\n\u201cWe've arrived,\u201d &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt; replied, and gave the signal.\nThe assault was over in mere minutes, as it had been calculated from the start. When the last body of the House guard had sunk beneath the ashmire, only then was the inventory of the caravan revealed. It was better than they had hoped, virtually everything the rebellion needed. Daedric swords, dozens of suits of armor, quivers of fine ebony bolts, and rations enough to last for weeks.\n\u201cGo on ahead to the camp,\u201d Tython smiled at his sister. \u201cI'll lead the caravan. We should be there within a few hours' time.\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Acra\"&gt;Acra&lt;/a&gt; kissed him passionately, and gave the sign of &lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt;. In an instant, she was back in her tent, exactly as she had left it. Humming the Song, she removed the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; rags and chose an appropriately diaphanous gown from her trunks. Precisely the sort of dress Tython would love seeing her in when he returned.\n\u201cMuorasa!\u201d she called to her servant. \u201cSummon the troops together! Tython and the others will be here very soon with all the weapons and rations we need!\u201d\n\u201cMuorasa can't hear you now,\u201d said a voice Acra hadn't heard in weeks. She turned, expertly removed every trace of surprise from her face. It was indeed Indoril-Baynarah, but not the quivering creature she had left behind at the massacre at Sandil House. This woman was an armored warrior, who spoke with mocking confidence. \u201cShe wouldn't be able to summon the troops if she could. You may have weapons and rations, Acra, but there's no one left to arm or feed.\u201d\nDagoth-Acra made the sign of Recall, but nothing happened.\n\u201cThe moment we heard you banging around in the tent, my &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s cast a diffusion of all magicka,\u201d Baynara smiled, opening the tent further to invite a dozen House soldiers in. \u201cYou won't be leaving.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think that my brother will walk into your trap, you underestimate his allegiance to the Song,\u201d Acra sneered. \u201cIt tells him everything he needs to know. I have convinced him to no longer fight it, and let it lead him and us to our ultimate victory.\u201d\n\u201cI've known him longer and better than you ever did,\u201d said Baynarah coldly. \u201cNow, I want to hear what the Song is saying to you. I want to know where I can find Tay.\u201d\n\u201cTython, my lady,\u201d Acra corrected her. \u201cHe is no longer a slave to your House and the Temple's lies. You can torture me all you wish, but I swear to you the next time you see him, it will be because he wishes it, not you. And that will be your very last moment alive.\u201d\n\u201cDon't you worry, serjo,\u201d Baynarah's nightblade winked at her. \u201cEveryone says they won't break under torture, but everyone always does.\u201d\nBaynarah left the tent. It was all a part of warfare, she understood that, but there would be little relish in witnessing it. She could not even watch as the House soldiers disposed of the rebel corpses. She had hoped she would grow numb to the bloodshed after weeks of following Tython and Acra, massacre after massacre. It didn't matter to her that now the bodies were of her enemies. Death was still death.\nShe had only been in her tent for a few minutes when her &lt;a href=\"nightblade\"&gt;nightblade&lt;/a&gt; appeared.\n\u201cNot so tough as she appeared, that one,\u201d he grinned. \u201cIn point of fact, all I had to do is ask her nice and point my dagger at her belly, and she was blubbering everything. Not too surprising really. It's always the ones that talk big that crumble fast. I remember way back a couple years ago, before you was even born -\u201c\n\u201cGaruan, what did she say?\u201d Baynarah asked.\n\u201cThe Song, whatever that is, told her brother that she got herself caught, and not to return to camp,\u201d the nightblade replied, only a trifle annoyed at having his fascinating story cut short. \u201cHe's got a half dozen mer with him, and they're going to try to assassinate the fella that led the Indoril army in the War. General Indoril-Triffith.\u201d\n\u201cUncle Triffith,\u201d Baynarah gasped. \u201cWhere is he stationed now?\u201d\n\u201cI'm not sure myself, serjo. Do you want me to ask if she knows?\u201d\n\u201cI'll come with you,\u201d said Baynarah. As they walked towards Acra's tent, cries of alarm sounded. The situation became abundantly clear even before they reached the site. Three guards were dead, and the prisoner had escaped.\n\u201cInteresting woman,\u201d said Garuan. \u201cWeak heart, but a strong arm. Should we send word of warning to General Indoril-Triffith?\u201d\n\u201cIf we can find where he is in time,\u201d said Baynarah.\nBook VII.\nTriffith stood the parapets of &lt;a href=\"Barysimayn\"&gt;Barysimayn&lt;/a&gt; and considered the volcano. Metaphors the poets used fell rather flat in his view. A festering wound it could be called with its blood-like lava. The King of Ash, too, could be applied, when one looked at its perpetual crown of smoke. And yet, none of that would do, for nothing in his experience could convey the sheer magnitude of the mountain. &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; was many miles away from the fortress, and yet it filled the horizon utterly.\nBefore he could feel too small, however, he heard his name being called within. It was some consolation that though he was insignificant compared to the mountain, he was still in possession of certain power and influence.\n\u201cGeneral &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Triffith\"&gt;Triffith&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d said Commander Rael. \u201cThere's trouble at the east gate.\u201d\nThe trouble was scarcely more than a skirmish. An &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, drunk perhaps on &lt;a href=\"shein%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shein&lt;/a&gt;, had begun a fight with the House guards at the back gate. As they tried to drive him away, his cousins joined him, and soon there were six Ashlanders altogether brawling with a dozen of Triffith's guards. If the n'wahs had not been well-armed, the fight could have been finished almost before it began. As it was, by the time the General arrived with more of his guards, two of the Ashlanders were dead and the others had taken flight.\n\u201cIt's the smoke in their brains,\u201d Rael shrugged. \u201cMakes them mad.\u201d\nTriffith climbed back up the stairs and returned to his chamber to dress for dinner. General &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Vorilk\"&gt;Vorilk&lt;/a&gt; and Counselor &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Nothoc\"&gt;Nothoc&lt;/a&gt; would be arriving very shortly to discuss the Temple's plans for reorganizing the House lands of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; was to be renamed &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. A great new city in honor of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; was to be built, but with whose &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;? It made his head hurt. There were so many details, a long night of argument, threats, and compromises were ahead.\nThe General's mind was so occupied that he nearly put his House robes on backwards. He also did not notice the shadowy figure steal out from behind the tapestry and close the door to the bedchamber. It was not until Triffith heard the sound of the latch-bolt fall that he turned around.\n\u201cSlipped in when I was distracted by the fracas at the back gate. Very clever, Tay,\u201d he said simply. \u201cOr do you call yourself &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt; these days?\u201d\n\u201cYou should know all my names,\u201d the young man snarled, unsheathing his sword. \u201cI was Tython before you butchered my family and sought to dispel my tribe. I was Tay when you brought me into your House to &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; me against my own people. Now you may call me Vengeance.\u201d\nThere was a knock on the door. Tython and Triffith did not move their eyes from one another. The knocking became a loud pounding. \u201cGeneral Indoril-Triffith, are you well? Is there something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cIf you're going to kill me, boy, you'd best do it quickly,\u201d Triffith growled. \u201cMy men will have that door down in two minutes.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't tell me what to do, 'Uncle,'\u201d Tython shook his head. \u201cI have the Song of my ancestors to instruct me. It tells me you made my father beg for his life before you killed him, and I want to see you do the same.\u201d\n\u201cIf your ancestors are all-knowing,\u201d Triffith smiled. \u201cWhy are they all dead?\u201d\nTython made an inhuman noise in the back of his throat and advanced. The door began to buckle at the pounding, but it was sturdy and secure. The general's estimate of its life expectancy at two minutes seemed clearly erroneous.\nThe pounding suddenly stopped. A familiar voice replaced the sound.\n\u201cTay,\u201d called &lt;a href=\"Baynarah\"&gt;Baynarah&lt;/a&gt;. \u201cListen to me.\u201d\nTython smirked, \u201cYou're just in time to hear your uncle beg for his miserable life, 'cousin.' I was afraid you'd be too late. The next sound you'll hear will be the death rattle of the man who slaved my House.\u201d\n\u201cThe Song is what's enslaved you, not Uncle Triffith. You can't trust it. It's poisoning you. It let you be manipulated first by that mad old woman, and now by that evil witch &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Acra\"&gt;Acra&lt;/a&gt; who calls herself your sister.\u201d\nTython pressed the tip of his sword so it touched the general's throat. The older man stepped backwards and Tython advanced. His eyes followed the length of his arm to the grip of the blade. The silver ring of Dagoth caught the red light of the volcano from the battlements outside the window.\n\u201cTay, please don't hurt anyone anymore. Please. If you just listen to me, and not the Song just a moment, you'll know what's right. I love you.\u201d Baynarah stifled her sobs to keep her voice clear and calm. There was a noise on the stairwell behind her. The general's guard had finally arrived with the battering ram.\nThe door splintered and burst open in two strikes. General Indoril-Triffith was holding his throat, staring out the window.\n\u201cUncle! Are you all right?\u201d Baynara ran to him. He nodded his head slowly, and removed his hand. There was only the barest of scratches on his neck. \u201cWhere's Tay?\u201d\n\u201cHe jumped out the window,\u201d said Triffith, pointing out into the distance where a figure was riding a guar toward the volcano. \u201cI thought he was going to kill himself, but he had an escape figured out.\u201d\n\u201cWe'll get him, serjo general,\u201d said Commander Rael, calling to the guards to get their mounts. Baynarah watched them go, and then kissed her uncle quickly and ran out to her own guar in the courtyard.\nSweat drenched Tay's body as he rode closer and closer toward the summit of Red Mountain. The &lt;a href=\"guar\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; was breathing hard, trudging along even more slowly, letting out little grunts of complaint about the heat. Finally, he abandoned his steed and began to climb the near vertical surface. Ash blew down the face of the volcano into his eyes. Near-blind, it was almost impossible to ignore the persistent, clamorous notes of the Song.\nA silken stream of crimson lava studded with crystalline formations surged a few feet away, close enough that Tay could feel his flesh begin to burn and blister. He turned from it, and saw a figure emerge through the smoke. Baynarah.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Tay?\u201d she cried over the howl of the volcano. \u201cDidn't I tell you not to listen to the Song?\u201d\n\u201cFor the first time, the Song and I both want the same thing!\u201d he yelled back. \u201cI can't ask you to forgive me, but please try to forget!\u201d\nHe pulled himself higher, out of Baynarah's sight. She screamed his name, scaling the rocks until she found she was close to the open crater. Waves of boiling gas washed over her, and she dropped to her knees, gasping. Through the rippling miasma, she saw Tay standing at the mouth of the volcano. Flames erupted from his clothes and hair. He turned to her just for a moment and smiled.\nThen he leapt.\nBaynarah was in a daze as she began the long, treacherous climb down the volcano. She began to think of the projects ahead. Were there enough provisions in storage at her house in &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; for the meeting of the Houses? The councilors were bound to stay there for weeks, maybe months. There was much work to be done. Slowly, as she descended, she began to forget. It would not last, but it would be a start.\n&lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Acra\"&gt;Dagoth-Acra&lt;/a&gt; stood as near to the mouth of the volcano as she could stand, blinking her eyes at the ash, soaked by the heat. She watched all, and smiled. On the ground was the silver ring with the seal of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. Tython had been sweating so much, it had slipped off. She picked it up and put it on her own finger. Touching her belly, she heard a new refrain of the Poison Song of Morrowind begin."}
{"id": "9755", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9755", "title": "Poison Song, Book I", "text": "Poison Song, Book I is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nContents.\nIt was beginning again. Even though everything seemed serene (the last embers crackling in the hearth; young servant girl and her child slumbering in a chair by the door; a tapestry half-finished against the wall, waiting to be completed tomorrow; one of the moons visible through a milky cloud outside the window; a lone bird, out of sight in the rafters, cooing placidly), Tay heard the first chords of the Song strike dissonantly somewhere far away.\nThe bird in the rafters croaked and took flight through the window. The baby in the girl's arms woke and began to scream. The Song swelled in intensity, yet still remained subtle and stately in tempo. The movement of everything seemed to take on the rhythm of the music as if strange choreography had been staged: the girl rising to the window, the clouds reflecting back red from the inferno below, her scream, all muted, consumed by the Song. Everything that came thereafter Tay had seen so many times, it had almost ceased to be a nightmare.\nHe did not remember anything of his life before coming to the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, but he understood that there was something different in his past that set him apart from his cousins. It wasn't simply that his parents were dead. His cousin Baynarah's parents had also died in the War. Nor were the other Housemen on Gorne or nearby &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; unusually cruel to him. They treated him with the same polite indifference that any &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; has for every other eight-year-old boy that got underfoot.\nBut somehow, with absolutely certainty, Tay knew he was alone. Different. Because of a Song he always heard, and his nightmares.\n\u201cYou're certainly imaginative,\u201d his aunt Ulliah would smile patiently, before waving him away so she could return to her scriptures and chores.\n\u201cDifferent? Everyone in the world thinks they're 'different,' that's what makes it such a common sentiment,\u201d said his older cousin Kalkorith who was studying to be &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; priest and had a firm grasp on paradoxes.\n\u201cIf you tell anyone else that you keep hearing music where there's no music to be heard, they'll call you mad and bury you in the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d his uncle Triffith would snarl, before striding away to attend his business.\nOnly his nursemaid Edebah would listen to him seriously, and just nod with a faint look of pride. But she would never say another word.\nHis cousin and chief playmate Baynarah was by far the least interested in the stories of his Song and his dreams.\n\"How tiresome you are with all this, Tay,\" said Baynarah, after luncheon the summer of his eighth year. He, she, and a younger cousin Vaster walked into a clearing in the midst of flowering trees. The grass was very low, barely up to their ankles, and there were big black piles of leaves from the previous autumn. \u201cNow, shall we get back to it? What shall we play?\"\nTay thought for a moment. \"We could play the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"What's that?\" asked Vaster, their constant companion, three years their junior.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was the home of the orcs, off in the Wrothgarian Mountains. For hundreds of years, it kept growing bigger and bigger and bigger. The orcs would come down out of the mountains and rape and pillage all over &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. And then, King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; and someone else, I forget, from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; all joined together against Orsinium. For thirty years they fought and fought. Orsinium had walls made out of iron and, try as they might, they couldn't break through.\"\n\"So what happened?\" asked Baynarah.\n\"You're so good at making up things that never happened, why don't you make it up?\"\nSo they did. Tay was the King of the &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, perched up in a tree they called Orsinium. Baynarah and Vaster played King Joile and Gaiden Shinji and they threw pebbles and sticks up at Tay while he taunted them in his most guttural voice. The three decided that the Goddess &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; (played by Baynarah in dual role) answered the prayers of Gaiden Shinji and drenched Orsinium in a torrent of rain. The walls rusted and dissolved. On cue, Tay obligingly fell from the tree and let King Joile and Gaiden Shinji mangle him with their enchanted blades.\nFor the most of that summer, the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20675\"&gt;675&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, Tay was nearly insensible by the power of the sun. There were no clouds, but it rained most every night, so the vegetation on the island of Gorne was bewildering lush. The stones themselves seemed to glow with sunlight, and the ditches burned with white meadowsweet and parsleydown; all around him were soft smells of flower and tree untroubled by wind; the foliage was purple green, blue green, ash green, white green. The wide cupolas, twisting cobbled streets, and thatched roofs of the little village of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, and massive bleached rock of &lt;a href=\"Sandil%20House\"&gt;Sandil House&lt;/a&gt; all were magical to him.\nYet the dreams haunted his nights and the Song continued whether he was awake or not.\nAgainst Aunt Ulliah's admonishments, Tay, Baynarah, and Vaster had breakfast outdoors every morning with the servants. Ulliah would hold an interior breakfast for herself and any visiting dignitaries: guests were rare, so she often ate alone. At first the servants would dine in silence, attempting gentility, but they broke down and would regale the children with gossip, reports, stories, and rumors.\n\"Poor Arnyle is laid up with a fever again.\"\n\"I'm telling you, they're cursed. The whole lot of 'em. Piss on the faerie and they piss right back on you.\"\n\"Doesn't Little Miss Starsia look, oh, just a wee bit tight around the belly region late-ly?\"\n\"She's not!\"\nThe only servant who didn't speak at all was Tay's nursemaid Edebah. She wasn't pretty like the other maids, but the scars on her face did not deform her. Her poorly set broken nose and her short hair gave her a certain alien mystique. She would merely quietly smile at the gossip, and look at Tay with almost frightening love and devotion.\nOne day, after breakfast, Baynarah whispered to Tay and Vaster, \"We have to go to the hills on the other side of the island.\"\nShe had used such imperatives before and always had something wonderful to show: a waterfall, tucked away behind ferns and tall rocks; a sunny grove of figs; a discreet still some peasants had set up; a sickly oak, twisted into a kneeling human figure; a collapsed stone wall that they imagined was thousands of years old, the last refuge of a doomed princess they named Merella.\nThe three walked across through the forest until they came to a clearing. A few hundred feet beyond, the meadow sank to a dry creek bed, filled with small, smooth stones. They followed that into the dark woods where trees canopied high over their heads. Sporadic red and yellow blossoms burst along the moist underbrush, but they became rarer and rarer as the children marched on under the umbrageous oaks and elms. The air crackled with birds ticking a staccato choral piece, a minor chord of the Song.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d asked Tay.\n\"\u201cIt's not where we're going, it's what we're going to see,\u201d replied Baynarah.\"\nThe forest surrounded the three children completely, bathed them in its tenebrous hues, and breathed on them with wet chirrups and sighs. It was easy for them to imagine that they were within a monster, walking along its twisted spine of stones.\nBaynarah scrambled up the steep hill and peered through the thick mass of shrub and tree. Tay lifted Vaster out of the creek bed and climbed out, gripping soft grass for support. There was no path through the forest here. Brambles and low hanging branches struck at them like the claws of chained beasts. The cries of the birds became ever more stentorious, as if angered at the invasion. One limb drew blood on Vaster's cheek, but he didn't cry out. Even Baynarah, who could pass like an ethereal creature through impenetrable forests, had a braid catch on a bramble, ruining the intricate pattern a servant had woven hours before. She paused to pull out the other braid, so her bright unruly tresses fell freely behind her. Now she was something wild, a nymph guiding the other two through her woodland domain. The Song began to beat like a wild pulse.\nThey were on a shelf of stone below a cliff overlooking a tremendous gorge, staring over an expanse of cinder. It looked like the scene of a tremendous battle, a holocaust of fire. Charred boxes, weaponry, animal bones, and detritus too annihilated to be identifiable littered the ground. Speechless, Tay and Vaster stepped into the black field. Baynarah smiled, proud that she had finally found something of true wonder and mystery.\n\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d asked Vaster at last.\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d Baynarah shrugged. \u201cI thought at first that it was some kind of ruin, but now I think it's a junk pile, just not like any junk pile I've ever seen. Just look at this stuff.\u201d\nThe three began an unorganized survey of the dusty mounds of refuse. Baynarah found a twisted sword only lightly blackened by flame and began polishing it to read the inscriptions on the blade. Vaster amused himself by breaking brittle boxes with his hands and feet, imagining himself a giant of unbelievable strength. A battered shield attracted Tay: there was something about it that reverberated with the sound of the Song. He pulled it out, and wiped its surface clean.\n\u201cI've never seen that crest before,\u201d said Baynarah, looking over Tay's shoulder.\n\u201cI think I have, but I don't remember,\u201d Tay whispered, trying to conjure the memory from his dreams. He was sure he had seen it there.\n\u201cLook at this!\u201d Vaster cried, interrupting Tay's thoughts. The boy was holding up a crystal orb. As his hand moved over the surface, brushing away grit and dust, a key in the Song rose which sent a shiver through Tay's entire body. Baynarah ran over to look at Vaster's treasure, but Tay felt paralyzed.\n\u201cWhere did you find that?\u201d she gasped, gazing into the swirl beneath the crystal surface.\n\u201cOver in that wagon,\u201d Vaster gestured toward a heap of blackened wood, barely discernible from the other piles but for its cart spokes. Baynarah began digging into the half-collapsed structure, so only her feet could be seen. The Song built in potency, sweeping over Tay. He began walking toward Vaster slowly.\n\u201cGive me that,\u201d he whispered in a voice he could barely recognize as his own.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Vaster whispered back, his eyes locked on the colors reflected in the heart of the globe. \u201cIt's mine.\u201d\nBaynarah dug through the remains of the wagon for several more minutes, but she could find no treasures like Vaster's. Most everything within was destroyed, and what remained was common-place by any standards: broken arrows, armor shards, guar bones. Frustrated, she pulled herself out into the sunlight.\nTay was alone, at the edge of the great gorge.\n\u201cWhere's Vaster?\u201d\nTay blinked and then turned back to his cousin with a shrug and a grin: \u201cHe went back to show everyone his new plunder. Did you find anything interesting?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d said Baynarah. \u201cWe probably ought to get back home before Vaster tells them anything that'll get us in trouble.\u201d\nTay and Baynarah started the walk back at a quick pace. Tay knew that Vaster would not be there when they got back. He would never be returning home again. The crystal globe rested snugly in Tay's satchel, hidden under a pile of junk he had picked up. With all his heart, he prayed for the Song to return and drown out the memory of the gorge and the long, silent fall down. The boy had been so surprised, he hadn't even time to scream.\n'I'm here. The Gorge will know me by Miz. And so will you.' said a voice inside Tay's head. 'You shall die as in the suffering slavery of Ann Marie...' Tay collapsed to the floor, unable to escape his uncontrolled terror 'Or... become a soldier, and you will become the most powerful, yet the most hated mortal in Tamriel.' After waking up a few moments after constant surroundings of the maids and Baynarath, Tay knew that he would be part of the siege. Tay heard the fading voice with the last words 'You. Are. Miz.'\n'What is to come is his inevitable, yet unpredictable fate. Through madness, therefore his corruption slowly builds, with the song.'"}

All through the long, fast walk away from the gorge, through the woods, across the dry creek bed, he chatted merrily with Baynarah, fully aware that he had just committed murder. Whenever his mind strayed from the conversation, and he thought back on the last moments of Vaster's short life, the Song would soar. He could not think of the boy's death, but Tay knew he was responsible.\n\u201cYou're a mess!\u201d cried Aunt Ulliah the moment she saw the two children emerging from the woods onto the grounds of Sandil House. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n\u201cDidn't Vaster already tell you?\u201d asked Tay.\nThe scene played itself out as Tay knew it would, every dancer in the Song performing their steps as choreographed. Aunt Ulliah saying that she had not seen Vaster. Baynarah, not yet frightened, making up an innocent lie about the threesome not having strayed far, saying he must have gotten lost. A slow but steady rhythm of panic intensifying as night began to fall, and Vaster had not yet returned. Baynarah and Tay tearfully (he was surprised how easy it was for him to cry without feeling) admitting where they had been, and leading Uncle Triffith and a crowd of servants to the junk pile and gorge. The tireless search through the woods as night turned to dawn. The weeping. The light punishment, merely cries of anger, that Baynarah and Tay suffered for losing their young cousin.\nIt was thought, from their stricken expressions, that the children felt guilty enough. They were sent to bed at dawn while the hunt through the woods continued.\nTay was drifting to sleep when his nursemaid Edebah came into his room. The look of unwavering love and devotion had not left her eyes, and he sank gratefully into his dreams and nightmares with her holding his hand. The Song wafted almost imperceptibly through his consciousness as he again had the vision of the room in the castle. The girl and her baby. The bird in the rafters. The dying fire. The sudden explosion of violence. Breathless, Tay opened his eyes.\nEdebah was stealing out the door, softly humming the Song to herself. In her hand was the crystal globe from his satchel. For a moment, he hesitated, about to cry out. How did she know the Song? Was she aware that he had murdered another boy to get the globe?\nSomehow he knew that she was helping him, that she knew all and loved him and sought only to protect him.\nThe next day, and the next week, and the next month were all the same. No one spoke very much, and when they did it was to suggest new places to look for the missing boy. Everywhere had been searched thoroughly. Tay was curious why they never looked in the gorge, but he understood how inaccessible it was.\nA side-effect of Vaster's absence was that the tutorial sessions with Kena Gafrisi took on a more serious, even academic quality. The younger boy's high spirits and meager attentiveness had always cut the lessons short, but sensible Baynarah and quiet Tay were ideal pupils. He was particularly impressed by how focused they became during a rather dry history lecture about the heraldic symbols of Houses of Morrowind.\n\u201cThe crest of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; features a scale,\u201d he sniffed disdainfully. \u201cThey see themselves as the great compromisers, as if that were something honorable. Many hundreds of years ago, they were the tribesmen following &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; who chose--\u201c\n\u201cPardon me, Kena,\u201d asked Baynarah. \u201cBut what is the crest with the insect on it?\u201d\n\u201cYou don't know &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;?\u201d asked the tutor, lifting up one of the shields. \u201cI know you have a sheltered life on Gorne, but you're surely old enough to recognize--\"\n\u201cNot that one, Kena,\u201d replied Tay. \u201cI think she means the other crest with an insect.\u201d\n\u201cI see,\u201d nodded Kena Gafrisi, brow furrowed. \u201cYes, you would be too young to have ever seen the crest of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House of Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. Our enemies together with the accursed heretical &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;War of the Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, now totally destroyed, thanks be to Lord, Mother, and Wizard. That House was a curse on our land for millennia, and when at last their pestilence was snuffed out, the very earth itself breathed a cloud of fire and ash in relief, bringing night to day for over a year's time.\u201d\nBaynarah and Tay knew they could not speak, but they exchanged knowing glances at one another as the tutor enlarged on the theme of the great wickedness of the Dwemer and the House Dagoth. As soon as the lesson ended, they walked silently out of Sandil House until they were far from all ears and eyes.\nThe afternoon sun stretched out the shadows of the spear-like trees surrounding the meadow. Off in the distance, they could hear the sounds of the workers beginning their preparations for the autumntide harvest, yelling to one another unintelligibly in coarse and familiar accents.\n\u201cThat was definitely the symbol on that shield you found at the garbage heap,\u201d Baynarah said at last. \u201cEverything there must be a remnant of the House Dagoth.\u201d\nTay nodded. His mind was on the strange crystal globe. He felt a light vibration of soundless music touch his body, and knew he was discovering a new cadence of the Song.\n\u201cWhy would our people have burned and discarded all that?\u201d he asked thoughtfully. \u201cDo you think the House Dagoth was so evil that everything associated with them could have been cursed?\u201d\nBaynarah laughed. At the height of day, all talk of curses and the evil Sixth House were pure supposition: something to add romance to one's life, but nothing to worry about. The two children walked back to the castle for yet another in a series of cold, quiet dinners. As the night fell, Baynarah looked through the treasures she had picked up in the junk heap. By the light of the moons, the small jars, the torc with orange gemstones, the bits of tarnished silver and gold of no obvious purpose, all took on a sinister aspect.\nRevulsion overtook her feeling of admiration instantly. There was a strange energy to them, a tincture of death and corruption that was undeniable. Baynarah ran to the window and vomited.\nLooking out to the dark open lawn below, she saw a figure below lighting an arrangement of candles in the shape of a large insect, the symbol of the House Dagoth. When it looked in her direction, she pulled back, but she saw the face illuminated by the tallows. It was Edebah, Tay's nursemaid.\nThe next morning, Baynarah left the castle grounds early, bearing a large sack filled with her treasures. She carried them to the dumping ground and left them there. Then she returned, and told her Uncle Triffith what she had seen the night before, leaving out only what had made her sick in the first place.\nEdebah was banished from the isle of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; without discussion. She wept, begging to be allowed to say goodbye to Tay, but all believed that would be too dangerous. When Tay asked what had become of her, he was told she had to return to her family on the mainland. He had grown too old for a nursemaid.\nBaynarah never told him what she knew. For she was afraid."}
{"id": "9757", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9757", "title": "Poison Song, Book III", "text": "Poison Song, Book III is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nContents.\nTay was eighteen in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20685\"&gt;685&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; when he first saw &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, the city of spires, home of the goddess. His cousin Kalkorith, already a senior initiate in the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, gave him a couple rooms on the ground floor of the house he had purchased. They were small and unfurnished, but bittergreen grew outside the windows, and when the wind blew, they filled his bedroom with a lovely spicy air.\nThe chords of the Song did not trouble him anymore. Sometimes he was even unconscious to it, so low and melodic it had become. Occasionally when he was passing through the streets on the way to the Temple for his instruction, someone would pass him and the Song would rise in intensity before falling away again. Whatever was different about those people, Tay never tried to ascertain. He remembered the last time he had let the Song lead him, and called for him to murder his young cousin Vaster. The memory did not trouble him unduly, but he did not want to hurt anyone again unless he had to.\nHouse couriers regularly brought Tay letters from Baynarah, still back in Sandil House on the island of Gorne. She might have gone to study at the Temple, she was certainly intelligent enough, but she chose not to. In a year or two at most, she would have to leave and assume her place in House Indoril, but she was not in a hurry. Tay welcomed the trivial gossipy news the letters brought, and responded back with news of his own studies and romances.\nIn his third month in Mournhold, he had already met a girl. She was also a student at the Temple, and her name was Acra. Tay wrote enthusiastically about her to Baynarah, describing her as having the mind of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, the wit of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and the beauty of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. Baynarah replied back merrily that if she had known how blasphemous students of the Temple were allowed to be, she might have become an initiate herself.\n\u201cYou are very devoted to your cousin,\u201d Acra laughed when Tay showed her the letter. \u201cAm I looking at the last remains of a thwarted romance?\u201d\n\u201cShe's lovely, but I never thought of her that way,\u201d Tay scoffed. \u201cIncest never particularly interested me.\u201d\n\u201cIs she a very close cousin then?\u201d\nTay thought for a moment: \u201cI don't know. Truthfully, no one spoke much of either her parents or mine, so I really don't know how we were connected. They were casualties of the War of the Red Mountain, that I know, and it seemed to cast rather a pall on the adults' humor whenever we asked about her parents or mine. After a while, we stopped asking. But you're an Indoril too. Perhaps you're a closer cousin to me than Baynarah.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d Acra smiled, rising from her chair. She uncoiled her hair, which had been pulled up in the formal arrangement reserved for well-born priestesses. As Tay watched transfigured, she removed the small brooch that fastened her robe to her shoulder cape. The soft silken fabric slipped down slowly, exposing her dark, slender body to him for the first time. \u201cIf we are, does incest particularly interest you now?\u201d\nAs they made love, the Song began a slow, rhythmic ascension in Tay's head. The vision of Acra before him darkened and was replaced by images from his nightmares before returning again. When finally he collapsed, spent, the room seemed filled with the fiery red clouds of his dream, and the scream of the woman and her child facing death echoed in his head. He opened his eyes, and there was Acra, smiling at him. Tay kissed her, grateful to have her in his arms.\nFor the next two weeks, Tay and Acra were never far apart. Even when they were at study in opposite wings of the Temple, Tay thought of her, and somehow knew she was thinking of him. They would rush to be together afterwards, ravishing one another in his rooms every night, and in a private corner of the Temple garden every day.\nIt was while Tay was rushing to see his beloved one afternoon that the Song rose up in powerful strident tones at the approach of an old, ragged woman. He closed his eyes and tried to quiet it, but when he looked again at her purchasing corkbulb papyrus from a street vendor, he knew who she was. His old nursemaid from &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, Edebah. She who had abandoned him without even a farewell to join her family on the mainland.\nShe didn't see him, and as she passed down the street, Tay turned and began to follow. They walked through shadowy passageways into the very poorest part of the city, a quarter which was as alien to him as the wildest principality of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. She unlocked a small wooden door on a street without a name, and he finally called out her name. She didn't turn, but when he followed, he found that the door had been left ajar.\nThe chamber was murky and damp like a cave. She stood facing him, her face even more wrinkled than he had remembered it, etched with lines of sorrow. He closed the door behind him, and she took his hand and kissed it.\n\u201cYou are so tall and strong,\u201d Edebah said, beginning to weep. \u201cI should have killed myself before I let them take me away from you.\u201d\n\u201cHow is your family?\u201d Tay asked coldly.\n\u201cYou are my only family,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; pigs forced me to leave, thrusting their blades in my face, when they discovered that I serve you and your family, not them. That bitch girl Baynarah saw me at a prayer of mourning.\u201d\n\u201cYou're speaking like a madwoman,\u201d Tay sneered. \u201cHow could you love me and my family, but hate the House Indoril? I am of the House Indoril.\u201d\n\u201cYou are old enough to know the truth,\u201d Edebah said fiercely. Tay had bitterly joked about her madness, but he saw something close to it burning in her ancient eyes. \u201cYou were not born of House Indoril; they brought you into their house after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;, like they and the other Houses brought in all the orphans. It was the only way they saw to erase history and remove all traces of their enemies, by raising their enemies as one of them.\u201d\nTay turned toward the door: \u201cI can see why you were taken away from Gorne, old woman. You are delusional.\u201d\n\u201cWait!\u201d Edebah cried, rushing to a musty cabinet. She retrieved from it a glass globe that shimmered with a spectrum of color even in the chamber's gloom. \u201cDo you remember this? You slew that little boy Vaster because he possessed it, and I took it from your room because you were not ready to face the facts of your inheritance and responsibility then. Did you not wonder why this bauble drew you so?\u201d\nTay gasped, and though he did not want to, he said, \u201cI hear a Song sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the Song of your ancestors, of your true family,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cYou must not fight it, for it is a song of destiny. It will lead you to do what must be done.\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Tay howled, \u201cEverything you say is a lie! You're insane!\u201d\nEdebah threw the globe to the ground with all her might, shattering it with a deafening retort. The shards melted into the air. All that was left was a small silver ring, simply wrought with a flat crown. The old woman quietly picked it up and handed it to him, while he stood with his back against the door, trembling.\n\u201cThis is your inheritance, as the bearer of the Sixth House.\u201d\nThe ring's crown was meant for stamping and sealing official House proclamations. Tay had seen his uncle Triffith's similar ring, crested with the wing which was the seal of House Indoril. This ring was different, with an insect design which he remembered from the day when Kena Gafrisi had taught the House heraldry to Baynarah and him.\nIt was the symbol of the accursed House Dagoth.\nThe Song took over all of Tay's senses. He heard its music, smelled its horror, tasted its sadness, felt its power, and the only thing he could see before him was the flames of its destruction. When he took the ring and placed it on his finger, his mind was not aware of what he was doing. Nor was Tay aware of anything but the Song when he removed his dagger from its sheath and thrust it into his old nursemaid's heart.\nTay did not even hear her final words, when Edebah fell bleeding to the ground, and groaned with a blood-streaked smile, \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWhen the veil of the Song lifted, Tay did not realize at first he was no longer dreaming. Before him had been flames, the very ones that destroyed the home of his birth, and flames were before him again. But they were flames from a fire he had struck outside the crumbling tenement that were already bursting through walls, consuming the body of his old nursemaid.\nTay fled through the streets as people began to call for the guards."}

It concerned some minutiae of theosophy that she did not believe in, but nevertheless found morbidly compelling. When the door opened and she heard Tay enter, she finished the paragraph she was reading before looking up.\n\u201cI've been here for hours, darling. If I knew you were going to be so late, I would have brought more books,\u201d she giggled. When she saw Tay's face and the state of his clothing, her manner lost all frivolity. \u201cWhat happened to you? Are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cI've been to see my old childhood nursemaid, Edebah,\u201d he said in a strange voice. \u201cIt was a sudden change of plans. I hadn't realized she was in Mournhold.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I had known where you were going,\u201d she said, rising slowly from her chair. \u201cI would have loved to have met her.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it's too late now. I've killed her.\u201d\nAcra inhaled deeply, studying Tay's frozen face. She took his hand. \u201cPerhaps you ought to tell me everything.\u201d\nTay let his beloved lead him to the hearth, where he sat blinking at the fire. He looked down at the silver ring on his finger. \u201cBefore I killed her, she gave me this. It's the sealing ring of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. She told me I was the bearer of the inheritance, and the Song I hear all the time in my head, the one that called me to kill another boy when I was young, and then Edebah herself, is the Song of my ancestors.\u201d\nTay fell silent. Acra knelt by his side, stroking his ringed hand. \u201cTell me more.\u201d\n\u201cMy tutor Kena Gafrisi taught us that the House Dagoth was a curse on &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He said that when they were all destroyed at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;War&lt;/a&gt;, the very earth itself breathed in relief,\u201d Tay closed his eyes. \u201cI can see the obliteration. I can even hear it in the Song. Edebah told me that the five Houses adopted the orphan children of Dagoth, raising them in their own traditions. I thought she was mad or a liar, but the real lie was all those years I thought my family was &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Acra whispered.\n\u201cWell, Edebah told me to follow the Song to my destiny,\u201d Tay laughed bitterly. \u201cBut the Song led me to kill her, so I don't know if she'd still give me that recommendation now. I know that I need to leave Mournhold. Before I knew what I was doing, I set a fire in her tenement. The guards were called. I just don't know where I'd go.\u201d\n\u201cYou have many friends to shield you if you prove yourself to be the new leader of the return of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d Acra kissed the ring. \u201cI will help you find them.\u201d\nTay stared at her. \u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you thought I was your cousin of the House Indoril, you did not mind having me though it might well have been incestuous,\u201d Acra replied, meeting his eyes. \u201cI have heard the Song too. It is not as strong with me as it was with you, but I never chose to ignore it. It taught me more than the ridiculous Temple priests and priestesses ever could. I knew that my true name was &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Acra\"&gt;Dagoth-Acra&lt;/a&gt;, and I knew that I had a brother.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tay said through gritted teeth. \u201cYou're lying.\u201d\n\u201cYou are &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\nTay shoved Acra hard against the wall and ran from the room. As he fled through the hall, he heard the sound of Kalkorith's footfall on the stairs behind him, a percussive instrument in the Song that was rising in his heart and head\n\u201cCousin,\u201d the senior initiate was saying. \u201cHave you heard about the fire--\"\nTay unsheathed his dagger and turned, burying it to the hilt in Kalkorith's throat. \u201cCousin,\u201d he hissed. \u201cI am not your cousin.\u201d\nThe streets of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; were lit by the red glow of the tenement fire, spreading through the tight alleyways by a steady and intense gust of wind. It was as if &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt; himself was looming over the city, fanning the flames his heir had struck. A House guard, running toward the blaze, stopped at the sight of Tay, standing uncertainly, swaying, before the front door of Kalkorith's house, a bloodied blade in his hand.\n\u201cWhat you done, serjo?\u201d\nTay ran for the forest, his cape whipping behind him by the force of the howling wind. The guard clambered after him, sword drawn. He had no need to investigate the house to see the murder. He knew.\nFor hours, Tay raced through the wilderness, the Song pushing him onward. The sound of his pursuer faded away. At last, the trees thinned, and he saw nothing before him but air and water. A cliff, a hundred foot long plunge into the Inner Sea.\nThe Song told him no. It pulled him north, sweetly promising a place to rest among friends. More than friends -- people who would worship him as the heir of Dagoth. As he slowly walked toward the edge of the cliff, the Song became more threatening, warning him not to seek to avoid his fate. There was no escape in death.\nTay spat a curse upon his House and threw himself head first over the cliff.\nIt was another glorious day on the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;, the first one in weeks that Baynarah could truly enjoy. Uncle Triffith had important company, Housemen from far away, and she had been required to attend every dinner, every meeting, every ceremony. As a child, she remembered, she had hoped for some attention. Now nothing was more blissful than time away from her duties.\nThere was only one thing she wanted to do that she had to do indoors, and that was writing a letter to her cousin. But that could wait until the evening, she told herself. After all, he had not written her in many days. It was the influence of that girl, Acra. Not that she seemed disagreeable, but Baynarah knew how one's first love can be all-consuming. At least, she had read about it.\nAs she walked idly through the wildflower meadow, Baynarah was so distracted with her thoughts that she did not hear her maid Hillima calling. She was quite startled when she turned to see the young servant running up.\n\u201cSerjo,\u201d she said, breathlessly. \u201cPlease come! Someone has washed up on the shore! It's your cousin, &lt;a href=\"Serjo\"&gt;Serjo&lt;/a&gt; Indoril-Tay!\u201d"}

He was feverish, neither asleep nor awake, screaming at invisible phantoms. The healers complimented the young man's fortitude. Bodies had washed ashore on the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; several times, many during the War, but never once had they seen one that lived afterwards.\nAunt Ulliah came in several times to bring Baynarah food: \u201cYou must be careful, dear, or when he's all well, he'll have to attend you on your sickbed.\u201d\nTay's fever broke, and at last he was able to open his eyes and see the young woman with whom he had spent seventeen years, all but the first year of his life. She smiled at him, and called for food. In silence, she helped him eat.\n\u201cI knew you wouldn't die, cousin,\u201d she whispered fondly.\n\u201cI hoped to, but somehow I knew I wouldn't either,\u201d he groaned. \u201cBaynarah, do you remember all those nightmares I told you about? They're all true.\u201d\n\u201cWe can talk about it when you've rested some more.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he croaked. \u201cI must tell you everything now, so you'll know what kind of a monster you call your dear cousin Tay. If there was some way you could have known before, you might not have been so eager to see me well again.\u201d\nA tear rolled Baynarah's cheek. She had grown into a beauty, even in the few months he had been away in Mournhold. \u201cHow can you think I would stop loving you, no matter what you've done?\u201d\n\u201cI saw my old nursemaid Edebah, and spoke to her.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Baynarah had feared this moment. \u201cTay, I don't know what she told you, but it was all my fault. You remember when Kena Grafisi taught us about the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, and its corruption. That night, I saw your nursemaid making some kind of altar out on the north lawn, using the symbol of the Sixth House. She must have been doing it for years, but I never knew what it meant. I told Uncle Triffith, and he sent her away. I've wanted to tell you so many times now, but I was afraid to. She was so devoted to you.\u201d\nTay smiled. \u201cAnd didn't it frighten you even more to wonder if there was any connection between her devotion to me, and her devotion to the accursed House? I know you, Baynarah. You're not one of those women who doesn't choose to use her mind.\u201d\n\u201cTay, I don't know what she told you, but I think she was very troubled, and whatever she thought about you and the Sixth House was wrong. You have to remember that. The ramblings of one madwoman are proof of nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThere's more,\u201d Tay sighed, and held up his hand. For a moment he blinked, and then turned to Baynarah angrily. \u201cWhat happened to my ring? If you saw it, you must have known already that everything I'm saying to you is true.\u201d\n\u201cI threw the filthy thing away,\u201d Baynarah stood up. \u201cTay, I'm going to let you rest now.\u201d\n\u201cI am the heir of House Dagoth,\u201d Tay was wild-eyed, almost screaming. \u201cRaised after the War as &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, but driven by the Song of my ancestors. When we were young, I killed Vaster because the Song told me he had stolen my inheritance. When Edebah told me who I was and gave me this ring, I killed her and burned her house to the ground, because the Song told me she had served her purpose. When I returned to Kalkorith's house, my love was there, telling me that she was of the House Dagoth too, and my sister. I fled, and when Kalkorith tried to stop me, I slew him, because the Song told me he was an enemy.\u201d\n\u201cTay, stop,\u201d Baynarah sobbed. \u201cI don't believe a word of it. You've been feverish...\u201d\n\u201cNot Tay,\u201d he shook his head, breathing heavily. \u201cThe name my parents gave me was &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d\n\u201cYou can't have killed Edebah, you loved her. And Vaster and Kalkorith? They were our cousins!\u201d\n\u201cThey were not my true cousins,\u201d Tay said coldly. \u201cThe Song told me they were my foes. Just as it's telling me now that you're my foe, but I won't listen. And I'll keep from listening... as long as I can.\u201d\nBaynarah fled from the room, slamming the door behind her. She took a key from the her startled maid Hillima, and secured the lock.\n\u201cSerjo &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;-Baynarah,\u201d Hillima whispered, with great sympathy. \u201cIs all well with your cousin, Serjo Indoril-Tay?\u201d\n\u201cHe'll be perfectly fine once he rests,\u201d Baynarah recovered her dignity, wiping the tears from her face. \u201cNo one is to disturb him under any circumstances. I'll take the key with me. Now I have much work to do. I don't suppose anyone's spoken to the fishermen about restocking Sandil House's supplies?\u201d\n\u201cI don't know, serjo,\u201d said the maid. \u201cI don't think so.\u201d\nBaynarah marched down to the docks, and relieved her troubled heart the only way she knew how, by concentrating on small things. Tay's words never left her, but she found temporary comfort talking to the fishermen about their haul, helping determine how much should be smoked, how much should be sent to the village, how much should be delivered fresh to the House larder.\nHer aunt Ulliah joined the discussion, oblivious to Baynarah's well-disguised agony. Together, they discussed how many provisions Uncle Triffith and his commanders had devoured during their weeks on the island, when they would be expected to return, and how best to prepare. One of the fishermen on the docks called out, interrupting.\n\u201cA boat is coming!\u201d\nUlliah and Baynarah greeted the visitor as she arrived. It was a young woman dressed in the robes of a Temple priestess. As she docked her small boat, Baynarah marveled at how beautiful she was, and strangely familiar.\n\u201cWelcome to Gorne,\u201d said Baynarah. \u201cI am Indoril-Baynarah and this is my aunt Indoril-Ulliah. Have we met before?\u201d\n\u201cI don't believe so, serjo,\u201d the woman bowed. \u201cI was sent by the Temple to inquire whether word had come from your cousin, Indoril-Tay. He has been missing from his classes for some days now, and the priests have become concerned.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we should have sent word,\u201d Ulliah fretted. \u201cHe came here a few days ago, half-drowned. He's better now. Let us escort you up to the house.\u201d\n\u201cTay's resting now, and I asked that he not be disturbed,\u201d Baynarah stammered. \u201cActually, I know it's dreadful manners, but I need to talk to my aunt for a moment. Would it be too terrible if I asked you to wait for us at the house? You have only to follow the path up the hill and across the lawn.\u201d\nThe priestess bowed again humbly, and began the walk. Ulliah was scandalized.\n\u201cYou know better than to treat a representative of the Temple that way,\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou can't be so exhausted from tending your cousin to have lost all sense of civility.\u201d\n\u201cAunt Ulliah,\u201d Baynarah whispered, drawing the woman away from the ears of the fishermen. \u201cIs Tay truly my cousin? He believes himself to be ... of the House Dagoth.\u201d\nUlliah took a moment to respond. \u201cIt's true. You were just a baby yourself during the War, so you couldn't know what it was like. There was not a part of Morrowind that wasn't ravaged. There was even a battle here on the island. Do you remember that burned pile of wreckage you and Tay and poor little Vaster discovered so many years ago? That was the remains. And after the War, when that accursed House was finally defeated, we saw the little innocents, the orphans whose only crime had been born to wicked parents. I admit there were some in our armies, the combined forces of the Houses, who would have had them all slaughtered to annihilate the legacy of Dagoth. In the end, compassion prevailed, and the children of the Sixth House were adopted into the other five. And so we thought that we had won the war and the peace.\u201d\n\u201cBy the Mother, Lord, and Wizard, if all that Tay believes is true, then there is no peace,\u201d Baynarah trembled. \u201cHe claims that the Song of his ancestors called to him, and forced him to slay three people, two of them our Housemen. Cousin Kalkorith and ... when he was a little boy ... Vaster.\u201d\nUlliah held her hands over her tearful face and could not speak.\n\u201cAnd it is only beginning,\u201d said Baynara. \u201cThe Song still calls to him. He said there were others who knew, who would help him raise up the Sixth House. His sister...\u201d\n\u201cIt must be an evil fantasy,\u201d Ulliah murmured. She noticed that Baynarah's gaze was now upon the path leading from the docks towards the house. \u201cNiece, what are you thinking?\u201d\n\u201cDid that priestess give us her name?\u201d\nThe two women ran up the path, calling for guards. The fishermen, who had never seen the mistresses of the house so undone, looked briefly at one another and then followed quickly behind, pulling out their hooks and blades.\nThe front gate to Sandil House stood wide open, the first of the corpses lying close within. It was now an abattoir, painted fresh with blood. There was Aner, uncle Triffith's valet, gutted but still seated at the foyer table where he had been enjoying his afternoon glass of &lt;a href=\"Flin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;flin&lt;/a&gt;. Leryne, one of the chambermaids, had been decapitated while carrying some once-clean linens up the stairs. The bodies of guards and servants sprawled about the hall like blown leaves. At the top of the stairs, Baynarah had to hold back a sob when she saw Hillima. She lay like a broken doll, slain as she tried to pull herself out onto the narrow window ledge.\nNo one spoke, not Baynarah, nor Aunt Ulliah, nor the fishermen, as they walked slowly through the blood-drenched house. They passed Tay's sick-room, its door broken open, and no one within. When they heard the sound of footsteps in Baynarah's room down the hall, they approached slowly, cautiously, with great dread.\nThe priestess from the docks was standing by the bed. In her hand was the silver ring Baynarah had taken from Tay's finger. In her other hand was a long, curved blade, splashed like her once pristine gown, with gore. She smiled prettily and bowed when she saw she was no longer alone.\n\u201cAcra, I should have recognized you by Tay's description in his letters,\u201d Baynarah said in her steadiest voice. \u201cWhere is my cousin?\u201d\n\u201cI prefer to call myself &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Acra\"&gt;Dagoth-Acra&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d she replied. \u201cYour false cousin, my true brother, has already gone to fulfill his destiny. I'm sorry you were not here so he could give you a more permanent farewell.\u201d\nBaynarah's face twisted in fury. She motioned for the fishermen, who advanced with their weaponry. \u201cTear her apart.\u201d\n\u201cThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt; will rise again, and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt; will lead us!\u201d Acra laughed. Her words were still echoing as she gave the sign of &lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt; and vanished like a ghost."}

Commander Jasrat watched it slowly disappear into the horizon as he led the caravan southwestward. It was a strange practice for him to lead a night operation, but scarcely more bizarre than anything else he was facing. He was only seventy years of age, far from old for a Bosmer, and yet he felt like he belonged to another era.\nHe had known the land of east &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; his entire life. Every forest, every garden, every small village between &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; had been home to him. But now it was all different, twisted into a world he did not recognize since the eruption and the year of &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;. It made night travel all the more treacherous, but it was a risk he was ordered to take.\nThe ashmire appeared quite suddenly. If a sharp-sighted scout hadn't seen it and given the signal, the entire caravan might have been swallowed whole. Jasrat cursed. It had not been on the map, but that was hardly surprising.\nIt was a huge unnamed scathe stretching as far as anyone could see. The commander considered his options. He might lead his party to the southeast toward &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; and then try an approach due west. As he consulted his map, he noticed a glimmer of a campfire in the distance. Accompanied by his lieutenants, Jasrat drove his guar forward to investigate what appeared to be an Ashlander man and woman.\n\u201cThis is no longer your realm,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cDon't you know it's been ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; that these are House lands now?\u201d\nThe couple shuffled to their feet, and began quietly walking away, toward a narrow ridge between hill and ashmire. Jasrat called them back.\n\u201cDo you know a way around the scathe?\u201d he asked. They nodded, their eyes still to the ground. Jasrat signaled to his caravan. \u201cYou will lead us then.\u201d\nIt was a treacherous winding crossing, almost too tight for the guars. The wagons themselves scraped as the drivers pulled to avoid the ashmire. The Ashlander man and woman whispered to one another as they led the caravan.\n\u201cWhat are you mumbling about, n'wah?\u201d Jasrat hollered.\nThe man did not turn around. \u201cMy sister and I were talking about the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; rebellion, and she was guessing that you were bringing arms to the stronghold at &lt;a href=\"Falensarano%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Falensarano&lt;/a&gt;, which is why you chose to cross the ashmire rather than taking a road.\u201d\n\u201cI might have known,\u201d Jasrat laughed. \u201cYou &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; are so hopeful whenever you see signs of trouble in the Houses and the Temple. I hate to dampen your spirits, but what you're speaking of is hardly a rebellion. Merely a few isolated incidents of... unpleasantness. Tell your sister that.\u201d\nAs they plodded onward, the narrow ridge began to taper even more. The Ashlanders found a low jagged crevasse in the hills, a crack from a lava flow even predating &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;. The caravan scored the rock walls at it moved through. Commander Jasrat, after twenty years of uncertainty in a land he did not understand, felt a twinge of his old instinct. This, he thought to himself, would be a fine place for an ambush.\n\u201cAshlander, how close are we?\u201d he shouted.\n\u201cWe've arrived,\u201d &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt; replied, and gave the signal.\nThe assault was over in mere minutes, as it had been calculated from the start. When the last body of the House guard had sunk beneath the ashmire, only then was the inventory of the caravan revealed. It was better than they had hoped, virtually everything the rebellion needed. Daedric swords, dozens of suits of armor, quivers of fine ebony bolts, and rations enough to last for weeks.\n\u201cGo on ahead to the camp,\u201d Tython smiled at his sister. \u201cI'll lead the caravan. We should be there within a few hours' time.\u201d\n&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Acra\"&gt;Acra&lt;/a&gt; kissed him passionately, and gave the sign of &lt;a href=\"Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt;. In an instant, she was back in her tent, exactly as she had left it. Humming the Song, she removed the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; rags and chose an appropriately diaphanous gown from her trunks. Precisely the sort of dress Tython would love seeing her in when he returned.\n\u201cMuorasa!\u201d she called to her servant. \u201cSummon the troops together! Tython and the others will be here very soon with all the weapons and rations we need!\u201d\n\u201cMuorasa can't hear you now,\u201d said a voice Acra hadn't heard in weeks. She turned, expertly removed every trace of surprise from her face. It was indeed Indoril-Baynarah, but not the quivering creature she had left behind at the massacre at Sandil House. This woman was an armored warrior, who spoke with mocking confidence. \u201cShe wouldn't be able to summon the troops if she could. You may have weapons and rations, Acra, but there's no one left to arm or feed.\u201d\nDagoth-Acra made the sign of Recall, but nothing happened.\n\u201cThe moment we heard you banging around in the tent, my &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s cast a diffusion of all magicka,\u201d Baynara smiled, opening the tent further to invite a dozen House soldiers in. \u201cYou won't be leaving.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think that my brother will walk into your trap, you underestimate his allegiance to the Song,\u201d Acra sneered. \u201cIt tells him everything he needs to know. I have convinced him to no longer fight it, and let it lead him and us to our ultimate victory.\u201d\n\u201cI've known him longer and better than you ever did,\u201d said Baynarah coldly. \u201cNow, I want to hear what the Song is saying to you. I want to know where I can find Tay.\u201d\n\u201cTython, my lady,\u201d Acra corrected her. \u201cHe is no longer a slave to your House and the Temple's lies. You can torture me all you wish, but I swear to you the next time you see him, it will be because he wishes it, not you. And that will be your very last moment alive.\u201d\n\u201cDon't you worry, serjo,\u201d Baynarah's nightblade winked at her. \u201cEveryone says they won't break under torture, but everyone always does.\u201d\nBaynarah left the tent. It was all a part of warfare, she understood that, but there would be little relish in witnessing it. She could not even watch as the House soldiers disposed of the rebel corpses. She had hoped she would grow numb to the bloodshed after weeks of following Tython and Acra, massacre after massacre. It didn't matter to her that now the bodies were of her enemies. Death was still death.\nShe had only been in her tent for a few minutes when her &lt;a href=\"nightblade\"&gt;nightblade&lt;/a&gt; appeared.\n\u201cNot so tough as she appeared, that one,\u201d he grinned. \u201cIn point of fact, all I had to do is ask her nice and point my dagger at her belly, and she was blubbering everything. Not too surprising really. It's always the ones that talk big that crumble fast. I remember way back a couple years ago, before you was even born -\u201c\n\u201cGaruan, what did she say?\u201d Baynarah asked.\n\u201cThe Song, whatever that is, told her brother that she got herself caught, and not to return to camp,\u201d the nightblade replied, only a trifle annoyed at having his fascinating story cut short. \u201cHe's got a half dozen mer with him, and they're going to try to assassinate the fella that led the Indoril army in the War. General Indoril-Triffith.\u201d\n\u201cUncle Triffith,\u201d Baynarah gasped. \u201cWhere is he stationed now?\u201d\n\u201cI'm not sure myself, serjo. Do you want me to ask if she knows?\u201d\n\u201cI'll come with you,\u201d said Baynarah. As they walked towards Acra's tent, cries of alarm sounded. The situation became abundantly clear even before they reached the site. Three guards were dead, and the prisoner had escaped.\n\u201cInteresting woman,\u201d said Garuan. \u201cWeak heart, but a strong arm. Should we send word of warning to General Indoril-Triffith?\u201d\n\u201cIf we can find where he is in time,\u201d said Baynarah."}

Metaphors the poets used fell rather flat in his view. A festering wound it could be called with its blood-like lava. The King of Ash, too, could be applied, when one looked at its perpetual crown of smoke. And yet, none of that would do, for nothing in his experience could convey the sheer magnitude of the mountain. &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; was many miles away from the fortress, and yet it filled the horizon utterly.\nBefore he could feel too small, however, he heard his name being called within. It was some consolation that though he was insignificant compared to the mountain, he was still in possession of certain power and influence.\n\u201cGeneral &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Triffith\"&gt;Triffith&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d said Commander Rael. \u201cThere's trouble at the east gate.\u201d\nThe trouble was scarcely more than a skirmish. An &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, drunk perhaps on &lt;a href=\"shein%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shein&lt;/a&gt;, had begun a fight with the House guards at the back gate. As they tried to drive him away, his cousins joined him, and soon there were six Ashlanders altogether brawling with a dozen of Triffith's guards. If the n'wahs had not been well-armed, the fight could have been finished almost before it began. As it was, by the time the General arrived with more of his guards, two of the Ashlanders were dead and the others had taken flight.\n\u201cIt's the smoke in their brains,\u201d Rael shrugged. \u201cMakes them mad.\u201d\nTriffith climbed back up the stairs and returned to his chamber to dress for dinner. General &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Vorilk\"&gt;Vorilk&lt;/a&gt; and Counselor &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Nothoc\"&gt;Nothoc&lt;/a&gt; would be arriving very shortly to discuss the Temple's plans for reorganizing the House lands of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; was to be renamed &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. A great new city in honor of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; was to be built, but with whose &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;? It made his head hurt. There were so many details, a long night of argument, threats, and compromises were ahead.\nThe General's mind was so occupied that he nearly put his House robes on backwards. He also did not notice the shadowy figure steal out from behind the tapestry and close the door to the bedchamber. It was not until Triffith heard the sound of the latch-bolt fall that he turned around.\n\u201cSlipped in when I was distracted by the fracas at the back gate. Very clever, Tay,\u201d he said simply. \u201cOr do you call yourself &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Tython\"&gt;Dagoth-Tython&lt;/a&gt; these days?\u201d\n\u201cYou should know all my names,\u201d the young man snarled, unsheathing his sword. \u201cI was Tython before you butchered my family and sought to dispel my tribe. I was Tay when you brought me into your House to &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; me against my own people. Now you may call me Vengeance.\u201d\nThere was a knock on the door. Tython and Triffith did not move their eyes from one another. The knocking became a loud pounding. \u201cGeneral Indoril-Triffith, are you well? Is there something wrong?\u201d\n\u201cIf you're going to kill me, boy, you'd best do it quickly,\u201d Triffith growled. \u201cMy men will have that door down in two minutes.\u201d\n\u201cYou don't tell me what to do, 'Uncle,'\u201d Tython shook his head. \u201cI have the Song of my ancestors to instruct me. It tells me you made my father beg for his life before you killed him, and I want to see you do the same.\u201d\n\u201cIf your ancestors are all-knowing,\u201d Triffith smiled. \u201cWhy are they all dead?\u201d\nTython made an inhuman noise in the back of his throat and advanced. The door began to buckle at the pounding, but it was sturdy and secure. The general's estimate of its life expectancy at two minutes seemed clearly erroneous.\nThe pounding suddenly stopped. A familiar voice replaced the sound.\n\u201cTay,\u201d called &lt;a href=\"Baynarah\"&gt;Baynarah&lt;/a&gt;. \u201cListen to me.\u201d\nTython smirked, \u201cYou're just in time to hear your uncle beg for his miserable life, 'cousin.' I was afraid you'd be too late. The next sound you'll hear will be the death rattle of the man who slaved my House.\u201d\n\u201cThe Song is what's enslaved you, not Uncle Triffith. You can't trust it. It's poisoning you. It let you be manipulated first by that mad old woman, and now by that evil witch &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Acra\"&gt;Acra&lt;/a&gt; who calls herself your sister.\u201d\nTython pressed the tip of his sword so it touched the general's throat. The older man stepped backwards and Tython advanced. His eyes followed the length of his arm to the grip of the blade. The silver ring of Dagoth caught the red light of the volcano from the battlements outside the window.\n\u201cTay, please don't hurt anyone anymore. Please. If you just listen to me, and not the Song just a moment, you'll know what's right. I love you.\u201d Baynarah stifled her sobs to keep her voice clear and calm. There was a noise on the stairwell behind her. The general's guard had finally arrived with the battering ram.\nThe door splintered and burst open in two strikes. General Indoril-Triffith was holding his throat, staring out the window.\n\u201cUncle! Are you all right?\u201d Baynara ran to him. He nodded his head slowly, and removed his hand. There was only the barest of scratches on his neck. \u201cWhere's Tay?\u201d\n\u201cHe jumped out the window,\u201d said Triffith, pointing out into the distance where a figure was riding a guar toward the volcano. \u201cI thought he was going to kill himself, but he had an escape figured out.\u201d\n\u201cWe'll get him, serjo general,\u201d said Commander Rael, calling to the guards to get their mounts. Baynarah watched them go, and then kissed her uncle quickly and ran out to her own guar in the courtyard.\nSweat drenched Tay's body as he rode closer and closer toward the summit of Red Mountain. The &lt;a href=\"guar\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; was breathing hard, trudging along even more slowly, letting out little grunts of complaint about the heat. Finally, he abandoned his steed and began to climb the near vertical surface. Ash blew down the face of the volcano into his eyes. Near-blind, it was almost impossible to ignore the persistent, clamorous notes of the Song.\nA silken stream of crimson lava studded with crystalline formations surged a few feet away, close enough that Tay could feel his flesh begin to burn and blister. He turned from it, and saw a figure emerge through the smoke. Baynarah.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Tay?\u201d she cried over the howl of the volcano. \u201cDidn't I tell you not to listen to the Song?\u201d\n\u201cFor the first time, the Song and I both want the same thing!\u201d he yelled back. \u201cI can't ask you to forgive me, but please try to forget!\u201d\nHe pulled himself higher, out of Baynarah's sight. She screamed his name, scaling the rocks until she found she was close to the open crater. Waves of boiling gas washed over her, and she dropped to her knees, gasping. Through the rippling miasma, she saw Tay standing at the mouth of the volcano. Flames erupted from his clothes and hair. He turned to her just for a moment and smiled.\nThen he leapt.\nBaynarah was in a daze as she began the long, treacherous climb down the volcano. She began to think of the projects ahead. Were there enough provisions in storage at her house in &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; for the meeting of the Houses? The councilors were bound to stay there for weeks, maybe months. There was much work to be done. Slowly, as she descended, she began to forget. It would not last, but it would be a start.\n&lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Acra\"&gt;Dagoth-Acra&lt;/a&gt; stood as near to the mouth of the volcano as she could stand, blinking her eyes at the ash, soaked by the heat. She watched all, and smiled. On the ground was the silver ring with the seal of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. Tython had been sweating so much, it had slipped off. She picked it up and put it on her own finger. Touching her belly, she heard a new refrain of the Poison Song of Morrowind begin."}

Upon arrival, it becomes clear that the place has been overrun by hordes of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vermai%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Vermai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; walking around the area. Near the Weir Gate, the corpse of a mage is found, carrying two scrolls. The first being a letter for the Battlespire hero, and the second being the note to Mactana Greenway.\nThe Daedra inhabiting the location commonly carry Daedric Sigils of the \"Doht\" kind, which can be used to become Aethereal. A total of three Doht Sigils of Entry can also be found, which are used to progress through the level. Making their way to the room with the locked door, the Hero can find &lt;a href=\"Clarentavious%20Valisious\"&gt;Clarentavious Valisious&lt;/a&gt; in a secret room, hidden behind come metal cabinets. In order to unlock the door, five cogs are required, which can be found throughout the level. There are, similarly, five anchors which need to be closed in order to keep the Battlespire stable. One of which is already closed.\nPylon Room.\nThis room features a large glowing pylon. Despite some minor resistance by the Daedra, the room appears relatively empty. One of the walls, however, can be opened, leading to a Vermai and a Dremora, as well as a button. Pressing this button unlocks another area of the room, with the same enemies. Such buttons are seen a total of three times in this room, with the last one leading to a room with floating rocks.\nJumping over the rocks leads to a Dremora on a wooden platform, which will rise up to a storage room filled with potions as well as Vermai. Returning to the rock room, the Hero must find their way to the other side of the room and press the red button, which brings down a platform which can be used to access a hallway leading to another room. Here, several scamps and Vermai must be slain. The Hero also encounters two small purple orbs, which are used to restore health. One of the scamps also holds the required cog for the door to the Star Galley.\nStar Galley.\nThis room features a control panel, being protected by scamps and Dremora. A small chest can be found near one of the walls. A secret entrance to a hidden room is found by activating one of the three cabinets, leading to &lt;a href=\"Clarentavious%20Valisious\"&gt;Clarentavious Valisious&lt;/a&gt;. While Clarentavious has largely given up hope, he will provide the required passphrase for access to his quarters which can be accessed from the teleporter room, which is where one must head next. Any cogs which are carried can also be placed on the control panel, if all five are presented the door will open.\nLava Room.\nOne of the rooms which is found on the first level is a large room, below which pathways are seen crossing through lava. Turning to the left, the Hero will eventually reach a button, the pressing of which raises part of the pathway. A similar button is found on the right side of the pathway, allowing the Hero to reach the other side.\nAt the other side, there are four directions which can be followed. The first leads straight ahead, into a room with a scamp. This scamp holds on of the required cogs. After slaying the scamp, a button can be found which will take the Hero up with a platform. Several other buttons can be found here, which raise other platforms, and ultimately lead the Hero back to the Weir Gate. On the right side after leaving the room is one of the anchors which needs to be closed.\nThe second direction leads to a Vermai guarding an unlocked anchor point. Closing the anchor is necessary to progress further with the level.\nThe third direction leads to a large room consisting of several walls with scamps, and Vermai walking around. This section also includes a small storage area. In the middle of the room, a large stone structure can be found. In order to open the structure, a button on one of the walls must be pressed, which lifts the Hero up with a platform to another button, which unlocks the structure. Within the structure, two Vermai and the Dremora Lord &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Methats\"&gt;Methats&lt;/a&gt;, who carries a magical pauldron which can be shown to Clarentavious in return for a magical staff. Upon his death, the stone structure turns out to be a teleporter, leading to an area with four separate teleportation pads. Three of the four can be used at all times, with the fourth one requiring a password. If Clarentavious has been spoken to, the password to the fourth room can already be known, namely \"boustrophedon\". In his room, two scamps can be found, as well as some items and scrolls, including one of the required cogs.\nThe fourth direction leads to a large open room, where the corpse of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; Papr\u00e9 is found, as well as his slain owner, &lt;a href=\"Samar%20Starlover\"&gt;Samar Starlover&lt;/a&gt;, whose final message is found in his note the \"&lt;a href=\"Starlover%27s%20Log\"&gt;Starlover's Log&lt;/a&gt;\". Below the dragon, one of the five cogs can be found.\nWest Corridor.\nThe west corridor leads to several roped bridges, on the first of which the Doht Sigil can be seen. In order to pass through safely, a Doht Sigil of Entry must be acquired, a total of three of which can be found throughout the first level. In possession of the Sigil, the Hero can continue, fighting through Vermai and scamps to eventually come into contact with the Dremora &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Rathine\"&gt;Rathine&lt;/a&gt;. While he can be convinced to not harm the Hero, he carries one of the required cogs, and as such, must be killed. The small temple near Rathine contains two purple orbs, allowing for restoration.\n&lt;a href=\"Mock%20Turtle\"&gt;Mock Turtle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Mock Turtle can be found in the room of the Star Galley, below the teleporter itself is another small teleporter which will bring the Hero to the creature.\nNotable items.\nThe following books can be found in the first level:\nReward.\nAccess to &lt;a href=\"Level%202\"&gt;Level 2&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "1023190", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1023190", "title": "Level 2", "text": "Level 2 is the second &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; in .\nWalkthrough pre-teleport.\nLevel 2 starts at the other end of the teleporter used during level 1, and is unable to be used to transport back. At the teleporter, two potions can be found, as well as one of the \"&lt;a href=\"Letters%20for%20the%20Battlespire%20Hero\"&gt;Letters for the Battlespire Hero&lt;/a&gt;\". Moving out of the teleporter is a large room, with several ways to go. Four Sigil Keys are found here: Zyr, Meht, Roht and Web.\nBalcony.\nGoing straight from the teleporter and up the stairs is a small wooden balcony. Here both a chest and a scroll can be found.\nRight Hallway.\nTaking the path to the right leads to a crossing. \nOn the left path, &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;the Hero&lt;/a&gt; will come across one of the Sigils, which will damage them without the proper Sigil Key. Ignoring the room for now, the next room leads to what appears to be a dead end. However, a coffin next to some crates can be moved to reveal a hidden switch. Activating the switch opens a secret door, which leads to &lt;a href=\"Perthan%20Vorn\"&gt;Perthan Vorn&lt;/a&gt;, a strong &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Killing the beast results in obtaining the Sigil Amulet Meth Sigil of Entry.\nThe right path leads to a hastily formed barricade where &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; need to be fought. Eventually leading to a crossing, where one way leads to a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; in front of a fireplace, and the other leads down a longer hallway. To the right of the hallway is a door with a face on it which requires a riddle to open, the answer of which can be found in a letter underneath the Dremora's platform, the answer being \"tree\". Opening the secret door leads to a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Codex%20Arcana\"&gt;Codex Arcana&lt;/a&gt;\" and a gem.\nAdvancing further down the hallway, a chasm is encountered with no way to cross. Going down leads to two &lt;a href=\"Vermai%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Vermai&lt;/a&gt; and a lever, which asks another riddle before it can be used. Using the \"Kendhall Book of Riddles\" to find the answer, being \"bell tower\", the lever creates a bridge to cross the chasm. Crossing this eventually leads to a small bridge, with a staircase leading down to a storage. Within the storage, the unique &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Dagger%20of%20the%20Stolid%20Kin\"&gt;Dagger of the Stolid Kin&lt;/a&gt; can be found near the corpse of a dead battlemage, who had written about it in his last words.\nCrossing the bridge leads to a large room, where &lt;a href=\"Zenaida%20Nacarra\"&gt;Zenaida Nacarra&lt;/a&gt; can be found. From the Daedra, the Hero can learn that the &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Scamps&lt;/a&gt; have made off with the voidstone and, if this path was followed first, that Perthan Vorn has a Meth Sigil of Entry. Not too far from Zenaida is another Daedra, &lt;a href=\"Rishaal%20Tamir\"&gt;Rishaal Tamir&lt;/a&gt;, who requires a Voidstone before enabling the Hero to pass.\nThe Voidstone can be found in a room requiring a sigil of entry, where the Spider Daedra &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Gatanas\"&gt;Dremora Gatanas&lt;/a&gt; is found. With the voidstone, return to Rishaal who will provide another sigil key, required to proceed through the teleporter. In order to access the teleporter, a door must be opened through answering its riddle with \"horse\".\nLeft Hallway.\nThe left hallway offers little in terms of exploration, aside from some loot.\nWalkthrough post-teleport.\nHaving passed through the teleporter, the Hero finds themselves in a small corridor, with scamps and a Spider Daedra. To the left is an armory with some loot. Turning around, headed back for the entrance, a mace can be spotted mounted above the door. Activating it moves one of the smithing tables, providing a wooden platform which brings the Hero down to the artifact &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, which will be required later on in the level.\nFollowing the main path again, the Hero finds themselves in a large open room, with several Dremora, Vermai, and scamps. Slaying the creatures shows that there are four directions which can be taken. One to the north, northeast, south, and one to the southwest.\nPassage North.\nFollowing the passage north leads to another large chamber, with two smaller chambers attached to the side. In one of these chambers, a Voidguide can be found. Clearing the main chamber of any Dremora and Vermai leads to &lt;a href=\"Sumeer%20Jabran\"&gt;Sumeer Jabran&lt;/a&gt;, who is willing to provide safe passage in return for the help in assembling the voidguide. In front of Sumeer is a stone slab with a blue circle on it, in which the voidguide pieces must be placed.\nPassage Northeast.\nThe passage to the northeast leads to a large bedchamber, where a letter from &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nPassage South.\nThe passage south leads through the barracks, crossing through various spider daedra and scamps. A specific Sigil Key of Entry is required in order to make it to the end. In the final large room, a health orb can be found in the right corner at the end of the room. In the same area &lt;a href=\"Wonshala%20Keriayn\"&gt;Wonshala Keriayn&lt;/a&gt; is found, who is willing to part with a voidguide in return for Scourge, but only if its keyword is also provided.\nPassage Southwest.\nThe passage to the southwest leads to a storage room, where some more daedra such as scamps need to be fought. Several potions can be found here.\nBacktracking.\nHaving cleared the open areas, the Hero must backtrack to the teleporter and look at the walls. Three of the grey walls can be opened. The first grey wall on the right leads to a barracks, in which scamps must be fought. Activating a rug on the floor reveals a secret area, where another piece of the voidguide is located.\nThe second grey wall on the right side leads to an infirmary, once more protected by scamps. While originally not too special, activating one of the tables reveals a hidden passage leading to a room with coffins. Aside from the scamps, another piece of the voidguide can be found here.\nThe third grey wall is located next to the armory, behind which a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Oathkin\"&gt;Dremora Oathkin&lt;/a&gt; blocks the way. Proceeding further leads to a library, where the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Tanchelm\"&gt;Dremora Tanchelm&lt;/a&gt; is located. After a brief conversation, Tanchelm teleports away, but not before giving the Hero the book \"&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Daedra\"&gt;Spirit of the Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\". In the library four scrolls can be found, one of which provides insight on the weapon \"Scourge\", required for the voidguide of Wonshala Keriayn.\nHaving provided Wonshala with the artifact, she provides the Hero with the Voidguide, before being transported into Oblivion itself due to her being a Daedra carrying the artifact. With the Voidguides all carried, the portal to the next area of the Battlespire can be opened. Inserting the Voidguides on the stone slab with the blue circle in front of Sumeer Jabran causes the central structure in his room to open, unlocking the teleporter.\nReward.\nAccess to &lt;a href=\"Level%203\"&gt;Level 3&lt;/a&gt;."}

Within the room, two new enemies are encountered, a &lt;a href=\"Morphoid%20Daedra\"&gt;Morphoid Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Wraith&lt;/a&gt;. Up the stairs is nothing special, and serves more as a hiding spot from the magical attacks of the creatures. The second room allows for simple passage to the third, and offers a mace mounted to a pillar. In the third room a chest can be found, guarded by another Morphoid Daedra and a Wraith. In the right corner, a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20for%20the%20Battlespire%20Hero\"&gt;Letter for the Battlespire Hero&lt;/a&gt;\" is found.\nFrom this point, the level splits into two. A left and a right path. In the middle hangs a plaque, which states:\n\" THE &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;SOUL CAIRN&lt;/a&gt;. Once they struggled, hammered, cried Fought for justice, honor, pride. Now from time and tide released They guard and serve in silent peace\"\"\nBoth paths lead to a wooden platform going up, and a hallway going down. The hallway down leads to another Wraith, while going up leads to a &lt;a href=\"Boneman%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Boneman&lt;/a&gt;, or a Wraith, depending on whether the right or left path was taken. Both paths eventually merge in a large central chamber, where a circular stone is used as an elevator to be transported down.\nAdvancing into the hallway attached to the large room are a total of 27 plaques stating the following:\n\"&lt;a href=\"A%20lengthy%20inscription%20identifies%20one%20of%20the%20Master%27s%20retainers%20who%20came%20to%20the%20Soul%20Cairn%20to%20die%20and%20be%20reborn%20in%20his%20Eternal%20Service.\"&gt;A lengthy inscription identifies one of the Master's retainers who came to the Soul Cairn to die and be reborn in his Eternal Service.&lt;/a&gt;\"\"\nOne plaque, the sixth on the left, states something different:\n\" First coffin: Grave Second coffin: Life Third coffin: Boat Fourth coffin: Pig Fifth coffin: Coffin.\"\"\nThis one plaque carries knowledge which is used later on.\nFrom here, a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Key%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Sigil Key&lt;/a&gt; is required to proceed, which could be obtained from one of the enemies in the previous areas. Advancing further leads into an even larger room, which offers three directions. A left room, a right room, and just advancing straight through the level. In order to advance straight through, a Sigil Key is required, which is not yet in the Hero's possession. Both the left and the right room lead to large water pools, with the left room also providing a secondary entrance to the first route, though it also requires a Sigil Key.\nBoth pools have underwater tunnels which can be used to continue to the next area, a large grass field with some undead, including the undead form of &lt;a href=\"Kirel%20Aman\"&gt;Kirel Aman&lt;/a&gt;, as a wraith. There are three paths, two of which are blocked by a sigil. Taking the only open path leads to another hallway blocked by a sigil. A wooden platform raises the Hero up to a passage where a Daedra is found, carrying a Sigil Key. The Daedra also stands next to two wheels, which, upon being turned, raise some grass platforms enabling the Hero the means to jump across the platforms to another area.\nGoing back down, and crossing through the sigil-blocked areas, provides some loot, largely in the form of &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, though one of the hidden cabinets also provides the book \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Life%20and%20Service\"&gt;Book of Life and Service&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCrossing the grass field.\nUpon arriving on the other side of the grass field using the platforms, more Daedra are encountered. To the right is a small dock with a boat, while the main path goes down another hallway. Taking the boat to the other side of the lake leads to a chest, a \"Letter for the Battlespire Hero\", a Sigil Key, and a number of potions. Here the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Paxti%20Bittor\"&gt;Paxti Bittor&lt;/a&gt; is also found.\nTaking the path down the hallway leads to a room with on the right side an entrance to a sigil-blocked area. To the left is a room with another Daedra, once more carrying a Sigil Key. This room is connected to a room with three coffins, two of which ask riddles. In each of the three coffins is an &lt;a href=\"Ideal%20Masters\"&gt;Ideal Master&lt;/a&gt;. In one of the corners, attached to one of the pillars, is a small pole required for the final room.\nThe coffin riddles can be answered through using the plaques found prior. The coffins ask the following riddles:\n\"We say some things improve with death. What stinks when living, but dead smells good?\"\"\nAnd:\n\"So dark, dirt, cold this place. To stay you would refrain Yet those who occupy this place Never do complain.\"\"\nThe answers are \"Pig\" and \"Grave\" respectively.\nPassing the Sigil Lock.\nWith the proper Sigil Key, one can cross into the room with the sigil lock. In the centre of the room is a large, spinning, colum. In one of the corners, another pole required to finish the level is found. Three areas connect to the room. Two small storages, and a Sigil-Locked area. The Sigil found by using the boat is used here to proceed to a graveyard. The graves have a variety of words attached should they be activated:\n\"Neither prophet nor profit, we pass empty-handed into the light.\"\n\"I was, and wasn't, and was again forever.\"\n\"Poor Alex... exported from his life.\"\n\"In these worlds beyond the sun no darkness hides the distant shore.\"\n\"Quadrille Pig gave up the ghost.\"\n\"We have done, and do, and will do. The gentle flowers of the sun doth triumph over the grave.\"\n\"Genius and Power passes, Peace and Constance triumphs.\"\n\"Shift my oars and wherry, For I shall pass over In the company of friends and lovers.\"\n\"The Soul Serves that Never Dies The Saint that Saved Us All\"\n\"Sacred honor, loyal love, eternal service.\"\n\"Thus do I cheat the worms of their unjust plunder.\"\"\nAdvancing further beyond the graveyard leads to an area with an elevator leading down to the final room, and another path leading to cooperative Ideal Masters. One of these Ideal Masters has their coffin locked with a riddle:\n\"What was the sight my eyes were giving When I saw the dead carrying the living?\"\"\nThe answer to which is \"Boat\".\nAdvancing down the previously encountered elevator, several &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and Daedra are found, which need to be defeated, as well as a small temple. Two pillars are seen in both corners of the room, with a lever next to them, which must be pushed in order to activate two beams. Stepping into the puddle in the middle of the room places the Hero atop the temple. Behind the platform some potions are located, while in front of it a pedestal and a Daedra are found. The three poles which were acquired need to be placed on the pedestal to unlock the gate.\nUpon unlocking the gate, it requires a destination, stating:\n\"Say your destination, and be certain, for error is fatal.\"\"\nResponding with \"&lt;a href=\"Shade%20Perilous\"&gt;Shade Perilous&lt;/a&gt;\" opens the door, leading to &lt;a href=\"Level%204\"&gt;Level 4&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "1023192", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1023192", "title": "Level 4", "text": "Level 4 is the fourth &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; in .\nWalkthrough.\nLevel 4 starts in an open area, leading to a hallway with a new enemy, a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Daedra%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Frost Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. The next area features another Frost Daedra, and a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daedra%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Fire Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Advancing to the back of the room is a small wooden platform, with a level in front of it. Activating the lever makes the platform rise up to another floor, where &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;the Hero&lt;/a&gt; is greeted by a &lt;a href=\"Seducer\"&gt;Seducer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom the Seducer, two hallways are found, leading in the opposite direction. The hallway on the left side leads to a small room with another Fire Daedra, and leads down to a small dock and a water-filled room. The hallway to the right leads to a bridge connected to another area, protected by two other Fire Daedra.\nRight path.\nFollowing the right path leads to a prison of sorts. The first gate is locked, with a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Oathkin\"&gt;Dremora Oathkin&lt;/a&gt; patrolling behind it. Walking further down the hallway leads to fire and frost daedra alike, with a pullable chain being found in one of the right indents. Pulling the chain opens up some of the gates, including the first one.\nProceeding further, the hallway splits up, with one direction going straight ahead, and another going to the right. Taking the path to the right leads to a small storage room, where another \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20for%20the%20Battlespire%20Hero\"&gt;Letter for the Battlespire Hero&lt;/a&gt;\" is found, which provides needed information for one of the areas behind the first gate. Following the main path, the Hero will come across a room on the left, blocked by sigils. Going further down, a similar such room is found, blocked by sigil again. At the bottom of the path the Hero will find water.\nBacktracking to the area behind the first gate leads to another gate, which demands an answer before it opens. Having found the answer via the letter, answer the question with \"The Gerent of &lt;a href=\"Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt; Rules Here\" to open the gate. Behind the gate is a large room, where the captured Daedra &lt;a href=\"Deyanira%20Katrece\"&gt;Deyanira Katrece&lt;/a&gt; is found. A lever is also found nearby.\nWater.\nThe water is accessible from both sides. From the right path, the water splits up in two directions. The left path leads to a dead end, where at the water bottom, letter 8 of the \"Letters for the Battlespire Hero\" can be found again. In the other direction, on either side of the waterway, are small indents. In one of these indents, another lever is found. Continuing further leads to the small boat which is found if the left path was followed instead. Behind the boat is a hole in the wall, which leads to a rock in the center of the water room. Several Seducers are found here, and need to be slain. Two &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Key%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Sigil Keys&lt;/a&gt; can be looted from their corpses.\nHaving cleared the rock, a small bridge leads to another room. Activating the doors opens up to a large area, with several &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; on either side of the room. Fighting the Daedra until the room is cleared, an altar can be spotted at the end of the room. Behind the altar, another lever is found.\nSigil Areas.\nHaving acquired Sigils from the Seducers, the two areas found on the right path can be accessed. One of the two rooms has another Seducer, and a large stone hand with more sigils on it. Jumping on the hand provides the \"&lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Wheels%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;Book of the Wheels of Heaven&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe second sigil locked area leads to a large open room, with two passages, one of which is locked by a sigil lock. Various potions, Frost Daedra, Seducers, and Fire Daedra are found in the area. Following the open passage leads to a Dremora Oathkin, who willingly offers the entry key required for the sigil lock.\nPassing through, several Dremora Seducers are found. Following the walls to the right eventually leads to a hallway, which in turn, leads to a room. Within this room, another copy of \"Book of the Wheels of Heaven\" is found, alongside potions, as well as a health and spell point gem.\nIn the main area itself, several platforms are seen. On these platforms are lines of Daedric letters. The correct letters must be pressed in order to continue. Pressing the wrong button deals damage. Using the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, the four rows must each me looked at in order to press the right buttons. The word which must be made is the word \"Dusk\". In order of the word, these rows are the following letters:\nWith the pressing of each letter, a bridge to the central structure is raised. With all four letters in place, all bridges are up. The central structure has four wheels attached to it, which must be turned in order to proceed.\nMoving on.\nFrom the original hallway leading into the chamber, head left to where used to be a large iron door. If the previous steps were performed correctly, it has now been replaced with a blue aura. It blocks the path until a riddle is answered:\n\"Never watched by daylight\"\n\"Never watched by night\"\n\"But evenstar watches oft and well\"\n\"'Tween the black and bright\"\"\nAnswering with \"dusk\" removes the aura, and enables the Hero to proceed into a small storage area. A path on the right leads down, but is blocked by spiked bars. The other option is to move into the room next to it. Here a Seducer is found, who must be beaten. In one of the corners of the room, a lever is found, which provides access through the bars.\nMoving through the tunnel, the Hero eventually encounters &lt;a href=\"Jaciel%20Morgen\"&gt;Jaciel Morgen&lt;/a&gt;, who is uncooperative, and unable to help the Hero further. As such, the Hero must return to Deyanira Katrece for advice.\nDeyanira makes up a plan in which she returns to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; so that Jaciel will snap out of her trance and help the Hero, providing the Hero with a dagger containing her essence before doing so. Approaching Jaciel with the dagger makes her cooperative, and provides the passphrase required to advance to the final part of the level, \"djemekweh\".\nWith the password, all that remains is finding the exit. Behind Deyanira are several floating bridges and platforms, on one of which a Dremora is found. Near the Dremora is a platform with a brazier on top of it. Activating the brazier provides access to the exit of the level. Making their way over there, the Hero will be told that \"The Gate is Sealed\". Answering with \"djemekweh\" will unlock it. Behind the gate, another Dremora is found, who is willing to engage in dialogue. He will inform the Hero that their friend is captured, and give minor insights into the next area before leaving the Hero. From here, a minor teleporter is found, which transports the Hero to the final area of the level.\nIn this area, a couple of Seducers, Fire Daedra, and Frost Daedra are encountered guarding the teleporter leading to the next level. Before dealing with them, some potions can be collected next to the teleportation pad. Once the Daedra are dealt with, the Hero can safely step on the main teleporter, and gain access to &lt;a href=\"Level%205\"&gt;Level 5&lt;/a&gt;."}

Two scrolls are found on the dock itself, a letter from &lt;a href=\"Chimere%20Graegyn\"&gt;Chimere Graegyn&lt;/a&gt;, and one from the &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;. The Seducer will explain that the realm itself is being used as a hunting ground, before disappearing. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Cuirass%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Iron Cuirass of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt; can be found underneath the dock, with a plaque reading:\n\"This is the accursed armor I wore when I defied Dagon. It's no ordinary mail but a captive servant of Malacath, and the trickster's mark is on it, for it led me into folly. As near as I can remember it's called the Hide of the Savior and the Scourge of the Oath-breaker and long may it hang here out of my sight, for I wish I'd never used it.\"\"\nIf the coastline is followed to the right, the Hero will eventually come across a brown temple of sorts, inside of which a health and spell point gem is found, as well as the Gatekey.\nTrybador.\nHeading north, the Hero will eventually come across the village of &lt;a href=\"Trybador\"&gt;Trybador&lt;/a&gt;, which has been abandoned. Many of its doors are inaccessible, with notices attached:\n\"WARNING! QUARANTINE! PLAGUE! NOTICE! This structure deemed unsafe by order of the Coastal Militia. Extremely Contagious! Entry Forbidden! Warning! No effective physick known!\"\"\nWithin the village itself, various &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; are encountered, and some of the buildings can be entered. One building, the bell tower, is blocked by a Sigil Lock. The Trybador crypt is one of the areas that can be accessed, here a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Key%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Sigil Key&lt;/a&gt; can be obtained, which is required to advance into the green structure in the east. If one of the altars in the crypt is activated, a staircase leading down is found. Activating the staircase bring the Hero to the same area which can be accessed from the graveyard near a green spiked structure. It is not possible to return up the crypt from the staircase, as it will be blocked by dirt. Going right from the staircase and sticking to the right wall, will lead to the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlet%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Gauntlet of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Chimere%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Chimere's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" is also found in the crypt.\nEastern Green Structure.\nAdvancing eastward along the coast, the Hero will eventually come across a large spiked green structure, near which a note from the &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt; is found. Inside the tower, a Gatekey and a locked chest are found, with the chest containing the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"There is a short inscription in some sort of cipher, followed by these lines: Spear of Bitter Mercy Lightning in the hand My point bites deep I end the chase Even the mightiest are unmade by my touch.\"\"\nAs of present, the Spear is still locked tight in the chest, and cannot be accessed. Going northward from here, towards a nearby tower, leads to an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Greave%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Iron Greave of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;.\nGraveyard.\nGoing eastward from the tower, following the coast, the Hero will eventually come across a graveyard, protected by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daedra%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Fire Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. At the graveyard, a notice can be read:\n\"The Drag is for the Lesser Dogs, to startle out the Hare. The Chase is for the Greater Hounds to drive the Hare before them. On the Call of the Greater Hounds trap the Hare and summon the Huntsmen for the kill, with the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Last is the View, the Huntsman rings the bell to call the Master to view his kill. Then is the bounty bestowed, and the victorious huntsman calls the new Hunt. To name a Wild Hunt is a grand and grave right indeed. All but the High Daedra Lords are prey to the potent Spear of Bitter Mercy. It is a terrible weapon, and must not be removed from the Grounds of the Rituak Hunt.\"\"\nA trapdoor is found in the center of the graveyard, which can be opened and entered, leading to several hallways filled with both Fire and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Daedra%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Frost Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. This is also the exit from the crypts which are accessed from the town of Trybador.\nThe Fortress.\nAdvancing westward from the graveyard, the Hero will come across a fortress of a sort, with four towers being located in each corner. Going up the towers reveals, aside from Daedra, four buttons. Pressing each of these buttons raises a purple crystal in the courtyard. When all four are activated, a circle in the center of the courtyard is raised. Below the circle, a health and spell gem are found, as well as a Gatekey.\nThe Temple.\nGoing northwest, the Hero will come across a path leading to a temple, guarded by several Daedra, including the sole Scamp of the level. This one Scamp is unique, and has a very large health pool.\nWithin the temple itself, several more Fire Daedra are found, guarding another Gatekey. Taking the key unlocks a previously closed door at the end of the temple, leading down to a small pool with a chest. In this area, there are also two health gems, and one spell point gem.\nChimere Graegyn.\nThe home of &lt;a href=\"Chimere%20Graegyn\"&gt;Chimere Graegyn&lt;/a&gt; can be found north of the fortress. Within, two gems, one for health, and one for spell points, are found. On a nearby table are some &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, as well as \"&lt;a href=\"Harvest%27s%20End%2C%203E%20172\"&gt;Harvest's End, 3E 172&lt;/a&gt;\". Speaking to Chimere shows his absence from &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; life, as he struggles to make up sentences, and is convinced the Hero is merely an illusion at first. When he realizes the Hero is an actual human, he is more cooperative in providing the real name of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and gives insights into the Spear of Bitter Mercy and Savior's Hide. He will also provide the \"&lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20Note\"&gt;Savior's Hide Note&lt;/a&gt;\".\nWaterfall Shrine.\nLocated near the waterfall, this temple consists of a large stone elevator, leading down to the temple proper. Here, two Fire Daedra are found, protecting one of the Gatekeys.\nWaterfall.\nEntering the Waterfall leads to two paths, with a steam of water separating them. On one side is a Dark Seducer, whereas on the other is a Frost Daedra. Advancing further up the path with the Frost Atronach leads to a collapsed arch, which led to an island with a tower, protected by several Dark Seducers. It is possible to jump from the end of the bridge over to the island.\nWithin the tower's first floor are some Frost Daedra, guarding the Boots of the Savior's Hide, which are hidden beneath a bench. An elevator is also found in the corner, which leads to the second and third floor respectively. On the second floor, a Coffer of Restoration can be acquired by activating the left bookshelf, which causes it to topple over and push the other bookshelves down. In the same room, the \"Trebuchet Ritual\" can be found. At the top floor, another Frost Daedra is found, as well as an enchanted staff and a healing gem.\nThe Keep.\nNear the home of Chimere Graegyn an island is found with a raised drawbridge. There are two ways to gain access to this island. One way is to swim around it, or use a boat, to get to the docks on the rear side. The other option is to use the hot air balloon found on a platform on the eastern coast of the island and use it to fly into the keep.\nA small ship at the docks provides a Coffer of Restoration, and three elevators leading up. From the first elevator on the right, the Helm of the Savior's Hide is found. Walking around the Keep walls, the Hero can find a wheel attached to the drawbridge, activating it lowers the bridge, providing easy access to the main island and back.\nWithin the Keep itself are a number of buildings, each of which is defended by Frost and Fire Daedra. The first building on the right is a smithy, where some swords and arrows are found. Followed up by the &lt;a href=\"Salt%20Barrel%20Tavern\"&gt;Salt Barrel Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, where potions are found on the first floor. In the corner to the right is an elevator which will bring the Hero up to the third floor and back. On the second floor the &lt;a href=\"Pauldrons%20of%20the%20Savior%27s%20Hide\"&gt;Pauldrons of the Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt; are found. On the third floor arrows are found.\nThe next building is a small home, with one \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Chimere%20Graegyn\"&gt;Letter from Chimere Graegyn&lt;/a&gt;\" being found on one of the tables. It is near the Temple, which can currently not be accessed due to lacking one of the Gatekeys.\nThe next building is another tavern, which is only home to a number of Frost and Fire Daedra. In the corner next to the barracks is a barn, where several potions and arrows can be found.\nThe Spear of Bitter Mercy.\nHaving acquired all the pieces of the Savior's Hide, the Hero must return to Chimere Graegyn in order to gain access to the Spear of Bitter Mercy. With the Spear, the Hero is finally able to damage the Herne on the island, including the Huntsman \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Herne%20Egahirn\"&gt;Herne Egahirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nKeep Barracks.\nReturn to the Keep and enter the barracks. Within some potions, arrows, and a Frost Daedra are found. Climb through the trapdoor to find another Frost Daedra, and the Huntsman Herne Egahirn. Slay the Huntsman to gain access to his Sigil Key and Gatekey. With the Sigil Key, the Hero can return to Trybador and enter the bell tower and ring the bell to formally call an end to the hunt. Within the bell tower, a healing gem is also found.\nEnding the Hunt.\nWith all six Gatekeys, the Hero can now access the previously locked Temple. Within the Temple, a number of Fire Daedra, and one Frost Daedra are found. Some arrows can also be looted here.\nIn order to advance to &lt;a href=\"Level%206\"&gt;Level 6&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero must use two elevators to rise up to a walkway and jump on the half-moon altar. The altar is easily identified due to the Frost Atronach walking atop of it.\nThe Shipwreck.\nIn the far south of the map, a shipwreck is found, which provides some loot in the form of potions and weapons.\nPosts.\nAcross the map, several posts can be found with a note attached to it, stating part of \"The Posting of the Hunt\":\n\"The Posting of the Hunt. Let no man say before a witness that the Hunt has not been called, nor the Rites declared, or the Ancient Offices observed. The Huntsman and his Hounds shall chase and harry the Hare as the ritual demands. The Hunt begins before the green crystal reflections of the Chapel of the Innocent Quarry. The Spear of Bitter Mercy is displayed, the Offices of the Hunt are recited: the Drag, the Chase, the Call, and the View of the Kill.\"\""}

Looking around the area quickly results in &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;the Hero&lt;/a&gt; discovering that there is no way to advance. There is a large gate located a short walk from the teleporter, however, there is no clear way to open it.\nPushing one of the wooden beams in front of the gate results in it collapsing and pushing open the gate. This leads to a large open area, with gates on three sides. Within the open area, &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Lord%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt;, Seducers and Herne can be found. If the right dialogue options are chosen, the Clannfear can be directed to fight with the Herne. There is also a single &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt; which, similar to the one in &lt;a href=\"Level%205\"&gt;Level 5&lt;/a&gt;, has a large health pool.\nHaving cleared the room, there are two ways to advance, one is to use the large drum at the end of the room to open the gate leading straight ahead, while the other option is using an elevator in the middle of the room. On one of the stools a scroll is found, \"&lt;a href=\"Curiosities%20of%20the%20Second%20Age\"&gt;Curiosities of the Second Age&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDrum Area.\nIf the drum is chosen, the gate will open, leading to another area where &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Lord\"&gt;Lesser Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;, Herne, and more Clannfear are encountered. The two Lesser Lords carry Sigil Keys which are required to advance. The central structure has a raised drawbridge, but this one can be lowered by activating the round mechanics next to it.\nImago's Keep.\nThe central structure serves as the Keep of &lt;a href=\"Imago%20Storm\"&gt;Imago Storm&lt;/a&gt;, one of Mehrunes Dagon's lieutenants. Several Seducers and &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Count\"&gt;Daedra Count&lt;/a&gt;s are found roaming around. There are four elevators, one in each corner. The one which leads up to Imago is the one with a sigil lock.\nLord Imago is willing to part with information regarding &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20Moath\"&gt;Xivilai Moath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faydra%20Shardai\"&gt;Faydra Shardai&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing. He also provides a small note with information as well as a Gatekey. In front of Lord Imago is a green gem, in which the three Gatekeys of the Lords must be placed in order to proceed to level 7.\nRight Path.\nThe right path leads to the holdings of the Clannfear. The area quickly splits into two hallways - each of which has a hidden room attached to their walls. Both paths give access to a small area blocked by a Sigil Lock. The two hallways reunite near a lava pit. Here, a Seducer, as well as a number of Clannfear are found. There are also two round doors on either side of the room. Advancing further leads to more Clannfear, some of which carry the required Sigil Key. Within the sigil-locked area, the book \"&lt;a href=\"Codex%20Arcana%2C%20Volume%20VII\"&gt;Codex Arcana, Volume VII&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a health and spell gem are found.\nAt the very end of the right path, the Hero will come across &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20Moath\"&gt;Xivilai Moath&lt;/a&gt;.\nRight Door.\nTaking the right door at the lava pit leads to some Herne and a Seducer. Three paths can be taken. The path to the left leads to a clannfear and some parts for an oculory. The path to the right leads to a small library, where a Coffer of Restoration is found. With the proper sigil key, the path straight ahead can also be followed, which will lead to &lt;a href=\"Sirran%20Angada\"&gt;Sirran Angada&lt;/a&gt;, who will inform the Hero of his part in taking over the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeft Door.\nThe left door leads to a barracks area. Here, three rooms are attached. To the right is a dining hall, where in the lower part \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Short%20History%20of%20The%20Augmented%20Craftworks\"&gt;A Short History of The Augmented Craftworks&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found. Straight ahead is a relatively small chamber with a healing gem. The room to the right is the sleeping quarters, where some gear and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Restricted%20List%20Of%20Noble%20Artifacts\"&gt;The Restricted List Of Noble Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;\" are found.\nLeft Path.\nThe left path leads to a different area. Going right instantly from the left path leads to a small library, where the book \"&lt;a href=\"Codex%20Arcana%2C%20Volume%20VI\"&gt;Codex Arcana, Volume VI&lt;/a&gt;\" is found. In the main hallway are three doors. The left door leads to some bells of a sort. The central door leads to a small room, and the door on the right leads to a small library where some potions can be found. To the right of the last door is a hallway, leading to three mirrors.\nLeft Mirror.\nThe left mirror leads to a hallway filled with Hernes, blocked off by a sigil lock. With the proper sigil key, the Hero can advance and encounter Faydra Shardai.\nCentral Mirror.\nThe central mirror leads to a testing ground of sorts. Several Clannfear, Herne, and Seducers are found here and need to be beaten.\nRight Mirror.\nThe right mirror leads to a room for \"intelligence training\". Here, several small rooms are found with trapdoors. Standing on them leads to a pitfall down into water, with no way to get out. There are also four sleeping quarters. Three of these can be freely accessed, one requires a sigil key which can be obtained from one of the Hernes or Clannfear in the area. Two of the bedrooms have wheels in them, which can be turned to unlock another room, where some gear, potions, a Coffer of Restoration, as well as a health and spell gem are found.\nObtaining all three Gatekeys.\nThe information provided by Lord Imago can be used against Xivilai Moath and Faydra Shardai in order gain possession of all three Gatekeys. With the keys, the Hero must return to Imago's Keep and insert them in the green gem on the top floor. This will enable the teleportation to &lt;a href=\"Level%207\"&gt;Level 7&lt;/a&gt;."}

It takes place in Mehrunes Dagon's Hunting Lodge, also known as The Hunting Lodge of Mehrunes Dagon or Isle of Joys.\nWalkthrough.\nThe level starts on a small dirt island, surrounded by lava with a bridge headed towards another island. On the ground a \"&lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20the%20Dremora\"&gt;Letter from the Dremora&lt;/a&gt;\" can be read, providing some insight on magical artifacts which can be found in the area, as well as some general information as to how to reach &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Dagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the bridge leads to a small island with a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt; on it. Across the lava another island can be seen where two &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Lord%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt;, as well as another Dark Seducer are seen. This island can be accessed by pushing over a tree surrounded by rocks. A healing and spell gem are found on the island, and the Dark Seducer turns out to be the bodyguard of Mehrunes Dagon and must be slain to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Sword%20of%20the%20Moon%20Reiver\"&gt;Steel Sword of the Moon Reiver&lt;/a&gt;, which is required to defeat Dagon.\nFollowing the bridges crossing through the island, &lt;a href=\"The%20Apprentice%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;the Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; will come across various &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, Dark Seducers and Daedra Lords. Some of the islands have bridges leading to towers, where more wraiths are found. At these towers, the magical artifacts mentioned in the \"Letter from the Dremora\" are found.\nHaving crossed through the islands, the Hero will come across a raised drawbridge, with a switch in front of it and a spell and healing gem on either side. Activating the switch results in it asking \"Identify Yourself\". Having read the \"&lt;a href=\"Lehmekweh%20Note\"&gt;Lehmekweh Note&lt;/a&gt;\", the Hero will have to answer \"Lehmekweh\" to lower the drawbridge.\nThe mountain.\nBehind the drawbridge, a large ballista is located. On the right side of the ballista some &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; can be found. A lever activates the weapon, causing it to launch a bolt with a rope attached to it across the lava pools, leading to the mountain atop of which &lt;a href=\"Dagon%27s%20Hunting%20Lodge\"&gt;Dagon's Hunting Lodge&lt;/a&gt; is found.\nA path leads around, and up, the mountain. The Hero will come across many Wraiths, Daedra Lords, and a Dark Seducer before making it to the Lodge. One of the Wraiths is notable in that they cast spells, which other Wraiths do not do. Should one or more pieces of the &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt; have been lost, this Wraith can be spoken to in order to retrieve them.\nAt the top of the mountain the entrance to the Hunting Lodge is found. In order to gain access, a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Key%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Sigil Key&lt;/a&gt; is required.\nThe Lodge.\nThe final area of the level is the Lodge itself. Inside, various potions of Cure Health, as well as arrows, can be found. On the lowest level, a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Count\"&gt;Daedra Count&lt;/a&gt; is found. Heading up the stairs leads to a Daedra Lord, and a Coffer of Restoration.\nA wooden door leads to an area with a lift. Here, three separate Sigil Keys are required to access the lift, provided by the Daedra in the Lodge. Another Daedra Count and Daedra Lord can also be found here.\nTaking the lift upwards, two more Daedra Counts, and a Wraith, are found. Dispatching the creatures leaves the room with an inactive teleporter and two purple orbs. Activating the orbs, in turn, activates the teleporter. This leads to a large room where the friend of the Apprentice is being held, as well as &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Battlespire%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nWith the Savior's Hide and the Moon Reiver Sword, the Hero must confront Dagon and slay him. Upon doing so, the Hero can rescue their friend, but the Battlespire itself starts to collapse. This concludes the game."}

It is a method of coping to prevent low-level players get high-quality &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; quickly, keeping difficulty up and also reward higher-level players with the items.\nFor example, if one is at level 10, they may find &lt;a href=\"Iron\"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt;-tier weapons and &lt;a href=\"Hide%20Armor\"&gt;Hide Armor&lt;/a&gt; in a chest. Alternatively, if one is at level 50, they may find &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Weapons\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20weapons\"&gt;Daedric weapons&lt;/a&gt; and armor in the same chest.\nLeveled items will continue to level with the player until they are interacted with. Thus, it is best to wait until they have reached max level and therefore max potential.\nThis concept is applied to various weapons that can be found in-game. For example, &lt;a href=\"Chillrend%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chillrend&lt;/a&gt;, widely touted as the most powerful one-handed sword available in vanilla (&lt;a href=\"Miraak%27s%20Sword\"&gt;Miraak's Sword&lt;/a&gt; is the most powerful one-handed sword in ). However, this is only when the player is after Level 45. If it is found before that, it will stay locked at that of a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Sword\"&gt;Daedric Sword&lt;/a&gt; or less.\nThis creates a very dynamic situation regarding the game's best weapons. For them to be the best they can possibly be, one must hold out for an extended period of time."}

The relationship between level and experience is exponential (r = 1.0), and the relationship between difficulty and experience is based on a set of &lt;a href=\"https%3A//forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/139738/world-boss-xp-vs-opening-a-chest-xp\"&gt;multipliers&lt;/a&gt; assigned by ZeniMax to each quest difficulty level.\nUsers who have purchased &lt;a href=\"ESO%20Plus\"&gt;ESO Plus&lt;/a&gt; should multiply the values in this table \u00d71.1 for accurate data. Users whose characters are &lt;a href=\"Enlightenment\"&gt;enlightened&lt;/a&gt; should multiply level 50 values \u00d74.0."}

As a result, tension has arisen between the three provinces for the territory.\nLeyawiin proper has two entrances, one located on the western side and one the eastern side. The western gate is the main entrance and is located on the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Road\"&gt;Green Road&lt;/a&gt; that leads to &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Water%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Water's Edge&lt;/a&gt;. The eastern gate leads to the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Road\"&gt;Yellow Road&lt;/a&gt; which leads to minor settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Cropsford\"&gt;Cropsford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blankenmarch\"&gt;Blankenmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20Leyawiin\"&gt;Castle Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; is on an island in the middle of the Niben and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Riders%20Stables\"&gt;Five Riders Stables&lt;/a&gt; sits just outside the western gate.\nJust inside the western gate, is the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Zenithar\"&gt;Great Chapel of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; to the south and the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Claws%20Lodge\"&gt;Five Claws Lodge&lt;/a&gt; on the north side. East of the lodge on north side of the street is &lt;a href=\"The%20Dividing%20Line\"&gt;The Dividing Line&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Best%20Goods%20and%20Guarantees\"&gt;Best Goods and Guarantees&lt;/a&gt;. Turning south past the chapel on to the main north-south road in Leyawiin, the residential district is on the east side, split by a shorter north-south road. South of the chapel, the town square with merchants and guild halls is on the west side and the residential district continues on the east side. There are paths leading east to the castle from both the northern and southern ends of the residential district.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt; lead by &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; garnered support from the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Leyawiin was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt; and it was also sought out by Aquilarios. He ordered his general, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, to capture Leyawiin with an army of Nibenese mercenaries who were double-agents that worked for Leovic.\nUpon entering Leyawiin, Sai Sahan was betrayed by the mercenaries and was enraged by this treason. Sai Sahan now had to fight both Leovic's army and his militia and was able to defeat both armies and liberate Leyawiin. Sahan's tale told by Aquilarios was described as a glorious battle, but it was much more brutal than described. Sahan survived day to day by killing commanders and guardsmen until the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; abandoned the settlement.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the cities of Gideon and Leyawiin signed a trade agreement allowing the &lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dorsza Pass&lt;/a&gt; to be open to Blackwood and Murkmire. From this it can be inferred that Leyawiin was not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; as it was able to trade with &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the same year, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Leyawiin\"&gt;Castle Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; fell under siege as a result of &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Waking%20Flame\"&gt;Waking Flame&lt;/a&gt; cultists infiltrating the city under the guidance of the head of the city &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Vandacia\"&gt;Councilor Vandacia&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the governments of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and Cyrodiil had talked over a border arrangement between the two provinces. Elsweyr wanted to have western Blackwood to themselves as it had traditionally been theirs, but Cyrodiil managed to keep the region. This brought tension between the two provinces and a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Renrijra%20Krin\"&gt;Renrijra Krin&lt;/a&gt; rose and performed terrorist attacks throughout &lt;a href=\"County\"&gt;County&lt;/a&gt; Leyawiin. It is because of the Renrijra that the Khajiits have a hard time in Leyawiin.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Leyawiin prospered along with the other eight cities in Cyrodiil. The city was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Count Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Alessia%20Caro\"&gt;Countess Alessia Caro&lt;/a&gt;. They married to cement a political alliance between Leyawiin and &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt; where Alessia's mother is the Countess of Chorrol. Both have a mission to unite the people of Blackwood and encourage Imperialization as seen in Gideon and &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the very late third era, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; launched the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; opened up outside of Leyawiin, which when closed by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, allowed them to recruit troops from Leyawiin to aid in repulsing the attack on Bruma later on.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%200\"&gt;4E 0&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; needed to gather the &lt;a href=\"Relics%20of%20the%20Crusader%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Relics of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat the rising threat of &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt;. The Mace of Zenithar was last seen when the old &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Kaladas\"&gt;Saint Kaladas&lt;/a&gt; sealed the Mace in the chapel in Leyawiin. The Hero found the mace and with the other relics, defeated Umaril in &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; declared the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominion captured Leyawiin but it was returned to the Empire after the signing of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;."}

County Lewayiin is nestled around the southern &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;, bordered by &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; to the west, and &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt; to the south. Situated on the southwestern bank of the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Lower Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Leyawiin guards the passage up the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben River&lt;/a&gt; from Topal Bay to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nPinned between the &lt;a href=\"Beastfolk\"&gt;bestial&lt;/a&gt; provinces of Elsweyr and Black Marsh, the city of\u00a0Leyawiin\u00a0guards the vital passage up the River Niben from Topal Bay to the Imperial City. Leyawiin is a mighty fortress, with both tall stone walls and strong garrisons.\nLeyawiin is a bright, cheerful and prosperous town in the midst of Blackwood swampy wildernesses. It contains wide, bright streets, large, comfortable houses, half-timbered or painted stucco of which many are colorful and not too dirty or weather-worn. Trees and flowering shrubs flourish. Peaceful plazas and ponds for quiet contemplation also adorn the city. Its population is made up significantly from those of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; descent and many other peoples, making Leyawiin a melting-pot of cultures from throughout the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nClimate.\nLeyawiin receives precipitation often, sometimes occurring daily. This is presumably weather systems coming off Topal Bay. This explains the ponds around town, and why the ground is grass, rather than paved.\nCount and Countess.\n&lt;a href=\"Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt; is Count Leyawiin and his recent bride; the lovely and cultivated &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Alessia%20Caro\"&gt;Alessia Caro&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of the righteous and reliable Countess &lt;a href=\"Arriana%20Valga\"&gt;Arriana Valga&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. The Count and Countess are energetic supporters of Imperialization and they work tirelessly to bring the traditional values of hard working, chapel going, and law abiding &lt;a href=\"Nibenese\"&gt;Nibenese&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; culture to this frontier outpost.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Zenithar\"&gt;Chapel of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with the Count and Countess, are partners in attempting to extend the benefits of Heartland Nibenese culture to the benighted frontier populations of Blackwood and the Lower Niben. Trade and industry are strong in Leyawiin, thanks to the patronage of &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, and notwithstanding, the &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; troubling caravans and travellers along the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Road\"&gt;Green Road&lt;/a&gt; through the recently annexed Trans-Niben.\nPeople.\nNot all of the Beastial peoples in Leyawiin are as presentable and industrious as the members of the new competitor with &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;. Some Argonians and Khajiit are to be seen in the streets at all hours, lounging and gossiping. The town is mostly populated with Khajiit and Argonians as it is on the border between &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nThe town itself lies with tall curtain walls on the west bank of the Niben. To the east through two gates lies the inner keep and &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Leyawiin\"&gt;Castle Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, straddling the deep channels of the river. The Chapel of Zenithar lies in the northwest, near the West Gate. All the shops, inns, and guilds lie south of the chapel, in the western half of the town, except for a fine bookstore and general trader north of the road traversing the town east-west from West Gate. The residential part of town runs along a single wide north-south boulevard, backed on the east by deep ponds created by impounding one of the meandering channels of the Niben.\nShops and guilds.\nLeyawiin boasts the finest collection of shops and tradesmen in Cyrodiil outside of the Imperial City. Even the craftsman and trainers of the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild are of a certainly higher quality. Something worth mentioning is &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Books\"&gt;Southern Books&lt;/a&gt;, a bookstore owned by an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; always stocking multiple copies of \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Children%27s%20Anuad%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;A Children's Anuad&lt;/a&gt;\"; a religious book appropriate for those ignorant of the mysteries of the faith and adapted to the meanest understanding.\nCompetitor of the Fighters Guild.\nRecently, a new competitor of the Fighters Guild, a mercenary hiring hall called the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;, has commenced operations here in a striking new building. They are notably staffed exclusively by Khajiit and Argonians and are led by officers well spoken, polite, and deferential. They aggressively compete with the Fighters Guild for both price and service.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Whom%20Gods%20Annoy\"&gt;Whom Gods Annoy&lt;/a&gt;.\nPeople in Leyawiin report strange noises and smells coming from &lt;a href=\"Rosentia%20Gallenus\"&gt;Rosentia Gallenus&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Rosentia%20Gallenus%27s%20House\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt;. She has accidentally acquired the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Everscamp\"&gt;Staff of the Everscamp&lt;/a&gt;, which produces a steady population of four &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;scamps&lt;/a&gt; to follow the staff-bearer.\n&lt;a href=\"Mazoga%20the%20Orc%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Mazoga the Orc&lt;/a&gt;.\nCount &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt; in Castle Leyawiin wants to know why &lt;a href=\"Mazoga%20the%20Orc%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Mazoga the Orc&lt;/a&gt; will not leave his hall. He asks the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; for help.\n&lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20White%20Stallion%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Knights of the White Stallion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Mazoga the Orc quest, the Count will offer another task. The objective here is to locate &lt;a href=\"Black%20Brugo\"&gt;Black Brugo&lt;/a&gt;'s location and kill him. Mazoga the Orc will accompany the Hero and tell them the location.\n&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Savior\"&gt;Tears of the Savior&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"S%27drassa\"&gt;S'drassa&lt;/a&gt; asks the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Garridan%27s%20Tear\"&gt;Garridan's Tear&lt;/a&gt;s. S'drassa enjoys collecting crystals, especially those of a &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al nature, and is willing to pay a handsome amount of gold for each Tear recovered."}

Her response is very cryptic, but if the Hero accepts her offer, she will tell them to speak with &lt;a href=\"Agata\"&gt;Agata&lt;/a&gt;. Once she is found, ask her about the encounter with Degail. She will explain that Dagail is a seer and that her visions are crippling her because her protective amulet, the &lt;a href=\"Manduin%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Seer's Stone&lt;/a&gt;, has gone missing. She asks the Hero to investigate. Asking members of the Mages Guild will provide more information about the Seer's Stone.\nAsking around will point the finger of blame towards &lt;a href=\"Kalthar\"&gt;Kalthar&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in the basement of the Mages Guild. Speaking to him will allow one to see that he resents Dagail's position in the Guild, and mentions that her father had similar problems concerning visions. Head back to Agata and talk to her again \u2013 she assumes that Kalthar must have overheard a conversation between her and Dagail, but does not remember Dagail's father ever being mentioned.\nAfter speaking to Degail once more, she will prove that her visions are becoming more severe, and anticipates the Hero's question before it is asked. She will provide an enigmatic answer, telling the Hero that they will need to go to the fort where her father was stationed. This is &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Blueblood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fort Blueblood&lt;/a&gt;, which is located a short distance away from &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nFort Blueblood.\nFort Blueblood is a two-area dungeon inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Marauder%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marauders&lt;/a&gt;, a mix of fighters, archers, and battlemages. In the last room, the Hero will find a coffin occupied by Dagail's late father, in which they will find the amulet that he used. The coffin itself will be surrounded by &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalthar will prevent the Hero from leaving the fort. He will reveal that he was the one who stole Dagail's amulet, planning to return it after she had been forced to step down from her position\u00a0among the Guild's ranks; as one might expect, he believes that he should be the one who should take her place. He will then turn hostile and attack the Hero.\nAfter he is defeated, take his key and exit the fort. Then, return to Leyawiin and give the amulet to Dagail. She will be restored to coherency, and will give her recommendation for the Hero's initiation."}

It is also just east of the &lt;a href=\"Reach%20Stormcloak%20Camp\"&gt;Reach Stormcloak Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is a &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; hideout that, upon arrival, is found to be in the process of being overrun by &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. Exploration will reveal the gaping hole used by the Falmer to invade, leading to Falmer lairs further in.\nThis location is a little different to most caves in the sense that there is no shortcut looping back to the start of the cave.\nSummary.\nUpon entering the cave, which appears similar in appearance to fort ruins, there have been bandits and Falmer fighting to the death, with the Falmer outnumbering the bandits.\nA single hostile &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; bandit is hiding from the Falmer, barricaded in a sleeping area behind a locked door.\nOnce the fort section is cleared and explored, it is clear to see the Falmer have busted into the ruin from the inside. This part of the cave is more typical of Falmer habitats and has alchemy ingredients scattered throughout the cave until the final chamber.\nThere are also &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; (one of which drops from a hole in the ceiling) and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chaurus&lt;/a&gt; (including a &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Reaper%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chaurus reaper&lt;/a&gt;) deeper inside the cave system. With , the chaurus reaper may be replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;chaurus hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen exploring the tunnels, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may come across two enclosures. One enclosure contains a dead bandit and the other contains two live bandits who are being taunted by a Falmer on the other side of a gate. The bandits may manage to open the gate and kill the Falmer. If they live, they are hostile to the Dragonborn, even if they assist them.\n&lt;a href=\"Rahd\"&gt;Rahd&lt;/a&gt;'s body lies on an altar with a Falmer sword stuck in his chest in the middle of the final chamber with the unique &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Warhammer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcish warhammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Longhammer\"&gt;The Longhammer&lt;/a&gt;, next to him. It can often be underneath the tablet Rahd's body is lying on, making it easy to miss.\nWhen finished exploring, backtrack to the fort section. Upon returning, three bandits arrive and the chief begins calling for service from the deceased barkeep, only to spot the carnage and exclaim, \"What in Oblivion happened in here?\" If they spot the Dragonborn, they will assume that they are the responsible party and become hostile."}

The questgiver &lt;a href=\"Alarvyne%20Indalas\"&gt;Alarvyne Indalas&lt;/a&gt; runs the &lt;a href=\"Glassworker%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Glassworker's Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and has had trouble lately to get hold of Dwarven limeware.\nBackground.\nAlarvyne Indalas sells fine glassware in her store in the &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20St.%20Delyn%20Canton\"&gt;St. Delyn Canton&lt;/a&gt; in Vivec. She used to sell exotic items, but that trade has suffered due to trade restrictions and the unfair activities of the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; merchant &lt;a href=\"Bolrin\"&gt;Bolrin&lt;/a&gt;. Alarvyne claims that he has been manipulating the prices and is holding back the selling licenses for the products in question. Hence, the Glassworker's Hall has run low on these precious wares.\nAlarvyne hopes for the Nerevarine to help her restock some of the items. She knows of a shipment of Dwarven limeware currently held in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; on a ship called \"&lt;a href=\"Chun-Ook\"&gt;Chun-Ook&lt;/a&gt;\". She asks the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; if they would \"recover\" the probably heavely guarded items for her unnoticed. She promises a generous payment of 1500 for this slightly dubious service.\nDetailed walkthrough.\nWhen the Nerevarine accepts the task, Alarvyne warns them to look out for fakes. She expects the Nerevarine to find 10 pieces of bowls and cups. The Nerevarine should now head to Ebonheart. Here, they could confront Boldrin with Alarvyne's accusations, or they could directly proceed to the ship to try and steal the limeware. If confronting Boldrin, he will claim to know nothing of a shipment of Dwarven limeware and says he will not believe such a thing until he has seen proof.\nAnyway, the Nerevarine will need to locate the ship \"Chun-Ook\" and force entry. They will need to &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;pick&lt;/a&gt; a level 25-locked trapdoor. There is a guard patrolling, and the shipmaster &lt;a href=\"Nevosi%20Hlan\"&gt;Nevosi Hlan&lt;/a&gt; stands on deck. Inside, another trapdoor with a level 30 lock must be overcome. Two guards are complicating matters, and if caught, will approach the Nerevarine while saying \"You can't be in here, . And I'm afraid I can't let you leave. The Company wouldn't like that at all.\". The limeware consists of five &lt;a href=\"limeware%20bowl\"&gt;limeware bowl&lt;/a&gt;s and the same number of &lt;a href=\"limeware%20cup\"&gt;limeware cup&lt;/a&gt;s and are stored inside a crate in the belly of the ship.\nOnce in possession of the valuable items, the Nerevarine can either return to Alarvyne as agreed, or deliver the goods to Bolrin to prove the illegal activities. If they choose to address Bolrin, he will thank the Nerevarine for uncover the truth and state that the guard will pay for this. He takes the Dwarven limeware from the Nerevarine and pays them 500 for his honesty, advising them nevertheless to keep their distance from his ships in the future. If the Nerevarine returns the goods to Alarvyne Indalas as agreed at the beginning, she will pay the promised 1500 for the Dwarven limeware."}

They are mages that have prolonged their lifespan through the use of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and black magic, turning themselves into powerful immortal beings.\nOrigins.\nAn unnamed Lich is known to have existed sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, during the rule of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the first Liches ever created was the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, who delved into the dark arts of magic. It was not long until &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow student of the order, discovered Mannimarco's activities, and the latter was cast out from the institute. During the great battle between Galerion's army and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;, Mannimarco transformed himself into the first ever Lich, making him immortal.\nCreation.\nIn , a Lich is a mage who seeks immortality, using powerful magics to expand their lives. One mage named &lt;a href=\"Celedaen\"&gt;Celedaen&lt;/a&gt; attempts to surpass death by using the &lt;a href=\"Sands%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;Sands of Resolve&lt;/a&gt;, an hourglass that must remain on his person until the transformation is completed.\nIn , it is mentioned that the process of becoming a Lich involves draining the life force of someone and transferring it back to the Lich's body. The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; managed to do this by making their servants give their energy to them. However, this is not always the case, as the Dragon Priest &lt;a href=\"Hevnoraak\"&gt;Hevnoraak&lt;/a&gt; managed to get some of his life force back by transferring blood into his body.\nIn it is said that to become a Lich, one must force their body into death and beyond. The next part of becoming a Lich is having great necromantic knowledge in the dark arts. Then the soon to be Lich must steal souls from their vessels as painfully as possible, as the higher measure of pain and torment from the sacrifices the purer the ascent to Lichdom. Finally a powerful relic either evil or good that can be perverted, has to be used as a focus point for casting the spell used to take souls from their owners. The more powerful the relic, the more powerful the soul rending.\nPowers and abilities.\nLiches are some of the most powerful undead as they are able to cast vast amounts of spells such as &lt;a href=\"destruction\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic, and are able to summon undead such as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s. They apparently can resist magical attacks, and therefore are not to be trifled with; extreme caution should be taken when fighting with one. Liches can see those that are invisible, and have an immunity to all weapons besides Mithril and silver, although they are susceptible to fire. Additionally, they are able to regenerate health when wounded.\nPhysical appearance.\nPhysically, Liches appear to have decaying skin and bodies. They generally wear robes with a helm and shoulder plates, an amulet, and carry a staff that they use for combat. Another form of Lich is the Nether Lich, which have a transparent, ghost-like form; they are weaker than regular Liches, however.\nBehavior.\nDuring combat, Liches prefer to distance themselves from their foe, and frequently use destruction magics such as &lt;a href=\"Flames\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sparks\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt; to kill their enemies. They often summon undead such as skeletons to fight for them, while they stay in the background, casting various destruction spells. Also, a Lich apparently becomes hungry from time to time. Because of this, a wandering lost spirit of a child may be a Lich in disguise."}

Though their bodies are just as decayed as those of the mindless &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;, Liches still have the consciousness they had in life, being able to cast extremely powerful spells.\nThese undead are described by the Official Game Guide as \"very powerful, able to defeat high level characters easily,\" \u2013 indeed they are not only the most powerful creature in , but also one of the strongest in the entire &lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;. These immortal wizards have great skill in &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, including the black arts.\nTheir main offensive spell is a shock release which is used both in long range combat and \"melee\". However their skills go far beyond offensive casting; they have the ability to see those who are &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt; to common eyes, immunity to weapons below Mithril (with the exception of Silver) and &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; regeneration. Liches also have a high amount of Health and experience points.\nA Lich can be a difficult opponent to even experienced adventurers \u2013 defeat by their spells is presumable without proper equipment.\nThey appear in as rotting undead, with their bones exposed in the back. They also have long red hair and eyes. They wear blue robes and an amulet, and wield a shock staff to use during combat. These undead can be identified by their yell \u2014 which is the same used by &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Trolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverall, Liches are the second strongest creature encountered in after the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Golem\"&gt;Iron Golem&lt;/a&gt;, and as such, they are encountered only in the two last main quests of the game.\nEncounters.\nThe Lich appears in the following locations:"}

It is the most powerful undead in , relying on magic instead of using a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; or melee &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; like other undead. A Lich can be summoned by a Master-level conjurer. They walk with heavy steps when idle and float around rather slowly when alerted. Liches usually carry a staff leveled to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;. They can summon other undead such as &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;. Even lower level Liches have high resistance to magical attacks.\nLiches are the result of &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; who, by seeking immortality, subject their soul and body to black &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s. Liches, although capable of slowly rotting away, lose none of their former minds, and can still think sharply and cast powerful spells as they did in life.\nGeneral stats.\nDrops:\nDispositions.\nLiches are members of their own Lich faction instead of the standard Undead faction. The disposition modifiers for the factions ensure that Liches will not fight other undead and, conversely, that other undead will not fight Liches.\nThe primary difference between the Lich faction and the standard Undead faction is the relationship to &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;: standard Undead will happily cohabitate with Necromancers and Vampires, but Liches hate them and will immediately attack (in these cases the faction modifiers ensure that members of the Necromancers cult and Vampire faction also attack Liches).\nOne other implication of the special Lich faction is that Liches do not like each other. If two Liches spawn near each other in a dungeon, they are very likely to start fighting each other.\nStrategy.\nLiches are notoriously difficult to deal with in battle. They have high health, frequently employ devastating magic, are capable of summoning a leveled undead to aid them, and possess &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; which are often problematic.\nAs with all &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;conjuring&lt;/a&gt; enemies, it is recommended that the summon is ignored and the Lich attacked directly, since killing the summon will only prompt the Lich to summon another. They will often try to put distance between themselves and the player, as they have no exclusively close-range attacks. This can be used to the player's advantage, if they are somewhat decent with any form of melee combat. If the player is NOT talented in close range, a bow is usable, though it will consume a large amount of arrows. If magic is to be used, Fire is recommended. Liches have a natural weakness to said element, as do most undead. Liches are immune to Frost, and have a 25% resistance to all forms of magic, thus making Fire the only reliably effective element presented in the game.\nIt is always a good idea to keep a few Healing Potions or Healing Magic handy while dealing with Liches as, due to their high health, a battle can drag on if the player is relatively low level.\nIt seems that, if the Lich is disarmed by removing its staff, it will be unable to move, and Magicka regeneration seems to be stunted until they can reclaim the staff. With this in mind, if a player disarms a Lich and takes its staff before the Lich can reclaim it, the Lich will be effectively incapacitated, save for an occasional spell every now and then, allowing the player to combat any nearby enemies without worrying about the Lich itself.\nVariations.\nLiches have two known variants:"}

The journal tells of a man named Vangaril, who entered the cave prior to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to seek out an erstwhile friend named &lt;a href=\"Erandur-Vangaril\"&gt;Erandur-Vangaril&lt;/a&gt;, who has turned himself into a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving tried and failed to recruit the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, Vangaril set out to save his friend's soul on his own.\nWalkthrough.\nAs the Hero explores the cave's great emptiness, notes are found littering the floor, ranging from a personal note left by Vangaril with a rhyme he used to memorize his route of safe passage through the darkness, to a threat left by Erandur stating that he will, \"...consume Vangaril from within.\"\nThe Hero then enters the deepest reaches of the cavern, the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Boy%20Hidden%20Bastion\"&gt;Lost Boy Hidden Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, after encountering &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. A secret bastion is revealed, inhabited by the Lich of Lost Boy Cavern.\nAfter slaying the lich, who drops a leveled &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt;, they may notice behind a throne occupied by the skeletal remains of someone, possibly Erandur, a chest locked with an 'average' level lock and a note proclaiming Vangaril's supposed \"success\" in vanquishing the lich and exorcising it from Erandur's body.\nHaving been expelled from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; due to accusations of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, Vangaril was far too inexperienced to properly banish the demon. The note goes on to say that he will now search the cavern for such treasures as he may find to appease the mages of the guild.\nFurther exploration yields more documents. On a table, along with several tools of necromancy, as well as a severed head, are &lt;a href=\"Letters%20to%20the%20Guild%20of%20Mages\"&gt;three notes&lt;/a&gt; to the Mages Guild, two of which have been hastily crumpled and cast aside. The first is a respectful missive, named \"An Open Letter to the Guild of Mages,\" informing the guild that \"an evil has taken root in [Vangaril],\" and then abruptly stops, as the writer had discarded it.\nThe second is more aggressive, titled, \"A Letter to the Once Great Guild of Mages,\" saying that it is their fault that he was inexperienced in his work, and that for his subsequent possession they are to blame as well. This note as well trails off suddenly, before the writer finally began their completed message.\nThe final note, \"An Open Threat to the Guild of Mages,\" is written in a blatantly angry tone, threatening their downfall at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Erandur-Vangaril\"&gt;Erandur-Vangaril&lt;/a&gt; and the necromancers. It goes on to mention both &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, then finishes with a string of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Alphabet\"&gt;Daedric symbols&lt;/a&gt;."}

Turns out, if you dress in the same outfit as the people around you, keep your head low, and act like you belong, you can infiltrate even one of the most evil and dastardly cults currently operating in &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, it wasn't easy. And I felt for sure that I was going to be revealed as a spy every moment I was there. But I snuck inside and emerged again to tell the tale. Barely! So, let me tell you about life in the Scaled Court\u2014at least, life as I saw it for about four hours last Middas.\nFor the most part, life in the Scaled Court camp was much like what you'd expect in any gathering of rough-and-tumble fighters and mages. There was the usual good-natured banter among people who lived, worked, and fought side-by-side. There were a number of harsher words exchanged, too, showing that not everyone in the cult always gets along. But they had a singularity of purpose. The members of the Scaled Court that I interacted with were dedicated to their leaders, their god, and their cause. It was scary, how devoted to the Serpent these men and women seemed to be.\nOne young man, a former bandit from &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, was particularly enamored with the leaders of the Scaled Court. He seemed to be particularly intrigued by the highfalutin (in my opinion) and grandiose titles and affectations the leaders assigned to themselves. It starts at the very top, with the council of regents who apparently control the organization. I never got to meet any of the regents, but most were spoken of with admiration and awe. I believe that some of them hold positions in the hearts of the Scaled Court almost as revered as the Celestial Serpent himself.\nThere seemed to be some disagreement as to the wisdom of making the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orc\"&gt;Iron Orc&lt;/a&gt; chieftain the Ophidian Exarch of Undulating Destruction. No one could fault that the addition of the Iron Orcs to the Scaled Court's ranks was an inspired idea, but instituting the brutish &lt;a href=\"Braadoth\"&gt;Braadoth&lt;/a&gt; into the highest echelons of the Serpent's forces in Upper Craglorn was not sitting well with everyone in camp. I gathered this opinion in fits and starts, by interpreting asides and whispers, and pressing the most upset members for whatever additional information they were willing to share. Even so, no one I met wanted to challenge the Ophidian Exarch or the other regents, so the Orc chieftain's promotion stands.\nOther leadership positions in the Scaled Court include the Regent of Wriggling Nightmares (who seems to be involved in crafting monsters loyal to the Serpent), the Regent of Fanged Fury, the Vizier of Slithering Visions, and a woman named Cassipia, who they called the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems. An entirely different chain of command was in place in Lower Craglorn. I never encountered any of these pompously titled individuals. And that's probably a good thing, as I'm not sure my disguise would have fooled them.\nI spent the rest of my time in the camp wandering around and listening to conversations, watching men and women perform the multitude of mundane tasks that fill the day at any military camp. (And make no mistake\u2014the Scaled Court is as military an organization as any I've ever encountered!) I heard mention of some unidentified substance that seemed important to the Scaled Court, but I could never determine exactly what it was. Perhaps someone in the Star-Gazers has heard of it. They referred to it as \"nirncrux dust.\" Whatever the substance is used for, the Scaled Court seems to consider it vital to their plans.\nDuring my final hour in the camp, I began to get the distinct impression that I was being watched. Immediately alert, I scanned the area for any sign that I had been recognized as the outsider I was. However, no one was raising an alert. No one was rushing toward me. But the feeling persisted, and I decided I had overstayed my welcome. I started to disengage from the group and slowly make my way to the edge of the camp when a band of Iron Orcs wandered in. If the sight of them made my blood run cold, my first view of the armored troll that accompanied them froze the blood in my veins.\nThe troll wore strange armor of Orcish design, run through with glyphs that made me want to look away (although maybe that was just the fear the creature inspired in me). I could have sworn it turned to study me, but then it was pulled along by its Orc masters and I had a clear path out of the camp. Before I reached the freedom I so desperately desired, however, I felt a hand gently grip my shoulder. I tensed, let out a few deep breaths to steady my nerves, and turned to face whoever had found me out.\nI was looking at a young Wood Elf with piercing eyes. She smiled, not unkindly, and handed me a folded piece of paper. \"You're nice,\" she said. Then she turned away, leaving me to depart without further incident. I must have walked for an hour or more before I finally slowed and rested my weary back against a large, cool boulder. I sank to the ground and unfolded the piece of paper . It contained five short words.\n\"Tell them what you saw.\"\nI dropped the paper and ran, sure that the howling hordes of the Scaled Court were chasing on my heels. But I made it back to &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt; without any problems and wrote this report while it was still fresh in my mind. So fresh, in fact, that I'll probably have nightmares."}

I've already made arrangements with &lt;a href=\"Yondin\"&gt;Yondin&lt;/a&gt; to use the forge.

There's a new &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt;! And we're now part of some kind of Alliance - with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, of all people. \"&lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;\", they're calling it. I couldn't be prouder, but father has done nothing but grumble. He says letting \"those kind of folk\" onto the island will be bad for business.\n10th Sun's Dawn:\nSirune and I sneaked out in the middle of the night and made for &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;. It was so exciting, bedding down by the side of the road. Like we're in the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;! The handbills telling of the parade have been all over the island, and we decided we couldn't let something like this pass us by. I'll be thrice-cursed by the old mer, I know it. But damn him for a fool. Miss a chance to see Queen, the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, and the Bosmer &lt;a href=\"Treethanes\"&gt;Treethanes&lt;/a&gt;! Not in your life.\n11th Sun's Dawn:\nIf today was any indication, Father was right. The parade was amazing, with Her Majesty leading a phalanx of &lt;a href=\"First%20Auridon%20Marines\"&gt;Marines&lt;/a&gt; up the path to the gates. Then came the Treethanes, with their wily jungle &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Rangers\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk\"&gt;Vinedusk&lt;/a&gt;, I think someone said? And then the Mane, with those braids! Amazing to see the Khajiiti warriors on display.\nMuch more pleasing than the furry sneak-thief I caught with his hand in my coin-purse. I tried to catch him before he made off, but he dove between some of those damned dock workers who were so obsessed with their &lt;a href=\"frog%20races\"&gt;frog races&lt;/a&gt; they didn't even look up. And then he was gone. Sirune said it was all right, that we'd just leave earlier than we'd planned. Damn it. Just hate to let her down.\n17th Sun's Dawn:\nDamn them all! Everything has been a mess since Sirune and I came back from Skywatch. Father was furious that we'd left, and when I told him how many coins that cat took ... old bastard hasn't beated me like that I was learning the forge.\nThen, a few days ago, they pulled all of us into the forgemaster's office. &lt;a href=\"Condalin\"&gt;Condalin&lt;/a&gt; has gotten word that, with the new alliance, tradesmer can start hiring some of \"those folk\". Tossing a certain number of jobs to \"them\" would net you extra coin from the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd so he dropped father's contract! Been with the forge for decades, and now cat-men and cannibals are doing the job. All because of this damned alliance. Father's beside himself, about the steel more than anything. Says they won't know how to sure it right. Stars above, what's happening?\n2nd &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;:\nMy life is ruined. I'm on the run, and everyone I knew and loved hates me. Damn the \"Dominion\" and our smiling Queen to boot!\nIt all started when the recruiter for the &lt;a href=\"Battlereeve\"&gt;Battlereeve&lt;/a&gt; came to town. He was looking for volunteers for the Dominion military. When no one came forward, he said he'd been empowered to take conscripts. He tapped me and Sirune's brother. He also grabbed the twins, &lt;a href=\"Taleril\"&gt;Taleril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanaril\"&gt;Tanaril&lt;/a&gt;. Shoved us into a line with a gang of others and started us down the road.\nWe weren't a mile before Tanaril snapped. Went crazy, screaming about how he couldn't fight &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;, that they use your body to hatch spiders in. He made a break for it, and a bunch of us used the chance to run as well.\nI'm holed up in a cave near &lt;a href=\"Silsailen\"&gt;Silsailen&lt;/a&gt;. My father is penniless. My ride-to-be will son think me a traitor. The damned cats and runty Elves are taking over the island, and the military is putting children on the front lines. This isn't the homeland I grew up in!\n5th First Seed:\nI was reduced to trying to steal something for my evening meal, and - of course - I was caught. I slipped into Silsailen after dusk, the smell of some delicious &lt;a href=\"whitefish\"&gt;whitefish&lt;/a&gt; wafting on the breeze. I hadn't eater anything worthwhile since the morning the recruiter came into town, when I had that delicious spiced bread Sirune's mother made.\nI slipped into town and tracked the smell to the local inn. I was trying to figure out how to get into the kitchen when a big beefy hand fell on my shoulder. One of the &lt;a href=\"Canonreeve\"&gt;Canonreeve's&lt;/a&gt; men. He knew exactly what I was doing, almost like he'd been watching me since I got into town. Now I'm sitting in a cell underneath the reeve's manse, waiting his justice. At least they let me keep the journal here.\nDamn you, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;! Damn you, Dominion!\n10th First Steed:\nMy old life is over. And my new life under the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; has begun. I turns out the Canonreeve himself, and honorable man named &lt;a href=\"Canonreeve%20Valano\"&gt;Valano&lt;/a&gt;, has experienced his own doubts about his future under the Dominion. He used to be a good friend to the Queen, even, but worries now the years have changed her.\nValano is a member of a group called the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;. They're a group of freedom fighters, willing to do what has to be done. They're willing to make the hard choices, and stop the spread of foreign influence on our soil.\nI was brought up out of that cellar below Silseilen thinking I was going to do hard labor. Instead, I found a new family. Valano said he knew all about my problems, even knew that I'd be taken by a Dominion recruiter. Said that he was willing to help, and hep me help myself.\nAnd I will."}

The town of Ivarstead has been haunted by a ghost from Shroud Hearth Barrow. Though the ghost never comes into town, the townsfolk would be grateful if the Dragonborn investigated the barrow.\nInvestigate Shroud Hearth Barrow.\nUpon entering the barrow, the Dragonborn is confronted by the spectral figure of &lt;a href=\"Wyndelius%20Gatharian\"&gt;Wyndelius Gatharian&lt;/a&gt; behind a barred gate wailing, \"Leave this place!\" Once he departs, a room with a series of levers is encountered opposite where he appears. The Illusion skill book, \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Ages%20of%20Man\"&gt;Before the Ages of Man&lt;/a&gt;\", can be found in this room. Once the correct combination of levers is pulled, the gates will open across the way and the path that Wyndelius took can be followed.\u00a0Wyndelius will be waiting, or even sleeping if one remains stealthy, in the next room and must be dispatched. Killing him reveals that he is no more than a mere man in the guise of a spirit, further evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Philter%20of%20the%20Phantom\"&gt;special potion&lt;/a&gt; found on him and confirmed by reading his &lt;a href=\"Wyndelius%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;. With Wyndelius' journal in hand the objective \"Investigate Shroud Hearth Barrow\" is completed and a new objective presents itself.\nWyndelius' Journal.\nLeaving the barrow and returning to Wilhelm with the journal will satisfy his curiosity and bring the mystery behind Shroud Hearth Barrow to a close, as far as Ivarstead is concerned at least. Wilhelm will give the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Sapphire%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;Sapphire Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt; as a reward, which is in fact the claw that Wyndelius was searching for in the barrow and thus is the key to unlocking its treasured depths.\nFurther into the Barrow.\nBack in the barrow, the room opposite Wyndelius' quarters contains the door to the main chambers with the combination being moth, owl, and wolf (this can be seen on the claw in inventory). The first chamber contains the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Oakflesh\"&gt;Oakflesh&lt;/a&gt; as well as a number of &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;. The next room holds a spiraled stairway, with a water trap at the bottom where a lowly adventurer drowned in its depths. At the top is a master-locked door with an expert-locked chest holding leveled loot. In the middle of the stairway is the path leading to the next room where several &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; are in an oil pool. Igniting the oil by shooting the hanging lamps, or otherwise igniting the oil via &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt;-based &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, puts an end to these archers. Before heading down the wooden stairway to cross the room, on the right side is a window to another room. The entrance to that room is located around the corner, through a coffin controlled by a handle next to it. Also, on the left side there are two more coffins that can be opened by activating a handle located on the wall next to each one of these coffins; one of them has a draugr, and the other one a skeleton.\nThe following corridor is home to several draugr, one of which holds the key to the door beyond. A room with a cascading waterfall has a drawbridge across it, but it is pulled up. A leveled sword can be found behind the waterfall. At the top of the stairs to the right is a turn-stone matching puzzle. Opening the door to the room behind it will initiate a battle with a draugr. Once he is dispatched, standing on the central pressure plate causes the doors to several alcoves to rotate open, which reveal the combination (from left to right: whale, hawk, snake, whale) to the puzzle. Rotating the short pillars outside then standing on the pressure plate causes the bridge to be lowered. Across the bridge stands in the corridor stands a single draugr archer. He can be dispatched by activating the tripwire along the ground to cause a number of rocks to fall down the slope. To the right is an apprentice-locked door to the right with a &lt;a href=\"gold%20ingot\"&gt;gold ingot&lt;/a&gt; within linked to a fire trap. Taking the gold ingot from the pedestal sets off the trap. The ingot can be retrieved without being harmed by standing back from the pedestal and using &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;, spells, or &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; to push it off, then waiting for the fire to stop. Further along is the door to the Shroud Hearth Depths.\nShroud Hearth Depths.\nThe first main room is filled with a series of sarcophagi which hold graduating levels of skeletons and leveled draugr. As they appear and are killed, the next tier will appear from their crypts, culminating in a leveled draugr lord at the room's apex. Once he is dispatched, the Dragonborn can continue to the final chamber. Using all three words of the Unrelenting Force Shout to knock the draugr lord into the water is also a one-hit kill. It is quite easy to go into sneak mode, if &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill is high enough, to pick off all the draugr with a high-power &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the sarcophagi further into the chamber is a chest with leveled loot (though the hidden trap on the right side of the chest must be picked open to avoid the poison darts from the ceiling) and a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Peace\"&gt;Kyne's Peace&lt;/a&gt; shout.\nThere is more loot in an alcove left of the Word Wall. &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to get to it. Also in the chamber is an adept-locked chest under the water to the right of the large trapped chest, in an alcove."}

The Countess needs some help locating an artifact.\nWalkthrough.\nThe Countess.\nWhen the Hero speaks with the Countess in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bruma\"&gt;Castle Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, she mentions that she is an avid collector of &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; items and considers her collection the most complete in all of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, one artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Draconian%20Madstone\"&gt;Draconian Madstone&lt;/a&gt;, has eluded her for some time. Based on an old, transcribed Akaviri diary, Carvain believes that it can be found at the legendary &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;, an Akaviri fort deep within the northern mountains.\nThe fort at Pale Pass was the location of several Akaviri staged assaults during their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the north many ages ago. The countess believes that the Akaviri commander had the stone in his possession and tasks the Hero with finding it.\nShe gives\u00a0the Hero a transcription of the journal, which provides an explanation of how to find the legendary Pass, and a roughly drawn map of Pale Pass that was found with the journal. She also provides\u00a0the first map marker, &lt;a href=\"Dragonclaw%20Rock\"&gt;Dragonclaw Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nSerpent's Trail.\nTo find Dragonclaw Rock, follow the dirt path east and then northeast from Bruma. Once there, head northwest up the mountain and one should find the cave's location &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Trail\"&gt;Serpent's Trail&lt;/a&gt;. Be careful at the entrance, as there may be Will-o-the-Wisps present.\u00a0In the trail, there are leveled &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass%20Ogre%20Stonewrecker\"&gt;Pale Pass Ogre Stonewrecker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"animals\"&gt;animals&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href=\"Land%20Dreugh%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt;, depending on level.\nWatch out for trap pads on the ground. One will eventually come across a skeleton, prompting a message window informing the Hero that the skeleton belongs to the same dead messenger that authored the journal. The skeleton is holding the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Orders\"&gt;Akaviri Orders&lt;/a&gt; that were supposed to be delivered to the commander. The Hero may choose to pick up these orders or not. Doing so is not required to complete the quest; however, it does affect later dialogue. Continue on through the cave until\u00a0reaching a door that leads outside to Pale Pass.\nPale Pass.\nIn Pale Pass, the Hero will find Pale Pass Ogre Stonewreckers and possibly &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;. Simply follow the path north-northwest until arriving at the old fort. Enter the fort into the Mouth of the Serpent, located in a dilapidated tower.\nThe Ancient Fort.\nOnce\u00a0the Hero has entered the fort, head down the hall and watch out for a log trap when reaching the first hallway intersection. The main enemies of this fort are &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Akaviri%20Soldier\"&gt;Undead Akaviri Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, who each wield a &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Akaviri%20Katana\"&gt;Ruined Akaviri Katana&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Ruined%20Akaviri%20Shield\"&gt;Ruined Akaviri Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe goal room is the Venom of the Serpent. There are several ways to get there from the beginning, although if\u00a0one has the intention to scout out and eliminate everything in the whole place, one will eventually make\u00a0it there. If not, the quickest and most direct way is the following:\nAt the first hallway intersection, make a left, go up the stairs and jump across the hallway to the other side (or, if\u00a0the Hero doesn't have a high &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; skill, jump to the side platform to get across). Then enter the Scales of the Serpent. Go down the stairs, but slow down once\u00a0the Hero comes to the hallway, as there will be several loose rocks in the ceiling. Allow the rocks to fall and then proceed.\nFollow the hallway as it turns left, lower and cross the bridge, and enter the Fangs of the Serpent. Once inside, look at the columns. One should notice that they have arrow trap holes. These can easily be avoided by circling around to the right and jumping around the outside of the columns. Lower the bridge and cross it, then make a left and enter the Venom of the Serpent.\nCommander Mishaxhi.\nIn the Venom, there will be the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Commander%20Mishaxhi\"&gt;Akaviri Commander Mishaxhi&lt;/a&gt;. Don't attack him yet. Go up and talk to him and he'll ask\u00a0where the orders are. There are three options, all of which are viable:\nAny of these three options will work and will ultimately achieve the same purpose: opening the wall behind Mishaxhi where three chests and the &lt;a href=\"Draconian%20Madstone\"&gt;Draconian Madstone&lt;/a&gt; are hidden. If\u00a0the Hero decided to kill Mishaxhi, he will drop the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Dai-Katana\"&gt;Akaviri Dai-Katana&lt;/a&gt;, but be sure to pick it up immediately. Otherwise, the katana will disappear with his ghostly body.\nReturn to the Countess.\nGo back out to Pale Pass and then &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; back to Bruma for the reward of the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Vipereye\"&gt;Ring of the Vipereye&lt;/a&gt;. The player can reenter Pale Pass at any time by traveling through the Serpent's Trail once more, and any side quests can be completed thus.\nMinor side quest: Keys and Barrels.\nAs a small side quest in the area, in one of the small frozen ponds southeast of the fort there is a Frozen Barrel. In this barrel, they will find a key and a \"&lt;a href=\"Crumpled%20Note\"&gt;Crumpled Note&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe note tells a story of how a thief (G.S.) stole a ring from the wizard Ortharzel. After fleeing, this mysterious person ends up in Pale Pass and decides to hide the ring here. The note mentions that the thief used the \"key to a key\" trick.\nThe key from the Frozen Barrel unlocks the Rusty Chest hidden among the grass in the tower just west of the entrance to the Mouth of the Serpent. The Rusty Chest contains a key to the Old Chest hidden behind some rocks along the trail southeast of the lake with the Frozen Barrel.\nThe Old Chest contains the key to the Forgotten Chest southwest of the entrance back to &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Trail\"&gt;Serpent's Trail&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the Forgotten Chest contains the &lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Circlet%20of%20Omnipotence\"&gt;Circlet of Omnipotence&lt;/a&gt;, a one-pound ring which increases five &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; by a small amount each. The chests in the area respawn every week or so, so the Circlet of Omnipotence can be retrieved multiple times, though only one may be worn. The copies may be sold or put into storage, however."}

You have learned to move easily with it in combat. As a Master of Light Armor, you gain a 50% increase in protection if wearing all light armor.\"\nTraining.\nOne way to speed level your Light Armor skill is to gather a group of low level enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;, adjust the difficulty slider to the lowest possible, and observe while the creatures attack you. It is advisable to have a few &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; of healing on hand to restore yourself. While your armor will become damaged and eventually destroyed, you will continue to gain skill points as long as you let them attack.\nAnother good place to level up your light armor skill (or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;) is to go to &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hackdirt&lt;/a&gt;. In the caverns below the town (accessible through any building) are the &lt;a href=\"Hackdirt%20Brethren\"&gt;Brethren&lt;/a&gt;. These will attack on sight with clubs. There are about 4\u20135 of them so you will need a decent amount of health potions.\nAnother method is to be a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, while following its \"&lt;a href=\"Permanent%20Retirement\"&gt;Permanent Retirement&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. After killing the target, you will be wanted by the &lt;a href=\"City%20Watch\"&gt;City Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Heading inside their barracks, a group will gather, ready to attack you. Having a large stock of potions and a high restoration skill is advised.\nNPC dialogue.\nWhen one's Light Armor skill is 70 or higher, NPCs will say: \"I heard you know how to move in light armor.\"\nUsefulness.\nLight Armor doesn't provide very much protection initially. But if you are willing to wait until you get the Master perk it provides 50% more protection than normal, making &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt; armor equivalent to &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; armor in everything but health (heavy armor does not encumber the wearer if they're a master, nor does light armor encumber the wearer if they're an expert). Light Armor is the only \"speed skill\" that is very useful. It has been argued that &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneaks&lt;/a&gt; do not need light armor since they are better protected by not being seen, &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;paralyzing&lt;/a&gt; opponents, or fleeing. Despite all this, many players prefer light armor since it does not encumber them nearly as much as Heavy Armor."}

The Light Armor skill is raised by incurring damage while light armor is equipped, paying a &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; to train the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, or by reading &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill books&lt;/a&gt;.\nInitially Light armor provides less protection than &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;, however, due to the maximum in-game armor cap, it will eventually provide just as much protection as Heavy armor. It also weighs less, slows the wearer less, and allows for much quieter sneaking. It comes in several varieties, providing different aesthetics, armor ratings and weights.\nLeveling.\nLeveling up armor skills is relatively simple: take physical damage in combat while wearing armor pieces of that type. To level up the Light Armor skill most efficiently, wear a full set of Light Armor (head, hands, feet, chest). The rate of skill gain is based on \"the total amount of damage incoming before armor is applied\". Thus, taking multiple attacks from a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; levels Light Armor at a significantly slower rate than blows from &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; would. Being the victim of power attacks likewise grants more experience than a standard attack. Conversely increasing armor rating does \"not\" decrease the rate at which the skill advances.\nFor those who are &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, wearing the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Articulation\"&gt;Amulet of Articulation&lt;/a&gt; when taking hits will increase the Light Armor skill, as the amulet counts as Light Armor. The &lt;a href=\"Diadem%20of%20the%20Savant\"&gt;Diadem of the Savant&lt;/a&gt; also increases the Light Armor skill when worn in battle.\nOne can rapidly level up the skill simply by finding an enemy (or group of enemies) which uses physical attacks and allowing them to attack without attacking back. &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt; are useful in this regard, as they have low health yet can do enough damage, especially the larger varieties. &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt; magic and &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;healing potions&lt;/a&gt; can be used to restore any damage taken (thus one can also level up the Restoration skill simultaneously). If you have a shield of the appropriate Armor type, one can also upgrade the &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; skill as well during this process. Taking on larger groups and/or more powerful enemies will level the skill(s) faster, but one has to balance their ability to restore their own health against the amount of damage they will be taking.\nTo level up the skill in complete safety, especially at low levels, one can find a &lt;a href=\"Brawling\"&gt;brawl&lt;/a&gt; opponent willing to brawl repeatedly without charging a wager - usually during a quest such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Hired%20Muscle\"&gt;Hired Muscle&lt;/a&gt;\" quest often dispensed near the beginning of the Companions questline or the \"&lt;a href=\"Taking%20Care%20of%20Business\"&gt;Taking Care of Business&lt;/a&gt;\" quest for the Thieves Guild.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Light Armor skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Light Armor skill:\nArmor types.\nThe following are the confirmed light armors that will benefit from this skill:\nCraftable armor.\nThese armors can be crafted and improved using the requisite perk from the &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; tree along with the required materials at a blacksmith &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nNon-craftable armors.\nThese armors are acquired as part of a quest line or looted throughout the world.

For these armor types, the forger is as much tailor as blacksmith. All use large pieces of leather, stitched together with leather strips.\n&lt;a href=\"Studded%20armor\"&gt;Studded armor&lt;/a&gt; also need &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron ingots&lt;/a&gt;, from which you will make the studs and metal rings that make it more effective than simple hide. &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Scaled armor&lt;/a&gt; uses &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt; instead of iron, but the steel is infused with &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ingot\"&gt;Corundum&lt;/a&gt; to make the metal inserts stronger.\nFor centuries the secret of making &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven armor&lt;/a&gt; was a closely guarded secret on &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Then the Betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Ulvul%20Llaren\"&gt;Ulvul Llaren&lt;/a&gt; brought it the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Ulvul was a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; slave, working the bellows for &lt;a href=\"Nuulion\"&gt;Nuulion&lt;/a&gt;, master smith of the isle from the fifth through the seventh century of the &lt;a href=\"second%20era\"&gt;second era&lt;/a&gt;. When Ulvul escaped, he could think of no greater punishment to mete out to his cruel master than to reveal all his secrets to the world. Thus we came to know that &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Moonstone&lt;/a&gt; is the key ingredient in Elven armor, and that salt water must be used to quench the hot metal.\nFor Gilded Elven armor, you must also meld in &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;. It melts at a much lower heat than Moonstone, making it tricky to work the two metals together.\nThe trickiest of all is &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Glass&lt;/a&gt;. Hammer blows struck across the grain run the risk of shattering the armor. It's principle ingredient is &lt;a href=\"Malachite%20Ore\"&gt;Malachite&lt;/a&gt;, although it also requires Moonstone to give it the right strength."}

For these armor types, the hammer is less useful than the sewing kit. A sharp awl is necessary to restitch the thick material. Holes frequently have to be patched with spare material. The rule of thumb is once you have to patch a patch, it's time to throw out the armor and get a new set.\nMetallic armor will occasionally need a patch. Usually it can be repaired by hammering the torn pieces back together. Elven and Mithril will repair better when heated. Chainmail is usually malleable enough to work on cold.\nThe trickiest of all is Glass. Hammer blows struck across the grain run the risk of shattering the armor. Whenever possible, align the hammer blows with the grain. In extreme cases, place the armor in tub of oil. Place the anvil so that the affected piece is on the anvil, but just under the oil. Vibrations from the hammer blows are absorbed by the oil and less likely to shatter the Glass."}

With the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; in hand, it is now time for &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; to return to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, claim the Septim Throne, and light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; invasion.\nWalkthrough.\nCloud Ruler Temple.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must escort Martin Septim to the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council%20Chambers\"&gt;Elder Council Chambers&lt;/a&gt; in order to present his claim to the Septim Throne. However, before leaving, be sure to stock up on any necessary items such as potions, arrows, repair hammers, etc. If the Hero leaves Martin at &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt; to get these items, when they return to escort him, he will be waiting in the stables to the left of the entrance.\nImperial City.\nWhen ready, take Martin to see &lt;a href=\"Chancellor%20Ocato\"&gt;Chancellor Ocato&lt;/a&gt; in the Elder Council Chambers, located in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial City Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Midway through the conversation, an Imperial Legion soldier will inform them the Imperial City is under attack by Daedra. Martin will inform the Hero that they must proceed to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;. A pair of Dremora burst into the council chamber itself. There are more Daedra outside the doors.\nProtect Martin at all costs. Make sure he does not die, which may be quite difficult at higher levels, when only &lt;a href=\"Xivilai%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt;, Dremora Valkynaz, and &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Storm Atronachs&lt;/a&gt; will spawn. There will be at least seven generic soldiers (two from the Imperial Palace and five from the Bastion), along with Ocato, and &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; to help. If Baurus has died in an earlier quest, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Steffan\"&gt;Captain Steffan&lt;/a&gt; will aid the Hero. If Steffan has died also, they do not receive help from anyone else.\nThe biggest fight occurs when the party enters the Temple quarter. The Hero should run through the entrance to the Temple District before Martin gets there, so that he will stay behind the door. This leaves them to fight all the Daedra on their own but stops him from being killed. If Martin comes through the gate make sure he stays alive at all costs.\nThere are swarms of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; pouring from several Oblivion gates, which could be a mixture of the aforementioned Daedra \u2014 it is advised that the Hero protect Martin. Note that the Hero cannot enter these gates, and if they kill the Daedra coming out of them, more will spawn.\nThe gates are designed to keep a constant number of enemies on the field. Once &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; arrives on site, Martin will speak to the Hero. The process can be hurried along by running away from Martin directly to the right in the Temple District so that they see Mehrunes Dagon. Otherwise, he moves very slowly, and they will be needlessly fighting Daedra until he gets to them. Run back to Martin for the conversation with him.\nAfter the short talk with Martin, run for the Temple of the One's door at once and waste no time getting inside. Once they are inside Martin will appear inside. If they are not fast enough to run in, then attempt to hurt Dagon. He cannot be killed, unless the Hero possesses the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; staff from the Sheogorath shrine quest. Which in this case his life points will be replaced with a lesser creatures', causing him to turn into a glitchy mess when hit with a weapon or damaging spell. If he is hit without the staff's magic, he will be staggered if he is hit with enough power from one particular attack or spell.\nTemple of One.\nInside the temple, Martin will show that he is indeed a Septim by turning into a Dragon \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Akatosh%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Avatar of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and battling with Mehrunes Dagon. Just before Martin turns into the avatar of Akatosh, he bids goodbye to the Hero. Mehrunes Dagon then rips off the roof of the Temple. A fight begins, ending in Martin defeating Mehrunes Dagon.\nThe Dragon, wounded from the fight, turns into a massive statue of Akatosh, similar to the statues in Talos Plaza and Market district.\nIn the end, Martin's sacrifice not only managed to send all the Daedra back to Oblivion \u2014 his actions prohibit them from entering Tamriel. Even though the Septim Dynasty ended with his death, the Dragonfires will not have to be lit ever again.\nOcato, who came into the temple, announces that Martin Septim is the greatest emperor of the Septim Dynasty, possibly even greater than Tiber Septim himself, and will always be remembered. Ocato then bestows the title of the Champion of Cyrodiil to the Hero, and orders a suit of Imperial Dragon Armor to be delivered. However, he is concerned about the future of the empire. Without an emperor, he will need the support of the Champion in more recent times."}

Members of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Defender%20Two-Blades\"&gt;Defender Two-Blades&lt;/a&gt;, are determined to stop the Cult from raising an army of shadows that will destabilize the region.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest is obtained by talking to &lt;a href=\"Defender%20Two-Blades\"&gt;Defender Two-Blades&lt;/a&gt;, who asks the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to find out how the Spider Cult is turning innocent people into shadow soldiers to build a whole army.\nAt first, the group of players has to find the Fighters Guild survivors.\nThe Fighters Guild survivors are found in cages. The first one is &lt;a href=\"Journeyman%20Gulvera\"&gt;Journeyman Gulvera&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to her after freeing her. Continue through the dungeon and find the second survivor -&lt;a href=\"Swordsman%20Ranarwa\"&gt;Swordsman Ranarwa&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to this survivor as well, and then go on to find and talk to the third one, &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Fasarel\"&gt;Apprentice Fasarel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first boss here is &lt;a href=\"Mephala%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Mephala's Fang&lt;/a&gt;. Werewolves should be careful because this creature has a lot of poison attacks. The two healers who support her should be killed as fast as possible. Also, this boss might run to the corpse of a killed player who hasn't been resurrected immediately and heal while feeding on that corpse.\nAfter freeing all the survivors, you are tasked with finding the Obsidian Husk.\nThe second boss encountered in this quest is &lt;a href=\"Gamyne%20Bandu\"&gt;Gamyne Bandu&lt;/a&gt;. The hard part of fighting him is the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Tormentor\"&gt;Shadow Tormentor&lt;/a&gt;s spawning during the clash and holding down one of the group members. If the group member is not helped before the shadow sword hits them, they die. The way to help the player who is held down is to kill just one of the Shadow Tormentors. From time to time, Gamyne disappears and summons four &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Aspect\"&gt;Obsidian Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nContinue to meet and battle &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warrior\"&gt;Obsidian Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, more Spider Cult, and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next boss, who is encountered after passing the first stone bridge, is &lt;a href=\"Ciirenas%20the%20Shepherd\"&gt;Ciirenas the Shepherd&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Ciirenas%27%20Spider\"&gt;Ciirenas' Spider&lt;/a&gt;s. The tactic in this fight is quite simple, it's good to kill the spiders first and focus on Ciirenas afterwards. However, if the boss is left alive too long, Ciirenas starts casting spells, so some players might prefer killing Ciirenas before the spiders.\nContinue through the second stone bridge to face more Spider Cult members and spiders.\nAfter crossing the third bridge, the group encounters &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20of%20Mephala%20%28Fungal%20Grotto%29\"&gt;Spawn of Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, another boss. Stay away when she creates her red circle.\nAfter killing her, go to the door above the place where Spawn of Mephala was found. You will face a lot of Obsidian Warriors. Finally, enter the chamber where the Obsidian Husk is hidden, and battle &lt;a href=\"Reggr%20Dark-Dawn\"&gt;Reggr Dark-Dawn&lt;/a&gt; -a boss. It is recommended to go immediately left (or right) just after entering the room, to kill the Obsidian Warriors in the left (or right) side of the chamber, then sneak to the right (or left) side of the chamber, kill the Obsidian Warriors there, and then start the battle with Reggr. Be wary, because this boss can drain magicka.\nAfter activating the Obsidian Husk, you have to return to Defender Two-Blades.\nKill the Spider Cultists on your way. At the stone bridge you will meet Apprentice Fasarel, who will advise you to take a side tunnel to reach Two-Blades faster. Jump down from the bridge into the water to find that tunnel.\nContinue through the corridor and fight the Obsidian Warriors.\nWhen you talk to Two-Blades, it turns out you have to kill &lt;a href=\"Vila%20Theran\"&gt;Vila Theran&lt;/a&gt;, a character encountered during the first Fungal Grotto quest, &lt;a href=\"Kings%20of%20the%20Grotto\"&gt;Kings of the Grotto&lt;/a&gt;.\nVila Theran can attack you with lighting beams, and you can clear the damage dealt to you by running into the bubble. The red circles created by her expand, so run away from them to avoid being killed.\nAfter the battle talk to Defender Two-Blades to get the reward."}

As such, strict rules prohibited the use of many types of light, as the Aurorans could utilize it and turn it into their own energy.

Contrary to her name, she has a reputation for being an utterly cruel and heartless woman. One of her charges, &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt;, managed to escape the orphanage and employ a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; to have a murder &lt;a href=\"Contracts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt; against her satisfied.\nPersonality.\nGrelod is frequently cruel and abusive towards the &lt;a href=\"children\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; in her care. Not only does she beat them and refuse to allow their &lt;a href=\"adoption\"&gt;adoption&lt;/a&gt;, but she berates them verbally as well. Listening to Grelod's conversation with the orphans reveals she has \"extra beatings\" planned for any who \"shirk their duties.\" She also states that they will never be adopted because nobody wants them, and openly calls them \"riff-raff\" to their faces.\nThe children are not the only ones in the orphanage who suffer from Grelod's cruelty. She also yells at her assistant, &lt;a href=\"Constance%20Michel\"&gt;Constance Michel&lt;/a&gt;, from time to time, issuing mean-spirited complaints about the children and orders to deal with them. According to Constance, the people of Riften are well aware of Grelod's cruel nature; they call her \"Grelod the Kind\" out of irony.\nInteractions.\nGrelod generally wants nothing to do with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Any attempts to speak to her will be roundly refused, as she is hostile to everyone.\nSpread the Love.\nIf the Dragonborn tries to give Grelod one of &lt;a href=\"Dinya%20Balu\"&gt;Dinya Balu&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Warmth%20of%20Mara\"&gt;The Warmth of Mara&lt;/a&gt;\" pamphlets after completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20Love\"&gt;The Book of Love&lt;/a&gt;,\" Grelod will flatly turn him or her down. \"Unless Mara wishes to come down and help me with these urchins, I don't really give a damn about her blessings.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is asked to assassinate Grelod the Kind by &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus Aretino&lt;/a&gt; after being mistaken for a member of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/a&gt;.\" If the Dragonborn does so, the children of the orphanage cheer and do not alert the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Guard\"&gt;Riften Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrelod can generally be cut down right in front of all of the children with no repercussions. If the Dragonborn lingers around too long the guards may eventually come inside \u2013 likely called by &lt;a href=\"Constance%20Michel\"&gt;Constance Michel&lt;/a&gt;, who is the only person to show anything but happiness at Grelod's death by running around screaming. Once Grelod is gone, interactions with the children indicate that their lives have improved considerably: Constance is now in charge of the orphanage, and she treats her charges far more kindly than Grelod did.\nIt is generally not possible to speak to Grelod, though it can be done if she is confronted after receiving the contract from Aventus; the Dragonborn can even claim to be a member of the Dark Brotherhood, despite not being recruited yet. However, Grelod will not be intimidated no matter what is said.\nEven when \"Hearthfire\" is installed, it is not possible to adopt children from the orphanage while Grelod the Kind lives. The Dragonborn may adopt children from elsewhere in Skyrim. Constance will remain agitated until the Dragonborn completes \"Innocence Lost\" by talking to &lt;a href=\"Aventus%20Aretino\"&gt;Aventus&lt;/a&gt;. In order to adopt from Honorhall one is required to begin the Dark Brotherhood series of quests, regardless of whether the Dragonborn joins the Brotherhood or decides to &lt;a href=\"Destroy%20the%20Dark%20Brotherhood%21\"&gt;destroy it&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nCombat and posthumous events.\nWhile it is possible to assassinate her without being detected, the children enter the room and celebrate regardless. Constance will panic, even if the assassin is undetected, or even if (through the use of a Fury spell) she did the deed herself. No &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; is gained, however. Constance will remain agitated and demand that the Dragonborn leave immediately. After the Dragonborn reports back to Aretino, guards all over Skyrim will comment about it. Guards in the Rift and Riften will mention that they saw the Dragonborn coming out of there, though one will never be charged with the crime.\nAfter Grelod is killed, the children in the orphanage all express respect for the Dark Brotherhood, as well as admiration for Aventus Aretino, for carrying out his promise. After Grelod's death, a coffin labeled \"Grelod The Kind's Coffin\" appears in Riften's &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Innocence%20Lost\"&gt;Innocence Lost&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"What do you want? You have no business being in here!\"\nConversations.\nGrelod \"Those who shirk their duties will get an extra beating. Do I make myself clear?\"\"\nSamuel \"Yes, Grelod.\"\"\nRuna \"Yes, Grelod.\"\"\nHroar \"Yes, Grelod.\"\"\nFrancois \"Yes, Grelod.\"\"\nGrelod \"And one more thing! I will hear no more talk of adoptions! None of you riff-raff is getting adopted. Nobody needs you, nobody wants you. That, my darlings, is why you're here. Why you'll always be here, until you come of age and get thrown into that wide, horrible world. Now, what do you all say?\"\"\nSamuel \"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.\"\"\nRuna \"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.\"\"\nHroar \"We love you, Grelod. Thank you for your kindness.\"\"\nFrancois \"We love you, Grelod.

{"id": "795815", "revid": "25622775", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=795815", "title": "Greymarch", "text": "The Greymarch was a recurring event that occurred at the end of every &lt;a href=\"era\"&gt;era&lt;/a&gt;, or every thousand years. The Greymarch heralded the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Order, &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s realm, the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Greymarch traces its origins to a curse placed upon Jyggalag by the other Daedric Princes out of fear of Jyggalag's growing power. The curse transformed Jyggalag into Sheogorath, the antithetical Daedric Prince of Madness.\nAt the end of every era, Jyggalag was able to break free from the curse and lead his &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Order\"&gt;Forces of Order&lt;/a&gt; against the inhabitants of the Shivering Isles in an attempt to cleanse the realm of madness and reclaim it as his own. However, the curse would renew itself after the Greymarch was over with Sheogorath returning to rebuild the Shivering Isles, never quite sure where everything used to be, leading to a succession of ruins of the previous capital cities. As Jyggalag had done with any remnant of madness he could find, Sheogorath destroyed any remnant of Order left behind, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Dyus\"&gt;Dyus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEach Greymarch begins with the emergence of large &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20Order\"&gt;obelisks&lt;/a&gt; and the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Order%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Knights of Order&lt;/a&gt;, who use the obelisks as conduits into the Isles. These obelisks are maintained by &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Order\"&gt;Priests of Order&lt;/a&gt;, residents of the Shivering Isles who had abandoned Sheogorath to serve Jyggalag.\nGradually, more obelisks would appear, turning the vibrant realm of madness into a gray and monotone area. The Knights of Order would then begin to attack anyone they can find, killing the residents and guards who remain loyal to Sheogorath.\nDuring the course of the Greymarch, Sheogorath gradually loses his madness and develops moments of clarity, until he \"dies\" and transforms into Jyggalag. The Prince of Order would then proceed to the throne room of the Shivering Isles, and, in doing so, mark the victory of Order and the defeat of Madness.\nSoon after, Jyggalag himself \"dies\" and is replaced by Sheogorath. The process of the curse's renewal may be either instantaneous or gradual, as it has never been clarified. Sheogorath reveals only that the realm remains in ruins each time he returns. Due to Jyggalag \"lacking any originality,\" the Greymarch occurs in the same manner each cycle.\nBreaking the cycle.\nSheogorath had attempted to break the cycle of the Greymarch at least once. This earliest known attempt involved digging a pit and filling it with clowns, which failed to prevent Jyggalag's advance.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath devised a second known attempt to avert the Greymarch. This plan involved finding a mortal champion to &lt;a href=\"Mantling\"&gt;mantle&lt;/a&gt; him, ensuring the throne of the Shivering Isles would not be empty when Jyggalag arrived and enabling there to be someone powerful enough to stop his invasion.\nTo this end, Sheogorath opened &lt;a href=\"A%20Strange%20Door\"&gt;a portal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; as an invitation to any mortal willing to enter the Shivering Isles and attempt to become said champion. &lt;a href=\"Belmyne%20Dreleth\"&gt;Belmyne Dreleth&lt;/a&gt; lost his sanity after he entered the portal and soon ran out, only to be slain. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; would then enter to become this champion.\nTo become the new Sheogorath, the Hero had to restart &lt;a href=\"Xedilian\"&gt;Xedilian&lt;/a&gt;, learn the ways of Mania and Dementia, replace either the &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Mania\"&gt;Duke of Mania&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20of%20Dementia\"&gt;Duchess of Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, rebuild a new &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, and acquire the Staff of Sheogorath, all the while fighting off the advancement of the Forces of Order and making sure few residents dared to turn traitor.\nDuring the course of the Hero's journey, Sheogorath noted several times that new things were happening during this Greymarch cycle, which he took as a sign that things were finally changing and there was hope of ending the Greymarch once and for all. One major change was the betrayal by either the &lt;a href=\"Thadon\"&gt;Duke of Mania&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Syl%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Duchess of Dementia&lt;/a&gt; in response to the murder of the other.\nThe traitor would go on to offer useful insights for the Forces of Order, directing them to either &lt;a href=\"Brellach\"&gt;Brellach&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20Rock\"&gt;Pinnacle Rock&lt;/a&gt; to cut off the supply of Sheogorath's army and to the Pools of Mania and Dementia, poisoning them and causing &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath's Staff&lt;/a&gt; to lose power and be unable to be recharge.\nSheogorath ultimately transformed into Jyggalag before the Hero could complete their accession by receiving the Staff of Sheogorath. With the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt; and Dyus, the Hero was able to acquire a new staff and fight Jyggalag directly after slaying the traitor and cleansing the pools.\nThe Hero of Kvatch and Jyggalag fought each other on the grounds of &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth%20Palace\"&gt;New Sheoth Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Though Jyggalag doubted the mortal champion could win, the Hero was able to defeat him in single combat.\nJyggalag's defeat signaled the end of the Greymarch once and for all, along with the end of the curse. Jyggalag used this newfound freedom to explore &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; while the Hero remained as the new Sheogorath. For the first time, the Shivering Isles survived the Greymarch with most of its inhabitants alive and, with the departure of Jyggalag, the Forces of Order retreated."}

Greymoor serves as the military bulwark of the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, but it has been used as an estate during the time of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nGreymoor is located in a strategic area, on the crossroad between &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the south, the region of &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt; to the north, and the rest of Whiterun Hold to the east. The layout of Greymoor is the standard version that is seen throughout the other strongholds of Skyrim. The Courtyard is rather open, with several encampments for the residents of Fort Greymoor. Underneath Castle Greymoor, there is a hidden entrance leading into the inner keep and coming from a small river descending from the Western Hills. Fort Greymoor is also very isolated from the rest of Skyrim, the nearest settlement to the town is Whiterun and &lt;a href=\"Sungard\"&gt;Sungard&lt;/a&gt;. The scope of Greymoor is rather small, but when Sven Advenson was named the Count, the area around the township was named the County of Darkmoor. The scope of the County is unknown, but it may have bordered the Kingdom of Whiterun considering their proximity.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe township of Darkmoor was given to &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Advensen\"&gt;Sven Advensen&lt;/a&gt; after his services in the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, he was named the Count of Darkmoor because of this reward. Around the same time, Tiber Septim had fought against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and had defeated the Armies of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the King and Queen of Mournhold. Amidst the battle, &lt;a href=\"Symmachus\"&gt;Symmachus&lt;/a&gt;, a Dark Elven General of the Septim Army had discovered the youngest daughter of the King of Mournhold whose name was &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;. Symmachus did not want to kill the young child, and so he left the child in the care of Count Sven in his Castle in Darkmoor. Sven and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Inga\"&gt;Inga&lt;/a&gt; had treated Barenziah as their daughter, and so she was raised as a noble, but she yearned to explore the outside world. In Darkmoor, Barenziah befriended &lt;a href=\"Straw%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Straw&lt;/a&gt;, a donkey-brained stable boy out of pity. Straw told Barenziah about a seditious conspiracy against her, saying that Sven was going to sell her as a concubine to the King of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this Barenziah and Straw escaped Darkmoor to the city of Whiterun.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Black Moor in their quest to recover the pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of Greymoor was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt;s of the region, losing the significance it once had before the war. During the Civil War, the city of Whiterun was allied with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Although, the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun, &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; was basically neutral in the war and was more focused on his domain than the war, this had left Balgruuf in a difficult position where he had to choose in this conflict. At some point in the war, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; had commenced, and the victor is unknown. Whoever won the battle, had possession of Fort Greymoor, even though the Leader of the militia operated out of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of Greymoor became the center of Whiterun's military force throughout the war."}

Bioluminescent biota, including giant mushrooms, are prevalent, providing ambient hues of blue, cyan and purple lighting.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Greymoor Caverns and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Greymoor%20Caverns\"&gt;Greymoor Caverns&lt;/a&gt; share its story quests with the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and the zone story quests tie into the Dark Heart of Skyrim's overarching storyline, but it is not necessary to complete the zone quests for other zones prior to those in the Western Skyrim or Greymoor Caverns. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nNine Skyshards can be found in Greymoor Caverns totaling in three &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Greymoor Caverns and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Greywyn and &lt;a href=\"Rowley%20Eardwulf\"&gt;Rowley Eardwulf&lt;/a&gt; were the only two mentioned survivors.\nGreywyn retreated to &lt;a href=\"Deepscorn%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%20Location%29\"&gt;Deepscorn Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, where he constructed the &lt;a href=\"Font%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Font of Renewal&lt;/a&gt; to rid the Curse of Vampirism from his body.

He does not use words but I can hear his voice. Echoes of darkness spring from his lips and tell me what I must do. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; must be purged of its clean-blooded vermin and a new order must take the reins. The time is nigh for the vampire to claim his rightful place as the true Hands of Sithis. I have secured the help of many of my kin, and soon, we shall spread like a cold fog through the ranks and make the group our own. Soon, Sithis will give the sign, the time will be right, and the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Scars\"&gt;Crimson Scars&lt;/a&gt; will strike!\nLoredas 27 &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"3E%20421\"&gt;3E 421&lt;/a&gt;.\nWe are betrayed! That cur, Silarian, has made true our plans to the Fingers, and we have been discovered! The Brotherhood struck as we slept, not even giving the Scars a chance to fight back. Using their silver weapons, they pierced the heart of many of my brothers... The screams I could hear as they turned to dust still echo within my mind. I was able to dispatch two of the purebloods that fell upon me, and before they could send more, I made good my escape. I must find a place to hide... to recover from this blow. I will make my way south to &lt;a href=\"Deepscorn%20Hollow%20%28Oblivion%20Location%29\"&gt;Deepscorn Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, my old hideaway from when I was but a novice. There I will make my dark plans and we shall see who Sithis truly favors!\nTirdas 21 &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"3E%20421\"&gt;3E 421&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's been nearly a month, and yet none of my brethren has returned to the fold. What puzzles me is why I have not heard from my lord. Sithis hasn't spoken to me since that dark night. What have I done to displease him? I have slain many since then, and poured their lifeblood on his altar, but still he remains silent. As I ponder this, I turn my attentions to the lair. Deepscorn Hollow will rise as the new headquarters of the Crimson Scars. But it must be prepared. So much to do...\nLoredas 1 &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year\"&gt;Mid-Year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"3E%20421\"&gt;3E 421&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lair has improved much. I was fortunate to find Rowley Eardwulf at the Wawnet Inn outside of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, another Scar who had escaped the night of slaughter. He now does his dark work acquiring the tools I need to bring Deepscorn Hollow back to its former glory. I must remember him in the future should I ever need these items again.\nMiddas 17 Sun's Height &lt;a href=\"3E%20421\"&gt;3E 421&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll along, I was mistaken. All along, I was the blight upon Sithis and his dark name. Tonight, he spoke to me and again, and I learned of his displeasure. Again, I heard no words, but I knew the meaning. I was meant to take blood, to spill blood... but never to taste blood. My sanguine ways have offended my lord! I must cleanse myself of this filth. I must find a way\nTirdas 30&lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Height\"&gt;Sun's Height&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"3E%20421\"&gt;3E 421&lt;/a&gt;.\nI have found it! My lord will be pleased! My answer lies with the Purgeblood Salts. Yes! I will bathe in these tonight and free myself from my old ways! Hail Sithis! Dark ruler, soon I will be your only true disciple!"}

Around two months later, he received another vision from Sithis, this one seemingly condemning his actions and demanding that he cure himself of &lt;a href=\"vampirism\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.

Speak with her and she will tell you that just as they had driven back the Colovian invaders, the Mane showed up here and spoke in a dark voice. He gestured and the ground opened, and Dro-m'athra poured out. Shazah will ask for your help in closing the rifts in the ground they are pouring from. \nThere are three rifts in total. One is directly east of the Grimwatch Tree, the others are in the north and west of the area. At each site, Shazah will close the rift while you fend off the dro-m'athra spirits attacking her. Once all three are closed, head to the central tree. There, Shazah will close one final rift to keep the evil spirits out.\nUpon closing the final rift, the spirit of the first Mane, &lt;a href=\"Rid-Thar-ri%27Datta\"&gt;Rid-Thar-ri'Datta&lt;/a&gt;, will appear. Talk to him and he will tell you that he has returned because he feels that his line is in danger. He will bestow you his blessing and tell you to go into the temple so that you can destroy the source of this darkness, stating that the flames there will not hurt you. He will then disappear; talk to Shazah about all this and she will tell you that the entrance to the temple is in one of the rifts formed by the spirits. Shazah's sister Khali went in with some troops, but they were cut off from the rest when dark flames appeared around the entrance.\nHead into the rift on the east side of the fort. There, you will find a passageway blocked by dark flames; pass through and you will find yourself in a large room with a lot of dead bodies. Khali is here, on the other side of the room, besides some kind of portal. Talk to her to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Grimmer%20Still\"&gt;Grimmer Still&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

All the heat he brought on the group was starting to chafe. Syndelius pretty much sat him down and made him do it, because I was ready to put my foot in his face. I know he's a rogue, but we're adventurers; we get our loot from raiding old crypts, and ruins, and places that ain't got guards. He can be a real horse's ass sometimes, I'll tell ya.\n12 Rain's Hand 3E431\nWhat a bad &lt;a href=\"Fredas\"&gt;Fredas&lt;/a&gt; we've had. We hit what was left of old &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wariel\"&gt;Fort Wariel&lt;/a&gt;, and after slaughtering a bunch of no good Marauders and grabbing their loot, made our way north. We came to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Trumbe\"&gt;Trumbe&lt;/a&gt;. Syndelius said they were &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ale Lid or Eyelid&lt;/a&gt; or some kind of old civilization, but all I cared about was how loaded with gold they were. He said usually they were, so in we went. What a mistake! The place was crawling with skeletons and ghosts. Those things give me the creeps. How can I fight something that ain't even alive? Lewin took a few good hits and had to pop all his potions, Syndelius broke his arm when a trap almost crushed him to death and I got a nice nasty scar across my forehead. Close call. Best of all, when we got to the treasure horde, Lewin was out of &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;! Why do we even keep him with us? We had to drag the damn container out of Trumbe and all the way back to Camp Atrene. Now I'm sitting here staring at a stupid metal box wishing I could use Lewin's head to bash it open. What a dolt.\n13 Rain's Hand 3E431\nAfter a night of deciding whether or not to snap off Lewin's legs and use them as firewood, I sent Syndelius and Lewin to Anvil to buy more lockpicks while I guarded the box. They came back in a few hours and Lewin picked the lock in the first try. Good thing too, I was still pretty mad at the guy. I don't like sitting around all day. Anyway, Syndelius got all excited when he saw something wrapped up in some sort of fancy cloth. Inside the cloth was a bunch of stuff, but the best was the sword. What a beauty! Blade looks like a mouth with teeth, handle like golden snakeskin and the gem in the middle of it... a perfect fiery orange and red, like the sky at dawn. Syndelius was going crazy and I asked him what was all the noise for. He told me it was &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaveery&lt;/a&gt; or something like that and made by the Snake People or the Sayessie or whatever. Syndelius says Sayessie starts with a T just now when he saw me writing this, but that doesn't make any sense. &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;T-s-a-e-s-c-i&lt;/a&gt;. Fine, there, I wrote it. By the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine&lt;/a&gt;, Syndelius is nosy sometimes. Well, anyway, the best was yet to come. Right as the sun was setting the sword vanished for a moment and was suddenly replaced by another weapon that looked almost the same, but the gem on it was deep blue and purple. Syndelius said he was certain that at dawn, it would change back to the orange and red gem! Well, this was good enough for me. That alone made the sword the best thing I had ever seen. Lewin muttered something about Akaveery magic, but I told him to shut up. I decided to call the sword &lt;a href=\"Dawnfang/Duskfang\"&gt;Dawnfang&lt;/a&gt; when it was orange and red and &lt;a href=\"Dawnfang/Duskfang\"&gt;Duskfang&lt;/a&gt; when it was blue and purple.\n14-16 Rain's Hand 3E341\nThings are getting better and better with my new sword in these last few days. I found out Dawnfang is a fire blade and Duskfang is a frost blade... handy for extra killing power! But the best was what I found out when a &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt; decided to jump us and I landed the killing blow. I heard a voice in my head. Or maybe a thought? I dunno. It was weird. But it felt like the sword knew it had just killed the Minotaur, like it was counting or something. At first I thought maybe I was just tired, but after tearing through a camp of Bandits, it kept counting. After the twelfth kill, it told me its thirst was satisfied. At least, I think it told me. Then it stopped. Syndelius said it's possible the sword was a blood drinker... my kind of sword... but he didn't know what would happen. It didn't take that long to find out. When dusk came around, and the blade changed... I almost fell off the campfire log. The new blade was still Duskfang... but it somehow seemed stronger. I could just tell. I couldn't wait to try it out! I ran right out and looked for something to kill. Didn't take long to come across a few of those stupid imps. Sure enough, not only did it do more frost damage than normal, but also I could feel the energy from the creature transfer to me every time I hit it! What a weapon this was! Yeah! Duskfang Superior! That's what I'll call it. Sometimes I amaze even myself. Syndelius said he was sure Duskfang would blood drink too and I could power up Dawnfang with it. I spent all night looking for twelve things to kill, and when the sun came up, he was right! Dawnfang Superior is to be this one's name. It's like having four blades in one!\n17-19 Rain's Hand 3E341\nIt's been the most fun I have ever had in my life cutting a bloody swath across the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; with my new double sword. Syndelius and Lewin are even more confident now that we have such a powerful weapon among us. We've gathered tons of loot in the last three days, but nothing compares to this. We're going to head north and explore the area around &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; today. I hope that something else like this turns up on our adventures. Then I'm going to retire!"}

Arentus tells me you burst into the Undertaker's office in a tizzy because you spied a &lt;a href=\"ghost%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; outside the crematorium or some such. You're new to the work, so I'll spare you a tongue-lashing. The truth is you'll see a lot of \"ghosts\" here in the &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20District\"&gt;Memorial District&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is they aren't spooks. They're just plain old grave-robbers. These damned &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; cover themselves in flour then scamper around all night looking for trinkets. It would be funny if it weren't such a pain in the arse cleaning up after them.\n\"What are they looking for\" you ask? Well, you were just a twinkle in your old mum's eye at the time, but this place used to be a market. A damn fine one at that\u2014the best in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Used to be full of people haggling over spices, and bolts of silk, and fine jewelry. Wish you could have seen it. Anyway, when &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen&lt;/a&gt; showed up with his &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n troops, &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;'s legion made their last stand here. I was still a pup at the time, you see? Spent the better part of a week tucked away in a sewer pipe waiting for it to stop. It was a week solid of sleeping on wet cobblestones and drinking bloody sewer water\u2014hearing nothing but shouting, and clanging steel, and explosions that damn near rattled the teeth out of my head. By the time it was all over, the whole district was gone. And I mean, gone. Wasn't a single thing standing taller than my knee, and I was just nine or ten. Then there were the bodies. Hundreds of them. Thousands maybe. I hope I never have to smell something like that again. Smelled like that dog you dug out from under Elliana's carriage, except you couldn't get away from it. It was everywhere.\nSoon as Varen tossed old Leovic in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the gutter&lt;/a&gt;, he set his men to work gathering up all the bodies and throwing them in mass graves. By the time he was done, there wasn't room for a market anymore. So he converted the whole district into a graveyard. The Memorial District.\nBut enough with the history lesson\u2014back to the Khajiit. They've got this fool notion that there are still jewels and such scattered throughout the district. I'll tell you right now, if there were still valuables here, I would have found them. And if I found them, I sure as spit wouldn't still be here turning a spade.\nTomorrow, I want you to go to old-man Varus' house. Buy a good, strong bow. Next time you see a \"ghost\" put an arrow in its arse, and see if it sticks. Bet you ten &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; it shrieks like a housecat that got its tail stuck in a door.\n\u2014 Groundskeeper Gavros"}

He traced his ancestry back to a maid of the House, who escaped during an Argonian invasion. His mother died sometime thereafter, but his father remained to write &lt;a href=\"Lymdrenn%20Telvanni%27s%20Journal\"&gt;a journal&lt;/a&gt; about the event. At the time, Brand-Shei had not been named by his parents, as his father, &lt;a href=\"Lymdrenn%20Telvanni\"&gt;Lymdrenn Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, did not feel right about doing so without his wife's consent.\nSometime before his death, he named his son Brandyl. The journal was kept by the boy's nurse, Hidrya Olen, who hoped to one day give him the news of his parents. She died in the attempt. The journal confirmed that he was the last known surviving member of House Telvanni, along with &lt;a href=\"Brelyna%20Maryon\"&gt;Brelyna Maryon&lt;/a&gt;, who is a descendent of them. He was proven wrong about the house being destroyed, however, since House Telvanni still has an influence on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and Morrowind; as the Telvanni Wizard &lt;a href=\"Neloth\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; states that the House still has their holdings.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Chance%20Arrangement\"&gt;A Chance Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;.\nBrand-Shei plays a role in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must frame him for stealing &lt;a href=\"Madesi%27s%20Silver%20Ring\"&gt;Madesi's ring&lt;/a&gt; in the quest A Chance Arrangement. Brand-Shei is temporarily jailed after this if the Dragonborn is successful.\nThe Dragonborn is instructed to place a stolen ring in his pocket, resulting in his arrest. The quest is given by &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, and is the first step to becoming a member of the guild.\nJail time.\nBrand-Shei's cell in the &lt;a href=\"Riften%20Jail\"&gt;Riften Jail&lt;/a&gt; can be unlocked by either lockpicking or using the Riften Jail Key from the guards. If his cell is unlocked, he will not leave the jail, he will just stand there. When spoken to, he stammers about his innocence. If his quest to find more of his past is started but unfinished and the stolen goods are planted on him, the dialogue option to finish the quest will not be initially offered if he is talked to in prison. After several days, though, it will be offered, even while he is still in prison.\nIt is possible to avoid him being sent to jail by failing the objective. The quest will go on and it is still possible to join the Thieves Guild regardless.\n&lt;a href=\"Distant%20Memories\"&gt;Distant Memories&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn may accept to search for clues to Brand-Shei's past. Directed to search the &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20The%20Pride%20of%20Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Wreck of The Pride of Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Lymdrenn%20Telvanni%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; detailing Brand-Shei's past can be found in a water-logged &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29%23Chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; on the lower deck of the wrecked ship. He rewards the Dragonborn with a key to his strongbox. It is also possible to find the journal without having spoken to Brand-Shei. Under this circumstance, the Dragonborn receives the reward from him immediately upon their first interaction.\nDropped items.\nIf &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; are dropped near Brand-Shei, he often argues about the items, claiming that they belong to him now, which can possibly lead to a fight with &lt;a href=\"Marise%20Aravel\"&gt;Marise Aravel&lt;/a&gt;.\nServices.\nBrand-Shei is a &lt;a href=\"General%20Goods%20Merchants%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;general goods merchant&lt;/a&gt;. As with many other merchants in Riften, his stall operates between the hours of 7:00 AM and 8:00 PM. He sells various &lt;a href=\"Ingots%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;jewelry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. All of his wares are &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"If you're ever in the market, I deal in specialty goods from Morrowind at one of the stands.\"\n\"Anything you can find would be of great help. Good luck.\"\nAfter finding \"&lt;a href=\"Lymdrenn%20Tenvanni%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Lymdrenn Tenvanni's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\":\n\"Can I interest you in some fine goods from Morrowind?\"\n\"I really appreciate what you've done for me. I'll never forget it.\"\nConversations.\nBrynjolf: \"Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round! I have something amazing to show you that demands your attention! Gather 'round all! No pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Come on, Brynjolf... what is it this time?\"\nBrynjolf: \"Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want you to get left out.\"\nMadesi: \"That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be crushed nirnroot mixed with water!\"\nBrynjolf: \"That was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real thing. Lads and lasses I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Oh come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?\"\nBrynjolf: \"The one and only. Mystical beings who live in legends and were masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their veins!\"\nMadesi: \"How did you get that, then? No one's seen them in years!\"\nBrynjolf: \"My sources must remain a secret for their own protection but I can promise that the contents are genuine. One sip of the elixir and your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or perhaps limitless power could be yours!\"\nBrand-Shei: \"How much does it cost?\"\nBrynjolf: \"Only twenty gold septims! Hurry before my supply is gone.\"\nMadesi: \"Don't listen to him, he's making this up.\"\nBrynjolf: \"Please hurry, I have only a few bottles left!\"\nBrand-Shei: \"That Wisp Essence didn't help, but maybe this will.\"\nRiften Guard: \"All right Brand-Shei. Turn out your pockets, we know you have it.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Have what? What in blazes are you talking about?\"\nRiften Guard: \"Don't play stupid. I said turn out your pockets... now!\"\nBrand-Shei: \"I'm telling you, I don't... wait, what's this ring? This isn't mine!\"\nRiften Guard: \"That's right. It isn't yours. You're under arrest, Brand-Shei.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"This is insane! I didn't steal anything! I never saw this ring before in my entire life!\"\nRiften Guard: \"We can do this one of two ways. You walk with me up to the keep, or I can drag your lifeless body. Your choice.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"But... I... very well.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Bolli\"&gt;Bolli&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"So while I was in &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, I heard news that something terrible happened at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"You've heard too? They say the town was completely destroyed by a dragon.\"\nBolli: \"\"If that's true, then we have much more to fear than the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"I'd still keep an eye on my purse if I was you.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Dinya%20Balu\"&gt;Dinya&lt;/a&gt;, about that incense you requested?

Have you joined &lt;a href=\"Mjoll\"&gt;Mjoll&lt;/a&gt; as official peacekeepers of Riften?

I've come by to browse your wares today.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"\"Is it true you chased a thief from your home? I overheard &lt;a href=\"Aerin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aerin&lt;/a&gt; mentioning it.\"\nMjoll: \"It's true. Wasn't much of a thief though. Made enough noise to wake the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Good. Maybe that will teach them to leave honest citizens alone.\"\nMjoll: \"\"I was hoping you could help me. It seems I've lost a ring that also means quite a bit to me. It's made of gold with an inscription on the inside that says \"sand elske.\"\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"I'm afraid not. I don't deal in stolen goods.\"\nMjoll: \"Stolen? How can you be certain? I may have just misplaced it somewhere in the city.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Lady Mjoll, if you lost a gold ring anywhere in this city I'm afraid it's likely never to be seen again.

It's... it's gone! A dragon burned it to the ground!\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Yes, I heard. I think all of Skyrim knows by know.\"\nShadr: \"Do you... do you think that could happen here? I mean, could a dragon come here and burn the city down?\"\nBrand-Shei: \"\"I don't know. All we can do is hope the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; will favor us and have these creatures stay far away from &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nBrand-Shei: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Svana%20Far-Shield\"&gt;Svana&lt;/a&gt;, I heard that &lt;a href=\"Sibbi%20Black-Briar%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sibbi&lt;/a&gt; was put in jail. What happened?\"\nSvana: \"They say...well, they say he murdered someone.

Wait...he didn't...\"\nSvana: \"No, it was Svidi's brother, Wulfur. She's in hiding, now. Somewhere far from here, I'd suspect.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"If he wasn't a Black-Briar, I'd march right over to the jail and teach Sibbi some manners...but then I'd suspect that I'd end up like Wulfur.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tythis%20Ulen\"&gt;Tythis&lt;/a&gt;: \"Brand-Shei... have you managed to find those boots for me?\"\nBrand-Shei: \"What's with all the boots and shoes you keep buying? You must have bought twenty pairs in the last two years.\"\nTythis: \"Always be prepared. You never know if you might get a split in one, or lose one, then where would you be? No sir, that's not happening to me.\"\nBrand-Shei: \"Um... okay. Well, the boots aren't here yet. Hopefully on the next Khajiit caravan.\""}

He claims that only this type of brandy will do, as the sort of people with enough money to donate refuse to drink the local spirit, &lt;a href=\"Greef%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Greef&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen talking to Iulus Truptor after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Shirt%20and%20Vest%20for%20Harvest%27s%20End\"&gt;Shirt and Vest for Harvest's End&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed, Iulus Truptor tells the Nerevarine that the cult is in need of five bottles of Cyrodilic brandy for the fundraising dinner. He asks him to solicit publicans in Balmora for a donation of brandy.\nBalmora has three taverns. A total of four bottles of brandy can be obtained from the merchants themselves as donations.\nBacola further hints that Banor Seran at the Council Club recently received the required amount of brandy. He points the Nerevarine to the place where Banor Seran most likely stores the brandy and says that it wouldn't be a bad crime to steal from Banor as he is an associate of the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nerevarine can now decide to steal the brandy from Banor Seran. Alternatively he could always donate the brandy himself by buying (or stealing) it from any source. Once he has obtained the requested five bottles of Cyrodil brandy, the Nerevarine should return to Iulus Truptor in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; (not Fort Moonmoth as the journal states) to deliver it to get his reward."}

She didn't like being told what to do by the older kwama.\n\"What makes you smarter than me?\" Brave Little Scrib asked Kwama Worker.\n\"I'm older than you, Scrib,\"\u00a0Kwama Worker said impatiently, \"And I'm always very busy, so I know what's best. You need to stay away from the waterfall. Trust me, you're better off keeping busy than playing in the stream.\"\nBrave Little Scrib didn't like that answer, so she went to speak with Kwama Warrior. \"Why can't I play in the waterfall?\" she asked.\n&lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kwama Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, serious as always, never looked at Scrib as he spoke. Instead, he constantly scanned the cave for any potential threats that needed to be fought. Warrior liked to fight, and he was always looking for a battle. \"The waterfall? You can't fight the waterfall, Little Scrib. Water is cold and fast and it makes you drown. You should go back to the egg chamber and play with the other scribs where the other warriors and I can watch over you.\"\nBrave Little Scrib didn't like that answer, either. \"Well,\" thought Brave Little Scrib, \"if no one can give me a really good reason why I can't play in the waterfall, then I'm going to go play in the waterfall.\"\nAs Brave Little Scrib approached the underground stream that flowed from the falling water, she spotted a tiny &lt;a href=\"Torchbugs%20%28Online%29\"&gt;torchbug&lt;/a&gt; up ahead. \"Hello, tiny Torchbug,\" Scrib called out.\n\"Oh, hello, Little Scrib,\" Torchbug sang. His voice was hot and sultry, and it crackled like a burning fire. \"What brings you to this part of the cave?\"\n\"I've come to play in the waterfall,\" Brave Little Scrib said cheerfully. \"Will you fly away so I can pass?\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" sang Torchbug. \"I'll happily fly out of your way. I haven't seen anyone drown in the waterfall in quite some time, and I find the sight very entertaining. Please, hurry. I need a good laugh.\"\nBrave Little Scrib didn't like what Torchbug was saying. \"You want to see me drown?\"\n\"Well, I guess I don't really care one way or another,\" sang Torchbug, \"but I do enjoy a good drowning. Do you know how to swim, Little Scrib?\"\nBrave Little Scrib thought about Torchbug's song. \"I know how to swim,\" she lied. \"But I don't think I feel like playing in the waterfall today. Maybe tomorrow. See you later, Torchbug.\"\n\"If you insist, Little Scrib,\" Torchbug sang. \"Have a good day.\"\nAnd Brave Little Scrib wandered back to the egg chamber, looking for another adventure."}

A grand &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; settlement remains beneath the city, long after the fall of their civilization, as Bravil was built atop the ruins.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nBravil is located in &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; a short ways south of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, between the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Road\"&gt;Green Road&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Upper Niben&lt;/a&gt;. Bravil is near &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and the border town of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. Bravil has one entrance located on the northern end of town and it leads to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. \nBravil's topology is unusual and the town buildings are spread over several islands in a pocket of the Niben River. On the main island is the town square, marked by the &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt; statue in its middle, the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Great Chapel of Mara&lt;/a&gt; and many merchants and residents. The southern island contains a solitary lodge and a home. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bravil\"&gt;Castle Bravil&lt;/a&gt; looks over the Upper Niben and the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; from the eastern island.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore Bravil was established, the &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Elves\"&gt;Heartland Elves&lt;/a&gt; settled in the general area and during this time had a flourishing settlement that was much larger than Bravil. This settlement became the trading center of the Niben Bay area. During the second century of the first era, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; began when &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s and sacked multiple cities, including this settlement.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Army\"&gt;Alessian Army&lt;/a&gt; advanced south towards the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; and into the area around what is now Bravil. This resulted in a siege lead by &lt;a href=\"Teo%20Bravillius%20Tasus\"&gt;Teo Bravillius Tasus&lt;/a&gt;, a centurion in the Alessian Ranks for whom the city is named. The battle began in a span of four minutes, and despite massive resistance, Tasus was able to break into the settlement. He could not hold it, however, as his soldiers were dead, and the Ayleids repopulated the stronghold. A second invasion occurred and underground tunnels were discovered underground. The third wave of Alessians came and they watched the roads for more Ayleids and yet more kept arriving from different locations.\nIt was revealed that the Ayleids used &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; magic to travel across the walls and go underwater to enter the city. Eventually, Tasus was able to uncover all of the hiding spots and finally defeat the Ayleids. These Ayleids are said to be the first recorded users of alteration magic in Tamriel, before the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; discovered &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; was tricked into triggering an explosion known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, it broke the barrier separating Nirn and Oblivion and allowed &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; to invade &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Because Mannimarco summoned Molag Bal from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; started his path of destruction in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; and then moved towards the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Basin\"&gt;Nibenay Basin&lt;/a&gt;. Cities such as &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, and Bravil were destroyed in the conquest in the event known as the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. Bravil, defended by the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, was sacked by Molag Bal's daedra as they moved southwards from the Imperial City to the Nibenay Valley and the Green Road. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, Bravil was inaccessible from the north and its walls were crippled, leaving it neutral between the alliances. During the Alliance War, an Imperial Captain from the Imperial City named &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Jena%20Apinia\"&gt;Captain Jena Apinia&lt;/a&gt; saved her legion by ordering them to retreat when the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; dropped. She appealed to Bravil's mayor for food for her legion and was refused. The citizens of Bravil rioted and many were slain, earning Apinia the sobriquet of the Butcher of Bravil.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, a spy network of assassins working for the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;, tracked Apinia to the isolated ruins of &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Agea\"&gt;Garlas Agea&lt;/a&gt; where she kept a wide assortment of goods from &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; was tasked by &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; of the Eyes to kill Apinia and retrieve the items. After defeating her, the Eyes of the Queen brought the things back to Bravil. A similar retrieval occurred at &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt; ruins.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Bravil prospered along with the other eight cities in Cyrodiil. The city was under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Count%20Regulus%20Terentius\"&gt;Count Regulus Terentius&lt;/a&gt; who was known by his people as being a champion in combat but a drunkard and a ne'er-do-well by his peers. His &lt;a href=\"Gellius%20Terentius\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; supported drug trafficking in the city.\nIn the very late third era, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; launched the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; opened up outside of Bravil, which when closed by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, allowed them to recruit troops from Bravil to aid in repulsing the attack on Bruma later on.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Oblivion Crisis, Bravil became an independent city-state and waged war against another city-state &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; subdued both cities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; declared the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the Mede Empire. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; captured the cities of Leyawiin, Rimmen, and Bravil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20187\"&gt;4E 187&lt;/a&gt;, Bravil and the Nibenay Valley had seen its fair share of &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt; trafficking coming from places such as Leyawiin, &lt;a href=\"Alabaster\"&gt;Alabaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gideon\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;. Bravil had two primary Skooma traffickers that clashed with each other on multiple occasions. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20188\"&gt;4E 188&lt;/a&gt;, riots ensued in the city between the two Skooma Kingpins. Many of the wealthy people such as &lt;a href=\"Alisanne%20Dupre\"&gt;Alisanne Dupre&lt;/a&gt; hired sellswords to protect their estates, but they eventually died in a fire. The Lucky Old Lady statue was also burnt down by the rioters and Bravil was a shadow of its former self."}

No visit to the southern part of the Imperial Province is complete without a walk along Bravil's exciting river port, a talk with her friendly native children, and, of course, in the tradition of the village, a whispered word to the famous statue of the Lucky Old Lady.\nMany thousands of years before the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, the native &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; people had long lived in the vicinity of modern day Bravil. The &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt; then, as now, provided food and transportation, and the village was even more populous than it is today. We are not certain what they called their region: as insular as they were, the word they used would be translated to simply mean \"home.\" These savage Ayleids were so firmly entrenched that the Bravil region was one of the very last areas to be liberated by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; army in the second century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Though little remains of that era culturally or archeologically, thank &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the tales of debauchery and depravity have entered into the realm of legends.\nHow the Ayleids were able to survive such a long siege is debated by scholars to this day. All, however, grant the honor of the victory to one of the &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Alessia\"&gt;Empress Alessia&lt;/a&gt;'s centurions, a man called &lt;a href=\"Teo%20Bravillius%20Tasus\"&gt;Teo Bravillius Tasus&lt;/a&gt;, the man for whom the modern town is named.\nIt was said he invaded the village no less than four times, after heavy resistance, but each time upon the morning dawning, all his soldiery within would be dead, murdered. By the time more centuria had arrived, the fortified town was repopulated with Ayleids. After the second successful invasion, secret underground tunnels were found and filled in, but once again, come morning, the soldiers were again dead, and the citizens had returned. After the third successful siege, legions were posted outside of the town, watching the roads and riverway for signs of attacks, but no one came. The next morning, the bodies of the invading soldiers were thrown from the parapets of town's walls.\nTeo Bravillius Tasus knew that the Ayleids must be hiding themselves somewhere in the town, waiting until nightfall, and then murdering the soldiers while they slept. The question was where. After the fourth invasion, he himself led the soldiers in a thorough inspection of every corner, every shadow. Just as they were ready to give up, the great centurion noticed two curious things. High in the sheer walls of the town, beyond anyone's ability to climb, there were indentations, narrow platforms. And by the river just inside the town, he discovered a single footprint from someone clearly not wearing the Imperial boot.\nThe Ayleids, it seemed, had taken two routes to hide themselves. Some had levitated up to the walls and hidden themselves high above, and others had slipped into the river, where they were able to breathe underwater. It was a relatively easy task once the strange elves' even stranger hiding holes had been discovered to rout them out, and see to it that there were no more midnight assassinations of the Empress's troops.\nIt may seem beyond belief that an entire community could be so skilled in these spells hundreds and hundreds of years before the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; was formed to teach the ways of &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; to the common folk. There does, however, appear to be evidence that, just as the &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; developed Mysticism long before there was a name for it, the even more obscure Ayleids of southern Cyrodiil had developed what was to be known as the school of Alteration. It is not, after all, much of a stretch when one considers that other Ayleids at the time of Bravil's conquering and even later were shapeshifters. The community of pre-Bravil could not turn into beasts and monsters, but they could alter their bodies to hide themselves away. A related and useful skill, to be sure. But not so effective to save themselves in the end."}

As beautiful and arresting as the Benevolence of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; cathedral and the lord's palace are, no manmade structure in Bravil is as famous as the statue called The &lt;a href=\"Lucky%20Old%20Lady\"&gt;Lucky Old Lady&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tales about the Lady and who she was are too numerous to list.\nIt was said she was born the illegitimate daughter of a prostitute in Bravil, certainly an inauspicious beginning to a lucky life. She was teased by the other children, who forever asked her who her father was. Every day, she would run back to her little shack in tears from their cruelty.\nOne day, a priest of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; came to Bravil to do charitable work. He saw the weeping little girl, and when asked, she told him the cause of her misery: she didn't know who her father was.\n\"You have kind eyes and a mouth that tells no lies,\" replied the priest after a moment, smiling. \"You are clearly a child of Stendarr, the God of Mercy, Charity, and Well-Earned Luck.\"\nThe priest's thoughtful words changed the girl forever. Whenever she was asked who her father was, she would cheerfully reply, \"I am a child of Luck.\"\nShe grew up to be a barmaid, it was said, kind and generous to her customers, frequently allowing them to pay when they were able to. On a particularly rainy night, she gave shelter to a young man dressed in rags, who not only had no money to pay, but was belligerent and rude to her as she fed him and gave him a room. The next morning, he left without so much as a thank you. Her friends and family admonished her, saying that she had to be careful, he might have even been dangerous.\nA week later, a royal carriage arrived in Bravil, with an Imperial prince within. Though he was scarcely recognizable, it was the same young man the Lady had helped. He apologized profusely for his appearance and behavior, explaining that he had been kidnapped and cursed by a band of witches, and it wasn't until later he had returned to his senses. The Lady was showered with riches, which she, of course, generously shared with all the people of Bravil, where she lived to a content old age.\nNo one knows when the statue to her was erected in the town square, or who the artist was, but it has stood there for thousands of years, since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, visitors and Bravillians alike go to the Lucky Old Lady to ask for her to bless them with luck in their travails.\nJust one more charming aspect of the charming, and very lucky town of Bravil."}

From the look of the buildings and its architecture, it appears that Bravil's populace is one of the less wealthy of Cyrodiil. It also might be high in crime rate, as there is a &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20Skooma%20Den\"&gt;Skooma den&lt;/a&gt; within the walls of the city.\nBravil is a city built quite oddly.

One can see the skooma addicts drinking from a relatively large purple flask \u2013 which is an easy way to discover the location of the Den, as the drinkers can often be seen outside on the first or second floor of the building.\nOverview.\nThe Den is an excellent source of skooma, as the name suggests, as each of the inhabitants carries around five to fifteen bottles of it and does not seem to care if the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; pick-pockets said items from them, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Roxanne%20Brigette\"&gt;Roxanne Brigette&lt;/a&gt;, who will report the &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt;, if caught. To minimize the chances of being caught, especially with a lower &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; level, it may be advisable to pickpocket smaller quantities of skooma at a time, instead of trying to take all of the available flasks in one go.\nIn addition to the inhabitants, several &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chests&lt;/a&gt; can also be found inside \u2013 at least one of which may contain skooma. Some of these chests are locked and their locks must be &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;picked&lt;/a&gt; first, however.\nInside, there are three beds upstairs and one downstairs, none of which are owned, meaning that if the Hero would like, they could sleep there as often as they wanted. Every Sundas, the Count's son, &lt;a href=\"Gellius%20Terentius\"&gt;Gellius Terentius&lt;/a&gt;, visits the Skooma Den to drink skooma. The other inhabitants all sleep in the Den regularly and do not seem to do much else all day, except drink skooma and eat."}

Both tunnels ahead leads to the same chamber, with knee-deep water and several paths to choose from. If here for the quest, take the southern or western path and skip the next section. Otherwise, locate the old wooden door and pick the lock.\nThe door reveals an entire subsection inhabited by conjurers. The dead end to the north contains several piles of bones and a common &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;. A conjurer will most likely detect and attack so be prepared.\nTo the south a wooden door says \u2018key required\u2019, although no key exists. The northern chamber contains a minor loot &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; and a poisoned apple, while the chamber opposite the locked door gives access to the rest of the conjurer lair, a large room filled to the brink with treasure, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; and rare &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Apparatus%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt; and two bedrolls. Backtrack all the way to the watery room south of the wooden door then head east until the knee-deep water turns into a very deep, flooded pit.\nThe pit is inhabited by a few &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and is incredibly deep. On the way down, look at the map and note the underwater path leading north; this is the path circumventing the locked door and the only way to proceed in the dungeon. Ignore it for now unless doing the quest, and dive even deeper into the pit until one see a hole at the bottom.\nThis is the lair of the unique &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Slaughterfish%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Giant Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt;, so prepare for an underwater boss battle. Make sure to loot the dead fish for a huge amount of valuables then swim west towards a tunnel where the Hero will find door out, the secret entrance from &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nBacktrack to the tunnel leading north and swim until they finally surface near an alcove with some lower level equipment. At the next intersection, ignore the left path as it leads to the other side of door and head right.\nAs the Hero approach the last intersection, they will most likely be detected by the boss-leveled Dremora, so dispose of him and consider picking the lock of the nearby door, even if it will only net another fight against a leveled Daedra, a restoration chest and some alchemy equipment. Finally, pick the &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; and go through to the locked door, the entrance to Bravil Wizard's Lair.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Extrication%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Arrow of Extrication&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gray Fox wants the Hero to steal the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Extrication%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Arrow of Extrication&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Fathis%20Aren\"&gt;Fathis Aren's&lt;/a&gt; room in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Bravil\"&gt;Castle Bravil&lt;/a&gt;."}

In this minigame, the Dragonborn fistfights for bets set by the opponent. Other instances of brawls are to complete quests if &lt;a href=\"speech\"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; checks fail, or to recruit a potential follower. If the Chief of any Orc stronghold is asked if there's any work to be done, he will request a brawl. The winner receives 100 . During brawls, bystanders can come and watch and may become hostile if weapons, magic, or\u00a0shouts\u00a0are used in the brawl. A brawl is concluded when one of the combatant's Health is reduced to zero, or, one can surrender the fight by lowering their fists.\nRules.\nDamage and healing.\nDuring a brawl, weapons and spells are removed, allowing only the use of unarmed combat. Using any weapons or spells forfeits the challenge and any gold wagered. &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Potions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;healing spells&lt;/a&gt; can be used to recover &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; during brawls without forfeiting the match. The claws of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiits&lt;/a&gt; add 15 and &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; add 6 (12 due to a calculation problem) damage per unarmed strike, thus they have a hidden advantage. Wearing apparel with an enchantment that increases the damage dealt by fists is also beneficial here.\nSpectators and assistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt; do not involve themselves in brawls, although &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Thrall\"&gt;Thralls&lt;/a&gt; will. Be careful of bystanders, as they can be accidentally hit during a brawl. Doing so causes them to retaliate and the act is considered assault, a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt;.\nArmor.\n&lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Oakflesh\"&gt;Oakflesh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ebonyflesh\"&gt;Ebonyflesh&lt;/a&gt; can be cast before and during brawls to bolster defense. The &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Steel\"&gt;Fists of Steel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; can add additional boosts to the attack.

Once he's dead, I must plant a letter on his body that will incriminate him in a plot to kill the Emperor. If I wish to earn a bonus, I must not kill him in Dragon Bridge, or on the road, but in one of the cities he visits.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe first step of the quest is for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to speak to &lt;a href=\"Gabriella\"&gt;Gabriella&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. She says that &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Maro\"&gt;Commander Maro&lt;/a&gt; will be in charge of the &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Emperor's&lt;/a&gt; security when he comes to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Dark Brotherhood wants Maro distracted during the Emperor's visit. The way to achieve this is to kill Commander Maro's son, &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;Gaius Maro&lt;/a&gt;, and plant false evidence on his body of a plot to assassinate the Emperor. Not only will this cause Commander Maro to be distracted, it will also give the Emperor a false sense of security: since he will believe that an assassination plot has already been foiled, he will not be expecting another one. Gabriella\u00a0also\u00a0says that if the deed is done in a major city, &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Astrid&lt;/a&gt; has authorized her to give the Dragonborn a &lt;a href=\"Olava%27s%20Token\"&gt;token&lt;/a&gt; to give to &lt;a href=\"Olava%20the%20Feeble\"&gt;Olava the Feeble&lt;/a&gt;, a friend to the Dark Brotherhood that will enable her to tell the Dragonborn's future. An &lt;a href=\"Incriminating%20Letter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Incriminating Letter&lt;/a&gt; will be added to the inventory.\nIf she is asked about his schedule, she will say that there is a written copy in the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus%20Outpost\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; that can be stolen.\nDragon Bridge.\nThe Dragonborn must go to Dragon Bridge for Maro to start his travels, but killing him there will prevent the bonus from being received. He can be observed in front of the Penitus Oculatus Outpost, saying goodbye to his father, and his wife from the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Shields%20Tavern\"&gt;Four Shields Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. After he leaves, the Dragonborn can steal &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro%27s%20Schedule\"&gt;Gaius Maro's Schedule&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; inside the outpost and waiting for the guard inside to move away from the table with the schedule.\nPlaces and methods for killing Maro.\nAs Maro is inspecting Skyrim to assess the security of the Emperor during his visit, he will be in several of the capital cities of Skyrim as well as the roads in between. Certain locations may prove to be easier to kill him, while others have heightened security and will therefore be more challenging. There are various methods of assassination that can be employed at various points in his journey.\nSolitude.\nShould it be Morndas as per Gaius' schedule stolen from the Penitus Oculatus Outpost, he will be in Solitude overlooking Castle Dour's courtyard and the Emperor's Tower during the day. By evening, he will retire to the barracks below where &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; are normally found. This is a good spot to attempt to stealth kill him as he normally sits at the table just around the corner from the stairs. The Hold Guards will be asleep, and therefore, unaware of any attempt on Gaius, unless it is around 8:00 AM or 8:00 PM. Both these times are when the changing of the guard normally occurs, and the area will be full of Hold Guards retiring for some sleep while their relief gets up to head out on patrol. It is especially risky if &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Aldis\"&gt;Captain Aldis&lt;/a&gt; is himself coming in for the night, which could cause him to see the murder and trigger a bounty. This is especially so if sitting with Gaius when he is killed. A bow or crossbow, if is installed, may be the best option here by hiding in the shadows near the barrels in the kitchen area.\nA good opening is when Aldis stands up to walk to the far end of the beds. With his back turned, an opening is made to stealth kill Gaius. Even if Aldis or the Hold Guards hear it, with a sufficiently high Sneak skill, the Dragonborn should remain undetected. However, if Gaius is spoken to and made hostile, the Hold Guards will awaken and come to the Dragonborn's aid, as they will see Gaius as the criminal due to attacking the Dragonborn first. In this case, the Dragonborn will need to deliver the final blow before Gaius becomes non-hostile again, risking a bounty should he remain alive and regain his health.\nRiften.\nIf Gaius is inspecting this particular city on Middas, the alleyway to the left provides an opportunity (the lock on the gate may need to be picked). As Maro leaves (around 1:00 A.M.), shooting him with an arrow will avoid detection and any bounty. If the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt; skill is at a low level or the player does not have the necessary perks (especially the sneak perk allowing 3x damage with stealth attacks, he may not die with one sneak attack, so there may be a fight. Another option is to wait in the corner of Riften Castle's courtyard, behind the small grouping of trees, and wait for him to exit (he exits that side every time at approximately 11:30 A.M., although the actual times may vary). He will be alone and far enough away from any guards to allow him to be killed without any worry about a bounty.\nPalace of the Kings (or other guard barracks).\nGaius Maro will sleep in the barracks with the guards in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; while there for his rounds on Tirdas, despite it being the rebel capital for Ulfric and his Stormcloaks. This can be one of the hardest places to get him without being detected. Around 10:00 P.M., in the corner by the sleeping guard, he can be shot with a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; (preferably after having coated the arrows with poison). Each time he is shot, he will get up and look around the room. He can be shot multiple times without being discovered. The guards in the beds will sometimes get up and look as well, but as is the case with the Solitude barracks, possessing a sufficiently high Sneak skill causes them to ignore the Dragonborn. After Maro is dead, it is possible to creep over to his body and plant the Incriminating Letter when the guards return to their routine. Sneaking back to the corner, then jumping over the beds with the guards in them until the doorway is reached, allows the Dragonborn to slip out to freedom. Naturally, should Gaius be made hostile by speaking to him, the Hold Guards will awaken and support the Dragonborn since Maro made himself a criminal in their eyes by attacking the Dragonborn first.\nThe Bannered Mare.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; when he is there on Turdas, it is extremely easy to sneak into his bedroom in The Bannered Mare, as it seems to be the only time he is not bunking in a castle or in barracks. He can be killed in his sleep with the door shut, and then the letter planted. This does not result in a bounty.\nHowever, there is a high chance that Maro might fall behind on his itinerary schedule and therefore only make a brief stop at The Bannered Mare, for some drinks, before continuing on to &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. In this case he normally arrives alone on &lt;a href=\"Day\"&gt;Turdas&lt;/a&gt; evening (10:00\u201311:00 P.M.) and heads straight to the hearth in the middle of the inn for a drink, whilst enjoying the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bard's&lt;/a&gt; performances.\nEmploying a high level of &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Mail%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Mail&lt;/a&gt;, while sneaking he can be shot using a ranged weapon from the balcony of the room overlooking the hearth (it is the same room rented from &lt;a href=\"Hulda\"&gt;Hulda&lt;/a&gt;). The player can also use offensive spells such as Frost to drain his stamina, and then Flames. Since this balcony is full of shadowy spots it is possible to hide in one of those and wait for Gaius to charge upstairs looking for his assailant. Once he has touched the shadowy tendrils of poison emitted by the Ebony Mail, it is just a matter of waiting for him to fall lifeless. Then the Incriminating Letter can be planted and the scene left with no alarm raised.\nObviously, this technique can also be used in other dark locations as well. A word of caution though: killing him in public usually leads to collateral damage, so there will be some bodies on the way out of the inn.\u00a0\nSometimes, he can be killed in full view of guards and citizens. The guards will do their normal \"What was that?\" routine, but will not see him actually being slaughtered, even though the Dragonborn is plainly in their vision range. Citizens, however, will scold and sometimes turn hostile when they see Gaius Maro killed.\nDirect provocation.\nAnother alternative method is, where the Dragonborn can approach Maro and use the option of telling him that he will be killed, and then the Emperor. After this, Gaius will begin to attack. Letting him strike the first blow, then fighting back and killing him will not cause a bounty. This method can be used in any major city in order to receive the bonus. If using this method, it is best to confront him in view of a guard \u2013 so that it is seen that Gaius attacks first, and the Hold Guards come to the Dragonborn's defense. However, if a guard wanders into view of the fight as it is proceeding and the first blow he sees is struck by the Dragonborn, a bounty will be earned.\nIf the Dragonborn is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and happens to encounter Maro in Riften, he can be provoked, and fellow Thieves Guild members (and even &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt; herself) will come to the Dragonborn's defense. They will finish him off. Similarly, should the Dovahkiin be a Companion and Maro is seen in Whiterun, he can also be talked into attacking, thus the warriors will slay him. More generally, if Maro is attacked in a town or city where friends are present, they will help to kill him. If he happens to enter the Dragonborn's house or &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;stewards&lt;/a&gt; (depending on whether or not stewards have been appointed) can also be immensely valuable, since they will fight him off too. The same will apply to essential followers.\nIt may also be possible to have him killed in the midst of a random Vampire attack, which can occur in most holds but has a higher chance of happening in Riften or Whiterun, or he can also be a collateral target if there is a thief in Riften. Both the vampire and thief would trigger an attack from guards.\nDragonsreach.\nAn easy way to kill Gaius without good combat skills is when he is in Dragonsreach, in Whiterun. He can be approached and provoked. Once he attacks, the entire court of Whiterun will retaliate against him. However, they will not kill him, but lower his health down to the point as to when he falls to one knee. This allows the player to slaughter him with an extra blow or two.\nPickpocket.\nWith a high enough Pickpocket skill, it is possible to plant the Incriminating Letter on Gaius before killing him. This allows him to be killed at range and in the open, and the quest completed without physically approaching his body. With the pickpocket perk &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Poisoned&lt;/a&gt;, poison can also be placed in his pocket along with the note. The &lt;a href=\"Lotus%20Extract\"&gt;Lotus Extract&lt;/a&gt; poison from the mission \"&lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Never%20Comes\"&gt;Mourning Never Comes&lt;/a&gt;\" is ideal for this.\nImmediate hostility.\nGaius can be attacked while outside a major city but not killed, by running away and losing him. Once he has entered a major hold, he will attack the Dragonborn on sight. Since he attacked first, he can be killed with impunity. The guards will either help the Dragonborn or not do anything.\nMarkarth.\nAt some point while in town on Fredas, Gaius will go to the guard tower in Markarth. Once he is back out of the tower, &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; (preferably all three words) will launch him off of the high point that the guard tower is on. The player can augment this with &lt;a href=\"Force%20Without%20Effort\"&gt;Force Without Effort&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20Force\"&gt;Dragonborn Force&lt;/a&gt; to enhance its effects. After following him down, Gaius will attack once he is back on his feet, causing the guards to see this as a crime and attack him until he yields. He can then be simply finished off, and the Incriminating Letter planted.\nSchedule changes.\nWhenever Gaius sees the Dragonborn he begins taking an alternate route. This can make the quest quite hard as he will turn away from a city if he sees the Dragonborn anywhere near it. If this happens, waiting in a tavern in a city on his route will allow him to eventually resume his normal journey.\nAfter assassinating Maro.\nUpon returning to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary, Gabriella will approach, initiating dialogue and congratulating the Dragonborn on completing the mission. She then gives all due rewards. This completes \"Breaching Security\" and automatically starts \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;,\" in which something has gone wrong in the Sanctuary. Also, if the bonus (Olava's Token) was earned, the miscellaneous quest \"&lt;a href=\"Receive%20a%20reading%20from%20Olava%20the%20Feeble\"&gt;Receive a reading from Olava the Feeble&lt;/a&gt;\" is started."}

This is the main quest for Seyda Neen.\nBackground.\n\"Someone extinguished Seyda Neen's lighthouse to cause a shipwreck. Deputy Governor Deminah Salvi suspects slavers and asked me to help her investigate the matter.\"\nWalkthrough.\nGo and talk to &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Delms\"&gt;Sergeant Delms&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20Lighthouse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, up at the very top in the Lighthouse Tower. After your conversation is finished, go and talk to &lt;a href=\"Cherishes-Water\"&gt;Cherishes-Water&lt;/a&gt;. She is by the bog behind &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Salt%20Grocery\"&gt;Sea Salt Grocery&lt;/a&gt;. After that, you will need to search a nearby hollowed out tree, which will contain a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"My%20Golden%20Child\"&gt;My Golden Child&lt;/a&gt;\". This will lead to ask townsfolk about the \"&lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;.\" You can speak to Cherishes-Water, &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Omellian\"&gt;Governor Omellian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watch%20Captain%20Bethes\"&gt;Watch Captain Bethes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chow-Chow\"&gt;Chow-Chow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snarzikha\"&gt;Snarzikha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Findun\"&gt;Findun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Garil\"&gt;Sergeant Garil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marise%20Rothrano\"&gt;Marise Rothrano&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is Marise Rothrano. After speaking with her, head back to &lt;a href=\"Deminah%20Salvi\"&gt;Deminah Salvi&lt;/a&gt;, who will be on &lt;a href=\"The%20Windstorm\"&gt;The Windstorm&lt;/a&gt;. After a chat, you can either ask Marise to steal the Parchment from the Governor's private quarters, or you can do it yourself.\nIf you choose to get Marise to steal it, speak to her and arrange a distraction with the Tower Guard for her to be able to accomplish the task. All you have to do is ask him a few questions. Once you are done, meet Marise by the Lighthouse. After your conversation is finished, proceed to speak to Deminah Salvi. After a conversation with her, you are to travel to Firemoth Island.\nIf you choose to steal the parchment yourself, head into the guard house in the southeast of town. This is considered trespassing, so be prepared to defend yourself if you get caught. Proceed to the top floor and head to the end of the hallway to find the governor's office. You will find the parchment on his desk. Once you have it, read the unfinished report on the table; you will find that something is going on on Firemoth Island. Tell this to Deminah Salvi and she will tell you to head there.\nNow, you are assigned with freeing &lt;a href=\"Kirrsi\"&gt;Kirrsi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Noam%20Derre\"&gt;Noam Derre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hreifryd\"&gt;Hreifryd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talosha\"&gt;Talosha&lt;/a&gt; from the Slaver enemies. Whilst searching for Evidence, you will find the &lt;a href=\"Captain%27s%20Note\"&gt;Captain's Note&lt;/a&gt;. After completing both objectives, return to Seyda Neen and speak to Deminah salvi once again. She will be in the &lt;a href=\"Census%20and%20Excise%20Office%20%28Online%29%23Sublocations\"&gt;Census and Excise Office&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so will enable you to complete the quest, receiving leveled and the &lt;a href=\"Governor%27s%20Ring%20of%20the%20War%20Maiden\"&gt;Governor's Ring of the War Maiden&lt;/a&gt;. Deminah Salvi will then proceed to help an injured Guard up to further pursue her chase after the Governor.\nDialogue.\nFor when you ask people about the ALMSIVI, here are the available dialogue options.\n\"The ending of the words is ALMSIVI\" results in the following responses:\n&lt;a href=\"Marise%20Rothrano\"&gt;Marise Rothrano&lt;/a&gt; is the only person who allows this quest to go on further, and the following dialogue accounts to her.\n\"The ending of the words is ALMSIVI\" \"Keep it down! We don't want to attract undue attention. But what happened? I thought I was supposed to go to the drop? You didn't come all this way just to give me my reward, did you?\"\nThe following dialogue is with &lt;a href=\"Deminah%20Salvi\"&gt;Deminah Salvi&lt;/a&gt;, who is at &lt;a href=\"The%20Windstorm\"&gt;The Windstorm&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Unfortunately, the wreck of the vessel provided no additional clues. Were you able to discover anything during your investigation?\"\nYou can now proceed to steal the parchment yourself, or ask &lt;a href=\"Marise%20Rothrano\"&gt;Marise Rothrano&lt;/a&gt; for help. If the latter is chosen, the following dialogue options are shown.\n\"Ah, our special customer! Is there something I can do for you?\"\nYou must now distract the Guard, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Delms\"&gt;Sergeant Delms&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"The deputy governor's errand runner. Now what?\"\nYou must now meet Marise at the rendezvous point.\n\"ALMSIVI is the ending of words! I forget how much I enjoyed the thieving arts! Sneaking into the governor's private quarters brought back fond memories.\"\nNow, go and speak to Deminah Salvi again.\n\"Back again? So tell me, you didn't do anything unlawful now, did you?\"\nThe following is the final dialogue with Deminah Salvi for the completion of the Quest.\n\"Someone attacked the governor. This guard will live. Did you find anything important on Firemoth Island?\""}

After reaching the hall, Battlereeve Urcelmo reveals that Estre has put up a powerful magical barrier around the castle. The barrier is powered by 2 wards which have to be destroyed in order for the barrier to break and &lt;a href=\"Sinien\"&gt;Sinien&lt;/a&gt;, the Mages Guild member, has a plan.\nIn order to destroy the wards, Sinien gives the Vestige a runed talisman, which they have to focus towards the wards so the ritual Sinien has prepared would destroy them. One of the wards is located in the east part of the city, the other in the west. Considering it takes a moment or two for the talisman to focus enough energy to destroy the ward, the Vestige should first clear out the Daedra guarding it.\nAfter successfully destroying the wards, the Vestige should speak to Razum-dar in front of the castle. The Vestige will receive a reward of 168 ."}
