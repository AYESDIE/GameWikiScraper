Sources in the &lt;a href=\"Apographa\"&gt;Apographa&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the Tribunal relied on profanely enchanted tools to achieve godhead, and that those unholy devices were the ones originally created by the ungodly &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; sorceror &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; to create the False Construct &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;.\n2. the purity of the Tribunal.\nThe Dissident Priests say that the Temple has always maintained a public face [represented by the Heirographa -- the \"priestly writings\"] and a hidden face [ represented by the Apographa -- the \"hidden writings\"]. The public account portrays the actions of the Tribunal in a heroic light, while the hidden writings reveal secrets, untruths, inconsistencies, conflicting accounts and varying interpretations which hint at darker and less heroic motives and actions of the Tribunes. In particular, conflicting accounts of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;battle at Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; raise questions about the Tribunal's conduct, and about the source of their subsequent apotheosis. Also, there is good evidence that the Tribunal have been concealing the true nature of the threat posed by Dagoth Ur at Red Mountain, misleading the people about the Tribunal's ability to protect Morrowind from Dagoth Ur, and concealing a recent dramatic diminishing of the Tribunal's magical powers.\n3. Temple accounts of the Battle of Red Mountain.\nAshlander tradition does not place the Tribunal at Red Mountain, and holds that the Dwemer destroyed themselves, rather than that Nerevar destroyed them. Ashlander tradition further holds that Nerevar left Dagoth Ur guarding the profane secrets of Red Mountain while Nerevar went to confer with the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt; [i.e., the Tribunal], that Nerevar died at the conference [not of his wounds, according to the Ashlanders, but from treachery], and that subsequently the Tribunal confronted a defiant Dagoth Ur within Red Mountain, then drove Dagoth Ur beneath Red Mountain when he would not yield to their will.\n4. veneration of the Daedra, Saints, and Ancestors.\nWhile challenging the divinity of the Tribunal, the Dissidents do not challenge the sainthood or heroism of the Tribunal. In fact, the Dissident Priests advocate restoring many of the elements of Fundamentalist Ancestor Worship as practiced by the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; and by Saint Veloth. Exactly how this would work is debated inconclusively within the Dissident Priests.\n5. denial of the prophecies of the Incarnate, and persecution of the Nerevarines.\nThough no consensus exists among the Dissidents about whether the Nerevarine prophecies are genuine, all agree that the persecution of the Nerevarines is unjust and politically motivated. The Dissident Priests do not reject mysticism, revelation, or prophecy as part of the religious experience. The Dissidents have not resolved the issue of true or false insights. They have studied the mysticism of the Ashlander Ancestor Cults, in particular the rites of the Ashlander seers and wise women, and the prophecies of the Incarnate. Many among the Dissident Priests have come to believe that the Nerevarine prophecies are genuine, and have made a systematic study of prophecies recorded in Temple archives.\n6. Authority of the Archcanon and the Ordinators.\nThe Dissident Priests reject the authority of the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;. The temple hierarchy has been corrupted by self-interest and politics, and no longer acts in the best interests of the Temple or its worshippers. The Dissident Priests believe the Archcanon and Ordinators speak for themselves, not for the Tribunal.\n7. the Inquisition and the use of terror and torture by the Ordinators.\nWithin the Temple hierarchy it is an open secret that the Ordinators rely on abduction, terror, torture, and secret imprisonment to discourage heresy and dissent. The Dissident Priests feel the Ordinators are either out of control, or tools used to maintain a corrupt priesthood in power.\n8. fundamentals of Temple doctrine - Charity for the Poor, Education for the Ignorant, Protection for the Weak.\nThough the Dissident Priests acknowledge that most rank-and-file priests honor the best traditions of the Temple, they believe that many priests in higher ranks are interested more in love of authority and luxury than in the welfare of the poor, weak, and ignorant."}

Neither seemed very winded or bothered by their wounds.\nBattle 4 (C vs. D):Lasted under 1 minute, both suffering grievous injury. Neither seemed very bothered by their wounds.\nIt seems my original theory was correct. In future trials I will try watering down the headless zombie blood before adding it to the mixture, to gain some insight into the actual potency of the blood itself and determine how much of the additional effect is coming from its combination with the existing ingredients."}

In previous battles, she fought much less bravely and to lesser effect. She lasted a full minute against my most angry of hounds before her throat was ripped out and I had to revive her.\nHowever, removing just the feet of the middle-aged &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; male made him despondent and without any will to defend himself, even against a lesser foe. So pitiful was the look on the face of his corpse, that I decide to leave him be, rather than resurrect him. After so many years of scientific study, I still cannot abide apathy. I'm sure that my aversion to pity has colored my findings, as I only make use of strong-willed test subjects. Though I suppose, flawed as my research may be, it is still more revealing and faithful than any other has done before me.\nSummary ConclusionsAfter studying the various combats between the test subjects in this project, I have concluded that, much as the pain threshold is inconsistent within a given species, so too is the effect of dismemberment. Whether beast or man, the removal of a limb, be it functional as a hand, or peripheral as a tail, has varying effects on the subject, having to do more with individual temperament than any biological or cultural endowment. Whatever the particular effect, it is substantial. Whether it enhances a subject's tendency toward aggressiveness or passivity, or swings them to the other extreme, removing a limb has a profound effect on behavior.\nAfter reviewing my notes, I will attempt to catalogue all the similarities and differences between the subjects and their responses. I may be able to offer Lord &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; a guidebook detailing how to craft a better kingdom by removing various appendages from the bodies of its people."}

The Prologue lasts for four pages, from Page 3 to Page 6.\nPlot summary.\nOut in Deep Waters.\nThe story begins with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Iffech\"&gt;Captain Iffech&lt;/a&gt; feeling the sea shudder. He senses a disturbance in the wind current, the wind dies out, and the sea becomes dreadfully slow. The sea shakes again, and it causes &lt;a href=\"Keem\"&gt;Keem&lt;/a&gt; to fall off the Crow's Nest, he was able to catch the rigging with his claws. &lt;a href=\"Grayne\"&gt;Grayne&lt;/a&gt; felt the tremor and questioned if it was a Tsunami. Iffech then dismisses the theory by providing examples from the past. When he was near the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, the sea tried to swallow him, and he felt the Tsunami's movements. He then says that in deep water, you do not feel anything like these shudders, they were in deep waters. Soon, Iffech sees a massive thunderstorm that shrouded the area in blackness and stricken the sea with green lightning. He then saw a huge thunderhead appearing in the black clouds.\nA third tremor came, and it was forty times louder than before &amp; a large gust of wind broke down the Crow's Nest, killing Keem in the process. The roaring thunder drowned out any other noises that could have been happening. Iffech began to realize that some of the crew members and parts of the ship are gone. Iffech starts to think it's the work of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and Grayne reminisces about the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; that opened up in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;. Iffech then notices that the thunderhead was shaped like a large cone as an island ripped from the ground. The fourth gust of wind came with a terrible stench that incapacitated them and sealed their fate.\nSul &amp; the Vision.\nAn elderly &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; wakes up in &lt;a href=\"Lank%20Fellow%20Inn\"&gt;Lank Fellow Inn&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. His chest was aching, his limbs were trembling, and he was in a cold sweat. He saw a man waiting at his door with a surprised look on his face. Sul had been screaming and hollering for quite sometime, so much so that it had worried the man. Sul dismisses the man and ponders to himself, asking &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; about what he had just witnessed and what in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; had appeared before the crew. Sul reminisces over another person named &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;, believing he has something to do with it. Looking back at his vision, he remembers seeing the face of &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, which was pale and lifeless, amidst the desolate wastelands of Morrowind. He also saw a &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; youth with a crooked nose, but he did not look into it. Sul then leaves his bed and goes to the washbasin to splash his face and to look into his red eyes. On his side, he sees several books including the &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Southern%20Waters\"&gt;Tales of the Southern Waters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Most%20Current%20and%20High%20Adventures%20of%20Prince%20Attrebus\"&gt;the Most Current and High Adventures of Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt;, and on the cover had a Colovian man with a crooked nose. He let out a hoarse laugh and in an hour later, Sul left Chorrol and south, thinking on what happiness feels like."}

During a conversation with Sibbi, he will say that the horse was not actually his, but belongs to his family, and will tell where to retrieve the papers, which are at the Black-Briar Lodge.\u00a0Sibbi will also give the key to the Lodge Stash (upon doing so, the optional objective to \"Steal the Lodge Stash\" will be added).\nOne option is to\u00a0go to &lt;a href=\"Maven%20Black-Briar\"&gt;Maven Black-Briar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and report\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sibbi%20Black-Briar%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sibbi's&lt;/a&gt; plans to her, and she will say to continue the plan and that she will take care of everything else.\n&lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Lodge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Black-Briar Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nStealing\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frost%20%28Horse%29\"&gt;Frost's&lt;/a&gt; Lineage Papers.\nWhen arriving at the Black-Briar Lodge, there will be two to three &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Mercenary\"&gt;mercenary guards&lt;/a&gt; outside in front of the lodge; an archer and a swordsman. One option is to approach from the front and fight them as to enter through the front, or, sneak around and open the basement door on the west side of the house. If a third mercenary does not join the fight outside from the basement, there may be two in the basement area.\nAlternately, the building can be approached from the rear. The Lodge is set back against a hill that runs along the west side of the building and out toward the road to the south.\nThe\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0skill can also be put to good use here, as\u00a0there is a small path on the east side of the hill mentioned above. Behind the Lodge, there is a wooden lookout tower and a single guard that walks between the two buildings. Kill the guard, take the key and enter from the back door (north side\u2014top building level).\nNo matter what approach is taken, the objective is to steal Frosts' identity papers, so the Black-Briar Lodge must be entered. The lodge is a three-level building; there are living quarters and rooms above, a dining area and rooms at mid-level and storage rooms and living quarters at the basement level. All outside guards appear to carry keys to unlock the doors of the Lodge. A single guard may be in the upper level and three to four guards in the mid/dining room level. In the upstairs bedroom, there is a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on a night-table.\nOnce downstairs, there will be a barrel in the back with the papers in a strongbox. The papers may also be found on one of the tables.\nStealing\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frost%20%28Horse%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Frost%20%28Horse%29\"&gt;Frost's&lt;/a&gt; identity papers have been retrieved, go outside to retrieve Frost; he\u00a0will be outside either in or behind the stables running around loose. Mount Frost and proceed to Letrush, who is close by.\nReturning to &lt;a href=\"Louis%20Letrush\"&gt;Louis Letrush&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf Frost dies on the way to Louis Letrush, the quest fails. There are no scripted enemies on the way, but standard &lt;a href=\"Random%20Encounters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random encounters&lt;/a&gt; may still occur, in which case hostile enemies will target both Frost and the Dragonborn. If a random encounter which involves combat occurs nearby Louis, he will join in the combat, preventing the completion of the quest until he has left combat and the enemies have been defeated. If a random &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0encounter occurs, riding Frost at a very slow pace may avoid catching the dragon's attention.\nAfter getting to Louis Letrush, initiate a conversation with him which will give several dialogue options.\u00a0There are several options to complete the job Letrush has given and to finish the deal.\nThe first (and easiest) way is to simply accept the payment and give Frost to Letrush, completing the job Letrush has given and the quest itself.\nA second option is to persuade him to give the payment and also to keep the horse. There are two sub-options, and may be based on whether or not the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has already spoken with Maven. The first option is to threaten to report to Maven unless allowed to keep the horse, the second is to threaten to kill him to keep the horse. The first results in a response from him that \"You play a dangerous game\" and he leaves the Dragonborn the horse and walks away. If his life is threatened, he comments, leaves the horse and runs away. In both cases, the Dragonborn has the horse and got the gold as well. Louis will, however, send a &lt;a href=\"hired%20thug\"&gt;hired thug&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation. The thug will randomly show up at a later point saying that \"this is for betraying Louis Letrush\" before attacking.\nA third option to receive the reward is to demand the pay by intimidation in which the payment is received and the horse is given to Letrush which will result in a reward of leveled gold.\u00a0\nA fourth option is to just kill him, then retrieve the horse and loot the gold off his body."}

Shoddy brass or &lt;a href=\"Advances%20in%20Lockpicking\"&gt;copper will give way to a well placed kick, thereby rendering the lock itself useless.&lt;/a&gt; I recommend steel over iron when choosing a material.

I have been chagrined to stumble across the shattered shell of a wooden chest, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; lock intact and still locked.\nOnce these basics are settled, pay particular attention to the offset of the tumblers. A seven degree offset to the keyhole will allow a torque style key to work smoothly, while at the same time causing numerous headaches for the thief attempting to insert non-torque &lt;a href=\"lockpick\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn similar fashion, the springs of the tumblers should be made by different smiths. Each smith will unknowingly create a spring with different tension than his fellow smiths. This variance will also create difficulties for anyone attempting to pick the lock."}

Failure, on the other hand, lasts for an eternity.\nThroughout their brief existence, every mortal invariably attempts activities that are beyond their physical capabilities, in the hopes of achieving greatness. Mortals refer to this quality as \"ambition.\" Inevitably, complications brought about by overreach, overexertion, miscalculation, or simply by bad luck will result in a catastrophic failure in one or more of these activities. The resulting shame and self-reproach will often imprint itself within a mortal's mind and forever remain, haunting them for the remainder or their days.\nFailure\u2014the natural byproduct of a mortal's ambition\u2014can therefore be one of the most potent weapons in a torturer's arsenal.\nMortals, through their liberal exercise of free will, do not wish to be reminded of their failures or their unrequited ambitions. Recounting these failures can have a effect upon their \"pride,\" a pitiable quality which espouses the individual person as a unique and exalted personality in a vast, meaningless universe. When a mortal's pride is affected, any other favorable qualities they might possess are devalued in their own self-perception. To wit, they begin to mentally torture themselves.\nOne of the most elegant and efficient means of breaking a mortal's spirit, then, is the constant and repetitive re-creation of the events they consider to be their most devastating failures and inadequacies. By highlighting, exaggerating, and to some degree even distorting these events, we can create a situation where their own self-doubts and frustrations turn inward, devouring their own mind, body, and soul.\nThough it may take more time and effort than pure physical torture, a daily regimen of repetitive forced-failure scenarios will eventually break the subject's will without the need to resort to violence or bloodshed, the expense of which have been extensively documented as the direct result of elevated cleaning costs and desiccated corpse disposal."}
{"id": "804538", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=804538", "title": "Proper Torture Techniques, Vol. 8", "text": "Proper Torture Techniques, Vol. 8 is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Online%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nLove, the Mortal Weakness\nOne of the more confusing phenomena of the mortal condition is that peculiar emotional state known as love, in which one mortal feigns an irrational and unconditional affection for another mortal. This state, unknown to the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;His Majesty's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;, is the most puzzling for a torturer to understand, foreign as the concept is, but lurking within this emotional quality are many avenues for simulating this state and therefore manipulating the torture subject into submitting to our will.\nLove, as it is, is a very powerful force, and it is through love that most mortals perform their greatest and most heroic deeds. Though love can be directed at any number of abstract concepts\u2014love for the Empire, love for one's personal &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;deity&lt;/a&gt;, love for one's home\u2014these are more tenuous forms of the emotion and thus less effective for our torture methods. Manipulating love for abstract concepts is best served for souring a mortal's disposition in peaceful times, not for extracting information while in the torture chamber.\nRather, if one wishes to use love as an effective torture method, the love of one mortal for another mortal is by far the strongest, and thus the most efficient and powerful, source for manipulation. Whereas love for an abstraction exists solely within a mortal's mind, the love for another person exists in the physical realm, and its tangibility amplifies its effect on a mortal's soul. A mortal may love, say, his career as a baker, but there is not one single thing which defines that love, and thus the affection is a complex thread of interwoven objects inside his mental faculties. But when a child loves his mother, he has only one mother, and if that is taken away from him, there would be only a void with which to fulfill that love. Thus, a proper torturer must focus on the love for another mortal in order to effectively torture a mortal soul.\nNow the question remains: How does one use the love for another mortal as a method of torture? The answer is entirely dependent on the relationship of the tortured soul and the object of their affection. Familial love, the love between members of the same family, is most effectively pursued by reinforcing the concept of loss. If a mother loves her child, she would be unable to bear losing that child. Thus, presenting a vision of the child to the mother and then taking it away\u2014either through death or kidnapping\u2014would be an effective means of torture. Love between friends, though, is best portrayed as constant and inevitable betrayal or overt treachery on behalf of the assumed friend.\nIf a torturer happens upon a mortal who holds secret desires for another mortal, particularly in the nature of nuptial love or carnal love, but for which this love is not fulfilled\u2014mortals call this \"unrequited love\"\u2014then that torturer has the most enticing and powerful version of love with which to use.\nA mortal's petty sense of identity and its futile need to fulfill its desires is one of the defining characteristics of mortal existence, and the sometimes lifelong ambition to achieve one's goals is the driving force for many mortal beings throughout their short and ultimately meaningless lives. Offering a mortal even the slightest indulgence of their unrequited desires, empty and false as it may be, is to entice the very essence of their ambitions and to stoke their basest emotional needs. If a torturer can invoke these instincts from the victim, then the success of the torture is practically guaranteed."}

Smithing is referred to as the art of refining raw materials and combining them to create or improve pieces of armor or weapons. It is one of the three &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; skills in Skyrim, falling under the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; playstyle, with parallels to &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt;.\nMechanics.\nSmithing is a multistage process with the number of stages depending on what items are being crafted and how raw the materials are. The process can be started at any intermediate stage if the right items are obtained, but every stage requires input materials, knowledge of the build, and its own tool. Input materials can be found in the world or purchased from vendors. Knowledge of new recipes can be acquired only through perks but some are available automatically. The tools listed below roughly outlines the end-to-end process.\nSmithing stations.\nThese stations, required for various stages in the smithing process, can be found in any main city and most villages. They are also frequently found in forts and dungeons or outside mines. See the individual station pages for more specific locations.\nRacial bonuses.\n&lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; characters gain an initial five-point boost to Smithing.\nLeveling.\nThe following actions raise the Smithing skill:\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Smithing skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Smithing skill:\nGrowth curve.\nThe Smithing skill levels according to an . This means each level costs proportionately more than the previous one.\nBeneficial equipment.\nThere are multiple objects and potions which benefit smithing within \"Skyrim\". First are &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, which temporarily increases the smithing ability. There is also armor &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; which, depending on one's enchanting ability, can grant a much higher smithing ability as long as the user is wearing it.\nPerks.\nThe following chart lists the perks that become available to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; as the skill is leveled up. In spite of the shape of the perk constellation implying otherwise, perks explicitly list their prerequisites (Daedric Smithing requires Ebony Smithing be taken first, and so forth).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nImprovement.\nThe table shows what quality improvement an item will achieve based on Smithing level and if the Smithing perk for the item is taken or not.\nItems can still be improved once they reach Legendary, but the description will not change.\nEach additional quality level beyond Legendary improves Armor by 3.6 and other items (weapons, helms, boots, etc.) by 1.8. The skill related to the item will also affect how much it does. So the bonus is significantly larger on the armor on someone with the corresponding skill.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; can improve results significantly via the &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;Fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt; effect allowing for greater improvements at a given level than the table shows. Combining both alchemy and enchanting to improve one another and then combining both to improve Smithing as much as possible can be very powerful.\nThe improvement of armor and weapons requires one smithing material per item improved. These items can be obtained by &lt;a href=\"tanning\"&gt;tanning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"smelting\"&gt;smelting&lt;/a&gt;, or other means of obtaining items."}

There are three outcomes for each character, depending on the choices made. The \"romance\" ending requires three correct choices, the \"friends\" ending requires at least one correct choice, and the \"enemies\" ending is achieved by choosing all the options wrong.\nDialogue.\nRazum-dar.\nOut of breath and soaked with rain, you and Razum-dar take refuge in a cozy tavern after a treacherous chase. You outran your latest enemy and, for what feels like the first time in weeks, you finally have a moment to breathe. You\u2019re in a back room, warming yourself by a roaring fire while Raz speaks to the innkeeper about preparing your rooms. After a few minutes, the Khajiit appears in the doorway with drinks in hand. He flashes you a smile as he sits beside you.\n\"That was a close one, yes? Closer than Raz is usually comfortable with. But we should be safe here, so long as we lie low, enjoying the drinks and perhaps one another's company? The innkeeper was a bit suspicious, so Raz told him the two of us are recently married, deeply in love, and on our honeymoon. The man said we make a beautiful couple, which of course Raz already knew. This one hopes you do not mind.\"\n\"At any rate, Raz is glad we made it here and that you are unharmed. It is a relief to have a moment to rest and know that we are safe after so many days of uncertainty. We should enjoy it while it lasts. Raz almost wishes we were a young married couple without a care in the world. No responsibilities. No duties to uphold. Nothing to concern our hearts with but our love for each other.\"\n\"Say what you will about our adventures together \u2026 Raz cannot deny he has enjoyed himself. We've had much excitement, yes? Not all of it good, but not all of it bad, either. Raz has worried through his fair share of it. You tend to be a source of distraction for him. Raz did not expect someone so stimulating, or attractive, to come into his life, after all. Hmm. This one begins to suspect his little lie about the two of us being married was a bit more indulgent on his part than he first admitted. That perhaps he has fallen for you, despite his best efforts. What do you think?\"\nRomance\nRaz leans forward, closing the distance between the two of you. This close, you can smell the damp leather of his armor and see the flames of the fire dancing in his green eyes.\n\"Long has this one wished to stare into your eyes like this. A shame we waited this long. Of course, our adventures are far from over. Raz knows there is much in store for us still. Now, come. If we are to keep our friendly innkeeper unsuspecting, the young couple should retire to their room for the night, yes?\"\nRaz chuckles softly, his eyes flashing with amusement. His gaze traces your face fondly for a moment, as if he hopes to memorize you, before he stands. He offers you his arm with a dashing grin and keeps you close to his side as the two of you climb the stairs and adjourn to your room for the night.\nFriends\nRaz chuckles, his eyes glittering.\n\"You joke with Raz. You always know how to make him laugh, yes? You are a good friend, you know. This one is glad to have met you. Shall we drink to our adventures? Raz hopes there will be many more to come.\"\nRaz sits back and raises his tankard with a dashing smile. He gestures it toward you with a nod of warm approval. The two of you drink long into the night, regaling each other with stories of your exploits and laughing so hard the innkeeper eventually has to scold you for it.\nEnemies\nRaz scoffs and shakes his head, his lip curling in a snarl.\n\"Raz can see you are obviously not interested in his company tonight. Perhaps come morning you will have a change of heart, but Raz will not hold his breath. Good night.\"\nRaz stands from the table, taking his drink with him. He stomps away to the other side of the tavern, leaving you alone by the fire. The two of you do not speak for the rest of the night.\nNaryu.\nYou stand awkwardly on a cobblestone street of Balmora as Naryu looks you up and down with a scrutinizing eye. She invited you to the House Hlaalu Masquerade Ball tonight, hosted by an important Hlaalu counsilor, but hasn\u2019t told you why she\u2019s brought you along. The Dark Elf circles you once, assessing your ball attire. After a moment, she gives a satisfied hum of approval and comes to stand across from you again.\n\"Well, well\u2026 you certainly clean up nicely, don\u2019t you, hero? You look divine. Every eye will be on you tonight. Think you can handle that?\"\n\"Anyway, the job is simple. It requires very little effort on your part. I invited you to play a very small, but vital, role in tonight's proceedings. I trust you, and my trust is not something easily gained. So don't screw this up. If all goes well, I should be done inside an hour. Then you can relax and even enjoy the party, if you so choose. Perhaps you'll even find a dashing suitor to dance with.\"\nNaryu steps closer to you, one hand coming to rest on your waist, the other on your shoulder. She presses close and stares deeply into your eyes, a smirk curling her lips. She leans in a little, so close you can feel her breath on your bottom lip. You feel a sharp edge against your side and realize she\u2019s pulled her dagger. It lingers at your ribs for a moment before Naryu laughs and pulls away from you. Her red eyes glitter with amusement. And something more.\n\"You know, I asked you here because you\u2019ve never let me down. I don\u2019t have many people I can count on, so I keep the ones I\u2019m reasonably certain about close. But if I\u2019m being completely honest, I asked you here for another reason, too. Some deluded fantasy about the two of us dancing in each other\u2019s arms, drunk on wine, retiring to some secluded hallway where I press you up against the wall and our hands are all over each other and\u2026 If that\u2019s as stupid as it sounds, I need you to tell me right now, hero.\"\nRomance\nA shiver runs through you.\n\"Let\u2019s get this done quickly, hero. Then we can start in on that delicious fantasy of mine. I can hardly wait. In fact \u2026 I think a taste of what\u2019s to come may be appropriate. It\u2019ll give me something to think about while I\u2019m working.\"\nNaryu suddenly presses you back against the wall of the Randy Netch Inn you\u2019re standing in front of and brings her body close to yours. Her expression is unreadable. She\u2019s either going to kiss you or kill you, and you can\u2019t quite tell the difference. You grab her hips. She\u2019s surprisingly soft. Her mouth hovers inches from yours and she chuckles low, sending shivers across your body. You lose yourself in the moment, savoring every second\u2026\nFriends\nNaryu rolls her eyes.\n\"Let\u2019s just forget about all that. I have a job to do, and you have people to mingle with and partygoers to impress. Try to be your charming self, hmm? And don\u2019t get into any trouble or try any heroics while I\u2019m gone. If all goes well, drinks are on me.\"\nNaryu adjusts the neckline of your ensemble fondly and then steps back, apparently satisfied with her work. She slides an elaborate masquerade mask into your hand with a smirk.\nEnemies\nNaryu\u2019s expression tightens.\n\"All right, I think it\u2019s fairly obvious that you\u2019re not interested in helping me. I\u2019m not sure what your problem is, but I don\u2019t have the patience for it, or the time. I think it\u2019s probably best you leave. I can do this on my own.\"\nShe makes a lewd gesture over her shoulder as she leaves. You do not hear from Naryu again.\nDarien.\nWhile exploring outside Shimmerene with Darien, a summer squall hits the island. You take refuge in an old, damp ruin with the golden knight to wait out the storm. Darien makes a fire and peels off his soaked shirt, laying it against a nearby rock. He rifles through the pack he brought for the journey, procuring a loaf of bread, some cheese, and an unanticipated bottle of wine. He pops the cork with his teeth and grins.\n\"So this is fun. A little unexpected, but most good things in life are. We have wine, food, a relatively dry place to stay and one another\u2019s fine company. What could be better? I\u2019m almost glad this storm hit. I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you to grab a drink anyway. And I must say, you look quite good soaking wet.\"\n\"Really, though, this isn\u2019t so bad. Things could be worse. Neither of us are wounded, no great evil is breathing down our necks for once, and we have nothing to do and nowhere to be until this storm clears. If only there was a bit more entertainment. A bard to play us a lovely song and set the mood, maybe. I suppose we\u2019ll have to entertain ourselves for the time being. Any ideas?\"\n\"We\u2019ve gone through a lot together, haven\u2019t we? I find myself dreaming about you often. Most of the time they\u2019re nice dreams. You in tight leathers, me in a steaming bath... But sometimes they\u2019re not so nice. Sometimes, I lose you. And that scares me more than I care to admit. Tell me, do you feel the same? Or am I crazy?\"\nRomance\nDarien traces your face with his eyes.\n\"Maybe we should just stay here, even after the storm passes. Tell everyone that we got hopelessly lost and just spend a few days lying out here in the grass, caressing each other to our hearts\u2019 content. Of course, there\u2019d be no one to save the world if we went missing. So, I suppose we\u2019ll just have to take advantage of the time we have.\"\nDarien moves closer, his hand trailing at your waist before pulling you flush against him with impressive strength. You feel the hard, muscled plane of his body pressed against your soaked clothes as his warmth surrounds you. He flips damp hair out of his eyes and then presses his forehead against yours. His laughter is lost in the pounding rain as the storm crashes down around you.\nFriends\nDarien rolls his shoulders a bit.\n\"Well, we\u2019ve got a full bottle of wine and at least a few hours until the worst of the storm passes. I say we get drunk, lie back, and watch the lightning. You\u2019re a good friend, you know. There\u2019s no one else I\u2019d rather be stuck out here with. Well, that\u2019s not true. If the opportunity to be stuck out here with a dozen beautiful women came up, I\u2019d probably pick that one. But then you. Definitely you.\"\nDarien grins at you and nudges your shoulder a bit. Then the two of you lean back to watch the storm roll through.\nEnemies\nDarien huffs a little.\n\"You know what? I was going to share my bread with you. It\u2019s delicious, like me. But if you\u2019d rather eat boring air, so be it. Oh. And I\u2019m drinking the rest of this wine.\"\nDarien scowls and starts valiantly chugging the remainder of the bottle. He glares at you with one eye while he does so. The storm rages outside the ruin all the while. The two of you don\u2019t speak for the rest of the night."}

He turned back to S'Riizh who was were he left him, half buried in the sand to pack his broken bones. One of the crates of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt; was open.\n\"You're sampling the merchandise?\" asked Harithoel angrily.\n\"It takes away the pain,\" said S'Riizh. \"How far away are we?\"\n\"We didn't make it as far as the mainland,\" said Harithoel. \"I can't see the coastline at all. But that's not all. I haven't found anything edible anywhere. Just weeds and a few scraggly trees.\"\n\"And no other survivors?\" asked S'Riizh.\n\"No, it looks like we're the only ones. I guess, the nice way to look at it is that if we're rescued, we can divide the profits between two rather than between twelve.\"\n\"So we'll either be rich or dead,\" said S'Riizh. \"That's a comfort.\"\nS'Riizh was too battered to be of much help, but Harithoel was able to construct a crude shelter, weaving the sand weeds. As night fell on the small island, the two men discussed the smuggling operation and what went wrong. Their boat, laden with five crates of moon sugar, was supposed to meet another, the Sanchariot, off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;. Who could have predicted the storm? Who could have predicted that everyone would drown, from the bold captain to the mysterious figure with ties to one of the royal Houses, everyone except for S'Riizh and Harithoel. They decided that it was all the whim of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; or one of the other &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; with cruel senses of humor.\nFinding fresh water was their first goal, and it turned out to be a fruitless quest. Harithoel dug deeply, but there were no springs under the island, just sand and rock. S'Riizh felt panic seizing his soul, until he saw the small, quick, golden fish swimming at the edges of the island. He had read somewhere that fish not only were food, but there was always a little fresh water within them. If he could catch one, the two men could be saved. With his broken legs, he was a pathetic predator and he was soon reduced to hurling rocks at the alert and nimble little fish.\nHarithoel watched S'Riizh's futile endeavor for a little while before getting to work. He used his small knife to whittle a point on a long, straight tree branch until he had fashioned a spear. Again and again, he thrust the spear at the fish, but he had no more success than S'Riizh and his stones.\n\"Have you never used a spear before?\" asked S'Riizh.\n\"It's not my weapon of choice,\" said Harithoel, quietly, watching his prey and missing another with a splash and a curse. \"Nchow!\"\nS'Riizh laughed: \"Do you want a rock?\"\nHarithoel ignored S'Riizh, murmuring, \"The trick as I've heard it is to anticipate where your target's going to go and aim your spear there, not where they are now. I just have to observe them a little longer. Why can't the little fechers swim in straight lines?\"\nAfter an hour of flailing about, Harithoel, by luck, managed to spear a fish. The men tore it apart and ate it raw. As the days and weeks went by, Harithoel got better and better until he was able to strike quickly and with great accuracy. He could hit a fish by throwing the spear or by plunging at one at his feet. S'Riizh made fire, but being lame, he had to rely on Harithoel for all the food.\nIt was nearly two months after washing ashore that the men saw a boat on the horizon. They set a large fire, and the crew saw them. As it approached, they saw that it was the Sanchariot, the very boat they were to have met on the night of the storm. The smugglers aboard would pay them good money for the moon sugar. Luckily, S'Riizh had used only a little bit of it, and they still had five nearly full crates. They were not only going to be saved, they were going to be rich, just as Harithoel had said.\nHarithoel excitedly started to help S'Riizh to his feet, but the man rose on his own.\n\"You can walk!\" he said, laughing. \"It's a miracle!\"\n\"S'Riizh is not too steady, though,\" said S'Riizh. \"Would you gather up the crates?\"\nHarithoel, overjoyed at rescue at long last, began picking up the crates and stacking them. \"I wish you had told me that you could walk though, mate. I could have used your help spearing dinner all these months.\"\n\"S'Riizh watches though,\" said S'Riizh. \"You'd be surprised how much you can learn just by watching. Don't forget the fifth crate over by the tree.\" S'Riizh shuffled over to the shore and saw that the boat was only a few minutes from landing. \"And S'Riizh listens. When you said that a fortune divided by two was more profitable than a fortune divided by twelve, S'Riizh listened to that too.\" S'Riizh shuffled back to the crate by the tree. \"And it occurred to S'Riizh that a fortune divided by one was even better.\" S'Riizh pulled the spear out of Harithoel's skull. The trajectory had been perfect: it had fallen down from the branches as soon as the crate was removed, just as he had planned. \"Like you said, the trick is to anticipate where your target's going to go and aim your spear there.\"\nS'Riizh pushed the crate to the shore and waved the boat in."}

Creepy looking thing, too, was glad to be rid of it.\nIt's a shame we couldn't hold out a couple more days though. This morning another buyer came by the camp, an Orc with a face so lumpy he must've jumped head first off the top of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurns out he was looking for the same staff, offering to pay double. I told him we could have something better for him on the next boat from &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, but he was pretty sodding clear there was only one staff he wanted to buy. Makes sense. The only thing uglier than this Orc was that staff. Maybe he wants to hold it up when he shaves so he doesn't feel so bad for being born.\nAnyways, I sold him the information on the buyers, and sent him on his way. Couldn't get him to trade any of the valuables on his carriage, but it's all right. There's more than one way to part a fool and his things.\nI told the boys to cut him off on the road west of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, at the burnt house between the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;watchtower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greymoor\"&gt;Fort Greymoor&lt;/a&gt;.

Close range sneak attacking is considered extremely useful when the Hero has the Expert &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt; perk, the Master Sneak perk, and a Mace.

{"id": "39309", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=39309", "title": "Sneak (Skyrim)", "text": "Sneak is a skill in and is one of the six &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; that fall under &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Thief&lt;/a&gt; adventuring style.\nChanges from previous games.\nThe sneak system in Skyrim is slightly different from that of previous games. Visibility is depicted through use of an eye that remains closed while undetected, but opens more and more as the likelihood of being detected increases. If the word \"Detected\" appears on the screen, a creature or character can see the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, or has just seen them and knows where they are. If the word \"Hidden\" appears on the screen, no one is aware of the Dragonborn's presence. Note that this means that the Dragonborn may still be hidden from one or more potential observers even if the eye is open as it will be open if even only one observer sees them.\nPeople around the sneaker will also change \"modes\" depending on whether they view them sneaking. For instance, they will be passive if they are unaware, or cautious if they are aware someone is sneaking. Characters' and animals' ability to notice the Dragonborn is dependent on a large number of factors, including their Sneak skill, line of sight, the level of light on their current position, how heavy the sneaker's armor is, whether this armor is &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, enchantments on the armor (muffle), spells cast (muffle), if weapons are drawn, if magic is equipped, how fast they are moving, and the effects of any active perks.\nSneaking now also depends on the hostility of opponents. Neutral or friendly characters will have a massively improved ability to detect, which can often make it difficult to sneak up on enemies who are technically not hostile yet.\nLeveling.\nThe more the Dragonborn sneaks, the more their Sneak Skill increases. Successfully sneaking increases the amount the skill goes up by.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Sneak Skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Sneak skill:\nPerks.\nThe following are the perks available to be taken as the skill is leveled up\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nNot-quite-hidden theft.\nSometimes, certain characters may discover, after the fact, the Dragonborn has &lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt; something. Unlike cases where the theft is detected immediately and &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; are called to arrest the thief, here the Dragonborn does not receive a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;; instead, the character will pay three &lt;a href=\"hired%20thugs\"&gt;hired thugs&lt;/a&gt; (one of which will have a \"&lt;a href=\"Contract%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Contract&lt;/a&gt;\" in their inventory) to \"teach a lesson\" to the perpetrator.\nEncounters with hired thugs can happen in any public place, including towns and cities (for example, in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;). If Hold Guards are nearby, they may or may not come to the Dragonborn's defense against the thugs.\nAlmost any character in Skyrim can send hired thugs after the thief, including generic characters such as &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. This extends to characters who would have no logical way of contacting thugs (for example, &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; or a ghost), and even if the character was dead prior to the theft. Effectively, for any item owned by a character that is stolen from a location or pickpocketed from them, there is a chance of encountering hired thugs later. There is also no dialogue option to confront the person who hired thugs.\nNot-quite-hidden murder.\nWith a relatively high sneak, individuals standing just a foot or two away from a guard can kill them without receiving a bounty. The killer also can remain undetected as long as the guard is not looking directly at them. However, if they then walk past the guard and are detected, the guard may attack them. While fighting back gains no bounty, killing the guard results in the normal 1,000 bounty for murder. Other guards throughout the &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt; will not become hostile, so murdering the guard that witnessed their indiscretion may be a solution rather than leaving town for several days.\nAlso, if you possess the illusion spell &lt;a href=\"Fury%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fury&lt;/a&gt;, you can cast it on any citizen as long as you are hidden, Quiet Casting is unnecessary, and killing them will not grant a bounty."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, they were the main inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and had a very advanced society.\nIt is commonly believed that centuries of underground living and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; twisted the race into becoming the blind, merciless and savage &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe few known remaining Ancient Falmer call themselves \"Snow Elf,\" and refer to those that are called by the modern term \"Falmer,\" as \"The Betrayed.\" There is believed to be a number of surviving pockets of Snow Elves hidden around Tamriel.\nHistory.\nDespite most of this civilization's history being lost, a surviving Snow Elf by the name of &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; revealed details about the fate of his race. Gelebor explains that they were once a \"proud and prosperous race,\" before the war with the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; and their subsequent enslavement by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The Snow Elves had a society that almost rivaled that of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The Snow Elves also possessed a remarkable aptitude with magic, as can be seen with &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;.\nMerethic Era.\nBeginnings.\nLike all &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Elves are descendants of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the other races of Mer, the Snow Elves retained much of the Aldmeri culture. When they separated from them is unknown.\nThe Snow Elves were originally a wealthy and prosperous society that made their home in portions of Skyrim. They were the first race of Mer in Skyrim and were present long before the first Atmoran colonies that were established by &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;. Their origin was part of the initial exodus of dissident Mer groups from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, although the only Mer to settle in Skyrim were the Snow Elves and later, the Dwemer.\nPeace with the Atmorans.\nWhen the Atmorans arrived from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Elves had a somewhat comfortable relationship with the &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;. Initial coexistence between men and Snow Elves was largely peaceful, though this was not to last, as conflict soon arose between the two peoples.\nNight of Tears.\nThe peace was short-lived, as an attack by Snow Elves destroyed the rapidly growing settlement of &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. The ensuing genocide was known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;\" and the raid on Saarthal caused the demise of the entire population of the city. However, Ysgramor and his two sons managed to escape the attack, who then fled back to Atmora. The death of his countrymen prompted Ysgramor to summon his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the namesake and forebears of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and vow to return and drive the Snow Elves from Skyrim.\nThe Sacking of Saarthal.\nThe \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20the%20Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Fall of the Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;\" suggest the conflict may have been related to the rapidly increasing Nord population and a struggle for control over territory and resources, which took the form of a war of extermination\u2014with both sides apparently pursuing the utter destruction of the other. The \"Night of Tears\" as well as the \"&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Report%20on%20Saarthal\"&gt;Imperial Report on Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;\" suggests the conflict may have rather been more specifically related to, or escalated by the Snow Elves desire to control a powerful artifact uncovered by the Nord settlers and the Nords of Saarthal's desire to keep such power buried beneath the rocks and soil of their city.\nLater during the events of , a &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; representative, &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; member &lt;a href=\"Quaranir\"&gt;Quaranir&lt;/a&gt;, took actions and made statements giving credence to the theory that this object, known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, may have played an important role in the conflict.\nThe text \"&lt;a href=\"KINMUNE\"&gt;KINMUNE&lt;/a&gt;\" supports the latter conclusion strongly as it identifies the area under Saarthal as the site of a divine prison.\nConflict with the Nords.\nHowever, the decision to eradicate the Nords would come at a great cost - to their entire civilization - as Ysgramor survived the attack on Saarthal and returned to their homeland of Atmora to raise an army. Ysgramor and his army, known as the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, would return to Skyrim to take revenge on the Snow Elves. The series of events that would soon follow would be known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;, and with this return, a new &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; would begin. As time passed, the Atmorans once again returned to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. They landed in Skyrim, and began a march across Skyrim under Ysgramor's leadership to avenge their fallen brethren. The elves would wage war with the humans for years, slowly losing to the very \"creatures\" they had culled in years prior.\nBattle of the Moesring.\nThe Snow Elves were broken and scattered, following numerous losses to Ysgramor and his Companions, and retreated to the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; for safe harbor. Led by an elf only known as the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Elves took a final stand against the Nordic people, inspired by their leader, to seek their victory anew. During the Battle of the &lt;a href=\"Moesring%20Mountains\"&gt;Moesring&lt;/a&gt;, which was to be the last battle against the Nords, the Snow Prince was slain by a child by the name of &lt;a href=\"Finna%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Finna&lt;/a&gt;, who, in her grief after the death of her mother, threw her mother's sword at the Prince, which struck him in the breast and killed him.\nThe death of the Snow Prince caused the elves' hope to be shattered, and many attempted to flee the battle. It is not known what the exact date of this loss was but it was towards the end of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the elves' military power destroyed, the Nords, then, mounted a genocidal campaign and killed the Snow Elves by the thousands.\nInteractions with Sai.\nFollowing their defeat, the Snow Elf resistance was eradicated. &lt;a href=\"Sai\"&gt;Sai&lt;/a&gt; had agreed to help all living creatures of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; with his luck, and thus attempted to help the Snow Elves. He had to find them first, as this was not an easy task, for the few remaining survivors had vanished into hiding. When he did find them, he did not manage to win their trust and they refused his help.\nThe betrayal.\nEventually, the Snow Elves sought refuge with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, in their underground fortresses. The Snow Elves had always maintained an uneasy alliance with the Dwemer, also known as Dwarves, and since the Snow Elves were experiencing the eradication of their culture, they turned to the Dwarves for help.\nThe Dwarves agreed to grant the Snow Elves refuge, but at a high price. They were forced to eat toxic plants in order to live underground. This toxic fungus naturally came from &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dwemer fed the toxic fungus to the Snow Elves. The toxins gradually destroyed their sight, and this loss happened over generations. The Dwemer then forced the blind Snow Elves into slavery. Not all of the Snow Elves agreed to such a price. Splinter groups had formed to search for alternate solutions. These elves sought out other alliances, but, ultimately, most were slaughtered, vanished, or gave in and accepted the Dwemer's offers.\nBirth of the Falmer.\nOver time, the Snow Elves began to devolve into twisted, blinded creatures, becoming the degenerate race now known as the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. They were slaves of the Dwemer and over time, their history was lost as they became an increasingly primal people. Because of this, it is commonly believed that the Snow Elves were actually tricked into blindness and slavery, rather than having agreed to the situation to survive. Although contradictory reports state that most Snow Elves sought the Dwemer's help and agreed to their terms to avoid eradication.\nSometime later, the Snow Elves/Falmer revolted against their masters, which started a war that lasted decades. The full-fledged and bloody conflict was known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Crag\"&gt;War of the Crag&lt;/a&gt;. The war raged deep below the surface of Skyrim, unbeknownst to the surface dwellers, the Nords. Then, in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Elves came to face the Dwemer in battle, but the Dwemer people had completely disappeared.\nThe Dwemer's demise.\nAt that time, the Dwemer were also fighting another war against the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, east of Skyrim, in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;. This war, in Morrowind, was fought over religion, philosophy, and issues over ethics, technology, and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. However the central contentious point was the fact that the Dwemer were in possession of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. The war started in &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, and in 1E 700, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; took place in and around the Dwemer citadels on &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. It is reported that, as the battle was being fought, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, the Chief Tonal Architect of the Dwemer, used his tools to tap into the Heart, which caused the Dwemer race to disappear. The disappearance of the Dwemer subsequently freed the Snow Elves. However, years of enslavement and war had left them bloodthirsty and in a primal state.\nSome pockets of Snow Elf resistance remained, although, it appears that most were eventually eliminated. &lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Skorm Snow-Strider's Journal&lt;/a&gt; discussed a military campaign against Snow Elf refugee forces as late as &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt; under the First King of Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Gelebor believes there may be other isolated Snow Elf survivors scattered across Tamriel.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Elves were a near-forgotten legend, and the ruin-dwelling Falmer remained hidden from the eyes of those on the surface.\nThe last of the Snow Elves.\nNot all Snow Elves suffered the fate of the Falmer: it appears that elves, such as &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; and various other religious followers, were able to evade death at the Nords' hands or their enslavement by the Dwarves. These last Snow Elves live in seclusion, and appear to have remained as keepers or guardians to their &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Skyrim%29%23Elvish%20Pantheon\"&gt;shrines&lt;/a&gt;.\nGelebor shows pity toward his \"primal brethren,\" whom he calls \"the Betrayed.\" He also states that he rejects the name of \"Falmer,\" preferring to be called \"Snow Elves.\"\nThe largest gathering of these elves were at the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. However, after a massive raid by the Betrayed, Knight-Paladin Gelebor and his brother, &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;, seem to be the only survivors left there.\nIt is unknown how many other Sanctuaries exist in Skyrim, where these Snow Elves may be found, but it should be noted that several &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; states that many fled Skyrim, and may probably be living in other parts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; or on different continents.\nReligion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the elves established monuments and shrines dedicated to their &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elf%20Pantheon\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these gods are common &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i gods, such as &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;. However, their chief-deity was &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, also known as &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. One such monument is known as the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, this monument was originally so large it covered an entire &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt;. This chantry may have also been the epicenter of the Snow Elf religion, having several rituals for initiates who sought out enlightenment.\nFollowing the regression of their race into the malevolent Falmer, many of the elven priests, known as &lt;a href=\"Prelates\"&gt;Prelates&lt;/a&gt;, were killed during Falmer raids. Subsequently, according to Gelebor, Auri-El \"evoked\" their spirits, allowing them to continue their work in Tamriel as \"spectral Prelates\" at the &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the rituals of the Snow Elves required the initiates to visit each of these wayshrines on their paths to enlightenment.\nIt appears that these 'spectral Prelates' are unaware of the disrepair of the chantry and will not respond to anyone, unless that person is on the path of the initiate, and possesses the &lt;a href=\"Initiate%27s%20Ewer\"&gt;Initiate's Ewer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to Knight Paladin Gelebor, they worshiped the following gods:\nMorphology.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, two living Snow Elves were encountered in the Forgotten Vale; &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;, as well as five 'spectral Prelates,' none of whom are female.\nTheir appearance is very similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elves\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of their skin and their hair, which is white. As the Chantry did not enter disrepair until after the fall of the Snow Elves, it is unknown how long Snow Elves live. As Gelebor stated, the Chantry was in disrepair long before he arrived. Thus his age cannot be fully determined.\nLifespan.\nSimilarly to their cousins, the High Elves, they have a rather extensive lifespan. Attesting to this, the report that Arch-Curate Vyrthur brought about the prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, that, much later became the obsession of &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt;. There is also the fact that Gelebor and Vyrthur were alive before the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; mentioned not knowing about the \"Empire\", she was, thus, imprisoned before &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; became the seat of an empire.\nFrom what is known, Gelebor and Vyrthur are at least over 1,000 years old, though it is implied they have been alive since at least the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the fact that the Snow Elves worshiped the god &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt; and are very similar to the Altmer, in comparison to the other races, it is, also possible that Gelebor had his life extended directly from Auri-El.\nReturn.\nThere is speculation that the Falmer will eventually become a surface-dwelling race once again. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the Falmer remained dormant, keeping quiet within the Dwarven Ruins for centuries to come. By &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; however, there are reports of increasing organized surface raids from the Falmer; attacking cattle and crops, abducting civilians, and killing travelers and explorers who would venture too close to their dwelling. There have also been cases where they have broken through underground tunnels into habitations and decimated those that lived therein.\nReports from &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20ruin\"&gt;Dwemer ruin&lt;/a&gt; explorations reveal that the &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;automated guardians&lt;/a&gt; that the Dwemer left behind are keeping the Falmer from escaping the depths of the ruins, causing them to resort to digging tunnels and find other exits.\nDuring the events in , the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, while seeking &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, meets two living snow elves. The first one, Knight-Paladin Gelebor, who owns the bow, believes that his &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt;, the other living Snow Elf, has been corrupted by the Falmer. Gelebor proposes to relinquish Auriel's Bow if the Dragonborn defeats his brother and ends his reign of terror.\nGelebor also mentions that the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; are becoming more intelligent, and if a line of communication could be established, relations may improve. Furthermore, Gelebor hopes that the Falmer will one day end their ways of hatred, and even begin to worship Auri-El like the Snow Elves once did."}

After pouring the water within the basin of the Chantry they would be granted an audience with the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch Curate himself&lt;/a&gt;. Following a massacre by the blinded Falmer most of the worshippers and prelates were killed. A group of Knight-Paladins were led against the assault but quickly defeated. The last known Snow Elf survivor to continue to worship Auri-El is &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt;, though the prelates of the chantry in death also worship him.\nAuri-El was believed by Snow Elves to protect his Arch-Curate from being infected with &lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, but because &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt; was infected by the disease it is unknown why he didn't protect him. The Arch-Curate believed that Auri-El turned his back on him, possibly meaning that Auri-El did not care for him. This also resulted in the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; prophecy which would allow his influence on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; to be limited.\n&lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El's&lt;/a&gt; Knight).\nTrinimac was considered to be the greatest knight of Auri-El and protected the ancient &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; from the armies of Men. Following his battle with &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; he was defeated. What remained of him turned into &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt; (Warlock's God).\nAn Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Forest).\nJephre is the god of the forest. He is popularly worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhynaster was one of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; to known to have become a god. He created the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Phynaster\"&gt;Ring of Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was a much respected and loved ruler by his people but was killed in battle against the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;ancient Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of the Moesring.\nTowards the end of the Merethic Era, the Snow Elves had been hunted to near extinction by the invading armies of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mereth\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; had already been purged of Snow Elves, so the ancient Nords turned their attention to Solstheim where a great number of skirmishes were said to have taken place.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be the final stand between the Nord and Snow Elf armies. Initially, the ancient Nords cut great swaths through the enemy ranks with their superior weapons, and it was said that the slopes of the Moesring \"ran red with Elf blood\"\nThe tide turned when during the battle, The Snow Prince rode in on a \"brilliant steed of pallid white.\" It was said that &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20the%20Snow%20Prince\"&gt;his spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Steel%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; bore the radiant glow of unknown magicka. The Snow Prince inspired great hope and inspiration to the last remaining army of Snow Elves.\nThe Snow Prince fought fiercely and seemed to control the ice and snow itself. Several of the mightiest Nord warriors fell before him and the tide of battle had begun to turn. Unexpectedly, a twelve-year-old girl named &lt;a href=\"Finna%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Finna&lt;/a&gt; watched as the Snow Prince killed &lt;a href=\"Jofrior\"&gt;her mother&lt;/a&gt;. In her rage, she screamed and threw her mother's sword at the Prince, which struck him in the breast and killed him.\nHis death shattered the spirit of the remaining Snow Elf warriors. Many fled, seeking refuge from the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, and those that remained on the battlefield were killed. News of his death spread across the land, reaching even the isolated and scattered tribes of Snow Elves across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nIt was Nordic tradition to burn the corpses of their foes, however it was decided that the Snow Prince, who was so loved by his kin, deserved better. Instead the Nordic chieftains honored him as a great warrior by having his body wrapped in fine silks and buried in a freshly dug barrow that later became known as &lt;a href=\"Jolgeirr%20Barrow\"&gt;Jolgeirr Barrow&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Steel%20Armor\"&gt;gleaming armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20the%20Snow%20Prince\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt; were presented on a pedestal of honor, and the tomb was arrayed with treasures worthy of royalty. He was not offered the protection of &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Stalhrim\"&gt;Stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; however, as it was reserved for Nord dead alone.\nShortly after the Snow Prince's tomb was sealed, grave robbers attempted to break in. The Nords respected their fallen enemy, so they defended Jolgeirr Barrow. Soon the location of the tomb became lost altogether. Early in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, a group of bandits rediscovered the Jolgeirr Barrow. They broke in and tried to steal the Snow Prince's famous armor, but only managed to take the helmet, leaving behind the rest of the armor, the spear and the Snow Prince's remains."}

In the tunnel, there will be no enemies, just a number of the King's soldiers. Head through and you will find &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; on the other side. Thane Mera is here. \nSpeak with Mera and she will tell you that she doesn't think the King's troops will be there in time before our scouts are found out, but that she has a plan to distract the enemy for long enough. She will ask you to light a few of the Orcthane's carts on fire to cause a panic among his soldiers, and then to light the signal fire. She also says that you'll need to reach Fildgor himself and slow him down, so that the troops can make it in time. \nThe stockpile carts are in various places in the enemy camp. the closest to you will probably be the weapons stockpile; just head to the camp and then up a stairs. it shouldn't be hard to reach, though there are enemies on the way. The food stockpile is to the southeast of there, with again a few waves of enemies before it. Finally, the mead stockpile is to the north of the food stockpile, up the stairs to the right. \nYour next task is to light the signal fire, directly west of the mead stockpile. When you've done this, enter the tomb. Here, you'll run into the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her, and she will tell you that Fildgor has forced his way into Sovngarde to steal her essence. She thinks the troops will be too late and that you're the only one who can reach Fildgor in time to stop this. She begs you to stop him before he succeeds in merging his essence with hers and getting the crown of queen Freydis to accept him as High King. \nAt this point, the quest is complete."}

Snowhawk was originally one of the eight major cities in Skyrim, but had lost power. Fort Snowhawk would eventually serve as the military bulwark for &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nFort Snowhawk is located west of the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;, which is the capital of Hjaalmarch. The layout of Snowhawk city is largely unknown. As time went on, Snowhawk devolved into a rundown fortress. Fort Snowhawk sports the typical layout of a regional bulwark, thought the central keep is in the middle of the fort, as opposed to the wall. The northern tower in Snowhawk leads to the prison, which connects to the keep through a bridge. Fort Snowhawk is also situated on the main road between Morthal and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and also where the &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;Drajkmyr Marsh&lt;/a&gt; meets the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt; Forest. The western wall holds both the stables and the smithy. Some of the stone walls had fallen into disrepair, prompting the freeloaders in the Fort to building wooden walls, which are not as sturdy.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Snowhawk in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Snowhawk was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Tarben\"&gt;King Tarben&lt;/a&gt;. It was around this time, a small settlement was located in the outskirts of Snowhawk.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress of Snowhawk was occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s of the region, losing the significance it once had before the war. In response to the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; had begun to take arms, garnering help throughout &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The Legion retook Fort Snowhawk from the local Necromancers, using it as a bulwark against the Stormcloaks from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. At one point or the other, Fort Snowhawk was occupied by the Stormcloaks when they advanced into Hjaalmarch. It is unknown how long they garnered control but regardless, Fort Amol has generally been territory under the Imperial Legion of West Skyrim. Fort Snowhawk was the center of militaristic control in Hjaalmarch Hold."}

Laurel is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Stonelore%20Druids\"&gt;Stonelore Druids&lt;/a&gt;, and also a historian investigating the past of her people, the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20Galen\"&gt;Druids of Galen&lt;/a&gt;. She and her friend &lt;a href=\"Dhulef\"&gt;Dhulef&lt;/a&gt; were investigating the movements of her people after they left &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Her friend is currently in the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Crypt%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Ebon Crypt&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, investigating a meeting that the &lt;a href=\"Kasorayn\"&gt;Druid King&lt;/a&gt; had with the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyrd\"&gt;Beldama Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;. However, their research has attracted the attention of a hostile group of druids, the &lt;a href=\"Firesong\"&gt;Firesong&lt;/a&gt;. These Firesong have apparently committed some atrocity at the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Root%20Enclave\"&gt;Earthen Root Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, so Laurel is worried for her friend's safety and will ask you to head over there with her. \nThe Ebon Crypt is located west of &lt;a href=\"Cath%20Bedraud\"&gt;Cath Bedraud&lt;/a&gt;. Meet up with Laurel and head inside. Dhulef will be in the eastern room. You will find him safe and sound, investigating an ancient tablet. Speak with him and he will tell you that the tablet contains the symbol of the Druid King, as well as three other symbols he does not understand. He will ask you to bring it to &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Tola\"&gt;Wyress Tola&lt;/a&gt; at the Beldama Wyrd Camp, on the coast west of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrd%20Tree\"&gt;Wyrd Tree&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen you arrive at the Wyrd Camp, you will discover that they have been attacked by the Firesong. Talk to &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Joslin\"&gt;Wyress Joslin&lt;/a&gt; and she will tell you that the Firesong were led by someone called &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%20Michiel\"&gt;Archdruid Michiel&lt;/a&gt;; he wanted Wyress Tola to open the Druid King's ritual site. She refused, so they attacked and kidnapped her. Wyress Joslin does not know where they went, but will suggest searching the camps the Firesong set up throughout Glenumbra for more information. If asked about the tablet, Joslin will identify two of the symbols as representing nature and the Beldama Wyrd, but will not recognise the other two.\nLaurel will stay behind at the Wyrd Camp, but Dhulef will come with you to the Firesong camps. There are three camps you need to investigate. One is to your southeast, near &lt;a href=\"Shrieking%20Scar\"&gt;Shrieking Scar&lt;/a&gt;. You will not find the Wyress here, but you will find &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%20Michiel%27s%20Orders\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; about the Firesong wanting to open the hidden paths and gain control of the &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Spirit\"&gt;Nature Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Seeds\"&gt;Sacred Seeds&lt;/a&gt;. Dhulef will comment that they were after the &lt;a href=\"Stonelore%20seed\"&gt;Stonelore seed&lt;/a&gt; at Earthen Root Enclave, but will fail to see the connection with the Druid King. The second Firesong camp is east of the Wyrd Tree; north of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrd%20Tree%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Wyrd Tree Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. This encampment is in a cave; you will find a map of Eastern Glenumbra here, with the area around the &lt;a href=\"Hag%20Fen\"&gt;Hag Fen&lt;/a&gt; encircled. The third camp will be northwest of &lt;a href=\"Westtry%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Westtry&lt;/a&gt; and east of &lt;a href=\"Seaview%20Point\"&gt;Seaview Point&lt;/a&gt;. Here, you will find a Wyrd Totem with the word \"Frii\" inscribed in it. \nOnce you have searched all the camps, head back to the Wyrd Camp and speak with Druid Laurel. She will also not understand why the Firesong are trying to obtain a nature spirit from the mainland, but when asked will tell you that the Sacred Seeds are part of some prophecy; they were given to each of the three druid circles to guard until a time when they would be needed. Once you are done talking, Wyress Joslin will tell you that there is a cave in the area marked on the map, but that the wyresses never go there because they believe it to be haunted. Dhulef will then tell you to head over there. \nThe location you are looking for is not actually near the Hag Fen, but rather it is just east of &lt;a href=\"The%20Lover%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Lover&lt;/a&gt; stone, northeast of &lt;a href=\"Trapjaw%27s%20Cove\"&gt;Trapjaw's Cove&lt;/a&gt;. Head there and enter &lt;a href=\"Eimhir%27s%20Cavern\"&gt;Eimhir's Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. You will come across several Firesong enemies while navigating this cave. At the other end, you will reach an open area, where you will hear a conversation between Wyress Tola and Archdruid Miciel; she will express her displeasure with what they are doing. Head down the path to their location. You will be too late to stop the Firesong's ritual, but you will be in time to save Tola's life. Speak with her and she will tell you more about what is going on. The symbols on the tablet represent the Druid King, the Beldama Wyrd and the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Wyrd%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenmoril Wyrd&lt;/a&gt;, with the one in the center representing the nature spirit. Long ago, the Druid King and the wyrds consecrated a nature spirit in three ritual sites. The Firesong seek to undo this ritual by desecrating the ritual sites; they have succeeded here and are now looking to do the same to a second site in &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpeak with Druid Laurel on what to do next. She will tell you that you need to meet with the witches of the Glenmoril Wyrd. Wyress Tola will help you by creating a portal to Bangkorai. Head through and proceed to the southeast; the location you are looking for is southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Evermore%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Eastern Evermore Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. When you arrive, you will find the wyresses distrustful of your group due to a recent attack from the Firesong Druids. Speak with &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Matilde\"&gt;Wyress Matilde&lt;/a&gt; and she will tell you that the Firesong have kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Sorcha\"&gt;Wyress Sorcha&lt;/a&gt; and taken her to a ritual site hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Road\"&gt;Sunken Road&lt;/a&gt;. She will also tell you that &lt;a href=\"Frii\"&gt;Frii&lt;/a&gt; is the name of the ancient spirit that was consecrated long ago.\nHead to the Sunken Road, west of the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Grotto\"&gt;Fallen Grotto&lt;/a&gt;, and enter the dungeon. The entrance to the ancient ritual site will be located in the southern room. Atop the staircase in said room, you will find the dead body of Wyress Sorcha; Druid Laurel will vow to avenge her death. Head into the ritual site and look for Archdruid Michiel. You will find him in the clearing at the end of this long hallway. Kill him, but beware that his power exceeds that of most of the game's bosses, though it is not quite on the same level as the world bosses. He may also occasionally summon a pair of &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Ursauk\"&gt;Primal Ursauk&lt;/a&gt;s to come to his aid. Once Miciel lies dead, Druid Laurel will ask you to help her free the nature spirit. There is a purple flower pod in the southwest side of the room; open it and talk to Frii. They will tell you that the wyrds and the ancient king summoned them for a reason, but that they do not remember what that reason was. \nSpeak with Druid Laurel and she will tell you that she is going to consult with her tribe's elders on what all of this means, but that you should first deliver the news of Wyress Sorcha's death to the Glenmoril Wyrd. Dhulef will open a portal there; head through and speak with Laurel in the camp. She will tell you that she will take Frii to her people on the island of &lt;a href=\"Galen\"&gt;Galen&lt;/a&gt;, to keep them safe from the Firesong and help them remember their purpose. This will finish the quest."}

He is best known for being a pioneer of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIt is said that Azra Nightwielder was among the greatest mages known by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first to discover the nature of shadows, and developed a new type of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; later known as Shadow Magic. Because of the power of Shadow Magic, Azra was an enemy of those seeking to misuse it. His progress in studying shadows became greater than ever, and at some point during the Third Era Azra attempted to do the seemingly impossible \u2014 to meld all his existences in shadow and strengthen himself through the use of Shadow Magic. As a result of the power he could wield, he was feared by others. Ignorant &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, who were opponents of magic and its practice in general, surrounded Azra in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; in attempt to thwart the shadowmage's plans. During that battle, something has gone awry and Azra lost control of his magic. Overwhelmed, he had to blast a hole in the ground and disappear. After the battle, a village grew around the hole. It was named &lt;a href=\"Azra%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Azra's Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in memory of the events that took place there. Many other shadowmages, like Pergan Asuul and &lt;a href=\"Skelos%20Undriel\"&gt;Skelos Undriel&lt;/a&gt;, strove to take Azra Nightwielder's place since his disappearance.\nInteractions.\nAzra Nightwielder appears in , where the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Azra%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; encounters him inside a giant crystal in Fearfrost Caverns. He seemed to have lost his memory, and thus unable to recall his name. Luckily, he hasn't lost his power, and, with hero's help, &lt;a href=\"Mage%27s%20Identity\"&gt;restores his identity&lt;/a&gt;. The hero is then rewarded with the knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Star%20Teeth\"&gt;Star Teeth&lt;/a&gt;, magical crystals needed to defeat Umbra' Keth, the Shadow of Conflict.\nAzra is later encountered the last time after the final battle between the hero and the Shadow of Conflict, congratulating the hero on the victory over Umbra' Keth and disappearing. He hasn't been seen since that moment, and his fate after the events of \"Shadowkey\" is unknown.\nStaff Enchanter.\nIt is less well known that Azra Nightwielder was also a pioneer in the field of enchanting staffs. Despite the fact that his techniques are considered rudimentary by standards of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, he is still viewed as a genius in the field. Numerous staffs that once belonged to Azra Nightwielder himself can be found in various locations throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt;, the wizard of Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, is a collector of magical staffs enchanted by Azra Nightwielder, and claims that Azra's staffs have a sentimental value for him, and that every staff that Neloth has uncovered has led him to greater understanding.\n&lt;a href=\"Azra%27s%20Staffs\"&gt;Azra's Staffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nStaves of Azra Nightwielder's making are involved in this quest in ."}

Her sphere is the period of transition and change, as seen in the constant twilight of her realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; has been referred to as her sister, though it is unknown if this is in the literal or metaphorical sense. She is known to be one of the more merciful and benevolent Lords, though her wrath is swift and painful when brought about. She oversees the &lt;a href=\"Planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Daedric Realm&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful world of blurred colors streaming together, cities of silver, and air like perfume.

Azura can be summoned on the 21st of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;, or during the times of dawn or dusk at her shrine in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearances.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; hears Azura during a 'dream' at the introduction of .

This holiday is revered by the Dunmeri, who invoke her for guidance and support. If thunderstorms strike during Hogithum, Azura must not be invoked, as these are the nights of the Madgod, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAzura is known to be one of the three Good Daedra in Morrowind, along with &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. They were worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; prior to the apotheosis of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and their becoming the Dunmer. The Tribunal recognizes them as the anticipations of themselves, Azura being the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. She taught the Chimer the ways to be different from the Altmer.\nRelationship with the Dwemer.\nAzura may have harbored a hatred for the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; race before they gained access to the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, following a possible event where she was tricked by a Dwemer into showing she was not omniscient.\nNerevar.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar's&lt;/a&gt; defeat of the Dwemer, he summoned Azura to ask what to do with &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's tools&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;. She told him how to separate the power of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s Heart from the Dwemer, and, in doing so, Nerevar caused the Dwemer to all simply disappear. However, there are many controversies surrounding this, such as the belief that the Dwemer caused their own disappearance. Azura then instructed Nerevar and the Tribunal to never use the Heart's power for themselves. However, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; did just that and became like gods, killing Nerevar in order to do so unopposed. As punishment, Azura cursed the golden-skinned Chimer to become the ash-skinned, red-eyed Dunmer. She then prophesied that Nerevar's &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; would end the Tribunals' godhood. This prophecy became known as the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nDuring the third era, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; released an unknown prisoner, born of uncertain parents, to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, an island in northern Morrowind, believing that the prisoner may have been the Nerevarine, the reincarnation of Nerevar. Azura somehow blessed the prisoner and guided them along the way to their destiny. After being named Nerevarine by the four &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashland&lt;/a&gt; tribes and &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; by the three great houses, and with Vivec's help, the Nerevarine destroyed the resurfacing &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, who planned to create and animate the giant golem, &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;. In the process, the Nerevarine destroyed the Heart of Lorkhan, severing the Tribunal from their source of godhood, making them merely very powerful mortals, finally fulfilling Azura's prophecy.\nFourth Era.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; following the eruption of the Red Mountain, a new religious movement for the Dunmer people arose, dubbed the \"Reclamations\". This new doctrine declared the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of their previously named Anticipations as the objects for worship. These Reclamations included Azura, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, who were \"reclaiming their status from the Tribunal.\"\nAzura and the Khajiit.\nThe Khajiit also worship Azura, spelled Azurah in Khajiit mythology. According to their legends, Azurah was one of the many children of &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Fadomai&lt;/a&gt;, and the only of her children who did not abandon her as she neared death. Fadomai gave Azurah three secrets as a reward for her loyalty, telling her to choose one of the children of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;i, the mortal races, and change them and name them Khajiit. The Khajiit were given the three gifts: to be the most beautiful, clever, and fastest creatures in the world; to be the best climbers in the world, and to be the best deceivers in the world.\nCreation of the Khajiit.\nAzurah waited as Nirni gave birth, and as &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; created a place for them to live. Nirni saw many of her children die and many fled to the stars, and of the rest, Nirni was most sad for the forest people (presumably, the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;), whom she felt had not found their place. Azurah came forth and changed some of the Bosmer into the various forms of the Khajiit, and bound their birth and growth to the moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nMorrowind.\nThe main quest of is entirely instigated by Azura, she is heard during the introduction, provides the Nerevarine with guidance and later more help. Finally appears again at the conclusion of the main questline, as Azura's Spirit, offering the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Azura\"&gt;Ring of Azura&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring \"Azura's Quest,\" the Nerevarine will acquire &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion.\nAzura has a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil, located in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the north of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. In her quest, she sends the Hero to a nearby mine where some of her worshippers have locked themselves inside. The worshippers had been turned into vampires, and Azura requests that the Hero put them out of their misery. As with most of Azura's quests, the Hero receives &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; as a reward.\nSkyrim.\nUpon locating the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn may speak with &lt;a href=\"Aranea%20Ienith\"&gt;Aranea Ienith&lt;/a&gt;, the last priestess of Azura in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Before coming to Skyrim, her people were cultists in Morrowind. Azura sent them visions of the eruption of the Red Mountain and they fled to Skyrim to rebuild their shrine. Sometime after Aranea became a priestess, Azura's Star was stolen by &lt;a href=\"Malyn%20Varen\"&gt;Malyn Varen&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; who wished to exploit the artifact in order to preserve his soul immortally within. The Dragonborn may agree to seek the star and recover it at &lt;a href=\"Ilinalta%27s%20Deep\"&gt;Ilinalta's Deep&lt;/a&gt;. They may choose to take it to &lt;a href=\"Nelacar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nelacar&lt;/a&gt;, who will turn the star black, or bring the star back to Azura, who will purge it of Varen's spirit and cleanse it. If she is given the artifact, she will dub the Dragonborn her champion.\nOnline.\nAzura appears in a number of side quests in , as well as the main quest of ."}

The whole takes up the eastern coast of Vvardenfell, which stretches to the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Grazelands\"&gt;Grazelands&lt;/a&gt; and near the city of &lt;a href=\"Firewatch\"&gt;Firewatch&lt;/a&gt; on the mainland. The region consists of several small islands with one or two settlements occupying them, this is evident with towns such as &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Branora\"&gt;Tel Branora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, that make up a large portion of the land. The region is critical for trade, not only are there several &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; settlements along the coast, but there are mainland colonies across the sea such as Firewatch and &lt;a href=\"Velothis%20Haven\"&gt;Velothis Haven&lt;/a&gt;. There are small coves and grottoes located along the coast, that house all sorts of creatures ranging from &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bull%20Netch\"&gt;Bull Netch&lt;/a&gt;s, and sometimes run away &lt;a href=\"Slaves\"&gt;Slaves&lt;/a&gt; from the Telvanni settlements. The city of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest settlement in the area and is where most of Telvanni's influence comes from within the District of Vvardenfell.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the Great House Telvanni governed the region from the city of Sadrith Mora. Telvanni, along with &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, was not a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; and because of this, they still kept &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slaves in their strongholds, despite Argonian Soldiers in the Pact. The leader of Telvanni was &lt;a href=\"Archmagister%20Gothren\"&gt;Archmagister Gothren&lt;/a&gt;, who resided in &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;. Around this year, an &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slave was freed from slavery and rose through the ranks of House Telvanni. The slave girl, &lt;a href=\"Sun-in-Shadow\"&gt;Sun-in-Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and her ally, an Outlander named the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the separate Telvanni Towers and were given writs that earned Sun-in-Shadow her freedom. She was able to buy property near the town of &lt;a href=\"Vos\"&gt;Vos&lt;/a&gt;, for a new &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Telvanni tower&lt;/a&gt;. Although there were disagreements with the Council of Telvanni, people such as Gothren and &lt;a href=\"Ralasa%20Delvi\"&gt;Ralasa Delvi&lt;/a&gt; were strongly against this. She was eventually able to retain her role as an &lt;a href=\"Oathman\"&gt;Oathman&lt;/a&gt; of House Telvanni.\nAround this time, an &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Chodala\"&gt;Chodala&lt;/a&gt; stumbled upon the &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful device created by &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and proclaimed himself as the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. After escaping Ald'ruhn, he traveled to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kaushtarari\"&gt;Kaushtarari&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, to help him against the Ashlanders and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.

Azura's Coast was less affected by this new approach, the only established settlement made by the Empire was the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Wolverine%20Hall\"&gt;Wolverine Hall&lt;/a&gt;, located in Southern Sadrith Mora. Nothing else had changed throughout the coast, but it remained highly populated with the waves of seafarers and slavers coming from the sea. Telvanni Towers began to pop up beyond Azura's Coast such as &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Uvirith\"&gt;Tel Uvirith&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the Telvanni Councilmen that remained from the Second Era continued to rule their respective settlements, except for &lt;a href=\"Master%20Neloth\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced &lt;a href=\"Nelos%20Otheri\"&gt;Nelos Otheri&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of Sadrith Mora."}

He invented much and created many theorems and logic structures that bore his name. But much of the world still puzzled him, and nothing was a greater enigma to him that the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of his research, he came to the conclusion that many of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt; were entirely fabricated by man and mer.\nNothing, however, was a greater question to Nchylbar than the limits of divine power. Were the Greater Beings the masters of the entire world, or did the humbler creatures have the strength to forge their own destinies? As Nchylbar found himself nearing the end of his life, he felt he must understand this last basic truth.\nAmong the sage's acquaintances was a holy &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; priest named Athynic. When the priest was visiting Bthalag-Zturamz, Nchylbar told him what he intended to do to find the nature of divine power. Athynic was terrified and pleaded with his friend not to break this great mystery, but Nchylbar was resolute. Finally, the priest agreed to assist out of love for his friend, though he feared the results of this blasphemy.\nAthynic summoned &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. After the usual rituals by which the priest declared his faith in her powers and Azura agreed to do no harm to him, Nchylbar and a dozen of his students entered the summoning chamber, carrying with them a large box.\n\u201cAs we see you in our land, Azura, you are the Goddess of the Dusk and Dawn and all the mysteries therein,\u201d said Nchylbar, trying to appear as kindly and obsequious as he could be. \u201cIt is said that your knowledge is absolute.\u201d\n\u201cSo it is,\u201d smiled the Daedra.\n\u201cYou would know, for example, what is in this wooden box,\u201d said Nchylbar.\nAzura turned to Athynic, her brow furrowed. The priest was quick to explain, \u201cGoddess, this Dwemer is a very wise and respected man. Believe me, please, the intention is not to mock your greatness, but to demonstrate it to this scientist and to the rest of his skeptical race. I have tried to explain your power to him, but his philosophy is such that he must see it demonstrated.\u201d\n\u201cIf I am to demonstrate my might in a way to bring the Dwemer race to understanding, it might have been a more impressive feat you would have me do,\u201d growled Azura, and turned to look Nchylbar in the eyes. \u201cThere is a red-petalled flower in the box.\u201d\nNchylbar did not smile or frown. He simply opened the box and revealed to all that it was empty.\nWhen the students turned to look to Azura, she was gone. Only Athynic had seen the Goddess's expression before she vanished, and he could not speak, he was trembling so. A curse had fallen, he knew that truly, but even crueler was the knowledge of divine power that had been demonstrated. Nchylbar also looked pale, uncertain on his feet, but his face shone with not fear, but bliss. The smile of a Dwemer finding evidence for a truth only suspected.\nTwo of his students supported him, and two more supported the priest as they left the chamber.\n\u201cI have studied very much over the years, performed countless experiments, taught myself a thousand languages, and yet the skill that has taught me the finally truth is the one that I learned when I was but a poor, young man, trying only to have enough gold to eat,\u201d whispered the sage.\nAs he was escorted up the stairs to his bed, a red flower petal fell from the sleeve of his voluminous robe. Nchylbar died that night, a portrait of peace that comes from contented knowledge.\nPublisher's Note\nThis is another tale whose origin is unmistakably Dwemer. Again, the words of some &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;is translations are quite different, but the essence of the story is the same. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; have a similar tale about Nchylbar, but in the Dunmer version, Azura recognizes the trick and refuses to answer the question. She slays the Dwemer present for their skepticism and curses the Dunmer for blasphemy.\nIn the Aldmeris versions, Azura is tricked not by an empty box, but by a box containing a sphere which somehow becomes a flat square. Of course the Aldmeris versions, being a few steps closer to the original Dwemer, are much more difficult to understand. Perhaps this \"stage magic\" explanation was added by &lt;a href=\"Gor%20Felim\"&gt;Gor Felim&lt;/a&gt; because of Felim's own experience with such tricks in his plays when a mage was not available.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Marobar%20Sul\"&gt;Marobar Sul&lt;/a&gt;\" left even the character of Nchylbar alone, and he represents many \"Dwemer\" virtues. His skepticism, while not nearly as absolute as in the Aldmeris version, is celebrated even though it brings a curse upon the Dwemer and the unnamed House of the poor priest.\nWhatever the true nature of the Gods, and how right or wrong the Dwemer were about them, this tale might explain why the dwarves vanished from the face of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Though Nchylbar and his kind may not have intended to mock the Aedra and Daedra, their skepticism certainly offended the Divine Orders."}

He could not remember how it happened, but found he did not care either. It had been a life well-lived, whether he believed so or not, and all had been exactly as it was meant to be.\nHe could not remember his name. He was still &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, that much he knew. He felt his claws, and his whiskers, and his fur. He smelled salt and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe opened his eyes when he remembered having them, looking out at an endless sea. There were old things there, above and below. He saw he was not alone. Other spirits slowly drifted away from the shore. He thought better of calling out to them. The sand was warm between his toes and the sky was painted dusk.\nHe turned to look upon the island. There was a house there, one of glass and moonlight and truth. The smell of sugar was stronger in that direction, so he walked that way.\nThe sand shifted under his feet, never quite giving him sure-footing. When he tried to step up to what seemed to be stone, it crumbled beneath his foot. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed. He reached a stair and stepped on to it, but it was made of transparent glass. Even though it was sturdier than the sand, he found it difficult to trust each step. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed. He reached the door to the house of light, but he could not open it. He looked up to the sky and the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Lattice\"&gt;Lattice&lt;/a&gt;. He tried to remember the Motions, the secrets a Mother had taught him, but it was hard, and the Lattice kept shaking. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed.\nThe gates to the house opened and he walked inside. He knew She was there. He knew he would be struck blind if he looked upon Her, but he could not help it. He looked upon &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;, She Who Sits at the Precipice, and he saw Her. He was not blinded. She was lithe and tall, reclining on a cloudy bed of stars. She wore nothing, yet he could only see one of her faces. There her eyes shined like the &lt;a href=\"Moons\"&gt;Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"My child,\" Azurah said, and he remembered his name. \"You've come home.\"\n\"I have been here before,\" said the Khajiit.\n\"You have walked many paths,\" Azurah replied with a purr. A path of roses formed before his feet, leading up to her. \"All for me.\"\nHe stepped onto the path of roses. Thorns cut his feet. The closer he got to Azurah, the farther away she appeared to be. She rose higher and higher until he was climbing a wall of roses and his fur was matted with blood. Each time he reached the top of the wall and pulled himself over, he was standing at the start of the path again. Still he walked, and stumbled, and climbed.\nHe was in Her cupped hands then. Her face was the sky and Her eyes the Bright Moons. He lived there in sugary bliss for many lifetimes before his feet touched sand again.\nNow he was on the other side of the island. It was dark and cold. It was so dark that he could only see the water when it moved. If there were any spirits there, they were &lt;a href=\"Dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;one with the darkness&lt;/a&gt;. His tail twitched.\nHe turned and saw Azurah once again, smaller now to stand alongside him. She carried a Moon-Staff and wore a silken dress of purple and gold. She appeared not unlike a mortal. Beautiful and weary. She looked with him out into the darkness.\nThe Khajiit saw the sadness in Azurah's eyes. She had given him so much, he knew, and he had given so little in return. \"I am ready to walk again,\" he said at last. \"What would you have me do?\"\n\"I must send you into the dark, little one.\" There were tears in Her eyes, but She did not let them fall. \"You must make a path for me.\"\nHe looked back over the dark water, noticing just how much it moved. \"I will do anything you ask, Mother.\"\nAzurah smiled at that, and his heart was glad. She plucked the Moon from atop her staff and stepped toward him.\n\"I give to you my Moon,\" Azurah said, and She put Her lips to his forehead and kissed him. And as he took the Moon, it became a &lt;a href=\"Moonlight%20Blade\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Khajiit held the blade before him. It shined with Moonlight and he no longer feared the dark.\nAnd Azurah told him: \"Bring my children back.\""}

To this effect, she will give you a staff that will instantly roast any chicken you use it on, and will tell you to collect five of these roasted chickens. \nThe chickens can be found all throughout the area. Roast five of them, then return to Aniel. She will be at the tents southeast of the lake. She will give you your next task: you are to serve drinks to the visitors in this plane. Head over to the bar, and tap some beer from the keg.

She's invited me to a party she calls \"the greatest in all the worlds.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching &lt;a href=\"Thormar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thormar&lt;/a&gt;, you will run into an old Bosmer named Aniel. She will tell you that something called &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt;'s Boast is about to take place here, where groups of people play tricks on each other to earn a place at the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Fingers%20Dance\"&gt;Five Fingers Dance&lt;/a&gt; in Baan Dar's realm. She will offer to introduce you to the leaders of both teams, starting with the Khajiit leader Yanabir-ja. Yanabir-ja will be inside the ruins, in the west of the area. He will tell you that he plans to trick the Bosmer using illusions and alchemy. Once you've been introduced, head east of the river to meet the Bosmer leader Dolirdor. She will tell you that she intends to set critters loose in the Khajiiti camp.\nOnce you've been introduced to both, Aniel will ask to speak with you in private. Lead her away from Dolirdor, then talk to her. She will tell you that she would like to one-up both of the teams; turn their tricks into something even more funny. She wants you to poison stranglers and then harvest their stems, which will create a powerful hallicinatory effect when thrown in the Khajiiti campfire. She also wants you to collect the glands of the venomous snakes that roam the area and use them to trick the Bosmer into getting their base invaded by giant snakes. \nFirst, you need to collect an empty Rotmeth barrel and some dark poison from the Bosmer camp. The poison can be found in the west, the rotmeth barrel in the east. Your next job hereafter is to collect the Snake Glands; head outside and kill some snakes. Once you have three snake glands, it is time to poison some stranglers and then kill them for their stems. These objectives have to be done in this order; you cannot collect the stems before you collect the glands. Once you have collected three poisoned strangler stems, it is time to actually play the pranks. To play the brank on the Bosmer, place the barrel of Snake Glands on the offering platform in their camp. This will attract giant snakes to the camp. To prank the Khajiit, give Yanabir-ja the stems and tell him that they taste great when cooked. The khajiit will start to hallucinate now. \nOnce both camps have been pranked, follow Aniel to the altar in the east of the ruins and talk to her there. She will invite you to the Five Finger Dance, and open a portal to Baan Dar's realm. Head through and you will find yourself in a mansion; talk to Aniel outside to finish he quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar%27s%20Bash\"&gt;Baan Dar's Bash&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Baar Dau was held in place by the divine energy of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, then later by a device known as the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe source of Baar Dau is unknown, with a prevalent theory being that the Daedric Prince of Madness &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; propelled the rock towards &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, either because he grew bored and wished to observe the destruction caused on impact, or with the intent of destroying Vivec City as an act of revenge against the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; for its disrespect. \nThe fall of Baar Dau in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt; effectively marked the end of Tribunal worship, and the beginning of what would be later known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond Era.\nBaar Dau hurtled towards &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; sometime before &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, during the city's construction. It was stopped and held in place by Vivec's utilization of his divine energy. Vivec elected to keep Baar Dau above his city to inspire lasting faith among his followers.\nHowever, this divine energy of Vivec's was sharply diminished around &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the demigod to become deathly ill and subsequently caused the meteor to descend dangerously close to the city. During this state the meteor showered the city with fragments of itself, causing chaos and fatalities. After Vivec made a full recovery with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, Baar Dau was stabilized, and remained in its new position.\nThird Era.\nSometime after Baar Dau's relocation, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; mined away the interior of the meteor, creating a prison and thus establishing the Ministry of Truth. The prison could only be accessed by the use of levitation, and therefore was considered practically inescapable. Baar Dau continued to be used as a prison throughout the third era.\nShortly after the disappearance of Vivec during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Baar Dau, now widely known as the Ministry of Truth, became unstable. In fear of the imminent destruction of Vivec City, two &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; by the names of &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; made a pact with the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. The device known as the Ingenium was created, which utilized energy from Clavicus Vile's Oblivion realm to hold up Baar Dau. In exchange, souls of the dead, and then eventually the living, were sacrificed. To function, the ingenium was installed directly inside of the ministry.\nFourth Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt; Vuhon attempted to sacrifice Sul's wife, &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, to the ingenium. When Sul attempted to rescue her from the device, to the contest of Vuhon, the resulting struggle damaged the ingenium, causing it to explode and form a rift in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Sul and Vuhon were sucked into Clavicus Vile's realm while Ilzheven was left to die upon Baar Dau's impact.\nAccording to a later testimony by Sul, the original velocity of the meteor upon arrival to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; was restored when the ingenium was destroyed. The ministry crashed into &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, causing &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to erupt. Sometime later, after tidal waves, lava, and ash had deformed the land, &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and the crater that was once known as Vivec City became the Scathing Bay.\nSource.\nThe source of Baar Dau has been speculated by common citizens and revered writers, with legends ranging from &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s involvement to claims that the moonlet was actually the solidified excrement of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec's religious teachings paint the giant stone as an actual sentient being that hurled itself at Vivec City, while &lt;a href=\"The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Path%20%28Book%29\"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; states Sheogorath is to blame for hurling the rock. Doctrinal Inquisitors of the Tribunal Temple have refused to release an official statement relating to the source of Baar Dau, however."}

It's good solid stonework built to hold up the next time the Bretons and &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; decide they'd rather just kill us all and try to raze our home to the ground.\nEvery time I'm back home, everything I do just feels right. If you haven't been, then I'll say it like this: it's not &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nEveryone knows where everyone stands in Orsinium. The Bretons in Daggerfall always think I'm on my way to a battlefield. If I hear \"Are you a soldier?\" one more damn time, I'm gonna show them the heavy end of my hammer. If we act like beasts, it's because half the humans in that town talk to us like we're big dumb beasts.\nThe other half get really quiet when I'm around. I don't honestly think they fear me. They couldn't possibly think I'm there to kill them and eat their children. They should know I'm there to do business. I'm a blacksmith and a stonemason and I'm there to make some coin. Despite that, no one there is really honest about how they feel about Orcs.\nAs soon as I'm back in the heart of Wrothgar, walking between those solid stone walls, everything changes. It's honest there. Not like Daggerfall. There's no fawning or bowing or scraping or Breton poetry: when you talk to someone, they say what they mean.\nWhen you look at someone, and he's got a problem with you, you know it. And if I've got a problem with someone, I can punch him in the face without knowing someone's going to call the city guard down on me. We settle it. You know what I mean.\nDo you remember the last time you were in a little Orc stronghold? Do you remember the last time you talked to some chieftain with his fat ass on a throne and all his wives scurrying around him? A chief's first wife - every time, I swear, no matter where I go - she sizes me up from her first look. She's got to figure out which Orc traveler of merchant or crafter is going to be the one to bring down her husband and tear down everything she knows. She's a big &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; in a little muddy pond, circling you over and over again.\nYou don't get that in Orsinium. Ever. There's a whole school of slaughterfish baring their teeth at each other, so really, you don't have to worry about some scheming chieftain's wife. Everyone who hates you shows it. You know it.\nAnd the food. Damn! The food! Noone in Daggerfall knows how to butcher an animal properly. Maybe their cooks just hate doing it. The farther you travel from Orsinium, the worse it gets: humans overcook their food, so it lacks that savory flavor you get from juice and blood. And nothing crunches properly.\u00a0 You know how it goes.\nDon't get me wrong. I make a lot of money in Daggerfall, but Orsinium is a real city. It's as honest as a stone wall, it's as brutal as a hailstorm, and no matter what they burn or bash or smash, it will never ever really die.\n&lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; is home. It's always good to be back."}

He can be found at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sutch\"&gt;Fort Sutch&lt;/a&gt; and guarded by his henchmen.\nBackground.\nRoderick is terminally ill and kept alive only by daily medicine administered to his unconscious body. The Hero will receive &lt;a href=\"The%20Deceiver%27s%20Finery\"&gt;The Deceiver's Finery&lt;/a&gt; as a bonus if they replace his medicine with a poison that &lt;a href=\"Ocheeva\"&gt;Ocheeva&lt;/a&gt; gives to them. Also, to receive the bonus, none of the henchmen must see them in the fort.\nWalkthrough.\nSpeak to &lt;a href=\"Teinaava\"&gt;Teinaava&lt;/a&gt; and they will learn of a secret entrance to the fort that is unprotected at Fort Sutch Abbey. The Hero may proceed from the Abbey sewers to the fort, or enter the fort directly with a possibly higher detection rate with the latter. The fort is very dark and is relatively easy to sneak through undetected. Most doors can be picked, but some require a key. This can be taken from a mercenary, either through killing them, or pickpocketing.\nIt is worth noting that mercenaries can be killed while still not losing the bonus, so long as they do not detect them before dying. The easiest way to achieve this is to sneak-attack them and kill them instantly.\nIf the Hero's &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill is high enough, or if they have good &lt;a href=\"chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chameleon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted armor&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href=\"M%27raaj-Dar\"&gt;M'raaj-Dar&lt;/a&gt; of the Dark Brotherhood sells an invisibility spell and a chameleon spell for a relatively low price) they can easily slip in and out without forfeiting the bonus. If using invisibility &lt;a href=\"spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, simply take a handful of restore magicka potions and use them to stay invisible.\nThe cabinet that Roderick's medicine is kept in is in the back left part of the fort. Take the medicine from the cabinet and replace it with the poison that Ocheeva provides (the poison is located under misc, not potions). If the Hero was detected already or do not care to receive the bonus, simply approach Roderick's body near the cabinet and kill him through whatever means desired.\nRoderick is laying on a slab, but be warned there will most likely be a guard standing right next to him, but he is facing the other way, so it is easy enough to simply sneak up to Roderick and kill him.\nThe Hero does not have to take the medicine with them. They can just place it in any container (except for the cabinet) in the fort and it will still complete the quest.\nReturn to Ocheeva for the reward and if one likes, go back and get the poison where they put it.\nIf the Hero does not have the poison, they will have to kill Roderick themselves."}

Lycanthropy was created by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, and has remained a controversial subject in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Some lycanthropes view the condition as a gift from Hircine, while others see it as a curse that they wish to rid themselves of. There are eight recorded variations of lycanthropes on Tamriel.\nTypes of lycanthropes.\nWerebears.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Werebear\"&gt;Werebear&lt;/a&gt; is believed to exist in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, supposedly as the most common type of lycanthrope in the province, although they also appear on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. This could potentially be due to the fact that Solstheim is in close proximity to Skyrim, and a population of werebears could have migrated there.\nWerewolves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; is the only lycanthrope known to be found everywhere in Tamriel. They are confirmed to have a connection with Hircine, and are often described as his hounds. Werewolves are arguably the most well-known lycanthrope on Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt;, an elite group of warriors within &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt;, is comprised of werewolves. Lycanthropy is passed down to new members through a blood ritual upon their admittance into the Circle.\nWerecrocodiles.\n&lt;a href=\"Werecrocodile\"&gt;Werecrocodile&lt;/a&gt;s exist in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Only &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; are known to transform into werecrocodiles. Werecrocodiles have yet to appear in any game in the series.\nWerelions.\n&lt;a href=\"Werelion\"&gt;Werelion&lt;/a&gt;s have been found in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and in certain regions of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. While they are said to be quite common, they have yet to appear in any game.\nWerevultures.\n&lt;a href=\"Werevulture\"&gt;Werevulture&lt;/a&gt;s supposedly exist in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, although they are said to be quite rare. They have yet to appear in any game.\nWereboars.\n&lt;a href=\"Wereboar\"&gt;Wereboar&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in both\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and are one of the more common varieties of lycanthrope.\nWeresharks.\n&lt;a href=\"Wereshark\"&gt;Wereshark&lt;/a&gt;s are believed to roam the oceans around Tamriel. Their existence has never been confirmed, and the only evidence to support their existence are rumors across Tamriel.\nWerebats.\n&lt;a href=\"Werebat\"&gt;Werebat&lt;/a&gt;s sometimes serve as guardians to &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; clans, and are commonly found in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;."}

Can my &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; and sorcery harrow one of her kind? By design, the &lt;a href=\"harrowstorms\"&gt;harrowstorms&lt;/a&gt; are not meant to affect our &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;lycanthrope&lt;/a&gt; brothers and sisters, but in the centuries since the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt; last set out to conquer, the breeds of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; and werewolves have become a diaspora, promulgated across the world. Not all of them have the sense to bow before the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Lord\"&gt;Ashen Lord&lt;/a&gt;, including the prisoners Ulfra captured today.\nShe could have easily ripped these lesser creatures apart for their defiance, but instead she delivered them to me for a more methodical dissection. There's a hunter's cunning hiding in that bestial skull.\nThe prisoners respect a pack hierarchy. An affectation of the origin of their curse, no doubt. By holding their leader, &lt;a href=\"Edjar\"&gt;Edjar&lt;/a&gt;, hostage, the others remain compliant. By offering a slim mercy to the other werewolves, Edjar assumes the role of willing test subject. They are dreadfully simple creatures, after all.\nThe incredible constitution of the werewolf, even in its human shape, creates one of many obstacles I must overcome to complete my study. The &lt;a href=\"netherroot\"&gt;netherroot&lt;/a&gt; seemingly has no effect on the subject, even in its concentrated form. Weakening the grip of the body on the soul will be the first step toward delivering it to the desired destination.\nI should have thought of it sooner. The creature's connection to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is something I can leverage, even if it is tied to a different realm within that great expanse. That connection can help bridge the gap between &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and what lies beyond, and the werewolf's lifeblood can imbue the netherroot with a vigor that our undeath simply cannot duplicate.\nIt's working. With each new refinement of the blood distillate, the netherroot brew grows stronger and more toxic. The werewolf shows greater signs of affliction with every injection. The only question that remains is whether or not its soul can be successfully exchanged when it inevitably succumbs to the ritual."}

I had studied &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt; for some time, and was keen to see if these rumors of &lt;a href=\"Werebear%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;werebears&lt;/a&gt; were actually substantiated. I elected to pursue these studies in the warmer summer months in deference to my fragile constitution.\nOne quickly finds that common villagers are of practically no use in this land. Whereas in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, even the youngest child can tell you the true fauna that inhabit its environs, here I find alleged \"wise men\" recounting tales of unicorns and flying &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt; directly alongside their stories of werebears, so I don't put any stock in the rumors. They certainly have their traditions for warding off werebears (certain &lt;a href=\"plant\"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt;s and ceremonies), but nobody can attest to even having seen one first-hand, much less possess any sort of &lt;a href=\"Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone has a cousin or a friend who saw one once, but when pressed, these stories fall apart.\nI don't wish to completely discount these stories, but I also must conclude that they may have spun out of some wild retelling of a particularly vicious, but mundane, bear. Legends can take a life of their own, particularly when there are grains of truth, as here we have the very real threat of werewolves. I worry that by spreading stories of a potentially false (or at least rare) beast, people may begin to discount the threat that real beasts pose. But if Skyrim's people choose to lead a backwards life, shrieking at shadows and clouds, I will not stop them.\nThe werewolves of this land are a curious sort. At least the legends of them. Given the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; flair for bravado, I had expected to see werewolf pelts lining walls in the cities, werewolf heads on pikes, that sort of gaudy show. Instead, few people in civilized society ever mentioned them, and my questions were usually met with nervous stares.\nThinking that perhaps the common folk were simply more cowardly than I had been lead to believe by my Nordic acquaintances in Cyrodiil, I sought out those known for actual bravery. The supposedly fearless warrior band of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt;, lost all color when I broached the subject, and asked me to leave. I had thought better of them, and was disappointed at how quickly brave men and women can be intimidated by stories.\nPressing into the wilderness, away from any sort of settlement, I would often find hunters, willing to recount stories of their kills. It was finally through one of them (a certain &lt;a href=\"Karsten%20Hammer-Back\"&gt;Karsten Hammer-Back&lt;/a&gt;) that I heard my first (and unfortunately only) verifiable stories of werewolves in the province, accompanied by pelts and claws to prove the killing. Just as I was thrilling to finding some actual evidence of the local beasts, he got a wild, conspiratorial look in his eyes and began spinning tales of some &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;band of werewolf hunters&lt;/a&gt; and their exploits in hunting down the creatures. I left him to mop his drool and continued my journeys.\nIn the end, I regret that my trip to Skyrim did not prove more productive. If it is indeed true that their breeds of lycanthropes are distinct from and more powerful than our local ones, they could prove to be powerful allies in our conflict against the influx of &lt;a href=\"werevulture\"&gt;werevulture&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. If they have grown as great and terrible as my friend &lt;a href=\"Gaelian\"&gt;Gaelian&lt;/a&gt; asserts, they could soon threaten the interior of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. When the summer next crests, I plan to travel there for a better accounting of the winged cretins, so that I may make more fitting report to the council."}

All &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; can contract Lycanthropy; however, &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; are somewhat resistant because of their &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; resistance to disease.\nLycanthropy itself was created by &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, who now serves as the guardian of the people infected with Lycanthropy. This disease gives the infected a bloodlust, meaning they must kill every time they transform. It is believed that a cure for this disease exists in the &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; foothills of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nA common misconception is that the form a person takes upon contracting Lycanthropy varies according to their species. Although a particular type of Lycanthropy is more common in a certain province, there is no evidence to suggest the type is solely based on the race of the afflicted.\nThese certain types of lycanthropy can be found mainly in their originating homelands. However, partial amounts of the creatures can be seen in neighboring provinces.\nTrivia.\n\"Because the werewolf is the most ubiquitous of lycanthropes, the term lycanthropy has been used since ancient days to describe the disease that transforms men into half-beast, although lycanthrope only strictly should refer to men who change into werewolves.\""}

Similar to &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, the infected party transforms into a lycanthropic &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;. Two types of lycanthropes transmit this disease: &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wereboar\"&gt;wereboar&lt;/a&gt;. The disease is spread through direct contact with afflicted creatures. Specifically, every successful hit from a werewolf or wereboar carries a 0.6% chance of infecting the player character. Disease immunity and resistance will not prevent infection\u2014only vampire characters are actually immune to lycanthropy.\nEffects of Lycanthropy.\nThe disease of lycanthropy itself has no initial physical effect, but the player will experience a strange dream the first time they sleep for any duration after becoming infected. During the 72-hour incubation period, the disease can be cured by the typical means\u2014potions or spells of cure disease, or by temples. After this period, however, the transformation is complete and the disease can no longer be cured in this way.\nOnce the initial disease has run its course, the lycanthrope acquires several new abilities. First, they will receive an increase to many attributes and skills. Specifically, Strength, Speed, Agility and Endurance attributes will all raise by 40 each (not to exceed 100), while Hand-to-Hand, Climbing, Running, Stealth, Swimming and Critical Strike will raise by 30 each (can exceed 100, but does not count toward skill increase requirements for gaining levels). They will also become immune to disease. These effects apply to both natural and beast forms.\nOnce a day, a lycanthrope can assume their beast form. They can revert to their natural form at will, with the exception of full moons, during which they are forced into their bestial form. Any transformation will restore the character to their maximum hitpoint level. While transformed, the player cannot access their inventory (and therefore cannot loot bodies or equip items) and no one will speak with him. He will also become immune to steel and iron weapons. Because humanoid enemies (including guards) will only use these weapons, even if their inventories contain something better, the transformed lycanthrope is immune to their weapon attacks. Hand-to-hand attacks and spells, however, are unaffected. Any crimes committed while in beast form will \"not\" be traced back to the lycanthrope's natural form. Their beast form is effectively a separate person.\nA lycanthrope must quench his thirst for blood by killing an innocent every fifteen days, or they will gradually suffer a reduction to their maximum &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;hitpoints&lt;/a&gt;, down to a minimum of 4. Unlike vampires, who can survive off the blood of animals and other living, \"non-innocent\" beings, lycanthropes must kill \"innocent\" people\u2014i.e., townspeople or guards. They may do so in either of their forms to satisfy this requirement, and their maximum hitpoints will immediately return to normal once they have.\nContracting Lycanthropy.\nAlthough lycanthropy is thought of as a disease, it is not affected by weaknesses and resistances like other in-game diseases; only vampires are truly immune to infection. When you are injured by a lycanthrope, there is a 0.6% chance that you will contract the disease. The only sign that you have been infected will occur the first time you rest after contracting the disease; a short scene will play while a voice says:\nYou dream of the moon, and of a man who is less than a man.\n72 hours after you have contracted the disease, you will turn permanently into a lycanthrope. Until then, the disease can be cured using a potion, spell, or temple healer."}

To gain access to this quest, they must be infected with &lt;a href=\"Sanies%20Lupinus\"&gt;Sanies Lupinus&lt;/a&gt; first.\nTo contract Sanies Lupinus, the Vestige can be infected by another player or by an enemy NPC.\nBy another player.\nThe easiest way is most likely getting infected by another player. If the Vestige does not have friends with the sickness, many guilds can offer the service for a cost. To infect someone else with Sanies Lupinus, the player must have the Passive Skill &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bloodmoon&lt;/a&gt;, from the Werewolf tree,\u00a0unlocked. The player that has this skill can only transmit the sickness once every seven days and players already infected with &lt;a href=\"Noxiphilic%20Sanguivoria%20%28Disease%29\"&gt;Noxiphilic Sanguivoria&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;) cannot be infected with Lycanthropy. Provided the players are not stopped by these conditions, the sickness can be transmitted in the Ritual Site of their alliance (shown to the already infected player as the option to activate a synergy). After being infected, the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Hircine's Gift&lt;/a&gt;\" will be added to the journal.\nBy an enemy NPC.\nEven though werewolves make several appearances throughout the game, not all of them can infect the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; with Sanies Lupinus. Only a certain variety of werewolves are able to transmit the sickness. These enemies are extremely rare and are known to spawn in the highest level territory for each alliance (&lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;), at night. These enemies can be really hard to find because of the previous conditions and also because of other players that constantly hunt them to acquire the sickness or to raise the price of it in the market. If the Vestige gets infected, the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Hircine's Gift&lt;/a&gt;\" will be added to their journal, asking them to travel to the Ritual Site.\nRitual Sites.\nThe Ritual Sites are very important places in the process of becoming a Werewolf. They are located in the highest level territory for each alliance: &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; (Werewolves that can infect the Vestige spawn in these same regions). They are the locations in which the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Hircine's Gift&lt;/a&gt;\" is achieved."}
{"id": "50210", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50210", "title": "Lycanthropy (Skyrim)", "text": "Lycanthropy is a &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; that can be received in . &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; are men and women who can transform into powerful, monstrous wolves once a day. Opinions on Lycanthropy vary among factions in Skyrim: some members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; see it as a blessing, a way of drawing out the strength and ferocity of their inner beast (though the &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; sees it as more of a curse that holds him back from entering &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; after death). On the contrary, the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; see it as a violation of nature. As of , werewolves have been incorporated into the wild as randomly encountered creatures.\nPhysical appearance.\nThe appearance of the werewolf in \"Skyrim\" is that of a large wolf-like humanoid creature with razor sharp claws and a set of large teeth. Unlike the more wolf-faced look of the werewolves, the werewolves of \"Skyrim\" have monstrous faces and muscular builds. Males are slightly taller than females. Their eyes in wolf form are yellow, while in human form the eyes of an NPC werewolf are silver. Werewolves in \"Skyrim\" have less fur than the \"Bloodmoon\" werewolves, their arms are longer and possess more strength.\nBecoming a werewolf.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; contracts Lycanthropy, they will have the ability to turn into a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to get this disease is by progressing through &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; questline. The process by which the Dragonborn becomes a werewolf is activated through the Magic menu, &lt;a href=\"Powers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Powers&lt;/a&gt; tab: &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Beast Form&lt;/a&gt;. This resembles a standard power in that it can be marked as a favorite and assigned a quick-change number as any other power, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLycanthropy is contracted as part of the blood ritual that occurs during the Companions quest, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;The Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\" The first transformation through this disease vector is particularly violent, allowing the Dragonborn to prowl outside &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; in bestial form; there are two exits, one to the city, and a one-way exit to the eastern environs. After the Dragonborn \"feeds\" or just waits, the screen blacks out, then the Dragonborn turns back to their original form, unclothed, and begins being questioned by &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn may also become a werewolf when wearing the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Ill%20Met%20by%20Moonlight\"&gt;Ill Met by Moonlight&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;. This is temporary and the Dragonborn does not contract lycanthropy.\nIn , if the Dragonborn is cured of Lycanthropy or becomes a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, they can talk to Aela and she can make them a werewolf again, canceling out vampirism. To become a Vampire Lord again, they need to ask Serana or Harkon (if sided with &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;the vampires&lt;/a&gt;). If sided with the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn must complete their quest line. Players can also go to &lt;a href=\"Redwater%20Den\"&gt;Redwater Den&lt;/a&gt; and interact with the Bloodspring.\nBloodlust.\nBloodlust is a feeding method used by lycanthropes. Player-controlled werewolves consume the flesh of corpses to extend the duration of their &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lycanthropic form&lt;/a&gt;. Each corpse extends the transformation an additional 30 seconds while also restoring &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;. If one chooses not to wait the minute or two one might have left, just wait a few hours.\nCuring Lycanthropy.\nConventional method.\nThe Dragonborn may cure themselves at any time by taking a &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witch%20Head\"&gt;Glenmoril Witch Head&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, activating the Flame of the Harbinger and defeating their beast spirit. Once Lycanthropy is cured in this way, the Dragonborn cannot contract Lycanthropy again, nor do they have access to &lt;a href=\"The%20Underforge\"&gt;The Underforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions%23Main%20Quests\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"radiant%20quest\"&gt;radiant quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Purity\"&gt;Purity&lt;/a&gt;\" becomes available for those Companions who wish to rid themselves of the disease. For that quest, the Dragonborn possess a head of a &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witch\"&gt;Glenmoril Witch&lt;/a&gt;, and bring it and the Companion back to the Flame of the Harbinger, proceeding as with Kodlak and the Dragonborn. If the Dragonborn has killed all five witches, it is possible to cure all of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt;, except for &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela the Huntress&lt;/a&gt; who does not want to be cured.\nNote that the witches do not respawn, so if the Dragonborn has not kept the spare heads, the only way to proceed with this method is to add the heads to the Dragonborn's inventory via the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt;. The command for this is codice_1.\nVampire\u00a0method.\nIf the Dragonborn chooses to become a Vampire Lord and they are already a werewolf, then Beast Form will be removed from the Dragonborn's power menu.\nConsole commands.\nAnother way of curing lycanthropy is via &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;; open the console and type, codice_2. By using the console command code codice_3 to change the Dragonborn's race, lycanthropy is immediately removed. This is also true of the codice_4 command.\nBeast Form.\nWhen the Dragonborn becomes a werewolf, they acquire a new power known as Beast Form. This allows them to transform into a werewolf once a day; however, the process takes a few seconds, during which they are vulnerable to attacks. Once transformed, the Dragonborn remains a werewolf for 2.5 minutes of real time. It is possible to extend this time by approaching a corpse and feeding on it by activating it as if looting it. This restores 50 points of Health and gives an additional 30 seconds of time as a werewolf. Beast form can be extremely useful in situations where equipment is removed, such as the quest \"&lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;\" and other prison escape attempts. In some scenarios, the Dragonborn's equipment (such as swords, ex: &lt;a href=\"Dragonbane\"&gt;Dragonbane&lt;/a&gt;) will stay equipped after the transformation. However, the equipment does not add extra damage to attacks, but one handed skill will increase as if the Dragonborn were still in human form. \nWhen in beast form, a notable size increase occurs. This is a real change in the character's size, not just a visual effect, and it may cause certain areas or &lt;a href=\"dungeons\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; to be impossible to traverse while in beast form. Walking backwards may allow the Dragonborn to pass under a low overhang. In the \"\", the Dragonborn's equipment is automatically re-equipped upon leaving Beast Form.\nAdvantages.\nPerk tree.\nAs a part of \"Dawnguard\", the werewolf perk tree is included. By consuming the heart of a corpse as a werewolf, it is possible to gain points exclusively for the werewolf perk tree. These points can be used to unlock perks such as increasing the total damage inflicted, health and stamina when in werewolf form. Unless the Savage Feeding perk is taken, only humanoid enemies can be fed upon (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, for fast leveling, it is highly recommended to take the Savage Feeding perk as soon as possible, increasing the variety of corpses that may be fed upon. The perk tree can only be accessed when in beast form.\nThe werewolf skill tree includes eight perks.\n\"*The quest \"&lt;a href=\"Totems%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Totems of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;\" must be completed before these will become usable.\"\nFeedings.\nEach new perk requires a few more feedings than the last. A total of 164 people need to be fed upon to complete the entire tree.\nDisease immunity.\nThe Dragonborn gains 100% resistance to all diseases (including &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;). This effect is permanent as long as they do not use the cure for Lycanthropy. In \"Dawnguard\", however, if the Dragonborn chooses to become a Vampire Lord, it will replace Lycanthropy just as Lycanthropy replaces Vampirism.\nShapeshifted.\nThe Dragonborn's damage is base 20 and levels gradually until level 45, where base damage is 80, while as a werewolf the Dragonborn also gains 100 health and stamina, not to mention a much higher sprint speed that makes them move much faster and can be utilized for long periods of time. Stamina also regenerates much faster, and power attacks are magnified. The standing and moving power attacks knock back opponents more often, and the sprinting power attack gains a massive damage boost. The Dragonborn also has a chance to maul an opponent after knocking them down. Unlike traditional werewolves, the Dragonborn can transform at will, during day or night, by using the Beast Form power. Actions while in werewolf form do not count towards the Dragonborn's normal &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt;, unless someone sees the transformation, in which case a 1,000 &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; bounty is added in the appropriate hold. This makes it incredibly useful while doing many &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; missions. Also whilst transformed, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; treat the Dragonborn as an ally unless attacked.\nRing of Hircine.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, once obtained through the quest \"Ill Met by Moonlight,\" will allow the Dragonborn to turn into a werewolf unlimited times a day. Equipping it will give the Dragonborn the \"additional transformations\" power which is lost after using it. To regain the power, the Dragonborn must re-equip the ring, at which point the power will be returned.\nFrostmoon Pack.\nIn , &lt;a href=\"Majni\"&gt;Majni&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Frostmoon%20Pack\"&gt;Frostmoon Pack&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Frostmoon%20Crag\"&gt;Frostmoon Crag&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, sells a set of four rings that enhance the abilities of a werewolf upon transformation into Beast Form. The rings are only available to the Dragonborn if they are a werewolf, otherwise the members of the Frostmoon Pack are hostile towards visitors. The &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Bloodlust\"&gt;Ring of Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; increases both damage and damage taken in Beast Form by 50%. The &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Instinct\"&gt;Ring of Instinct&lt;/a&gt; provides an effect similar to the &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; shout for 20 seconds upon transformation into Beast Form. The &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Hunt\"&gt;Ring of the Hunt&lt;/a&gt; allows for the regeneration of health in Beast Form. The &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Ring of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; increases the duration of Howls by 25%.\nShifting.\nAs previously stated in the \"Other\" section above, the Dragonborn is limited to one change per day. When using the power Beast Form, it is possible to transform no matter what the time of day or where the Dragonborn is located. To return to normal form, the Dragonborn must wait 2.5 minutes, unless they have fed on corpses, which adds 30 seconds per humanoid heart consumed, 15 seconds per animal heart (only with the \"Savage Feeding\" perk). Alternately, you may choose to wait 2 or 3 game hours.\nGiants.\nThe Beast Form is useful for fighting against giants. By using the sprint attack, the giant will be knocked down just like any other foe, and they take a long time to get back up on their feet. During this time the Dragonborn can continue attacking the Giant with no risk of damage. As soon as the giant is almost recovered from its stagger, the Dragonborn can simply repeat to knock them down again.\nHowever the Dragonborn does need to beware of the giants' pets, the &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt;. It is recommended that the Dragonborn kills them first. This can also be done in werewolf form easily. Simply power attack the mammoths first, when the giant is approaching, knock him down as stated above and continue attacking the mammoth. The Dragonborn should constantly be moving around to the back of the mammoth, to avoid being attacked, as the mammoth moves rather slowly compared to the werewolf. A werewolf's agility and the giant and mammoths' slow attacks also give the Dragonborn a huge edge.\nDisadvantages.\nNo sleeping bonus.\nThe Dragonborn cannot gain any resting bonuses when having lycanthropy. They also cannot gain the temporary bonus of &lt;a href=\"Lover%27s%20Comfort\"&gt;Lover's Comfort&lt;/a&gt; (normally gained by sleeping in the Dragonborn's house when his or her spouse is present) while afflicted. Skill bonuses from &lt;a href=\"standing%20stones\"&gt;standing stones&lt;/a&gt; still apply normally. They also still get the Father's/Mother's Love bonus.\nShapeshifted.\nOnce transformed, the camera view is automatically moved to third person and cannot be changed back until after the transformation wears off. The werewolf form is large, and so has trouble fitting through narrow passages, and while in werewolf form the Dragonborn cannot access menus, maps, or items. This can be troubling when in the wild, as the Dragonborn cannot view the map and can easily become lost. By \"sheathing\" the werewolves claws, the werewolf can take on a less aggressive stance, along with allowing them to pan the camera. It is not possible to speak while shifted (unless a part of a quest is reached where a character starts a conversation with the Dragonborn. If this happens it is possible to reply to them even in werewolf form). Anyone unfamiliar with the werewolf form will usually flee or try to attack the Dragonborn. Any &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; that the Dragonborn may have will not leave their service for simply transforming into a werewolf and will still follow and attack enemies, but if the Dragonborn were to use The Scent of Blood or purposely damage the follower, they would flee, so it is advised to be careful around followers when in werewolf form. (Exceptions: When a follower is at too high a level to be affected by Scent of Blood, they will shrug it off without consequences.)\nThe Dragonborn can feed upon fallen foes by activating them, this allows the Dragonborn to regenerate health. This is the only way to heal while in this form, as spell-casting and passive health regeneration are disabled. It also increases the duration of werewolf form by thirty seconds per person fed on. It is sometimes possible to feed on non-playable races,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; can be fed on.\nIf the Dragonborn goes near a town while transformed, the guards will attack on sight. To enter a town, the Dragonborn must wait in a hidden location until they revert to human form.\nSince all armor and weapons are unequipped when in Beast Form, the Dragonborn will not gain any skill points (one handed stays the same skill level after clawing foes to death).\nLocks cannot be picked and chests cannot be opened while in Beast Form, although followers with a sufficient &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; skill and &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory can be used to work around this, as they can then be interacted with from far away and ordered to unlock locked chests and doors up to adept level. They can then loot the chests or containers, but will not pick up most quest items, and some followers will refuse to steal. \nLocked doors that require use of keys from the inventory cannot be opened in Beast Form. Most unlocked doors and gates can still be opened as a werewolf, but some narrow corridors were made without the Beast Form size in mind, such as the secret passages at the end of most &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Tombs\"&gt;Nordic tombs&lt;/a&gt;; this can lead to the Dragonborn getting trapped or at least unable to traverse certain areas until they revert back into human form. Activation points such as chains, levers and switches can be used in Beast Form, except those where items must be dislodged before use (for instance, certain switches in &lt;a href=\"Raldbthar%23Raldbthar%20Deep%20Market\"&gt;Raldbthar Deep Market&lt;/a&gt;.)\nWeapon loss.\nWhen the Dragonborn leaves Beast Form, all of their equipment will be placed in their inventory, and they will have to re-equip it. There have been claims that the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric artifacts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Sword\"&gt;Daedric Sword&lt;/a&gt;, any kind of mace, and the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt; bug when transformed and allow the Dragonborn to use them in werewolf form. On several occasions, &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; will still trap souls and fill &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;. Very rarely the Dragonborn may have a blade or a bow in their hand as a werewolf, but it will not affect combat. Using a blade in this form will count towards one handed experience, but using a bow will not.\nLow armor.\nInitially this is not a problem, since the base armor value of Beast Form is better than most early armor, but in the late-game most enemies will be able to quickly put the Dragonborn down with a few power attacks. This is especially true on Master Difficulty. This problem is worsened by the lack of any ranged attacks, aside from launching opponents at each other.\nWerebears.\nWerebears are a different kind of lycanthrope present on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.

As Housecarl, she is sworn to protect the Dragonborn with her life, and to carry their burdens. She is a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29%23Potential%20spouses\"&gt;marriage candidate&lt;/a&gt; for the Dragonborn.\nFollower.\nJust like other followers, Lydia can die if she does not get the opportunity to heal herself when knocked down. This can happen if the Dragonborn damages her at low health.\nIf the Dragonborn and Lydia part ways, she returns to Dragonsreach. If &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; is owned, she will return there instead. If enough time was spent with her, she may gift the Dragonborn with a radiant item upon reuniting with her.\nLydia, like most followers, has the option of being recruited into The &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; by being brought to &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; after the quest &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; is completed. She can still be recruited as a follower, but her default Steel apparel will be replaced with a full set of &lt;a href=\"Blades%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades Armor&lt;/a&gt; and a Blades sword. This change is permanent.\nMarriage.\nBefore Patch 1.5, it was only possible to marry Lydia through &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29/Characters\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn does marry her, then she opens a shop in town and gives the Dragonborn 100 per day. She can be asked to move to a different house, if a house other than Breezehome is owned. Like all the other candidates for marriage, she will cook a &lt;a href=\"Homecooked%20Meal\"&gt;Homecooked Meal&lt;/a&gt; once a day that regenerates Stamina, Health, and Magicka. She can only be married once Breezehome has been purchased.\n\"Is that an amulet of Mara? I'm surprised someone like you isn't spoken for.\"\nCombat behavior and skills.\nLydia is primarily a melee-type character and uses no spells. As with some other melee-oriented followers, she has tendency to simply rush into &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, possibly leading to her death.\nShe can use &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell scrolls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, potions and food if available, and favors &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons, but will use any equipment if it bests the current base armor or damage rating.\nShe also has very low &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill, alerting enemies of her presence nearly immediately. This may cause problems if the Dragonborn has low Sneak skill, but may prove as an advantage if the Dragonborn has a higher Sneak level, since it allows the Dragonborn to lure enemies using Lydia. Although her Sneak skill isn't high enough to have the perk to do this, she can sometimes be seen doing a roll (when the Dragonborn is crouching) in order to catch up.\nEquipment.\nArmor and jewelry.\nLydia's default armor is steel &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; (the version without pauldrons), &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Cuffed%20Boots\"&gt;boots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Nordic%20Gauntlets\"&gt;gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Her default equipment provides a total armor rating of 169. She does not wear a helmet by default, but can equip any if given one. She can also wear any &lt;a href=\"Crafted%20Jewelry%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ring or necklace&lt;/a&gt; given to her by the Dragonborn, which can be useful due to the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;added effects&lt;/a&gt; these items may have. She can equip armor given to her, if its armor rating surpasses that of her default equipment. She can and will wear light armor, but her high Heavy Armor skill makes it difficult without a high &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; skill or high-end armor, or the \"equipitem\" &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console command&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt should be noted that, similar to other followers, there are multiple options to change her gear. She may be dismissed then pickpocketed to remove her default gear using the &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20Touch\"&gt;Perfect Touch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; perk. Alternatively, she may be married so that she opens a shop \u2014 this then allows the Dragonborn to buy her default clothes, which forces her to wear alternative gear.\nWeapons.\nShe only uses a shield if the best melee weapon in her inventory is &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise she uses a &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weapon. Lydia's default weapon is a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel sword&lt;/a&gt;. If her sword is removed or if opponents are out of melee range, she uses a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunting bow&lt;/a&gt;, with an infinite supply of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron arrows&lt;/a&gt;, though these arrows cannot be taken from her inventory. Similar to her melee weapon and armor, she can be given stronger &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and a stronger &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, which she will use instead.\nDialogue.\n\"The Jarl has appointed me to be your housecarl. It's an honor to serve you.\"\n\"Good day.\"\nAs a follower.\n\"I'm right behind you.\"\n\"Lead on.\"\nQuotes.\n\nWith , Lydia has been updated with a set of quotes unique to her, making her much more expressive than before. She may comment on various locations in both Skyrim and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;."}

Lymdrenn was a casualty of the Accession War, when the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt;, invaded Morrowind and slaughtered House Telvanni.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLymdrenn Telvanni was a prominent member of the Great House Telvanni, who had a wife on his side. In &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, Lymdrenn had a son named &lt;a href=\"Brandyl%20Telvanni\"&gt;Brandyl Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, whose born on the same year as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted, sending an endless flurry of ash across &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. When the An-Xileel took over in faraway &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, they amassed an invasion force onto the weakened Morrowind, attacking various city-states including &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. The Argonians sought to destroy House Telvanni, and so the various strongholds were destroyed, leaving little to no survivors. Both Lymdrenn and his wife both died at the hands of the Argonians, in agony and pain.\nLegacy.\nBy his request, Lymdrenn had his wet nurse named Hidyra Olen take his child, Brandyl Telvanni far away from the destruction, to the west. Olen and the remaining Telvanni took a ship known as the &lt;a href=\"Pride%20of%20Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Pride of Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;, escaping Morrowind. Olen was able to keep Lymdrenn's journal so that Brandyl will know his heritage.

She is first encountered while fleeing from &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;The Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt;, joining the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; on the way towards &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, and later returns to help Tamriel.\nBackground.\nLyris was born to &lt;a href=\"Gjalder\"&gt;Gjalder&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; man who was a descendant of &lt;a href=\"Giant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;giants&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Lyris' giant blood, she was a considerably large infant and her mother died in childbirth as a result. Lyris was raised by her father in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, who believed his wife's death was on his hands, but loved Lyris dearly none-the-less. Lyris later left for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and enlisted in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, enduring constant harassment from her fellow soldiers during her training due to her height and giant blood, calling her a beast, among other terms. Lyris rose up through the ranks and eventually became one of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;' most trusted advisors, forming the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt; with him, alongside Councilor &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, Dragonguard leader &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, and Battlemage &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;. The Companions set out to find the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;582&lt;/a&gt;, as Varen believed it to be the key to legitimizing his rule as Emperor. When they located the Amulet, the Companions initiated a ritual upon the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; to proclaim Varen as a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were tricked by Mannimarco during the ritual, who used the Amulet to extinguish the Dragonfires and cause a tear between &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, allowing his master &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; to invade &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and begin his &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. During the Soulburst, Molag Bal captured Lyris and Sai Sahan, keeping them prisoners in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven%20in%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Soul Shriven in Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nLyris finds the Vestige in his or her cell, releasing them. She takes the Vestige with her on their way out of Coldharbour, explaining why he or she was in the Wailing Prison, and who the Prophet is. She reveals that she and the Prophet are still alive\u2014unlike the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but are still prisoners there, regardless.\nAfter the Vestige destroys a &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Sentinel\"&gt;Coldharbour Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, the gate to the Prophet will be sealed by Molag Bal, to which Lyris suggests that &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt; might know another way. Following his advice, Lyris and the Vestige go through the Undercroft to get to the Prophet's cell. Lyris tells the Vestige that a living soul must take his place in order for him to escape, and volunteers to do so, warning that the transference is sure to attract some guards. After the Vestige activates the pinions of the snare, she is replaced by a freed Prophet, who must leave her behind in order to escape with the Vestige, with a promise to return and get her out as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Daughter of Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige must help her overcome her fears to escape Coldharbour. Lyris' mother died in childbirth, and she always felt that &lt;a href=\"Gjalder\"&gt;her father&lt;/a&gt; blamed her for her mother's death. She was teased during training for her size.\nConversations.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Ragjar\"&gt;Ragjar&lt;/a&gt; and talking to &lt;a href=\"Gjalder\"&gt;Gjalder&lt;/a&gt;:\nGjalder: \"Lyris? Is this true, child?\"\nLyris: \"You were always so cold. So distant. My mother died giving my life. It was my fault! I should never have been born!\"\nGjalder: \"Lyris, look at me. The blood of giants flows through my veins. Your mother was a Nord. I gave her my seed without thought for her safety. That's why she died. Not because of you, child. Because of me!\"\nLyris: \"I thought you blame me. You ... you couldn't even look at me, Papa!\"\nGjalder: \"Do you not see? When I looked at you, I saw her face. I loved her, child. Just as I love you\u2015more than life itself. We cannot change the past, nor should we cling to it. You must not let these feelings haunt you. Let them go. Let me go.\"\nLyris: \"I love you too, Papa. Rest now. Be at peace.\"\nAfter entering Clannfear Roost:\nLyris: \"Abnur Tharn, you traitorous bastard! I should have expected to find you here!\"\nAbnur: \"Don't be a fool, Titanborn. I'm trying to help you. Your hatred poisons you. Warriors are like steel. When you lose temper, you lose your worth.\"\nLyris: \"Help me? You betrayed us all, then went back to licking Mannimarco's boot before the smoke cleared!\"\nAbnur: \"I did what I had to do. And, as a show of my good intentions, I have a gift for you. But, be warned. Coldharbour will not give it up, easily.\"\nLyris: \"Is that ... ? Shor's bones, it is! Vestige, that's my battle axe!\"\nIn the Prison of Echoes, after approaching Sai Sahan:\nLyris: \"Sai! What's happened to you? What have they done?\"\nSai: \"Lyris! Lyris, I can see you! Are you really there?\"\nLyris: \"Sai, it's me! We're seeing some kind of vision of you. Do you know where you are?\"\nSai: \"I ... I don't know. They're torturing me. They ... want the Amulet of Kings. Want me to tell them where it's hidden. But I haven't broken. Not yet.\"\nLyris: \"Sai, you need to hold on. We're going to find you. I'll make sure of it. We'll find you! Somehow, we'll get you out of here! Sai? Sai! No! Bring him back, you bastards!\"\nAfter escaping to the Harborage:\nThe Prophet: \"Lyris, child. Are you all right?\"\nLyris: \"Yes, Prophet. I'm fine. The Vestige freed my mind from the Daedra's control.\"\nThe Prophet: \"Thank the Divines. Your loss would have thrown all into chaos.\"\nLyris: \"They won't take me again. Not alive, at least. Prophet, Mannimarco captured Sai Sahan! He's torturing him to find out where the Amulet of Kings is hidden. We have to rescue him!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Tharn is quite correct. We have little choice in the matter.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You can't be serious! How can we possibly trust him?\"\nThe Prophet: \"As our visitor so eloquently pointed out, we cannot. But if we are to locate Sai Sahan, we must do this. Go with the Vestige, Lyris. Rescue Tharn. Give him a chance to redeem himself. He may surprise you.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You must be the ugliest princess ever rescued from a tower, Tharn.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"I'm shocked your lack of education and repeated blows to the head haven't dulled your wit, Titanborn.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"What? You son of a bitch!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Gah! Are you insane? Get away from me, you brutish she-troll!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Lyris! Stand down!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"He's done nothing but lie to us from the beginning! I don't care what he says, he'll always be Mannimarco's toady!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Please. Mannimarco wants me dead! Did I pretend to capitulate to him? Yes, I did. Do you have any idea how many lives I saved by doing so?\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"The only thing you saved was your holdings and your own hide, you pompous ass!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Enough! Abnur had no choice, Lyris. And we are guilty of our own deceit, are we not? The time has come for the Vestige to know the truth!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"What's this? The Vestige doesn't know? Oh, this is rich!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sire, don't ...!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Vestige. Until now, you have only known me as the Prophet. But that is not my true name. I ... am Varen Aquilarios!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Our fallen Emperor, in the tattered robes of a Moth Priest, blind as a newborn kitten!\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"I am sorry I deceived you, Vestige.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Put a corck in it, Tharn! Sai's my friend. Probably the best friend I have. If the Vestige is going, I'm going too!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Yes, I see. And you are the most qualified, why? Is it your superior knowledge of Coldharbour? Your expertise in dealing with Daedric entities? Or is it simply the unrequited puppy love you feel for that shirtless mammoth?\"\nSai Sahan: \"It is strange to return to these mountains. Memories of youth flood my mind, each one bringing its own sorrow, or its own smile.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Oh, joy. We've been here less than five minutes and Sahan is already getting maudlin and weepy.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Shut up, Tharn! Don't let him get to you, Sai. Let him roll his eyes. Maybe he'll find a brain back there.\"\nSai Sahan: \"What is this? The abbey burns! Quickly! We must find Kasura!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"So much destruction! What could have done this?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"I'm afraid I've seen this before. Keep an eye skyward, Titanborn!\"\nSai Sahan: \"Kasura! There!\"\nKasura: \"Sai Sahan! Intruders ... cultists ... they attacked the abbey. So many of my students have fallen ...\"\nSai Sahan: \"Kasura! Are you injured? What happened? The abbey is in ruins, Kasura! How could they ...?\"\nKasura: \"A gigantic beast ... like nothing I've ever seen! The cultists ... they're opening rifts to Oblivion!\"\nSai Sahan: \"Save your strength, Kasura. We will make them pay, I promise you!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"What do you think? Trap?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"It's only a trap if you don't know about it. I assume everything is a trap. Therefore, it's a challenge.\"\nMannimarco: \"In the name of Molag Bal, come forth and destroy his enemies!\"\nMannimarco: \"Heed me, Daedric minions, and obey!\"\nMannimarco: \"Hosts of Oblivion, come forth and feast!\"\nKasura: \"Sai, the Titan returns!\"\nMannimarco: \"Ah, Sai Sahan and company, at last! My pet has been waiting for you.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Eyes skyward! Here it comes!\"\nMannimarco: \"How many more of your friends must die, Sai Sahan? Where is the Amulet of Kings?\"\nKasura: \"Follow me. The hidden entrance will not be obvious.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Why would a crypt need a secret entrance?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"It's a wonder there's an unplundered crypt in all of Skyrim! You Nords could learn a thing or two from the builders of Hammerfell.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Perhaps Hammerfell could also teach Nibenay the virtue of good manners.\"\nKasura: \"Here we are. Watch your step as you descend.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Tread lightly. Few living have been permitted to walk among these honored dead.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Divad Hunding, son of Frandar do Hunding Hel Ansei No Shira, the greatest of the Sword Saints. The hearth of every household in Hammerfell has small alcove containing a copy of his father's greatest work, The Book of Circles.\"\nSai Sahan: \"\"Ra Abah was a warrior of great renown. He fought alongside Frandar Hunding in the seven great battles against the Armies of Hira, and survived. At the final battle at Hattu Mountain, more than three hundred thousand gave their lives.\"\n[After finding the Ring]\nSai Sahan: \"It seems fitting that the Ring of Stendarr's Mercy lies with my father's greatsword. We will need both for the battles that lay before us.\"\nSai Sahan: \"\"By the sword of my father, Nazir Itaf Sahan, I pledge myself to the destruction of Mannimarco and the liberation of Tamriel from the tyranny of the God of Schemes, Molag Bal!\"\n[After talking to Kasura]\nMannimarco: \"I knew you would lead me to the ring, eventually. Give it to me!\"\nSai Sahan: \"Your presence defiles this place, Mannimarco!\"\nMannimarco: \"Give me the ring and I might spare your pathetic lives!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"We struck down your Titan and we'll strike you down soon enough!\"\nMannimarco: \"The Titan was a prelude of what's to come if you continue to defy me!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Defy you? Your delusions of godhood are laughable, your ignominious corpse-herder!\"\nMannimarco: \"Very well, then. I'll simply take the ring from your corpses.\"\nSai Sahan: \"\"Blasphemy! How dare you raise the honored dead to fight your battle!\"\n[After defeating Divad Hunding]\nKasura: \"\"Sai, look out! He's raising Ra Abah!\"\n[After defeating Ra Abah]\nAbnur Tharn: \"\"The next time you hide something from the most powerful necromancer in all of Tamriel, you might reconsider hiding it in a bloody tomb!\"\n[After defeating Ansei Kalam and Ra Adia]\nSai Sahan: \"\"Hold the line! They must not get the ring!\"\n[After defeating Ra Hasa, Ra Huzar, and Ansei Satameh]\nSai Sahan: \"Rest in peace, honored dead.\"\nKasura: \"\"I swear on the souls of my ancestors, I will avenge Mannimarco's blasphemy!\"\n[After talking to Sai Sahan]\nKasura: \"The damage is great, but if you had not arrived when you did, there would be nothing left to rebuild. Be safe in the coming days, my friends. I look forward to your return.\"\nSai Sahan: \"The Abbey of Blades will rise from these ashes. If I survive the dark path we must walk, I will return to help Kasura shape a new generation of blademasters.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You could have hidden that amulet anywhere in Tamriel, and this was your first choice?\"\nSai Sahan: \"It seemed like a good idea at the time.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Brilliant. Why is it that the people with the most ridiculous ideas are always the ones who are most certain of them?\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Shut up, Tharn.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Shut up, Tharn.\"\nMannimarco: \"What brings you to Sancre Tor, old friends? Looking for an amulet, perhaps?\"\nSai Sahan: \"Mannimarco? How did you find this place?\"\nMannimarco: \"Do you really think I'd allow you to escape the Halls of Torment if I couldn't track your every movement?\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai, no! Mannimarco, stop! You're killing him!\"\nMannimarco: \"Where is the Amulet of Kings? My master, Molag Bal, demands it!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Your master. Please! You would use the amulet to betray Molag Bal!\"\nMannimarco: \"Fool! When I ascended, you could have been at my right hand, Tharn. Instead you chose to allign yourself with mongrels and imbeciles. Now you'll die with them!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"You won't get away with this. Do you really think you can betray a Daedric Prince?\"\nMannimarco: \"With the Amulet of Kings, all things are possible! Nations will tremble and bow before me! I will be a god!\"\nSai Sahan: \"The Amulet of Kings will never be yours! It is protected by a ward of the Divines!\"\nMannimarco: \"You mean your ward of Stendarr, God of Merciful Forbearance, patron of gutless, law-abiding dimwits? It won't even slow me down!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai, are you well enough to continue?\"\nSai Sahan: \"Have no fear, Snow Lily. I am Redguard. We are like mountain bamboo: far stronger and more flexible than we might appear.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"I find it hilarious that Mannimarco chose such a massive projected appearance. He's obviously overcompensating for something.\"\nMannimarco: \"Persistent, aren't you? Do you really think you can keep me from acquiring the amulet?\"\nSai Sahan: \"The Amulet of Kings is under the protection of Stendarr's ward! It will never be yours!\"\nMannimarco: \"Ah, Sai. You still don't understand, do you? My plan will succeed because of your ward of Stendarr! It will prevent Molag Bal from observing or interfering. By the time the ward is down and the amulet is mine, it will already be too late!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You're insane if you think you can betray the God of Schemes!\"\nMannimarco: \"Naive child! You know nothing! Chim-el Adabal, the red diamond at the center of the Amulet of Kings, is the most powerful Soul Gem ever created! With the amulet in my possession, I will absorb Molag Bal's power, reducing him to an empty husk of ethereal flesh. Then I will trap his essence within the gem! In time, the name Molag Bal will be forgotten! In time, all of Tamriel will bow down before me! Soon, the God of Schemes will have a new name: Mannimarco!\"\nSai Sahan: \"I do not like Mannimarco as a mortal. I think I will like him even less as a god.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Please. A moment, my friends. I ... I must rest before we continue.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai? Are you all right? That bastard really hurt you, didn't he? I swear to the gods I'll take his head off!\"\nSai Sahan: \"I'll be fine, Snow Lily. I just need a moment to catch my breath.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Take all the time you need. I'll keep watch. If there's anything I can do, just name it.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"An enchanting moment. I'll be over here, bringing up my lunch.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Dank corridors, crumbling walls, nauseating smells. This place has all the charm of a Riften brothel. It must feel very much like home to you, Titanborn.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You mean a crypt filled with the rotting corpses of inbred kings and failed statesmen. Must be what it's like at a Tharn family reunion.\"\nSai Sahan: \"It is more pleasant in the summer months.\"\nMannimarco: \"Your pathetic efforts will not succeed! The Amulet of Kings will be mine!\"\nSai Sahan: \"I swear by Stendarr's grace and the sword of my father, you will not win, Mannimarco!\"\nMannimarco: \"Soon, you will know the extent of my power and bow before me! Through the Amulet of Kings, I will be transformed! All the nations of Tamriel will bow before me! They will worship me and beg for my mercy! All will know the name of Mannimarco as their one, true god!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You'll never get away with it, Mannimarco! We'll fight you to our last breath!\"\nMannimarco: \"By all means, my old friends. Try and stop me!\"\nMannimarco: \"Miserable fools! You are nothing! I am Mannimarco!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Keep Mannimarco occupied! I'll close the portal!\"\nMannimarco: \"Minions, arise! Obey me!\"\nSai Sahan: \"I will hold them at the portal! Focus on Mannimarco!\"\nMannimarco: \"I grow tired of these games!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"He's weakening! Don't stop now!\"\nMannimarco: \"Do you really think that death can stop the most powerful necromancer Tamriel has ever known? This is merely a transition! My first step towards true immortality! Now witness my true power! Watch as I rise up from the grave and ascend to godhood!\"\nMolag Bal: \"\"Worm! You think you can betray the Lord of Brutality and Domination without consequence? You will pay for your arrogance! You will writhe in agony for the rest of eternity! Your tortured screams will echo throughout Oblivion to serve as a warning to others!\"\n[After retrieving the Amulet]\nLyris Titanborn: \"Everything Mannimarco did was designed to pit us against each other. We can't let that happen. Look what we can accomplish when we work together.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"How uncharacteristically optimistic of you, Titanborn. I may have that embroidered on a pillow.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"The Divines gave you a nose for a reason, Tharn. So you can keep your mouth shut and still keep breathing.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Well played, Titanborn. Well played.\"\nSai Sahan: \"My lord, with your permission.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"You needn't call me that anymore, Sai Sahan. We are equals now.\"\nSai Sahan: \"All those years ago, when we fought beneath our lord's banner to free the Empire from the Longhouse Emperors, we did so with a dream of freedom and peace in mind\u2015not just for the Empire, but for all of Tamriel. Together we forged a fellowship stronger than any blade, only to see it shattered upon the rocks of deceit by one of our own. That fellowship is no more, yet we four have assembled here, united by a single purpose. It is not vengeance that drives us, but truth and loyalty and justice. I, Sai Sahan, steward of the Abbey of Blades, call for the Five Companions to be reforged this day. By the light of Stendarr, and the heart of Lorkhan, may our blade fellowship be forged anew. And may the Vestige, our mutual friend and ally, become its tip, that we may thrust it straigt into the heart of a Daedric Prince.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai Sahan is right. You are the member that we should have had all those years ago.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"It is as the Scrolls foretold. The soulless one will become the brightest of five stars, and they shall guide us to the coming dawn.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Oh, please. You melodramatic sots! Fine, fine. If seeing one of your foolish prophecies come true will help to ensure the safety of the Empire, I'll play along.\"\nSai Sahan: \"We stand united once more\u2015the Five Companions are reforged, and together we will strike down the God of Schemes!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Come here, my friend. I've got a few things I want to say before you go.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Let's not forget the struggles that got us to this point. We're almost home. We just have a bit further to fight.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Are you all insane? You do realize what we need to do, right? We have to fight a Daedric Prince. Amulet or no, this is going to mean more death. Vestige! Come here. I'll tell you what they're afraid to mention.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Of course it is. The fact of the matter stands, however. One of the Five will need to give their life to fuel this attack, when the time comes.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"So you said before the Vestige arrived. And I've already thought over it.

Plus, her new home is better than the last. It is a very tiny cage, but she does not beg for food. It is given.\nStill, M'Sharra longs to see the night sky. When she was a kitten, the elders warned her that if she stared too long at the moons, they would grow shy, and M'Sharra would never see them again. This made her sad, and so M'Sharra vowed to stop looking at the sky, and kept her head down toward the dirt, where the beggars belonged.\nOne day, she tried to steal the silver out of the pockets of a Nord named Tyra. When she heard Khajiit's story, she took pity on the kitten, and told her that the moons were not the timid creatures she had believed. She said that as long as Khajiit held her head up high, they would shine brighter than any star.\nFrom that day she spent her life in service to the Crimson Dirks. And when she was ready, her new litter-mates forged her an armor made of silver, and in its heart, the piece Tyra had in her pocket so many moons ago.\nM'Sharra hid the armor in a hut, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;. At times, M'Sharra has longed to retrieve it, and wear it proudly.\nBut she must be careful not to let sentiment cloud her judgment. M'Sharra suspects she is being followed. So she will leave the armor for another. Besides, it is not the silver in the armor or the moonlight in the sky that M'Sharra treasures, but the friends she has lost. Perhaps in death, she will see them again."}

If the guards only knew, they would come kill her. That is why M'Sharra can never tell.\nBut her time is short. She longs for company. The other day she took to begging outside the city, and saw her litter-mate, Zaharia, walk through the gates. M'Sharra called her by name, but the Redguard ignored her. M'Sharra is sure she heard her, and it made her sad to know this.\nM'Sharra does not want to die a rug. Perhaps she will do something mischievous, and get the Whiterun guards to attack. Then she will be a warrior once more."}

They assume that the &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is all about skill and the mace is only about strength and stamina. As a veteran instructor of mace tactics, I can tell you they are wrong.\nWielding a mace properly is all about timing and momentum. Once the swing of the mace has begun, stopping it or slowing it down is difficult. The fighter is committed to not just the blow, but also the recoil. Begin your strike when the opponent is leaning forward, hopefully off balance. It is completely predictable that he will lean backward, so aim for a point behind his head. By the time the mace gets there, his head will be in its path.\nThe mace should be held at the ready, shoulder high. The windup should not extend past the shoulders by more than a hand's width. When swinging, lead with the elbow. As the elbow passes the height of your collarbone, extend the forearm like a whip. The extra momentum will drive the mace faster and harder, &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;causing far more damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the moment of impact, let the wrist loosen. The mace will bounce and hurt a stiff wrist. Allow the recoil of the blow to drive the mace back into the ready position, thereby preparing the warrior for a quicker second strike."}

To do so, the \"&lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Wizard's Tower&lt;/a&gt;\" official plug-in installed. Enter the spire, teleport to the living space, and stand in the garden dedicated to Oblivion plants, such as &lt;a href=\"Bloodgrass\"&gt;Bloodgrass&lt;/a&gt;. Facing the entrance to the garden, stand in the leftmost red glowing light. Save the game, then deactivate or uninstall the plug-in from the storage device it is on; it can be re-downloaded for free later.\nStart the game back up and load the file. A message will appear stating that some content may be missing from the save; load the file anyway. If done correctly, the Hero will be inside a house. When the game is started, they will be surrounded by darkness if done incorrectly. If they do not start inside the house, they must look around until they see a house with invisible walls. Walk towards the house to teleport into it. This process can be sped up by using a \"summon creature\" spell to teleport inside.\nWhen in the house, the Hero must go through the door that should be located right in front of them.

{"id": "64736", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=64736", "title": "Madanach", "text": "Madanach, also known as The King in Rags, is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Rebellion\"&gt;Forsworn Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. He is imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;, deep beneath the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;.\nEscape from Cidhna Mine.\nBefore Madanach allows the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to escape the mine with the rest of the Forsworn, he will require the disposal of &lt;a href=\"Grisvar%20the%20Unlucky\"&gt;Grisvar the Unlucky&lt;/a&gt;, as Grisvar has been in and out of Cidhna Mine, possibly leaking information, and thus is suspected of being a spy. With Grisvar dead, Madanach and his followers plan to escape through a tunnel they have been digging under Markarth, leading eventually to the city's surface. Upon reaching the surface, Madanach will give a speech to his followers, after which a battle will ensue between the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s and his men.\nOnce the battle concludes, Madanach and his followers will retreat to the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Druadach Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the Dragonborn decides to kill Madanach before escaping the mine, the remaining prisoners will become hostile. One can then use Madanach's Key to escape through the tunnel next to Madanach's quarters. &lt;a href=\"Thonar\"&gt;Thonar&lt;/a&gt; will meet the Dragonborn at the entrance to the Markarth Ruins, reward them with the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Family%20Ring\"&gt;Silver-Blood Family Ring&lt;/a&gt;, then he will inform them that they have done a great service to the Silver-Blood family and that they have been pardoned by the Jarl of Markarth.\nUpon helping Madanach escape and choosing not to kill him at Thonar's behest, Madanach will reward the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;Armor of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nThe \"King in Rags\" proves to be a strong-willed and shrewd character, totally dedicated to his cause. He is no stranger to murder, as long as he expels the Nords and regains the Reach for his fellow Forsworn. He has a particular distaste for outsiders too, being hostile to the Dragonborn in their first meeting. Madanach shows absolute belief in his cause, he fully believes what he is doing is right and the Nords are evil, and that the Forsworn are the only legitimate rulers of the Reach.\nMadanach shows a talent for manipulation and cunning. In the shadows, he lures Thonar into a false sense of security before striking at him and Markarth, with the right agents in place. He forces the player to kill the loose end, Grisvar, who could be disloyal. Honeyed words and speeches are his specialities, as he attempts to convert the Dragonborn and justify his cause. He empowers those who follow him and seeks to win through slyness what brute force cannot obtain. He fancies himself to be ruthless and cunning, although he reveals that all he really wants is the peace they had before Ulfric's attack.\nCombat.\nIf the Dragonborn decides to attack and slay Madanach, they should take caution. If attacked in his cell, the Dragonborn will have little equipment, the only available weapons, aside from magic, being a pickaxe or a shiv. This is the same for Madanach, and he has magic on his side as well. If confronted directly, he can invoke a Frost Cloak spell. He will also hurl Fireballs and Ice Spikes relentlessly if the Dragonborn is within range. A sneak attack may be the best course. Magic users will have a much easier time with this battle, as they don't have to get close to the Frost Cloak. Shouts are also very useful, as a single Fire Breath shout with all three words of power may result in an instant kill at lower levels.\nSlaying Madanach after aiding him will make his followers hostile, too. At this stage, some may have been killed by the enemies in the ruins. One may or may not have recovered their equipment by then, so this may vary in difficulty. Avoid being surrounded, as some of the other prisoners have magic of their own. Madanach will also have improved and enchanted gear if the Dragonborn's equipment has been recovered.\nBeast form or Vampire Lord Form may prove useful as it requires no equipment to use.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Well, well. Look at you. A wild beast caged up and left to go mad. So, my fellow beast, what do you want? Answers about the Forsworn? Revenge for trying to have you killed?\"\nAfter the player hears Braig's story:\nI talked to Braig. \"Imagine hearing a story like that, over and over. Each time a different family. Each time a different injustice. Your meddling above ground reminded me of how removed I've been from the struggle. My men and I should be in the hills, fighting.\"\nAfter the player kills Grisvar the Unlucky:\nUraccen: \"What's going on, Madanach? You wouldn't have old Grisvar killed unless you weren't planning on needing him.\"\nMadanach: \"My brothers, we have been here long enough. It's time to leave Cidhna Mine and continue our fight against the Nords. Through this gate, just beside my quarters, is a tunnel. A tunnel that leads right through the old Dwarven ruins of Markarth, into the city. Well, what do you say, my brothers?\"\nDuach: \"The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!\"\nBorkul the Beast: \"The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!\"\nBraig: \"The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!\"\nUraccen: \"The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!\"\nOdvan: \"The Reach belongs to the Forsworn!\"\n\"I say you've earned an early pardon. Let's go.\"\n(When the group reaches the end of the tunnel:\nKaie: \"Madanach. I've brought what you asked for.\"\nMadanach: \"Good work. Get ready while I have a word with our favorite outsider.\"\n\"I had Kaie recover all the things the Nords stole from you. You better get ready before we break out into the city. And take this. It's blessed with the old magicks. Something to remember me by. Time to finally see the sky, and make it rain red.\""}

It is the twelfth game in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;The Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;\" series. On June 9th, 2015, the game was released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nDeveloped by the team at &lt;a href=\"ZeniMax%20Online%20Studios\"&gt;ZeniMax Online Studios&lt;/a&gt;, \"The Elder Scrolls Online\" merges the unmatched exploration of rich worlds that the franchise is known for with the scale and social aspects of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.\n\"The Elder Scrolls Online\" features a buy-to-play model similar to previous \"Elder Scrolls\" titles, where one purchases the game for a flat fee and can play it for free afterwards, but there is also an optional membership program, ESO Plus, which grants bonuses such as increased XP gain and free access to all DLC Packs. The game has an in-game cash shop, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt;, where things such as vanity items and cosmetic &lt;a href=\"Mounts%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mounts&lt;/a&gt; are sold for a premium currency called &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing that gives players a significant advantage over another will be sold.\nBuying the Imperial Edition gives players the option to play as an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;, craft Imperial gear, convert existing gear into the Imperial style, gives an Imperial horse with standard stats, a &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Mudcrab\"&gt;mudcrab&lt;/a&gt; vanity &lt;a href=\"Pets%20%28Online%29\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pledge%20of%20Mara\"&gt;Pledge of Mara&lt;/a&gt;, which allows players to marry. As of February 2018, the base game is no longer available for purchase on the Steam store, and is instead bundled with , a major expansion.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Firor\"&gt;Matt Firor&lt;/a&gt;, additional content development of \"The Elder Scrolls Online\" is set to continue until at least 2020.\nSetting.\nThe game is set on Tamriel in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, a period of time between the assassination of the last &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, and the rise of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, where there was chaos, bloodshed, and no &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral years prior, the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; desired to become &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; in order to light the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, thus legitimizing his claim to the Ruby Throne. The sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; was able to convince him that he knew a ritual that could accomplish this, but that it required the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, the half-giant &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; and the High Chancellor of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, they became the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;. They were able to retrieve the Amulet of Kings and begin the ritual in &lt;a href=\"2E%20578\"&gt;2E 578&lt;/a&gt;. At that moment when the ritual began, Mannimarco used his dark &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to immobilize the others and reveal his true intentions: he was an agent of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and the ritual in fact destroyed the barriers between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;. This event allowed Molag Bal to initiate the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, a forceful merging of worlds. Once the ritual was completed, aftershocks were swept across every corner of Nirn. Mages died or went mad, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; trembled in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, earthquakes shook &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and heavy storms devastated the coastlines of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The constellation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Serpent\"&gt;the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; grew so large that it seemed to threaten every star sign at once.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharn family&lt;/a&gt;, rulers of Cyrodiil through Empress Regent &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, made a pact with Mannimarco, the King of Worms, who agreed to supplement the Imperial's forces by resurrecting their soldiers, except for Clivia's father Abnur, who opposes Mannimarco. Molag Bal is harvesting the &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s for more power. The hero, known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, is an adventurer whose soul has been taken, which allows them to constantly return to life. The Vestige is killed by Mannimarco in a sacrificial ritual and they are brought to &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, where they awaken to find a mysterious man known as the Prophet, who, with the help of Lyris Titanborn, helps the Vestige escape Coldharbour, freeing the Prophet, but also imprisoning Lyris within Coldharbour. Once the Vestige escapes Coldharbour, they awaken in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and are let loose upon the dangerous world.\nAlliances.\nIn the game, there are three major playable factions fighting against one another in the conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. Those factions, made up of the different races found throughout Tamriel, are the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther factions.\nOther factions in the game include:\nExploration.\n\"The Elder Scrolls Online\" spans across all of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. From the dry desert wastes of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the tropical jungles of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, a huge variety of environs can be explored.\nAll of the provinces of Tamriel are explorable to a fairly large degree. &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; is accessible once the character reaches level 10. The dark realm of Coldharbour is accessible once the Vestige completes &lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;The Weight of Three Crowns&lt;/a&gt;. However, most provinces are only able to be traveled to in a limited capacity. In fact, the only provinces explorable in their entireties are &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, new areas will be released to the game through DLC.\nEach zone is roughly 3 square kilometers in size and Cyrodiil is 27 square kilometers in size, and there are over 20 zones, meaning the explorable game world in \"Online\" is significantly larger than the previous three installments in the franchise.\nPrior to the \"One Tamriel\" update in 2016, exploration throughout the game's zones was restricted based on your level\u2014zones were not locked (with the exception of DLC areas), but if you ventured to areas beyond your level, they would become difficult to the point of impossibility. However, this changed with the One Tamriel update, meaning you can explore any zone you want to regardless of your level. Level scaling was introduced, so that the whole game world has one linear difficulty for all players, similar to the other games in \"The Elder Scrolls\" franchise.\nTraveling.\nThe game world can be explored by foot or by &lt;a href=\"Mounts%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;. There are a variety of mounts that can be ridden\u2014&lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Senche-Cats\"&gt;senche&lt;/a&gt;. All start out with the same base stats but mounts can be trained to become faster, have more stamina and to be able to increase the player character's &lt;a href=\"Inventory%20%28Online%29\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; capacity. They can be fed one of three types of food per day to train their attributes or training books can also be bought from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt; and used at will.\n&lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fast traveling&lt;/a&gt; is also available. Instead of fast travel in the previous games, where one could fast travel to any location, players must travel via &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt;. You can teleport to a wayshrine when using another wayshrine to teleport for free, or you can travel to the wayshrine from the wild, but you must pay a sum of gold if it is done in this way.\nFast travel in Cyrodiil is different from the rest of the zones. Instead of wayshrines, characters can travel to keeps and outposts that their alliance controls via the &lt;a href=\"Transitus%20network\"&gt;Transitus network&lt;/a&gt;. Players can not fast travel to anywhere without using a Transitus shrine at a keep or alliance base camp, nor can players travel directly to resources. To fast-travel to another keep using the Transitus, that keep must be linked to the keep the player is traveling from - for example, if &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road%20Keep\"&gt;Blue Road Keep&lt;/a&gt; is owned by the Pact but &lt;a href=\"Chalman%20Keep\"&gt;Chalman Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakelowe%20Keep\"&gt;Drakelowe Keep&lt;/a&gt; are owned by the Covenant, Pact players cannot travel to Blue Road Keep via Transitus.\nCombat and gameplay.\nCharacter stats and progression.\nThere are three primary stats:\nAnd six secondary stats:\nAs your character levels up, they will be given one point to place in the health, magicka, or stamina stats, similar to the system in . Secondary Stats can be affected by numerous factors, such as armor traits, enchantments, buffs and &lt;a href=\"Mundus%20Stones%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mundus stone&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 which are used to give special passive abilities, similar to the &lt;a href=\"standing%20stones\"&gt;standing stones&lt;/a&gt; found in \"{Skyrim\" and have the same names, but they give different boons.\nA maximum of 64 points can be earned to put into your primary attributes. Players can change how their attribute points are distributed by visiting a shrine of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; in your faction's capital city (Wayrest, Elden Root and Mournhold, respectively) and paying a sum of gold, or purchasing an &lt;a href=\"Attribute%20Respecification%20Scroll\"&gt;Attribute Respecification Scroll&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt; for 700 Crowns.\nLevels.\nThe game has 50 levels that are attained by earning XP from questing, exploring, killing enemies, PvP and almost all other activities.\nPrior to the \"Dark Brotherhood\" update on May 31st 2016, after a player character has reached Level 50, they unlocked &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Ranks\"&gt;Veteran Ranks&lt;/a&gt;. Veteran Ranks were used to progress in all content after Level 50, such as &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;, and they acted just like normal levels\u2014XP was earned to increase them just like normal levels, and there were 16 Veteran Ranks in total.\nWhen the \"Dark Brotherhood\" update launched, Veteran Ranks were removed entirely and the maximum level was set at 50, with character progression now based on Champion Points (\"see below\").\nChampion Points.\nOnce the player's first character reaches level 50, they will unlock &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Points\"&gt;Champion Points&lt;/a&gt;, which can be spent across three constellations - &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, with each having a certain \"theme\" - Warrior passives are based around reducing the damage you take and protecting your character, Thief passives are based around reducing how much stamina/magicka you use and how fast ones resources recharge, and Mage passives are based around increasing your damage output.\nEach constellation has 3 separate trees, with 8 passive abilities in each. Four of these passives can be leveled up by Champion Points, up to a maximum of 100 per passive, and the other four are unlocked depending on how much points have been spent in the sub-constellation e.g. 10 points, 30 points, and the 4th is unlocked after 120 points. The system is similar to 's skill trees.\nChampion Points are shared across all characters on a player's account - i.e. if your main character has 200 Champion Points, any new characters you make will have 200 Champion Points as well which can be spent at any level, not just 50. However, any additional Champion Points you earn on your main character will not carry over to your new character.\nThe maximum number of Champion Points you can spend is 167 points per tree, with this number changing with certain updates. Some post-level 50 equipment is locked based on your number of Champion Points, up to 160.\nPlayer vs. Player (PvP).\n&lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player\"&gt;Player vs. Player&lt;/a&gt; combat is available after &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 10. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; revolves around the capturing of &lt;a href=\"Fortifications\"&gt;keeps&lt;/a&gt;, their surrounding supply lines, and &lt;a href=\"outposts\"&gt;outposts&lt;/a&gt;. If a keep isn't defended well (which is unlikely \u2013 there are usually players defending their faction's keeps everywhere in Cyrodiil) a keep can be taken by a small group of players. If it is heavily defended, a much larger force with more &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapons\"&gt;siege weapons&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of co-ordination is required. Sometimes, individual battles can last for hours.\nCampaigns.\nHundreds of players from all three factions can be in Cyrodiil (Which is roughly 27 square kilometers in size, not including the many areas such as &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt;, houses, &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Online%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt; etc.) at a time per &lt;a href=\"Campaigns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;, a kind of \"sub-server\" to mitigate overpopulation. There are several different campaigns on each platform. You can join two campaigns at once \u2013 one home campaign and one guest campaign. A guest campaign is usually for when there is a long queue for your home campaign or if you wish to play with a friend who is in the guest campaign, but you cannot increase your leaderboard ranking while in a guest campaign \u2013 you may only increase your leaderboard ranking in your home campaign.\nEach campaign has a duration, e.g. 30 days for Campaign A, 2 weeks for Campaign B, and so on. Once the duration is up, the faction leaderboards reset and whatever faction was at the top of the leaderboards wins the campaign, and the winners receive a large sum of gold. The runners-up will also receive a smaller amount of gold, and this reward is increased based on your contribution to the campaign which is determined by your reward tier, which goes up to Level 3 and is increased the more you PvP. Once the campaign resets, keep and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; ownership does not change, the only thing that happens is a reset of the faction and player leaderboards, and the war resumes once again.\nSome campaigns have certain rules \u2013 e.g. in some campaigns Champion Point bonuses are disabled.\nSiege Weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20Weapons\"&gt;Siege Weapons&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e and &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s are used to attack and defend keeps in Cyrodiil. Each siege weapon is suited to a particular role in PvP combat e.g. &lt;a href=\"trebuchet\"&gt;trebuchet&lt;/a&gt;s are for destroying structures, ballistas are used to take out enemy siege weapons, and so on. Siege weapons can be purchased for a varying amount of &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Points\"&gt;Alliance Points&lt;/a&gt;, the PvP currency, from &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Quartermasters\"&gt;quartermasters&lt;/a&gt; in keeps, and there are 5 types of siege weapons \u2013 &lt;a href=\"flaming%20oil\"&gt;flaming oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battering%20Rams%20%28Online%29\"&gt;battering rams&lt;/a&gt;, ballistae, catapults and trebuchets. ballistae, catapults and trebuchets each have variations with special effects, such as fire trebuchets and scattershot catapults which give enemy players various damaging effects depending on what sort of siege weapon they were hit with. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fire-based&lt;/a&gt; siege weapons are very powerful and are capable of breaking up large groups.\nAlliance Ranks.\nAlliance Ranks are an alternative advancement system, with 50 ranks. Each rank will give a new &lt;a href=\"Titles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;title&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes a new armor &lt;a href=\"dye\"&gt;dye&lt;/a&gt; and a new alliance icon on a player's name tag, similar to faction ranks in and . They take a very long time to earn, and Grand Warlord is the highest alliance rank available. Increasing your alliance rank will also increase your Assault and Support skill lines and will allow you to unlock new abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20Detonation\"&gt;Magicka Detonation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vigor&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance Ranks are similar to combat ranks found in the multiplayer components of various first-person shooter games.\nEmperorship.\nYou are able to become the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Cyrodiil. To crown an Emperor, your faction must be in control of the 6 &lt;a href=\"Fortifications\"&gt;keeps&lt;/a&gt; surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Chalman%20Keep\"&gt;Chalman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road%20Keep\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Roebeck\"&gt;Roebeck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ash%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Aleswell\"&gt;Aleswell&lt;/a&gt;) simultaneously. Once this is done, the player at the top of your alliance's leaderboards will become the Emperor.

Once she bought back a bright, shiny scale she was convinced belong to a dragon. Her grandfather said it was nothing but a piece of &lt;a href=\"wamasu\"&gt;wamasu&lt;/a&gt; hide and cuffed her for going too far away from the house.\nBut that didn't discourage Iori. She wanted to find a dragon, so she kept searching. Iori strayed further and further from her grandparents' hut until, one day, she got caught in a rainstorm. She took cover in a nearby cave but found the floor full of brackish water. Picking her way around the pool, Iori made it to the back of the cave and came upon something she'd never expected to see\u2014a large, green egg!\nThe egg, half-buried in warm mud, pulsed with life. Iori knew it had to be a dragon egg. All her grandpa's stories said dragon eggs were big, and hard, and warm. This egg was very, very warm.\nAnd it was alone. There was no sign of the mother dragon, or anyone else. Iori knew if the egg hatched now, there would be no one to take care of the baby dragon and it would die.\n\"I can't bring it back home,\" she said. \"Gram'll want to smash it, or cook it!\" Her gram didn't believe in dragons and eggs, in her world, were food.\n\"I can't stay here, either,\" she thought about the hiding she'd get if she came back after dark. \"What am I going to do?\"\nIori sat and thought while the rain poured down. \"The storm's getting worse,\" she thought. \"I can't go back now\u2014I'll just get lost or sick. Gram'll understand.\" And, so, Iori convinced herself she should stay overnight. And she did.\nThe next morning, Iori woke to the sun shining in the cave mouth. She was famished, as hungry as she'd ever been, but her first thoughts were of the egg. Iori dug it out of its warm, mud nest and examined it. The egg was hot!\n\"It must be just ready to hatch!\" she exclaimed. But almost as if in answer, she heard a growl from outside the cave. \"Maybe that's the mother dragon?\" she thought. But the thought of being trapped in a dragon cave didn't make her feel good at all.\nIori heard the growl again, followed by sniffing. It wasn't a dragon outside! It was a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt;! Picking up the egg with one hand and a stone with the other, Iori crept out of the cave. There, she saw a wild guar, nose to the ground. It saw her and sniffed.\n\"You can't have it!\" Iori exclaimed, throwing the rock at the guar. It hit the creature right in the nose, hard enough to make it yelp. But this guar wasn't like the tame ones back home. She'd never heard a tame one snarl, and this one started pawing at the ground angrily.\nIori ran. The guar chased her a little way and the young girl grew frightened. She clutched the egg to her chest, protecting it from the tree branches and the occasional fall. She ran long after the guar gave up chasing her, she was so frightened. Eventually, when Iori was too tired to run anymore, she fell to her knees.\n\"I think we're safe, little dragon,\" she said\u2014but then gasped in horror. She looked down at the egg and there was a crack! \"Oh, no!\" Iori wailed. She must have held it too tight, or let a branch hit it. Or\u2014\nAnother crack appeared, and then another. The shell started to fall away, being pushed from the inside.\n\"You're hatching!\" Iori said. She looked around wildly, not sure what to do. She stooped to put the egg down but then hesitated\u2014what if the dragon ran away? But she didn't want to hurt it, either, so she sat cross-legged and made a hammock out of her dirty apron. Iori put the egg in her lap.\nIt continued to shake and break and, soon, a dragon's nose poked out of the hole! It was bright green and a bit slimy-looking, but the eyes opened and looked up at her. A forked tongue licked out of the wedge-shaped head and Iori felt a rush of excitement. The dragon was hatching!\nThe rest of the egg broke away, but Iori was surprised to see the \"dragon\" had no claws\u2014no feet or legs of any kind. It was a snake, but a &lt;a href=\"Sep%20Adder\"&gt;snake with tiny wings&lt;/a&gt;. Most of her friends would've been horrified, holding a baby snake in their laps, but Iori was amazed. She'd heard stories of dragons, but never a snake with wings!\nAfter the creature struggled free of its shell, Iori carefully discarded the shards and put her hands around the winged snake. It was a bit cold, but she felt it grow warmer as it snuggled up in her hands. With sleeping, serpent's eyes, the creature looked up at Iori. It blinked twice, then fell asleep.\n\"Well, you're almost a dragon, aren't you?\""}

Travel to Cheydinhal and speak with the &lt;a href=\"Beggars%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;beggars&lt;/a&gt; marked on the map. If their &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; towards the Hero is high enough, they will tell them to look in the chapel.\nGo to the Cheydinhal chapel and enter the Undercroft down the stairs. Be cautious, as there is a guard posted. It is recommended to &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; past.\nIf they are noticed by the guard, she will become hostile and attack them. If the Hero escapes after being seen, the guards will attack the chapel guard. It is advised to avoid looting the tomb of &lt;a href=\"Llathasa%20Indarys\"&gt;Llathasa Indarys&lt;/a&gt;, as her ghost will come out and attack the Hero.\nTravel back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;. It will be discovered that the guards, including &lt;a href=\"Hieronymus%20Lex\"&gt;Hieronymus Lex&lt;/a&gt;, have overrun the place, and have issued an arrest warrant for Armand, who has gone into hiding.\nFind some of the other Thieves' Guild members and ask what has happened. They will tell the Hero that &lt;a href=\"Methredhel\"&gt;Methredhel&lt;/a&gt; is looking for them. She is actively seeking them out to give an update on the situation. She can be located in the &lt;a href=\"My%20Imperial%20City%20House\"&gt;Shack for Sale&lt;/a&gt; or inside her own house. Alternatively, the Hero can wait, and she will eventually appear. Upon being questioned, it will become clear that the job was an elaborate charade designed to expose the Hero and, in turn, frame a traitor in the Thieves' Guild, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Myvryna%20Arano\"&gt;Myvryna Arano&lt;/a&gt;, the same woman who delivers the invitations to the Thieves' Guild.\nThe same stolen item that revealed her treachery is now to be used to turn Lex against her. Methredhel wants the Hero to frame her for the crime by placing the bust in a cupboard at her house. The swarm of guards will continue to bolt throughout the Waterfront area, and Lex will remain in constant line of sight, so a high sneak skill will be required to enter Myvryna Arano's house unseen. It is also possible to repeatedly walk into Lex in order to push him to a position where he cannot see the Hero trying to break into the house, which reduces the required sneak skill.\nThe guards thin out but do not disperse entirely, even after several days. Be careful to not be seen breaking into her house. &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chameleon&lt;/a&gt; effects may be preferable to &lt;a href=\"Stealth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; alone. Once inside, place the statuette in \"Myvryna's Cupboard\", which is the cupboard nearest the door and next to her bed.\nGo outside and find Lex. If his &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; is low towards the Hero, he will not believe the story. However, once it is at least 71, the Hero can convince him that Myvryna stole the bust and to search Myvryna's house. After finding the bust, Lex will confront her. However, despite trying to defend herself and even mention that the Hero is the real thief, Lex will not believe her, and will arrest her for the theft.\nReturn to the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20Dareloth\"&gt;Garden of Dareloth&lt;/a&gt; and speak to Armand next midnight. He will give the Hero the reward money, and explain the reason why they used them in such a way."}

She will tell you that she is here to retrieve a relic called the Emerald Chalice. Said chalice was stolen from the Mages Guild by a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Malofar\"&gt;Malofar&lt;/a&gt;; Lady Laurent has sent hirelings into the cave to look around, but they have not returned.\nHead into the cave and start looking for the hirelings. If you simply head down the path, you will spot a dead hireling with &lt;a href=\"Note%20from%20Theomund\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; next to his body. It will mention that they solved the puzzle to get into the chamber where the chalice is held; runestones of a whale, an eagle and a snake are needed. The dead man's friend apparently made it into the chamber, but his fate is uncertain.\nFrom this point onward, goblins will appear throughout the cave. Your next task is to gather all three runestones; these can be collected in any order. The closest to you is the eagle runestone, which is just south of you, on the goblin altar. For the whale runestone, head through the passageway to the south. In the room with the water, you will find goblins praying to an altar with the whale runestone on it. Finally, for the snake runestone, head to the northwest of the map and up to the second floor. Take the turn to the south, then head into the western path. You will again see a group of goblins praying to the runestone; kill them and take it.\nOnce you have all the runestones, head for the door on the southeast side of the second floor. You will see three altars in front of it, with runes resembling the snake, whale and eagle runestones. Place the runestones on the appropriate pedestal and the door will open to the inner sanctum. Head inside; you will see the chalice ahead, guarded by Malofar and two goblin shamans. They will be hostile; kill them and take the chalice, then leave the inner sanctum. You will notice a &lt;a href=\"Amberic\"&gt;Strange Goblin&lt;/a&gt; standing outside; he will be non-hostile so you can speak to him. He will claim that it is actually a Breton; he cannot explain here what happened to him, but he will offer to guide you past the goblins to the outside.\nFollow the goblin to the exit area, then talk to him again. he will tell you that anyone who drinks from the cup will turn into a goblin, and will be subjected to the control of the person who owns the cup. This goblin was one of the men Lady Laurent sent to retrieve the cup, but he fell for its curse. He will suggest getting Lady Laurent to drink from the cup to \"show her.\"\nHead back outside and talk to Lady Laurent. You can either tell her the truth about what the chalice does or lie to her that it gives you amazing powers. If the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; hides the secret of the cup from Lady Clarisse, Stibbons is turned into a goblin. If the Vestige tells Lady Clarisse what the chalice does, she will use it to turn Amberic back into a human. Doing so will inadvertently turn Stibbons into a goblin. Either way, the quest will be over."}

When the Vestige gets there, he sees two mages, &lt;a href=\"Juline%20Ginis\"&gt;Juline Ginis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mim\"&gt;Mim&lt;/a&gt;. Juline appears to be injured and Mim leaves shortly after the Vestige approaches them. Juline tasks the Vestige with planting strange seeds that &lt;a href=\"Angof%20\"&gt;Angof &lt;/a&gt; has given here saying it will help.\nTo plant the seeds, the Vestige must find 5 dead Heritance soldiers and use the seeds on them. After completing the task, the Vestige returns to Juline. Upon returning to Juline, they will meet Angof who tells them that she will survive and that Angof has to play the game as well.\nNow the Vestige can move on to help other two mages.\nIf helping out Mim, the Vestige must find &lt;a href=\"Thalik%20Wormfather\"&gt;Thalik Wormfather&lt;/a&gt;'s rune circle and bring him the rune Mim gave them. The Vestige must now use the rune in the circle next to Thalik and they will turn into a skeleton. The Vestige must now charge the rune by slaying foes. The players must be vary though because after a short while, they will turn back to human form. To retain the Transformed form, they must go back to the circle near Thalik Wormfather.\nAfter successfully charging the rune, The Vestige has to return to Mim and after a short conversation with him, the Vestige can go aid the last mage, Relmus.\n&lt;a href=\"Relmus%20\"&gt;Relmus &lt;/a&gt; will be on a nearby cliff standing over it, apparently wishing to jump of the edge. After persuading him to speak, the Vestige finds out he lost the shadow &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;Lady Estre&lt;/a&gt; gave him, saying that he \"wasn't fit to own such a fine shadow.\" After finding his lost shadow, the shadow tasks the Vestige to find Lady Estre's mask which has been broken into three pieces.\nFirst piece can be found just to the west, underneath a bridge leading up, very close to the river. The second one is just to the south of last one, inside of a circle made by some stones. The last one is to the east of previous one, in the river. After finding all three pieces, the Vestige has to return to the shadow where they will meet Lady Estre herself. She will tell them she wants to set their differences aside and win the game together.\nThe Vestige now must speak to the Observer in the Observer's Watch. If the Vestige wants to defeat the Observer in his game, they must choose a side. No matter who's side is chosen, the reward stays the same and the quest it over."}

Without it, people will not help the Vestige.\nShaman Bogham convinced Moramat there was never a curse and thus, she wants the poisoner to be brought to justice. She asks the Vestige to question the unafflicted, or the Vestige can go on their own in discovering poisoner's identity.\nIf the Vestige decides to go on their own, they will have to return to the tin mine and find a corpse of a spider with knife stabbed into the venom sac. The Vestige can now go and ask Shakul, the strongholds forge-wife, to whom it belongs. She believes it belongs to Rakhaz, her apprentice, who is, according to her, a \"slow-learner.\"\nIf the Vestige opts to question the unafflicted, they will hear that &lt;a href=\"Namoroth\"&gt;Namoroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sharnag%20gro-Barkbite\"&gt;Sharnag gro-Barkbite&lt;/a&gt; were training at the gates at the time of the poisoning, &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20Bogham\"&gt;Shaman Bogham&lt;/a&gt; was collecting alchemical supplies and &lt;a href=\"Shakul\"&gt;Shakul&lt;/a&gt; was alone at her forge while her apprentice &lt;a href=\"Rakhaz\"&gt;Rakhaz&lt;/a&gt; was checking weapons at the longhouse. Moramat will corroborate most of those stories, but she will tell you that she never saw Rakhaz at the longhouse that day. \nAfter confronting Rakhaz, she will confirm that she did poison the well water, but only because &lt;a href=\"Gargak\"&gt;Gargak&lt;/a&gt;, the current Chief's brother, is the rightful chief. Telling her what Moramat did, she does not sound surprised at all, saying how foolish that girl is.\nShe will ask the Vestige, if they are willing, to put a stop to Gargak and his madness."}

Whether or not the tale is true, it remains an interesting story of survival.\nThe reader will, I trust, forgive me if I translated the epic somewhat informally. The message, I think, is universal, and should not be misread.\nEnjoy, gentle reader.\nA.J.J.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Falcon\"&gt;Grey Falcon&lt;/a&gt; , a small warship of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Sumurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Was patrolling deep in the ocean for a pirate That had been looting the coast. The first three weeks out were uneventful. Two hours after sunset, on the 22nd day out of port, The lookout spotted a top of a sail in the moonlight, Just on the horizon. \"Sail! To starboard, forward quarter!\" The lookout of the Grey Falcon cried. The crew and captain of the &lt;a href=\"Grey%20Falcon\"&gt;Grey Falcon&lt;/a&gt; were quickly roused, And stumbled to the deck. \"'Tis the ship we're looking for, Captain,\" said the lookout.\n\"All hands to battle stations! All archers to their posts,\" The Captain yelled, \"Full ahead!\" The two ships closed, And a dark figure stepped out onto the forecastle of the pirate ship. The figure made a gesture with his hands, And a giant ball of fire streaked towards the Grey Falcon. The ball of fire struck the Grey Falcon in her sails, Quickly catching them aflame.\nThe figure made another gesture. Large bolts of ice streaked out from his hands, And hit the Grey Falcon just above and below the water line, Gouging large holes in her hull. The Grey Falcon was mortally wounded. The Captain cried, \"All hands abandon shi-\" As he was cut off by a pirate's arrow shot into his throat.\nAs the Grey Falcon, aflame and listing badly, plunged into the sea, One of her sailors, &lt;a href=\"Darik%20Seaspit\"&gt;Darik Seaspit&lt;/a&gt;, Managed avoid the pirate arrows and spells to make his way to a lifeboat, And lowered it into the darkness below. Just as the lifeboat entered the water, a quick grey shape jumped into it. Darik looked, and saw it was &lt;a href=\"Helnor%20Snarlsbane\"&gt;Helnor Snarlsbane&lt;/a&gt;, A &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; mercenary assigned to the ship. The two rowed the small boat away, As the Grey Falcon finished her descent into the sea. In the darkness, the Pirate ship missed their small craft. After the two rowed well out of the pirates possible view, They both collapsed from exhaustion.\nEarly morning the next day, They took an inventory of the lifeboats stores. Normally the lifeboat carries enough food and water To supply seven people for at least ten days.\nIn place of the food, though, Helnor found a note: \"The food in this lifeboat was found to be in violation of &lt;a href=\"Sumerset\"&gt;Sumerset&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Navy\"&gt;Navy&lt;/a&gt; regulation during inspection. In accordance to that article, the food was taken away and destroyed. A replacement may be obtained by redeeming this letter at the Port Supply Office. Signed, Lt. Inspector &lt;a href=\"Windhollow\"&gt;Windhollow&lt;/a&gt;\" Helnor read aloud.\nSaid Darik, to his Khajiit Companion, \"We have plenty of water, but we are out of food. I don't know what we're going to do. I suppose we could try fishing, but we have no bait. \"There's no chance we can make it back to land Before we starve to death - 'twill be over a month in this craft\" \"Wait, I have an idea\" said Helnor, with a gleam in his catlike eye.\nSix weeks later, the lifeboat entered the port of &lt;a href=\"Corwich\"&gt;Corwich&lt;/a&gt;. As it was tethered to the dock, a solitary figure was pulled out, Looking weather beaten and thin. One of the dock workers peered into the life raft, After the figure was taken away to the port healer for treatment. \"Hmm, what's this\", a worker said to himself, As he picked up a large bone from the boat, A bone bleached white by the sun.\nAfter the sole survivor of the Grey Falcon recovered from his ordeal, He was taken to the inquest for the death of Darik Seaspit, And placed on a chair before the magistrate. \"We here in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; have a dim view of cannibalism. You'd better have a good reason for your actions,\" The inquisitor boomed at &lt;a href=\"Helnor%20Snarlsbane\"&gt;Helnor Snarlsbane&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"By the Lady, do you?\" Helnor stood, and said, \"Your Honor, I had no choice. There was no food, and it was at least two months to the closest port. We both decided this was the only way someone would make it\" \"Well, then , I suppose that is understandable, If somewhat distasteful,\" the inquisitor said. \"You think it was distasteful?,\" Helnor muttered to himself, \"I didn't have any seasoning.\"\n\"One final thing, Mr. Snarlsbane, How was it decided that you would be the one that would dine on the other? The toss of a coin?\" Helnor drew himself up and said, \"Your honor, it was very simple. Darik Seaspit was a vegetarian\" \"Case dismissed!\""}

Everything that her parents had dreamed she would be. As perfect as she was, they could not help but have dreams for her. Her father, a bit of a social climber named Munthen, thought she would marry well, perhaps become a Princess of the Empire. Her mother, an insecure woman named Cinneta, thought she would reach greatness on her own, as a knight or a sorceress. As much as they wanted the very best for their daughter, they argued about what her fate would be, but both were wrong. Instead of growing up, she grew very ill.\nThe Temples told them to give up hope, and The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; told them that what afflicted Vralla was so rare, so deadly, that there was no cure. She was doomed to die, and soon.\nWhen the great institutions of the Empire failed them, Munthen and Cinneta sought out the witches, the sorcerer hermits, and the other hidden, secret powers that lurk in the shadows of civilization.\n'I can think of only one place you can go,' said an old herbalist they found in the most remote peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. 'The Mages Guild at &lt;a href=\"Olenveld\"&gt;Olenveld&lt;/a&gt;.' \n'But we have already been to the Mages Guild,' protested Munthen. 'They couldn't help us.' \"\n'Go to Olenveld,\" the herbalist insisted. \"And tell no one that you're going there.' \nIt was not easy to find Olenveld, as it did not appear on any modern map. In a bookseller's in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, however, they found it in a historic book of cartography from the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;2nd Era&lt;/a&gt;. In the yellowed pages, there was Olenveld, a city on an island in the northern coast, a day's sail in summertide from &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBundling their pale daughter against the chill of the ocean wind, the couple set sail, using the old map as their only guide. For nearly two days, they were at sea, circling the same position, wondering if they were the victim of a cruel trick. And then they saw it.\nIn the mist of crashing waves were twin crumbled statues framing the harbor, long forgotten Gods or heroes. The ships within were half-sunk, rotten shells along the docks. Munthen brought his ship in, and the three walked into the deserted island city.\nTaverns with broken windows, a plaza with a dried-up well, shattered palaces and fire-blackened tenements, barren shops and abandoned stables, all desolate, all still, but for the high keening ocean wind that whistled through the empty places. And gravestones. Every road and alley was lined, and crossed, and crossed again with memorials to the dead.\nMunthen and Cinneta looked at one another. The chill they felt had little to do with the wind. Then they looked at Vralla, and continued on to their goal - the Mages Guild of Olenveld.\nCandlelight glistened through the windows of the great dark building, but it brought them little relief to know that someone was alive in the island of death. They knocked on the door, and steeled themselves against whatever horror they might face within.\nThe door was opened by a rather plump middle-aged &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; woman with frizzy blond hair. Standing behind her, a meek-looking bald Nord about her age, a shy teenage &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; couple, still very pimply and awkward, and a very old, apple-cheeked Breton man who grinned with delight at the visitors.\n'Oh, my goodness,' said the Nord woman, all afluster. 'I thought my ears must be fooling me when I heard that door a-knockin'. Come in, come in, it's so cold!' \nThe three were ushered in the door, and they were relieved to find that the Guild did not look abandoned in the least. It was well swept, well lit, and cheerfully decorated. The group fell into introductions. The inhabitants of the Guildhouse in Olenveld were two families, the Nords Jalmar and Nette, and the Bretons Lywel, Rosalyn, and old Wynster. They were friendly and accommodating, immediately bringing some mulled wine and bread while Munthen and Cinneta explained to them what they were doing there, and what the healers and herbalists had said about Vralla.\n'So, you see,' said Cinneta, tearfully. 'We didn't think we'd find the Mages Guild in Olenveld, but now that we have, please, you're our last hope.' \nThe five strangers also had tears in their eyes. Nette wept particularly noisily.\n'Oh, you've been through too, too much,' the Nord woman bawled. 'Of course, we'll help. Your little girl will be right as rain.' \n'It is fair to tell you,' said Jalmar, more stoically, though he clearly was also touched by the tale. 'This is a Guildhouse, but we are not Mages. We took this building because it was abandoned and it serves our purposes since the Exodus. We are &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;.' \n'Necromancers?' Cinneta quivered. How could these nice people be anything so horrible?\n'Yes, dear,' Nette smiled, patting her hand. 'I know. We have a bad reputation, I'm afraid. Never was very good, and now that well-meaning but foolish &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Archmagister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt; - '\n'May the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Worm King&lt;/a&gt; eat his soul!' cried the old man quite suddenly and very viciously.\n'Now, now, Wynster,' said the teenage girl Rosalyn, blushing and smiling at Cinneta apologetically. 'I'm sorry about him. He's usually very sweet-natured.'\n'Well, of course, he's right, Mannimarco will have the last say in the matter,' Jalmar said. 'But right now, it's all very, well, awkward. When Traven officially banned the art, we had to go into hiding. The only other option was to abandon it altogether, and that's just foolish, though there are many who have done it.' \n'Not many people know about Olenveld anymore since &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; used it as his own personal graveyard,' said Lywel. 'Took us a week to find it again. But it's perfect for us. Lots of dead bodies, you know \u2026' \n'Lywel!' Rosalyn admonished him. 'You're going to scare them!' \n'Sorry,' Lywel grinned sheepishly.\n'I don't care what you do here,' said Munthen sternly. 'I just want to know what you can do for my daughter.' \n'Well,' said Jalmar with a shrug. 'I guess we can make it so she doesn't die and is never sick again.' \nCinneta gasped, 'Please! We'll give you everything we have!'\n'Nonsense,' said Nette, picking up Vralla in her big, beefy arms. 'Oh, what a beautiful girl. Would you like to feel better, little sweetheart?' \nVralla nodded, wearily.\n'You stay here,' Jalmar said. 'Rosalyn, I'm sure we have something better than bread to offer these nice folks.' \nNette started to carry Vralla away, but Cinneta ran after her. 'Wait, I'm coming too.' \n'Oh, I'm sure you would, but it'd ruin the spell, dear,' Nette said. 'Don't worry about a thing. We've done this dozens of times.' \nMunthen puts his arms around his wife, and she relented. Rosalyn hurried off to the kitchen and brought some roast fowl and more mulled wine for them. They sat in silence and ate.\nWynster shuddered suddenly. 'The little girl has died.'\n'Oh!' Cinneta gasped.\n'What in Oblivion do you mean?!' Munthen cried.\n'Wynster, was that really necessary?' Lywel scowled at the old man, before turning to Munthen and Cinneta. 'She had to die. &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; is not about curing a disease, it's about resurrection, total regeneration, transforming the whole body, not just the parts that aren't working now.'\nMunthen stood up, angrily. 'If those maniacs killed her -'\n'They didn't,' Rosalyn snapped, her shy eyes now showing fire. 'Your daughter was on her last breath when she came in here, anyone could see that. I know that this is hard, horrible even, but I won't have you call that sweet couple who are only trying to help you, 'maniacs.\nCinneta burst into tears, 'But she's going to live now? Isn't she?'\n'Oh yes,' Lywel said, smiling broadly.\n'Oh, thank you, thank you,' Cinneta burst into tears. 'I don't know what we would have done -'\n'I know how you feel,' said Rosalyn, patting Wynster's hand fondly. 'When I thought we were going to lose him, I was willing to do anything, just like you.'\nCinneta smiled. 'How old is your father?'\n'My son,' Rosalyn corrected her. 'He's six.'\nFrom the other room came the sound of tiny footsteps.\n'Vralla, go give your parents a big hug,' said Jalmar.\nMunthen and Cinneta turned, and the screaming began."}

While she herself has written many tales of her exploits, I find that she often does not reveal the true &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of her profession. She is not a woman for flair, of course. She sticks to the facts, which in and of themselves are intriguing. But she discounts the true wonder of her methods, the breathtaking feats she accomplishes with little to no effort, the sheer beauty of her talent! It is my duty to try to encapsulate the greatness that is Claudina in these writings.\nTHE CASE OF THE CURSED STABLE\nMost recently, Claudina and I were called to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to address a family's concern about their stables. They'd reported strange sightings, noises and a general unease from their &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;. One of the elder siblings claimed to have seen an apparition. She said the &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be trying to communicate, but she was unable to understand it.\nClaudina took to the case immediately. She set up wards around the stable and spread smelling salts around each stall. The horses weren't too pleased, but they tolerated it. Hours passed and nothing happened. The family went to bed, but Claudina stayed up to keep watch. She stood vigil over the stable for hours, saying nothing, merely observing. As thrilled as I was to be part of such an experience, even I became to succumb to weariness. I could barely keep my eyes open! But Claudina never wavered. She continued her watch like a statue.\nThen\u2014finally! We heard whispering all around us. A shimmer began to dance in the air as the spirit became ensnared in one of Claudina's wards. It gave a terrible roar, and I (to my great embarrassment) screamed like a child. Claudina was unruffled, of course, and merely stood to greet the phantom. In a low, commanding voice she said, \"Tell us your purpose.\"\nThe spirit molded itself into the shape of a &lt;a href=\"man\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt;, though his clothes were from a time long ago. He looked perturbed, as if we were an inconvenience. I didn't believe he would speak but then he opened his mouth and with perfect clarity answered, \"I've been trying to tell them! They built this stable over my grave!\"\nClaudina spoke with the spirit for a long while. While I could not possibly transcribe their entire conversation, I can say that it very much resembled an impatient customer arguing with a levelheaded merchant. Claudina listened to the spirit's concerns, nodded at appropriate times and asked a few questions.\nAnd that was that! When Claudina was done with the spirit, she conferred with the family and asked them to build their stable somewhere else. They were more than happy to have such an amicable end to their ghost problem that they got to work right away. I feel it necessary to mention that the family offered Claudina quite a large sum for her work, but she declined. When I asked her about this, she said \"They did not have much, and I did them no great service. It was simple enough. They should keep their gold.\""}

Serving as the final quest in the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; questline, it culminates in a battle against &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; becoming &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; upon emerging victorious.\nBackground.\n\"The Staff of Magnus has been recovered, and so it's time to assault the College of Winterhold and strike down Ancano.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe College of Winterhold is now caught in an increasingly unstable maelstrom of magic\u2014so much so that it has disappeared from the world map. At the College, the mages are caught up in a battle with the &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Anomalies\"&gt;Magic Anomalies&lt;/a&gt;, although helping them defeat the creatures is optional.\nInto the Eye of the Maelstrom.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; can be used to force clear the way across the courtyard and into the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. There are likely to be one or more &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Anomalies\"&gt;Magic Anomalies&lt;/a&gt; just inside the whirling force screen.\nUpon arriving at the Hall of the Elements, Ancano is waiting, directing energy of some kind at the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. He is well aware of the Dragonborn's presence. The mad elf spots them and &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, then begins taunting and crowing that he is so far beyond any pitiful attempts at magic that he cannot be touched.\nUnfortunately, this is true, as Tolfdir's aimed fireball dissipates harmlessly. The old mage has just enough time to tell the Dragonborn to bring out the Staff of Magnus and use it on the Eye before an enraged Ancano strikes him\u2014and anyone else (such as followers) in the vicinity\u2014with a &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Paralysis\"&gt;Mass Paralysis&lt;/a&gt; spell, leaving the Dragonborn standing alone.\nAncano decides to finish the Dragonborn himself, opening the Eye of Magnus and tapping into its full and incredible power.\nNote: It is possible to keep Ancano from paralyzing Tolfdir and any other follower by blocking the former's Mass Paralysis spell with a magic ward.\nDefeating Ancano.\nNote that any followers cannot aid in the fight and will likely attack Tolfdir after the magic anomalies are defeated, so it will be impossible to complete the quest with one around.\nWhile the Eye is open, Ancano is invincible. When the Eye is fully open, a casting from the Staff of Magnus absorbs its energy, and the Eye begins to close.\nOnce the Eye is closed, the Dragonborn can start attacking Ancano with effect. Eventually, the Eye reopens, and Ancano becomes invincible again. When the Eye is pried open a second time, several Magic Anomalies are also let loose. Although the Dragonborn must deal with them, their presence has the potential to be very useful, as the soul gems they drop can recharge the staff if it is out of charge. Additionally, the magic anomalies attack Ancano if the Dragonborn is not near him. This quest can be used as a way to farm filled soul gems for training in &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn can use the chamber's topography to an advantage, keeping a healthy distance from Ancano, which allows for more time to maneuver around his spells. Standing behind one of the chamber's many pillars, or the Eye itself, will block the full force of Ancano's attacks. A very easy way to safely battle him is to stand in the Hall of the Elements behind the closed gate after Tolfdir is paralyzed. One can stay safely behind the gate to heal or take a break from the battle, or just to sit back and let a summoned follower do the work.\nAn alternative method, if the Dragonborn has the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Night%20to%20Remember%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;A Night to Remember&lt;/a&gt;,\" is to use it to summon a Dremora after Ancano casts his paralyzing spell. The Dremora will attack Ancano, leaving them free to use the Staff of Magnus on the Eye. The Dremora will make short work of him as soon as the protection of the Eye is removed.\nAnother way of quickly dispatching Ancano is to use high archery skill, have health damaging poison, and carry a powerful bow and arrows. With this combination, it is possible to use the Staff to close the Orb. Immediately after it starts to close, a poisoned bow with glass or stronger arrows can make short work of him.\nOne other method is to get a &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Paralysis\"&gt;Staff of Paralysis&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; spell, and the level 100 archery perk will also work). Once the Eye is closed, the staff or spell can be used to paralyze Ancano. Then he can be killed easily. Alternatively, the Dragonborn may also summon an &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;, which will attack Ancano. The Dragonborn can then proceed to close the eye.\nThe Dragonborn can also rely on the presence of the College's initiates, namely &lt;a href=\"Colette%20Marence\"&gt;Colette Marence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phinis%20Gestor\"&gt;Phinis Gestor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergius%20Turrianus\"&gt;Sergius Turrianus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faralda%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Faralda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drevis%20Neloren\"&gt;Drevis Neloren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt;, who will join the battle and fight Ancano and the Magic Anomalies.\nThe Nick of Time.\nWith the hated &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; now dispatched for good, the Dragonborn can return to Tolfdir. He is thankful that Ancano has been stopped, but has no idea how to dispel the gathering crescendo of power that the Eye of Magnus is exuding. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"Quaranir\"&gt;Quaranir&lt;/a&gt; appears just in the nick of time.\nAlthough he is as cryptic as ever, Quaranir tells the Dragonborn that the Psijic Order always believed in them, and their actions have proved their readiness to lead the College of Winterhold. Now that the Eye has grown unstable, it may not only destroy the College, but also the entire world.\nAncano's actions proved that this world is not ready for such power, so Quaranir prepares to secure the Eye. The Psijic Order will maintain the Eye for now, and he summons his brethren, &lt;a href=\"Gelebros\"&gt;Gelebros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tandil\"&gt;Tandil&lt;/a&gt;, to perform a binding ritual. The monks and the Eye soon disappear from this world.\nAftermath.\nThe quest's namesake relic is transported out of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; by members of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. Tolfdir awards the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;key&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt; as well as his robes.\nAfter this, only the &lt;a href=\"Radiant%20Quests\"&gt;radiant quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Aftershock\"&gt;Aftershock&lt;/a&gt;,\" master-level ritual spell quests, \"&lt;a href=\"Onmund%27s%20Request\"&gt;Onmund's Request&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"&lt;a href=\"J%27zargo%27s%20Experiment\"&gt;J'zargo's Experiment&lt;/a&gt;,\" \"&lt;a href=\"Brelyna%27s%20Practice\"&gt;Brelyna's Practice&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Names\"&gt;Forgotten Names&lt;/a&gt;\" are left to complete for the college."}

How did I not appreciate it before? The green fields of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, the deep woods of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim's&lt;/a&gt; majestic mountains, topped with snow. The dangerous beauty of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. How I missed it all, reduced was I to this &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;city of brass&lt;/a&gt;, surrounted by barren wastelands.\nOr so I thought, for quite the longest time. My life's work as not the study of machines or people, but rather the animals that surround us every day. I despaired when I first came to Clockwork City, thinking my career as a revered naturalist had come to an end. But all I had to do was look a little harder, and eventually I found new species to study, ones made of metal and gears rather than flesh and sinew.\nI've compiled a list of the more memorable species of \"creatures\" found within the city, if I may be so bold as to call them that. Their appearance certainly mimics their more natural counterparts, and strangely enough so does their behavior. What their creators had in mind, I do not know. They seem to hold little function, but rather add life to this barren land.\n&lt;a href=\"Brassilisk%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Brassilisk&lt;/a&gt;\nThe brassilisk is created from interconnected brass squares, exposed copper wiring allowing for its snakelike movement. Popular as a pet, you'll often see them following the quick footsteps of the young scholars. A rather lovely and most prized model mimics the leathery wings of the &lt;a href=\"sep%20adder\"&gt;sep adder&lt;/a&gt;. This creature comes in a variety of colors, and while it may display aggressive behaviour it is not equipped to attack others.\n&lt;a href=\"Skeevaton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeevaton&lt;/a&gt;\nThough I do not delight in speculation, the rumored origins of this creature do fascinate me. The skeevaton takes the form of a copper mouse. It possesses no legs, traveling by a rotating ball fitted within its middle. In a city filled to the brim with mechanizations of all kinds, what could be more inconspicuous? The legend goes that its inventor created the skeevaton with the purpose of spying on his or her fellow scholars. Something to keep in mind the next time you see one of them staring up at you from the alleyway.\n&lt;a href=\"Seht%27s%20Dovah-Fly\"&gt;Seht's Dovah-Fly&lt;/a&gt;\nThis mechanical insect that flutters through the stagnant city air is thought to be a collaboration of two ill-fated lovers. Once again, I'm not usually one for rumor, but this story does have quite the emotional appeal. Two apprentices fell in love, but were forced never to see each other because of a long-standing feud between their lectors. Seht's Dovah-Fly was created as a messenger, delivering communications between them. So impressed were their masters by this elegant creation that they set aside their feud aside and allowed their apprentices to collaborate on future projects. A delightful tale I must admit, whether it be true or not."}
