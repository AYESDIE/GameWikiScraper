A husband. A son or daughter. Mother or father, aunt or uncle: each of us has lost one or more of these. It has touched every family in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, the dreadful epidemic, the terrible plague\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt started in &lt;a href=\"Senchal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, on Sweet Street in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Keirgo\"&gt;Black Keirgo&lt;/a&gt; slums, among the &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;-struck. At first the city elders dismissed it as a toxin in the goods, but then it spread to &lt;a href=\"Dagi\"&gt;Dagi&lt;/a&gt;'s Pride and Squint-Eye, and was reported from the docks in &lt;a href=\"Alabaster\"&gt;Alabaster&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nAnd suddenly, it was everywhere: &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corinthe\"&gt;Corinthe&lt;/a&gt;, and all points in between. The Winds of &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt; bore the coughing and retching to every ear. We seemed to be witnessing the Death of Cats on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSlowly, Elsweyr began to fight back against its doom. Clan Mother Mizaba-ko of Corinthe first identified how the flu spread from &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; to Khajiit. Rathuni-la Dawnwhisker, a Daughter of Azurah from &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt;, distilled a sorghum-tea that mitigated the worst of the symptoms. Even I contributed, organizing the remnants of the Mane's Legion to maintain order and put this new knowledge to use.\nBut it was not enough. Everywhere, Khajiit were dying, by the litter, by the pride, by the entire tribe. The Moon Bishops read the portents, and they were dire indeed.\nThen, past all expectation, help arrived from an unforeseen direction: over the western waves came the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, bringing physicians, healers, desperately needed supplies.\nAnd one more thing: hope. Hope that Elsweyr would survive.\nAt first, many Cats were suspicious. Never before had the haughty High Elves helped the Khajiiti\u2014why now? But their &lt;a href=\"canonreeve\"&gt;canonreeve&lt;/a&gt;s passed among us, as if unafraid of the flu, and explained: the Altmer did it not from friendship, but from policy. We needed their help now, and they would need our help later. Invaders were coming to southwest &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, they said, and the High Elves could not repulse them without Khajiiti claws at their side.\nTo fight against mutual enemies\u2014ah, that was a logic we Cat-Folk could understand. So we accepted the aid of the High Elves, and their sly cousins the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, and gradually the Knahaten Flu began to recede. And when &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; proposed the alliance treaty of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, we took plume in claw and signed it.\nNow, fellow Khajiiti, we have been through the forges of torment, and with our new allies, we emerge stronger than ever. We welcome the chance to test blade and edge against these invaders, to spill their blood and take their bright objects.\nFor now is the time of the Dominion."}

But does the Empire as a whole benefit? Hardly. The vast machineries of the Imperial bureaucracies cost far more to maintain than can be recovered in duties and taxes. And the cost of establishing and maintaining the garrisons of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the far-flung wilderness posts of these provinces would be cost-effective only if there were evidence of a military threat from the East. But no such evidence . No army of Morrowind or Black Marsh has ever threatened the security of any other Imperial province, let alone the security of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nIn fact, a greater threat to Imperial security lies in the idle legions that the taxpayer spends thousands of drakes to support. The generals of these legions, facing no enemies or opposition within the borders of their provinces, may look with ambition to the West. With their loyal veteran troops and coffers fattened by friendly monopolists, they become unpredictable political factors in the uncertainties surrounding the Imperial succession.\nIf the occupation of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; were motivated by idealistic aspirations, perhaps there might lie some justification for bearing the burden of Empire. But consider the shame of the Empire's mute acceptance to the unspeakable practice of slavery in Morrowind. Instead of using our Imperial legions to free the wretched &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slaves from their &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; masters, we pay our troopers to PROTECT the indefensible institution of slavery. Within the ebony mines of Morrowind, bloated monopolists under Imperial charters exploit slave labor to harvest the outrageous profits assured by rampant graft and corruption.\nConsider the colossal arrogance of our proposition to bring Peace and Enlightenment to the East, when in fact, we have only brought our armies into lands who have never threatened us, and when we have only exploited the most shameful and evil practices we have found in Morrowind and Black Marsh simply to enrich the friends and flatterers of the Imperial family.\nImpartially considered, our occupation of the Eastern provinces is morally corrupt, militarily indefensible, and economically ruinous. The only conclusion is that we should disband the Eastern legions, withdraw the Imperial bureaucracies and monopolists from the East, and give these ancient lands and peoples their freedom. Only by doing so may we hope to preserve the fragile ideals and fortunes of Western culture."}

The great armies continue to wage their unrelenting battle. The battlefield is red, the rivers flow crimson, the sky reflects a deep pink. In the distance lightning flashes, and thunder sounds. Two huge ravens begin circling the field; their blackness is vibrant against the various shades of red in this vista of death and suffering. The bright flashes of light and rumbling begin to increase. The redness surrounding the battlefield begins giving way to a golden glow from the east, almost like a summer's setting sun. From the false sunset a massive golden stallion and single rider approach. All become suddenly still on the field of battle as both sides recognize &lt;a href=\"Reymon%20Ebonarm\"&gt;Reymon Ebonarm&lt;/a&gt;, God of War, and the companion and protector of all warriors, also known as the Black Knight and his mighty steed War Master.\nHe rides into the middle of the blood soaked field and dismounts. He is a very imposing figure. His very tall and heavily muscled body is encased in ebony armor. His ebony helmet does not hide the flowing reddish blonde hair and beard which appear almost as shimmering gold, nor does it shield the steel blue eyes that seem to pierce all they fall upon. In his left hand he carries a massive &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Tower%20Shield\"&gt;ebony tower shield&lt;/a&gt; on which is emblazoned a fiery red rose. As he raises his right arm, all see an arm and a magnificent &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;ebony blade&lt;/a&gt; which are extensions of each other. The fused arm and sword are a result and symbol of the wounds suffered by this god during titanic battles in the youth of this world.\nThe ravens come to rest on his shoulders. And, as the point of the ebony blade seemingly touches the sky, lightning flashes, thunder roars. Then total quiet descends and a shudder rolls through both armies.\nThe leaders of both armies approach Reymon Ebonarm and kneel. In turn they tell their reasons for this war. Each asks for the favor of the Black Knight for their cause. Reymon Ebonarm listens, but there is no acknowledgment that he has chosen to favor one side or the other in this fight. However, each of the leaders has heard the other state his position. And, each now knows that this war is baseless. They embrace and turn to their armies. They instruct their forces to bury their dead, tend their wounded and return to their homes.\nReymon Ebonarm mounts his great golden stallion, War Master, and again raises the ebony blade skyward and extends the huge rose emblazoned ebony shield to both armies. A massive chorus of cheers rises from the armies. The ravens again take to the air. Lightning and thunder follow him as he rides into the sunset followed by the two birds.\nThe armies do as they have been bidden. They care for their wounded and bury their dead. As they retreat towards their homes each warrior is sure that the great God Reymon Ebonarm, the Black Knight, has responded to their individual prayers for intervention. Each side has won, neither has lost.\nAs the armies depart the field, the rivers begin to run clear, and a single red rose begins to bloom near the grave of a fallen hero."}

The development of \"The Elder Scrolls\" series began in 1992, when the staff of Bethesda Softworks\u2014which had until then been a predominantly sports game-producing company\u2014decided to shift the focus of their upcoming \"Arena\" from arena combat into role-playing. The team, pulling influences from \"Ultima Underworld\" and \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", released the massive, open, but ultimately derivative, first-person RPG in 1994 for DOS PC systems. The game began a tradition of games based on the principles of \"being who you want and doing what you want\" that has persisted throughout the series' history. To date, there are five titles in the main series of the game. Two expansions were published for , two more accompanying 's installment, and three others for .\nWhile beginning on , the series has expanded to video game consoles, starting with \"Morrowind\" on and eventually expanding to &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"PlayStation%203\"&gt;PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; (\"Oblivion\" and \"Skyrim\"), Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (\"Online\" and \"Skyrim: Special Edition\"). Four \"Elder Scrolls\" titles were released for Java-enabled cell phones, Nokia's N-Gage, and the PlayStation portable. These titles are known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls%20Travels\"&gt;The Elder Scrolls Travels&lt;/a&gt;\". Two based on the \"Elder Scrolls\" universe, and , were published by . An MMORPG adaption set in the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls%20Online\"&gt;The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;\", was released for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2015. was released in 2016, and was be the first game available on iPad.\nMain series.\nArena.\nThe very first game in the series was known as . Though originally planned to be a gladiatorial game where the player and their three other companions would go from city to city fighting enemies, the idea of the game drastically changed during development. Resulting in many changes to the game, Arena became an all-out full exploration RPG game. Many of the promotional images had already been drawn and printed, meaning that the game could not be renamed. After missing the planned 1993 Christmas deadline, Arena was released in the spring of 1994.\nDaggerfall.\nThe next \"Elder Scrolls\" series game\u2014\u2014was published in 1996. Fueled by the modest success of \"Arena\", \"Daggerfall\" was even more ambitious than its predecessor. \"Daggerfall\" attempted to create a game world twice the size of Great Britain, rendered in a truly 3D engine, and build a skill-system that revolved around skill building rather than experience gains. However, \"Daggerfall\" suffered at the hands of that very ambition: \"Daggerfall\", rushed to publication, was found torturously buggy, and prohibitively hardware-intensive. In the opinion of one commentator, despite \"Daggerfall\"'s commercial success, \"the game still bears the mark of bad code.\"\nMorrowind.\nAfter Bethesda's purchase by Zenimax in 1999, work on began. With \"Morrowind\", Bethesda tripled their staff and pushed again towards hardware-intensive gaming. \"Morrowind\" saw a return to the old-style expansive and non-linear gameplay, but also a shift towards individually detailed landscapes and items, and a smaller game-world than past titles. \"Morrowind\" was released on both the Xbox and the PC, and saw popular and critical success on both, selling upwards of 4 million units by mid 2005. Two expansion packs were quickly developed and released for \"Morrowind\" between late 2002 and early 2003: , and .\nOblivion.\nWork began on in 2002, immediately after \"Morrowind\"'s publication. \"Oblivion\" focused on providing a tighter storyline; improved AI, courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI; improved physics, courtesy of the Havok engine (used in \"Half-Life 2\"); and impressive graphics. The game was released, following much press coverage, on the PC and Xbox 360 in early 2006, and the PS3 in early 2007. Bethesda released two expansion packs for \"Oblivion\" in late 2006 and early 2007: and . \"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\" received a 9.5/10 average out of many different gaming site's reviews, with or without the expansions.\nSkyrim.\nIn 2011 Bethesda released for the PC, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3. The game is considered to be a spiritual successor to \"Oblivion\", allowing for non-linear gameplay, with a large number of quests and side quests. In \"Skyrim\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;,\" or player character, starts as a prisoner awaiting execution, as in its predecessors, \"Oblivion,\" \"Morrowind,\" and \"Arena\".\n\"Skyrim\" excluded the conventional &lt;a href=\"Classes\"&gt;class-bases system&lt;/a&gt; of its predecessors in favor of more unique customization through &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk trees&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns\"&gt;Birthsigns&lt;/a&gt; from other titles were exchanged for changeable &lt;a href=\"Standing%20Stones\"&gt;Standing Stones&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Doomstones\"&gt;Doomstones&lt;/a&gt; in \"Oblivion\" only with effects that reign permanent until another stone is encountered and activated. The &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; school of Magicka was also eradicated and new spell-based attacks known as &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt; were introduced.\n\"Skyrim\"'s first &lt;a href=\"DLC\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt;, released in June 2012. The storyline revolved around a group of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Hunters\"&gt;Vampire Hunters&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;, opposed by the villainous &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;. The plot divided at a quest called \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;\", where the Dragonborn decided whether to assist the Vampire Hunters, or become a member of the undead themselves. This was the first instance in which &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; became a key element in an \"Elder Scrolls\" game; it also marked the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt; skill tree perks. \"Dawnguard\" also saw the return of the &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;, a projectile weapon first appearing in \"Morrowind\".\nSkyrim's second DLC is known as , allowing house building and adoption elements to the game. It allows the player to design and build a homestead, hire a steward, and adopt children.\nThe third DLC, , was released on December 4, 2012. The plot involves traveling to the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and the return of a mysterious former &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; and one-time ruler of the island. Unlike the ancient Dragon Priests of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, he is purportedly the first individual to be gifted with the dragon blood, much like the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, and possesses the ability to absorb Dragon souls. The DLC adds new quests, characters, locations, weapons, armor, and the ability to tame and fly a dragon.\nA ' of \"Skyrim\" with the base game and the three DLCs \"Dawnguard\", \"Hearthfire\", and \"Dragonborn\", was released on June 4, 2013. A graphically remastered version of the game, including all DLCs, called the ' was released on October 28, 2016. A ' (virtual reality) edition was released on April 3, 2018. An audio-focused version of the game called \"&lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Very%20Special%20Edition\"&gt;Skyrim Very Special Edition&lt;/a&gt;\" was released for the Amazon Alexa on June 10, 2018. An ' will be released on November 11, 2021, which includes the \"Special Edition\", all DLCs, and 74 &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Club\"&gt;Creation Club&lt;/a&gt; items; all 48 currently available, plus 26 unreleased new items.\nSpin-offs.\nBattlespire.\nAfter the success of \"Daggerfall\", Bethesda began work on a DLC for the game. The DLC was originally titled \"Dungeon of Daggerfall: Battlespire,\" but after extensive work, the DLC became a standalone game. In 1997, was released. It is the only game with the title \"An Elder Scrolls Legend\" to date.\nThe Elder Scrolls Adventures.\nIn the fall of 1998, Bethesda released . Redguard was much more unique compared to any game and was very limited, having a pre-generated character with his own backstory named &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; and took place on the small island of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. Redguard was the first game to have 3D-generated characters and no further need for sprites. It was also the first game to have fully voiced dialogue.\nTwo more sequels were planned, named \"The Elder Scrolls Adventures II: Eye of Argonia\" and \"The Elder Scrolls Adventures III: Paradise Sugar\". Due to poor sales of \"Redguard\" and \"Battlespire\", the sequels were ultimately set aside as Bethesda flirted with bankruptcy. After Bethesda's purchase by Zenimax in 1999, the sequels were never developed and work shifted to Morrowind and its DLCs.\nThe Elder Scrolls Travels.\nFollowing the release of Morrowind in 2002, four mobile phone games were created. The first was in 2003, followed by in 2004 and continuing with in the same year.\nThe last game in the series was \"\", but instead of being a standalone game with its own storyline the game was a mobile adaptation of \"Oblivion\". The game was released on mobile phones in 2006, but development of the game on the PlayStation Portable was canceled.\nThe Elder Scrolls Online.\nIn May 2012, &lt;a href=\"ZeniMax%20Online%20Studios\"&gt;ZeniMax Online Studios&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of &lt;a href=\"ZeniMax%20Media\"&gt;ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt; and a sister company of &lt;a href=\"Bethesda\"&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, officially revealed , an MMORPG set in the Elder Scrolls universe due for release in late 2013. The game was initially to be exclusive to PC, but in June 2013 it was announced that the game was going to be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, as well as PC, with a release in Spring 2014. It is the first game in the series to feature online play.\nThe PC version of the game was released on April 4, 2014, with heavy criticism. The game suffered from a rocky launch and the game was criticized for having issues with grouping, poor combat mechanics, and its utilization of a subscription model. A delay was announced for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions in May 2014, with those versions expected to come in 2015.\nZeniMax eventually announced that the game was being relaunched as \"The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited\" in March 2015, which aimed to fix most of the problems that critics pointed out initially. ZeniMax also announced that the game was dropping its subscription model in favor of a Buy-to-Play business model. The company also announced a definitive release date for the console editions\u2014June 9, 2015. \"Tamriel Unlimited\" was praised by several critics.\n\"The Elder Scrolls Online\" currently has seventeen available DLCs, and two upcoming DLCs:\nThe game also has five \"chapters,\" which are essentially larger DLCs, and one upcoming chapter:\nThe Elder Scrolls: Legends.\nOn June 14, 2015, Bethesda released information regarding an \"Elder Scrolls\" strategy card game titled . It will in some way involve a number of races such as &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, and will be available on the PC and iPad for free. The initial release date was set to be Fall 2015, but was later delayed to March 9, 2017 for PC, March 23, 2017 for iPad, May 10, 2017 for Android, May 31, 2017 for Mac OS, and July 2017 for mobile.\nThe Elder Scrolls: Blades.\nOn June 10, 2018, Bethesda announced , a free-to-play game available on iPhone, iPad, and Android devices on September 1, 2018.\nGame mechanics.\n\"The Elder Scrolls\" games can be safely categorized as role-playing games, although they do include elements taken from action and adventure games. However, in contrast to other games of the genre, \"The Elder Scrolls\" maintains a unique, skill-based approach to character advancement. A multitude of skills can be raised through use, and once a character's skills have increased sufficiently, their level increases in reflection of those skills. Because of this, players are allowed immense flexibility and choice in character advancement. This is perceived as both a strength and a weakness in the series by gamers, although the flexibility of the games' engines has facilitated the release of game extensions (or mods) through the &lt;a href=\"Construction%20Set\"&gt;Construction Set&lt;/a&gt; that change the skill and level mechanics.\n\"The Elder Scrolls\" main series of games emphasizes different aspects of the gaming experience from most computer role-playing games. A brief by Joystiq in early November 2006 contrasted BioWare's creations to &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;'s by noting a difference in emphasis. Bethesda's creations focused on \"aesthetic presentation and open-ended adventuring\"; BioWare's on a combat system and modular architecture. The series' overarching aim has been noted by their designers as well. Bethesda has described their motivations in creating the first series game, \"Arena\", as those of any good pen-and-paper RPG: creating an environment in which the player could be what the player wants and do what the player wants. 's manual begins with a sort of design manifesto, declaring the developers' intention to \"create a book with blank pages,\" and \"a game designed to encourage exploration and reward curiosity.\" Choices, in the form of paths taken by the player, to do good, to chase after evil, are left open to the player, \"just like in real life.\" This design trend continued with \"Morrowind\", following the hiatus of similarly epic games in the interim, though Joystiq's previously noted insistence on graphics came again to the fore. During the development of \"Morrowind\", Bethesda tripled its staff, so as to perfectly color its newly hand-made world. In their own words, \"We knew we had to exceed the visual polish of the other games on the market, and we made it our goal to put The Elder Scrolls back into the forefront of game innovation.\" The \"Elder Scrolls\" series' emphasis on freedom remained. In the words of Bethesda's \"Morrowind Prophecies\", \"Experience it as you wish.\"\nThe series' grand ambitions have put some members of the gaming press into an apparent position of subdued skepticism prior to the release of each new game, incredulous as to Bethesda's capacity to surmount its obstacles. Nonetheless, whether this be a grab for reader interest or a true sentiment on behalf of the game press, such feelings evaporate by the end of each unvaryingly warm review the series' games receive.\nThese mechanics exist in contrast to most RPGs, where experience points are the sole measure of a character's advancement, and leveling up drives skill increases.\nCosmology.\nThe world of \"TES\" is known for its attention to detail, realism, and the long, complex lists of names, dates, and places. They constitute its extensive history and the vast, interconnected structure of its various societies, cultures, and religions much more than most players are familiar with.\nFurthermore, there is no one compilation of all information pertaining to \"TES\", and, within the games, historical references are often vague or unsure. Players are encouraged to draw their own conclusions about situations and events for which the records are few and incomplete or when competing viewpoints obscure the truth. This has spawned a subculture amongst TES players of history and philosophy debaters affectionately called \"loremasters\".\n\"The Elder Scrolls\" games take place on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, a large landmass divided into nine provinces. An exception is \"Battlespire\", which takes place between the realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, an alternate dimension ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and the mortal realm of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. It is known that there are continents besides Tamriel in \"The Elder Scrolls\" planet known as &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, but there is yet to be an official game that takes place in one.\nThe nine provinces of Tamriel and some other continents are:\nThe other continents of Nirn:\nWhile each of the ten playable races has a \"home province\" or province of origin, they are not limited to this province and can be found outside its borders, though they are a minority. It should also be noted that the home province of the Orcs is, in fact, a city-state called &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, which lies within the borders of High Rock.\nOther races included in \"TES\" lore are &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imga\"&gt;Imga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ka%20Po%27%20Tun\"&gt;Ka Po' Tun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tang%20Mo\"&gt;Tang Mo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwemer vanished for unknown reasons before \"Arena\", but this is explained in \"Morrowind\".\nMythology and religion.\n\"The Elder Scrolls\" places great emphasis on the idea of the dualism and equality of opposites. This dualism is not the Abrahamic dualism of good and evil, but more closely resembles a fusion of Eastern and pre-Christian Western beliefs on the subject, being the duality of order and chaos. According to \"Elder Scrolls Lore\", the concepts of order and chaos can be translated collectively into everything. These notions might be more exactly approximated using the words \"stasis\" (unchanging continuity) and \"change\" (unknowable energy). Almost all Tamrielic religions strongly feature the idea that the world was created through an \"intermingling\" of these two things, some saying that time is in essence a synthesis of continuity and alteration, and most religious creation-theories deal with one or more mythological characters representing these absolutes either procreating or engaging in combat (or both, as the case may be). The thought experiment of the irresistible force is often invoked, and much of the Elder Scrolls theosophical lore is devoted to developing and examining hypotheses as to how such a thought experiment might actually play out on all levels, were it metaphysically possible."}

{"id": "11721", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=11721", "title": "Five Hundred Companions", "text": "Five Hundred Companions, often simply called the Five Hundred or Companions, were a group of &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; warriors led by the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; in the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Five Hundred Companions were an army of fierce conquerers who played a vital role during events of the time period known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;. Their initial goal was to avenge the brothers and sisters who fell victims of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; during their raid known as &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;. However, after &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; was reclaimed, they would continue to press against the other peoples of the continent, attempting to conquer all of &lt;a href=\"Mereth\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt; and much of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nArrival to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Atmorans, led by Ysgramor, left their homeland called Atmora and sailed to Tamriel due to the presence of a civil war in Atmora. They sailed south and eventually landed at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; at the northern tip of &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt;. They moved inland and soon built the legendary city Saarthal. They befriended the local &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; and made peace and prosperity with them.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite this coexistence, the Snow Elves launched a sudden assault upon Saarthal in which they sacked the city and killed everyone there, with the exception of Ysgramor and his two sons, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ylgar\"&gt;Ylgar&lt;/a&gt;, who survived and returned to Atmora. Different reports stated different theories as to why the Snow Elves broke the peace with the Atmorans. Some reports suggest that the initial attack on Saarthal was very focused, and did not appear to correlate to any locations that were established as points of defense or importance. Not only did the Snow Elves know the apparent layout of the city, but their assault appeared to be based on a specific directive and perhaps a singular goal. One theory was that the Snow Elves' motive was to exterminate all of the Atmorans in Skyrim, as the rate at which the Atmorans' population was growing was increasing. To the Snow Elves, this would be a potential threat to their existence in Skyrim. Another theory was that the Atmorans discovered a powerful artifacts deep below Saarthal, called the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, and the Snow Elves coveted it for themselves, so they sacked Saarthal.\nRetreat to Atmora.\nYsgramor, Yngol, and Ylgar fled northward in the sole remaining ship they had. After they returned to Atmora, they told stories of Elven treachery and murders in Saarthal. Men and women of Atmora quickly assembled an army to avenge the fallen and claim Mereth for themselves. Ysgramor\u2014inspired by his Elven enemies' affinity for knowledge\u2014created an alphabet for written Atmoran speech, thus giving the Five Hundred the ability to document the best ways to kill Elves.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20Final%20Passage\"&gt;Day of Final Passage&lt;/a&gt; the Five Hundred set sail for Mereth using longboats that had been made in the massive shipyards of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt;. On the way there, a massive storm broke out, known as the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt;; its namesake comes from how Ylgar and his ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Darumzu\"&gt;Darumzu&lt;/a&gt;\", were knocked away from others and delayed. The storm also destroyed several vessels in the fleet; Yngol's ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Harakk\"&gt;Harakk&lt;/a&gt;\", was among those sunk, thus making him and his crew the first of the dead.\nReaching Skyrim anew.\nAfter regrouping at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;, the warriors sought to reclaim Saarthal and avenge those slain there. With the combined might of the Five Hundred Companions, Saarthal was retaken, sending the Snow Elf forces back toward their cities. Though some of the Companions did not survive, the Ysgramor's people retained the name \"The Five Hundred Companions\" in honor of their fallen &lt;a href=\"Shield-Siblings\"&gt;Shield-Siblings&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Atmoran-Snow Elf War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reclaiming Saarthal, the Five Hundred formed the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor commanded that the Snow Elves be conquered utterly, beginning a long period of the slaughter of Mer and heralding the grand expansion of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered for each &lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; to take their crew on a unique path, seeking their fates throughout Skyrim and the world. Now unbound from Atmora, many of the crews converted their ships to buildings or even burned them ceremoniously, claiming all of Tamriel to be their kingdom. The Five Hundred did not limit their attacks to Snow Elves, and they fought many of the peoples of Tamriel concurrently. Ysgramor himself warred against the giants and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Sinmur%20the%20Terrible\"&gt;Sinmur the Terrible&lt;/a&gt;, until all\u2014including the mighty Sinmur\u2014were gone. Other groups left Skyrim, fighting with &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; in the east or with &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe exploits of all of these crews branch out from one another in their unified goal of conquest. The \"&lt;a href=\"Chrion\"&gt;Chrion's&lt;/a&gt;\" crew went toward Red Mountain and engaged the Elves there, massacring them despite the populations there being passive. The \"&lt;a href=\"Fallowfire\"&gt;Fallowfire&lt;/a&gt;\" went south and conquered &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt; from Snow Elves, reveling in the process until eventually creating &lt;a href=\"Fallowstone%20Hall\"&gt;Fallowstone Hall&lt;/a&gt; after losses. The \"&lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr%20%28Ship%29\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;\" founded &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt;, fighting against Snow Elves prior to the Hold but meeting little resistance when they founded &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. The \"&lt;a href=\"Kaal%20Kaaz\"&gt;Kaal Kaaz&lt;/a&gt;\" were closely linked with Ysgramor's personal retinue, fighting against the Snow Elves at their side for a while, though their exact actions in Skyrim afterward are unknown. The \"&lt;a href=\"Krilot%20Lok\"&gt;Krilot Lok&lt;/a&gt;\" decided to remain on the sea, sailing to various places with coastal access; this included Black Marsh, &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, and even the continent of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. The crew of the \"&lt;a href=\"Sadon%20Reyth\"&gt;Sadon Reyth&lt;/a&gt;\" are less documented than the other crews, though they did assist Ysgramor and the \"Kaal Kaaz\" in fighting the Snow Elves. The \"&lt;a href=\"Ylgermet\"&gt;Ylgermet&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2014led by Ysgramor himself\u2014would battle various factions in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, eventually building &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; on the backs of Snow Elf prisoners. Despite their diaspora, though, the various Companion groups swore to defend anyone of Atmoran ancestry if ever required, thus remaining a united front. Only a few distant Snow Elf bastions, such as the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, remained.\nThe formation of Skyrim.\nThe city of Windhelm was built near &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;Yngol's burial mound&lt;/a&gt;, supposedly so that Ysgramor could look upon it and know that his family line, now in their new home, knew more peace than Atmora before it. Despite this belief, however, Ysgramor and The Companions continued his conquest of the Snow Elves, and so the expansion and slaughter by the Five Hundred only slowed with Ysgramor's own final breath. A huge, dark storm was said to have been seen all over Tamriel, leaving even the fiercest warriors grieving for their leader. Most of the Five Hundred at last ceased their conquest out of respect for Ysgramor, thus ending the period known as The Return.\nThe Return's end soon saw the remaining Five Hundred Companions lose their grip over Tamriel, with many becoming simple settlers and farmers of the land. Though only remnants of the once great army were present, the Atmorans had successfully created the province of Skyrim, founding the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; with the completion of Windhelm.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMembers of the \"Fallowfire\" crew, in their exploits in The Rift, would engage the Snow Elves until their captain, &lt;a href=\"Gurilda%20Sharktooth\"&gt;Gurilda Sharktooth&lt;/a&gt;, was slain in battle. The first mate, &lt;a href=\"Vikord%20One-Ear\"&gt;Vikord One-Ear&lt;/a&gt;, decreed that his crew would cease their conquest and create a great hall, eventually building Fallowstone Hall. The group would evolve from their original Five Hundred roots, becoming known merely as \"The Companions.\" By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, the faction would be well-respected by the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of western Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, and assisted the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe crew of Five Hundred Companions who were led by Jeek the River would settle around the &lt;a href=\"Skyforge\"&gt;Skyforge&lt;/a&gt;, largely retaining the spirit of the original Five Hundred. Jeek would be the first Captain to halt his conquest and instead seek out settlement, wanting to protect those in his company who were less skilled in battle. Thus, Jeek became the first Harbinger of this new iteration of The Companions. The group would give on on its original name and became simply known as \"The Companions,\" similarly to the \"Fallowfire\" crew.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, traditions and goals had changed over time; though the leader of The Companions was still named the \"Harbinger,\" none had held the weight that Ysgramor had, and instead, the newer Harbingers served more as advisors than a hierarchal leader. Similarly, The Circle of Captains would evolve into The Circle, which served as the official leadership. Alongside being a Companion, some members had also embraced &lt;a href=\"lycanthropy\"&gt;lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;, bestowed upon them by &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;; this would eventually include all members of The Circle. The motives of the Companions were much different by the Fourth Era; the Companions had become more of a mercenary group who hunted beasts and criminals rather than Mer. Companion groups were no longer under the control of Captains, since sailing and settlement were no longer driving &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; concerns. They have sworn off war and political conflict of all kinds since the time of Harbinger &lt;a href=\"Mryfwiil%20the%20Withdrawn\"&gt;Mryfwiil the Withdrawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nRanks.\nFive Hundred Companions were a group who considered that every man should be able to make his own path without guidance of others. There were no rules that bound someone under rule of another. Companions were free to come and go as they wish. The only thing that bound him to his Shield-Brothers and Sisters was his honor. As a result, there were not so many ranks within the army.\nHarbinger.\nThe Harbinger was considered to be the main commander of the army. During the time of &lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;, this role was taken by Ysgramor. Companions followed his commands and listened to his advice, though he did not command the army with an iron fist, and men followed him by their own free will.\nThe Harbingers's role shrank significantly after the assembly of the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Captains\"&gt;Circle of Captains&lt;/a&gt;. No other Harbingers were considered rulers among the Companions after the death of Ysgramor.\nCaptain.\nCaptains were commanders of longboats and their crews. After the reclaiming of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; and of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and later the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt;, the Circle of Captains was assembled to decide what the Five Hundred should do next. It was decided that every crew and its captain should split up and forge their own path, with the Captains leading these bands. Like the Harbinger, a captain did not have an iron-fisted rule over their men and they followed the Captain freely.\nAs more and more Atmorans migrated from Atmora to Skyrim, Companions settled, and so sailing decreased in importance; longboats were no longer needed. Thus, the rank of Captain was depreciated and eventually disregarded. However, the rank of Harbinger and the tradition of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;Circle&lt;/a&gt; remained.\nShield-Brothers and Sisters.\nShield-Brothers and Sisters weren't a rank in the Five Hundred Companions, though they are part of the structure and are a common phrase to add to one's name even in the Fourth Era. In general, Shield-Siblings watch one another's back in battle and should not hesitate to fight for each other. Many Companions were and still are Shield-Siblings of one another, though this is not exclusive to the faction; this phrase is still commonly used among &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; as a sign of trust among warriors.\nHuntmaster.\nSimilar to the quartermaster and blacksmith, the huntmaster was a revered hunter who would lead younger Shield-Brothers on game hunts to hone their skills. The official title and role, however, disappeared by the end of the Second Era."}

After the defeat of the Alessian army at &lt;a href=\"Glenumbria%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt;, where King &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Merkiller\"&gt;Hoag Merkiller&lt;/a&gt; was slain, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; was elected by the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; was so powerful that he could not verbally swear into the office, and scribes were used to draw up his oaths. Immediately thereafter the scribes wrote down the first new law of his reign: a fiery reinstatement of the traditional &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic pantheon. The Edicts were outlawed, their priests put to the stake, and their halls set ablaze. The shadow of King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; had ended for a span. For his zealotry, King Wulfharth was called Shor's Tongue, and &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, Dragon of the North.\nKyne's Son.\nThe second song of King Wulfharth glorifies his deeds in the eyes of the Old Gods. He fights the eastern &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; and shouts their chief into Hell. He rebuilds the 418th step of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, which had been damaged by a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. When he swallowed a thundercloud to keep his army from catching cold, the Nords called him the Breath of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;.\nOld Knocker.\nThe third song of King Wulfharth tells of his death. &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, an enemy god, had always tried to ruin the Nords, even in Atmora where he stole their years away. Seeing the strength of King Wulfharth, Orkey summoned the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; Time-Eater again. Nearly every Nord was eaten down to six years old. Boy Wulfharth pleaded to &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, the dead Chieftain of the Gods, to help his people. Shor's own ghost then fought the Time-Eater on the spirit plane, as he did at the beginning of time, and he won, and Orkey's folk, the Orcs, were ruined. As Boy Wulfharth watched the battle in the sky he learned a new thu'um, What Happens When You Shake the Dragon Just So. He used this new magic to change his people back to normal. In his haste to save so many, though, he shook too many years out on himself. He grew older than the Greybeards, and died. The flames of his pyre were said to have reached the hearth of Kyne itself.\nThe Ash King.\nThe fourth song of King Wulfharth tells of his rebirth. The &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and Devils of the eastern kingdoms had started to fight again, and the Nords hoped they might reclaim their ancient holdings there because of it. They planned an attack, but then gave up, knowing that they had no strong King to lead them. Then in walked the Devil of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, who swore he came in peace. Moreover, he told the Nords a wondrous thing: he knew where the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Shor&lt;/a&gt; was! Long ago the Chief of the Gods had been killed by Elven giants, and they ripped out Shor's Heart and used it as a standard to strike fear into the Nords. This worked until &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; Shouted Some Sense and the Nords fought back again. Knowing that they were going to lose eventually, the Elven giants hid the Heart of Shor so that the Nords might never have their God back. But here was the Devil of Dagoth with good news! The Dwarves and Devils of the eastern kingdom had his Heart, and this was the reason for their recent unrest. The Nords asked the Devil of Dagoth why he might betray his countrymen so, and he said that the Devils have betrayed each other since the beginning of time, and this was so, and so the Nords believed him. The Tongues sung Shor's ghost into the world again. Shor gathered an army as he did of old, and then he sucked in the long-strewn ashes of King Wulfharth and remade him, for he needed a good general. But the Devil of Dagoth petitioned to be that general, too, and he pointed out his role as the blessed harbinger of this holy war. So Shor had two generals, the Ash King and the Devil of Dagoth, and he marched on the eastern kingdoms with all the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;sons of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nRed Mountain.\nThe fifth song of King Wulfharth is sad. The survivors of the disaster came back under a red sky. That year is called &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Death\"&gt;Sun's Death&lt;/a&gt;. The Devil of Dagoth had tricked the Nords, for the Heart of Shor was not in the eastern kingdoms, and had never been there at all. As soon as Shor's army had got to &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, all the Devils and Dwarves fell upon them. Their sorcerers lifted the mountain and threw it onto Shor, trapping him underneath Red Mountain until the end of time. They slaughtered the sons of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, but not before King Wulfharth killed King &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; the Dwarf-Orc, and doomed his people. Then &lt;a href=\"Vehk\"&gt;Vehk&lt;/a&gt; the Devil blasted the Ash King into Hell and it was over. Later, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; lifted the ashes of the ashes of &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; into the sky, saving him from Hell and showing her sons the color of blood when it is brought by betrayal. And the Nords will never trust another Devil again.\nThe Secret Song of\nWulfharth Ash-King\nThe Truth at Red Mountain.\nThe Heart of Shor was in &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, as Dagoth-Ur had promised. As Shor's army approached the westernmost bank of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, they stared across at Red Mountain, where the Dwemeri armies had gathered. News from the scouts reported that the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i forces had just left Narsis, and that they were taking their time joining their cousins against the Nords. Dagoth-Ur said that the Tribunal had betrayed their King's trust, that they sent Dagoth-Ur to Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) so that the god might wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for their hubris; that Nerevar's peace with the Dwemer would be the ruin of the Velothi way. This was the reason for the slow muster, Dagoth-Ur said.\nThe Armies Grow.\nAnd Lorkhan (for that is what they called Shor in Resdayn) said: \"I do not wreak vengeance on the Dwarves for the reasons that the Tribunal might believe I do. Nevertheless, it is true that they will die by my hand, and any whoever should side with them. This Nerevar is the son of Boethiah, one of the strongest Padomaics. He is a hero to his people despite his Tribunal, and he shall muster enough that this battle will be harder going still. We will need more than what we have.\" And so Dagoth-Ur, who wanted the Dwarves as dead as the Tribunal did, went to &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoran&lt;/a&gt; and summoned his House chap'thil, his &lt;a href=\"nix-hound\"&gt;nix-hound&lt;/a&gt;s, his wizards, archers, his stolen men of brass. And the Ash King, Wulfharth, hoary Ysmir, went and made peace with the Orcs in spite of his Nordic blood, and they brought many warriors but no wizards at all. Many Nords could not bring themselves to ally with their traditional enemies, even in the face of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. They were close to desertion. Then Wulfharth said: \"Don't you see where you really are? Don't you know who Shor really is? Don't you know what this war is?\" And they looked from the King to the God to the Devils and Orcs, and some knew, really knew, and they are the ones that stayed.\nThe Doom Drum.\nNerevar carried &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt;, a dagger made of the sound of the shadow of the moons. His champions were Dumac Dwarfking, who carried a hammer of divine mass, and &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;, who was the immortal son of Azura and wore the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20Mail\"&gt;Wraith Mail&lt;/a&gt;. They met Lorkhan at the last &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Lorkhan had his Heart again, but he had long been from it, and he needed time. Wulfharth met Sul but could not strike him, and he fell from grievous wounds, but not before shouting Sul blind. Dagoth-Ur met Dumac and slew him, but not before Sunder struck his lord's Heart. Nerevar turned away from Lorkhan and struck down Dagoth-Ur in rage, but he took a mortal wound from Lorkhan in turn. But Nerevar feigned the death that was coming early and so struck Lorkhan with surprise on his side. The Heart had been made solid by &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt;'s tuning blow and Keening could now cut it out. And it was cut out and Lorkhan was defeated and the whole ordeal was thought over."}

They are the weakest of the three Daedric atronachs, symbolizing fire.\nAppearance.\nFlame atronachs resemble fiery female humanoids, wearing loose pieces of black metal armor. They have three clawed fingers on each hand, and two toes on each foot. They wear a metal mask shaped like a woman's face, which features two long, swept-back horns that serve as their \"ears.\"\nBehavior.\nWhen passive, flame atronachs levitate in place, occasionally spinning or doing flips. They make a faint whistling noise similar to breathing, along with the crackling of flames. They stare at friendly creatures that approach them before losing interest. When they move, they leave a short trail of fire on the ground behind them.\nCombat.\nFlame atronachs, unlike other Daedra, rely heavily on magic attacks and keeping their distance in a fight. They get as far away as they can from a target, while still being in range, and hurl &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;firebolts&lt;/a&gt; at it from a distance until either it or the target dies. As the target gets closer, they switch to casting &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flames&lt;/a&gt; and, at higher levels, cast &lt;a href=\"flame%20cloak\"&gt;flame cloak&lt;/a&gt; before running away to safety. If the target gets within melee range, they may slash or backhand the target with their arms, which deal both physical and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a flame atronach dies, it explodes in the same way as a fireball blast, but stronger. This can deal fatal damage to any creature already substantially weakened from already fighting them. \nSubtypes.\nFlame atronachs come in a few types, though visually identical, their stats differ."}

He belonged to a holy order that lights Malacath's pyre once every decade, but was ambushed before he could do so. I swore to head to the heart of Old Orsinium and light Malacath's pyre.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;Old Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, near the entrance, you will find a dying man named Nashruth. He will tell you that his order has lit the ritual pyre to &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; here once every ten years, but that they were ambushed when they tried to light the pyre anew. He will ask you to light them in his stead and complete the Rites of Praise and Scorn. After this conversation, he will pass away.\nHead onward until you find a brazier. Light this brazier and you will hear the voice of Malacath. Head on through the caves and to the next portion of the ruins. It does not matter whether you take the right path or the left path; they are about as long. Once you reach the inner part of the ruins, you will find an Aspect of Malacath, in the form of a statue of two hands grabbing an axe. Speak to him and he will tell you to honour the tribes that built Orsinium so that you may progress to the great pyre. \nYou honour the tribes by lighting the braziers around the ruins in their name. First off is the brazier for the Morkul clan, here in this room. It will be behind the pillar to your south. From here, head through the ruin counterclockwise, sticking to the high ground as much as you can. In a room with a lot of bears, you will find the brazier to clan Igrun. Not long thereafter, you will find the brazier to Tumnosh. From here, it is time to go down the stairs, then along the path to find the final brazier, to clan Shatul. \nWith the braziers lit, head back to the northeast of the area, where you will find symbols on the ground. To unlock the gates here, you must activate the symbols representing the clans in a certain order. You will find a note here titled \"\", which will give you hints on the order. \nFirst came those who built her walls\nNext is the clan who armed her halls\nThird were they who kept her fueled\nLast whom o'er all others ruled\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; must press the stone plates in front of the door the Old Orsinium in this order:\nThis will open the door. Head through to the interior of Old Orsinium, take a left in the room with the pool, then take a right once you are in the ruins proper. You will find another Aspect of Malacath here; speak with him and he will tell you it is now time to curse the tribes that caused Orsinium's downfall. Proceed onward into the next room, then down all the stairs to get to the ground floor. At the base of the stairs, you will find a brazier to curse clan Bagrakh, guarded by &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. \nOnce you have cursed clan Bagrakh, head to either the eastern or western section of the ruins. To get to the eastern section, you need to climb up some of the stairs you descended at the start of this room, then head through the archway with the stairs behind it. Head up these stairs and through the flooded hallways until you find the brazier for clan Shatul, in the room with the spiders. Further in this section, you can also find this dungeon's skyshard, so make sure to pick that up before you head back to the main room. \nTo get to the western section, head up the stairs in the western part of the main room. Once you are in this section, turn left to find the brazier to clan Fharun. To find the last brazier, to curse clan Igrun, you will have to head all the way to the northwest of the section. It will be in the northeast of the throne room. \nOnce all braziers are lit, head back to the central room. Just in front of the entrance of the western section, you will again find a series of floor panels. Nearby, you will find \"&lt;a href=\"Ushutha%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Ushutha's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\", which will hint at the order in which the panels must be pressed. The correct order is as follows:\nPressing the plates in that order will open the door ahead. Proceed into the forges and fight your way through Malacath's Wrathful Guardians. Take care not to walk on the grates here, as that will damage you. Take a right, then a left to reach your destination; heading left from the entrance will bring you to a boss. Once you have reached the pyre, light it, then talk to the Aspect of Malacath in the back of the room to finish the quest. "}

Attrebus finally understood that she had lost on purpose previously, and the prince began to believe it was true that he was not the mighty warrior the bards told. If it hadn't been for Sul he would have been caught again.\nThe next time Attrebus unsheathed his sword was to face the masked men that attacked him in The Gaping Frog inn in &lt;a href=\"Water%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Water's Edge&lt;/a&gt;.

I couldn't stand to remain behind after what had happened. &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;The flu&lt;/a&gt; was bad enough, but to see all that fire? And breathing\u2014so difficult.\nEvery time I think about it, I just want to vomit. And when I sneeze, which is often thanks to the smoky air, I darken my fur if I cover my nose.\nWe're all dark inside now because of what we've done. Even those of us who tried to stop it. We failed. The darkness is more than just the air we breathe. Our very spirits have dimmed. Maybe even diminished.\nAnd now we have to live with ourselves and this devastation that we added to the world. The flu? A terrible thing. But to add to that as we did? We did that. That was us. What hubris! And so much fear. So much bad behavior. It stains us.\nBut, start where we are. That's what my grandmother would say. Start where we are.\nDespite the darkness inside us that we gave a fiery form, we must keep moving forward.\nAnd so I leave Senchal. I leave the miasma of death and destruction behind me. And I will find and heal anyone I encounter outside its walls. I cannot stay around Senchal, no. It sickens me to do so. But I can work my healing on those outside it. Perhaps the flu will find me. Perhaps it won't. That is beyond my control.\nZiss. Enough of this.\nI must write this down before I forget. It has been weeks since the fires. I cannot return to Senchal and be part of that, but I have found a roving community outside the walls. We protect each other. We forage for food. We take in more as we can. And I heal them all with what supplies we can find. The land is not as generous as we would like, but now and again, we find a treasure trove of herbs I can use.\nBut I write now because of this: None have died from the flu for several days now. Some have recovered. Some have not. But none have sickened in the past several days. Perhaps we should head &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt; and see if the so-called barbarians of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; will be kinder than the \"civilized people\" of Senchal were. Or maybe we will discover more fear-driven and hubris-driven behavior. That is beyond our control.\nWe will start where we are. Move forward. Make each step count.\nZiss! It has been \u2026 decades? I forgot I wrote down my pain in this little journal and tucked it into one of our hidden safeholds. Those were dark days. We were staving off more than the flu back then. We fought off fear and starvation. Lived off the land without destroying it and ourselves. But one thing everyone in that group had in common: We knew we needed to be better. Do better. Have more empathy. Be kind. And learn patience. With others, and most of all with ourselves.\nYes, devastation surrounded us for quite a while as we traveled. We saw many behaving badly. We tried to offset that as much as we could, and to some extent, we succeeded. Not as much as we'd like, but the path was the effort, not the result.\nI shall leave this little book behind with the hopes that any who pick it up will remember these words: Start where you are. Each moment, and especially when facing the worst things you can imagine, that's all you can do. Start where you are.\n&lt;a href=\"Riifa\"&gt;Riifa&lt;/a&gt;, Itinerant Healer"}

It is given by &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Faldrus\"&gt;Sergeant Faldrus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nVeya Releth has ran away to find out what happened to her brother. Her father, Councilor Eris, asks the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to find her. They then find out that she joined the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, and that she will not be returning home until she finds out the truth about her brother.\nWalkthrough.\nSergeant Faldrus sends the Vestige to speak to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Councilor\"&gt;Councilor&lt;/a&gt; of Balmora, to help him in his case to find his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Veya%20Releth\"&gt;Veya Releth&lt;/a&gt;, who ran away again. When they speak with the councilor, they make an arrangement with him that allows the Vestige, an \"outsider,\" to take part in official Redoran business, as Veya knows the &lt;a href=\"House%20Guard\"&gt;House Guard&lt;/a&gt; too well and can easily avoid them. They must now speak to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Brivan\"&gt;Captain Brivan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the conversation, he will want them to track down Veya's friends and spy on them. Doing so will make them spy on several &lt;a href=\"runner\"&gt;runner&lt;/a&gt;s carrying letters between themselves. If they are to be caught, try again by speaking to the captain again. When they succeed, they end up at the inn, and confront &lt;a href=\"Drevis\"&gt;Drevis&lt;/a&gt;. Drevis will tell them that he forwards his letters to &lt;a href=\"Ashur\"&gt;Ashur&lt;/a&gt;, a local tough, but a Morag Tong member. Ashur will be outside Balmora, attacked by &lt;a href=\"Othloth%20Salavel\"&gt;Othloth Salavel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiram%20Indaram\"&gt;Tiram Indaram&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Derana%20Rothalen\"&gt;Derana Rothalen&lt;/a&gt;, who they will have to defeat. Ashur will tell them to seek out Veya's mentor at the Western Ruins for more direct access, so that's what they will have to do.\nOnce they have arrived at &lt;a href=\"Ashurnibibi%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashurnibibi&lt;/a&gt;, they will speak to a &lt;a href=\"Malacath%20Champion\"&gt;Malacath Champion&lt;/a&gt; who tells them that a lone warrior has defeated each warrior who tried to face her, and entered the ruins, but it is filled with traps. Once inside, they will find out that her real name is Naryu Virian, and they have to help her with her Morag Tong contract against a Telvanni mage before they can ask her questions.\nOnce they do that, she tells them that Veya is safe, and that Councilor Eris should stop sending outsiders and Redoran soldiers out to look for her. They must now speak to Eris about this, which will allow them to complete the quest."}

The Flesh Atronach will defend the areas it is set to guard until it is destroyed.\nBackground.\nWhile technically golems, Flesh Atronachs appear to play host to the souls and spirits of many other &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, as shown by the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Rebuilding the Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;.\"\u00a0It is later discovered that &lt;a href=\"Relmyna%20Verenim\"&gt;Relmyna Verenim&lt;/a&gt; was the creator of Flesh Atronachs after her discovery of the element Flesh. These golems are used by &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; himself as guardians to his plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nResistances.\nFlesh Atronachs are completely impervious to &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, and are highly &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Fire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;resistant to fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Frost%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;.

Flesh Atronachs are also very flexible and acrobatic in their melee fighting style. They are able to perform very high kicks and leap long distances towards their foe.\nVariants.\nThere are five varieties of Flesh Atronach: Mangled, Torn, Stitched, Sewn, and Mended. While mangled and mended Flesh Atronachs can easily be identified from afar by their gem colours, Torn, Stitched, and Sewn Atronachs all have the same gem color. A unique visual feature of this creature is the energy spots located on its body. These colored areas seem to glow with an inner light and denote the power of the Atronach. In increasing order of magnitude, these seem to be yellow, purple, and red. The function for these spots (if any) is still a mystery, but from some observations it is concluded to be a magic-dampening gland of some kind."}

But make no mistake - this is not a work of fiction. The events chronicled in this account are all true, were originally documented in a private journal (which now remains safely guarded in the House of Quills in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;) and occurred not more than a year before this book was printed.\n- &lt;a href=\"Ashad%20Ibn%20Khaled\"&gt;Ashad Ibn Khaled&lt;/a&gt;, High Scribe, House of Quills, Hammerfell\nIt's been nine days. Nine days since I slipped my bonds. Nine days since I strangled my captor with my own chains. And nine days since I rushed headlong into the night, always listening, but never looking back.\nBut in order to understand my current predicament, one must first understand where I came from, and just where this story began.\nMy name is &lt;a href=\"Hadrik%20Oaken-Heart\"&gt;Hadrik Oaken-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, and I am a proud &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. I am a skald by trade, and received my formal training at the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Location%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. For years, I made my occupation as a traveling musician and minstrel, and even served several stints as war-&lt;a href=\"Bards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt; in service to the armies of the various &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAnd it's fairly safe to say that if I weren't a bard, I never would have gotten into this mess to begin with.\nMy troubles began when I first started singing about &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Ninth and greatest Divine&lt;/a&gt;, beloved of the people of Skyrim. Turns out, he's not so beloved by the Thalmor.\nAh yes, the Thalmor. As common as a head cold in Skyrim these days, and just as annoying. Or so I thought at the time, before their true power and influence made itself known.\nFor those not in the know, the Thalmor are Skyrim's recently honored \"guests\" - &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; who were gracious enough not to wipe us all out during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut, as every Nord of Skyrim knows, Thalmor graciousness comes at a terrible price. One of the stipulations of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; - the peace treaty between our peoples - was the abolishment of Talos worship. A man ascend to godhood? Preposterous, claim the Thalmor. And so, the open worship of Talos has been outlawed in Skyrim, and actively enforced in those cities where the Thalmor have a tangible presence. Cities, I might add, in which the Empire has the most secure foothold.\nIt was in one of these cities - Markarth, to be exact - where I made the conscious decision to defy the ban on Talos worship. And my defiance came in the form of - what else? - a song. For what bard who has spent time writing and rehearsing an original work can possible refrain from performing it? So perform it I did. Not once, not twice, but seven times. Once a day, for an entire week.\nNow here's something most of my kinsman are unaware of: not all Thalmor in Skyrim are equal in station, or purpose. In fact, there is one group in particular that operates secretly, in the shadows - watching and waiting for those Nords who break the law, and continue their worship of almighty Talos. These are the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Justiciars&lt;/a&gt;, and it is their job to enforce this, the most terrible of conditions of the White-Gold Concordat.\nAnd so, I would have performed my song for an eighth time had I been given the opportunity. Sadly, I was not. For the Justiciars had been watching, had been waiting. Instead, I received a black sack over my head in the wee hours of the morning, a dreadfully uncomfortable wagon ride, and sinister promises that I would enjoy my \"new home,\" which I came to realize was some sort of secret Thalmor prison or detention camp. One I was certain I would never leave alive.\nIt was at that moment I realized I needed to make my escape. No matter what - even if I died in the attempt - I had to slip the grasp of my captors. Better that than rot in some godsforsaken Thalmor jail until the end of time.\nI finally got my chance when the wagon stopped, and we made camp for the night. One of my two Thalmor guards set off into the forest to hunt, leaving me alone with the other. And so, my account comes full circle.\nIt is now nine days later, and in that time, I have realized the true extent of my foolishness. I couldn't have sung the song just once? Or maybe twice? Or not at all? I couldn't have swallowed my stubborn Nord pride and realized just how much power and influence the Thalmor truly have over the Jarls?\nNo. I could not. So now I run. Like a hare from the hound, I run. Always moving, rarely resting, never sleeping. But the Thalmor dog my every move. Where will I go? How will I escape their grasp? I honestly don't know. The only thing I now understand for certain is this: if the agents of the Aldmeri Dominion cannot have your soul, then they will take your very life.\nMy name is Hadrik Oaken-Heart, and I am a proud Nord of Skyrim. Remember me. For soon I will be dead."}

The Vestige can cover for Cinder-Tail or tell the truth. If told the truth, &lt;a href=\"Jode%27s%20Chariot\"&gt;Jode's Chariot&lt;/a&gt; will appreciate the honesty. The Vestige can ask about Jode's Chariot and Tulira will explain that they keep peace at the trading post and deal with thieves.\nAfter talking to Cinder-Tail, he reveals that there is an organization called the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20Moon\"&gt;Hollow Moon&lt;/a&gt;, which help the less fortunate. Cinder-Tail will give the Vestige a Hollow Moon token which can be redeemed at the temple. To redeem it, the Vestige should speak to &lt;a href=\"Fadi\"&gt;Fadi&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; woman who works for the Hollow Moon. She explains that Cinder-Tail was also working for them, but led them into some trouble as well. If the Vestige offers help, they should speak to Valirr, a Khajiit inside the temple.\nAfter talking to him, he explains that Shan'ra, the leader of guards here, wants to bring in the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. The post was originally built on top of ancient tomb which supposedly holds untold riches. Valirr wants to use the treasure to persuade Shan'ra to change her mind. The Vestige must survive the traps and return to him after finding the treasure. The problem is, the only known entrance to the tomb is sorrounded by guards at all times. Valirr believes Tulira can help with that.\nAfter short conversation, Tulira provides the Vestige with the key to the tomb.\nThe Gauntlet is composed of several fire and spike traps. Near the entrance to the Reliquary, two tigers will spawn which must be defeated to continue. Inside the Reliquary, there is a puzzle room. To solve the puzzle, the statue of Anahbi must plunder both chests before the guards catch up with her. The guards start chasing her after the first chest was plundered. To complete the puzzle, one should head directly forward for the first chest. Afterwards, the statue can be moved on a tile behind the first chest and go around to the other. If the puzzle has been solved, the main chest will begin to glow brightly and the loot inside can be taken.\nOnce on the surface, &lt;a href=\"Feathers\"&gt;Feathers&lt;/a&gt; will inform the Vestige that Valirr and Tulira have summoned Shan'ra at the market. Valirr will ask the Vestige to hand over the gem they found inside the Tomb. Shan'ra will be stunned and wants the Vestige to name the price. The Vestige can choose gold and glory, or for him not to call in the Thalmor.

Many fear the place as a matter of course. Those ignorant of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; customs avoid the area entirely, fearing the clans that hide among the cliffs and dark caves throughout the mountain passes. Which is quite a shame, because some of the most beautiful sights exist in and around this vibrant mountain range. The &lt;a href=\"Reachfolk\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; themselves likely know more than we ever will about the flora and fauna that exist among their territory. What I learned has mostly been from the fringes, with notes furiously scribbled in the margins of my journals, hiding in bushes and not daring to breathe! I hoped to learn of a plant or animal that had not been documented, but I fear I was too afraid to explore further afield. I have written here all that I recorded in hopes someone will add to this store of knowledge in the future.\nReach Flora\n&lt;a href=\"Juniper%20Berries\"&gt;Juniper Berries&lt;/a&gt;: White berries, as lovely and glossy as pearls, grow abundantly along the sprawling paths that line the Druadach Mountain range. These berries are a common sight, and those brave enough to venture to pick them find that they are good for a variety of purposes. Whether you want to flavor your &lt;a href=\"mead\"&gt;mead&lt;/a&gt; or make a sweet treat, or even use it as an ingredient for various apothecary tinctures, these berries are as plentiful as they are versatile.\n&lt;a href=\"Hanging%20Moss\"&gt;Hanging Moss&lt;/a&gt;: I've always been strangely attracted to the sight of hanging moss. The way it drapes itself along the mouths of caves and from rockfaces. There is something strange and magical about their presence in the world. The Druadach Mountain range boasts an impressive number of these plants due to the moist climate.\n&lt;a href=\"Mora%20Tapinella\"&gt;Mora Tapinella&lt;/a&gt;: This whimsical fungus grows the base of fallen trees or decaying stumps. I find them beautiful, despite their rather unremarkable appearance. They grow in places death has touched, undeterred by the silence that it brings. I admire their tenacity. They may not be the most attractive specimens in the Druadach Mountain range, but they are certainly among my favorites.\nFauna\n&lt;a href=\"Snow%20Bear\"&gt;Snow Bear&lt;/a&gt;: I would be remiss to not mention the powerful Snow Bear in this book. The high, snowy peaks of the Druadach Mountains are the perfect home for these massive beasts. Don't be fooled by their lovely appearance, however. Snow bears are just as dangerous as their lower-dwelling counterparts. Their pelts are highly sought after for their white luster and softness, but the price to obtain even a single pelt is one this intrepid observer refuses to pay!\n&lt;a href=\"Reachmare\"&gt;Reachmare&lt;/a&gt;: You will not find a hardier breed of &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; outside the Reach. The Reachmare was once wild, I imagine. How wonderful it must have been to see them darting through the valleys of the mountain range. The tamed specimens are no less extraordinary, however. The fighting spirit and tenacity of the Reach is embodied in these magnificent creatures. They can be temperamental and quite untrustworthy of others as well. I'm lucky my observations for this entry did not result in me breaking any of my limbs! The Reachmares do not suffer fools.\n&lt;a href=\"Hagraven\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;: I must consider the possibility that my writing might one day inspire a traveler to visit the Druadach Mountains and see these things for themselves. So I must be responsible and caution you, dear reader. If you find yourself in the Druadach Mountains, keep your wits about you. There are more dangers than just what the natural land has to offer. I wanted to include Hagravens in this account because they too, are a part of this account. I pray you have never seen one, and never have reason to. But if you happen upon a horrible crone with bird-like qualities, know that you are in immediate danger. The time for observation is over, and the time for running is now."}

Despite being a priest, he frequently makes wild claims about his prowess in combat and generally acts in a non-priestly manner.\nSupposedly the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, god of burials and funeral rites, converses with him regularly. Other Dawnguard members such as Sorine Jurard dismiss this behavior as eccentric. Regardless of Arkay's involvement, Florentius repeatedly obtains highly detailed information that he would have no feasible way of learning otherwise\u2014such as learning when one of the Dragonborn's friends have been kidnapped and having highly detailed information about the inhabitants of the radiant locations he sends the Dragonborn to.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolstering%20the%20Ranks\"&gt;Bolstering the Ranks&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlorentius Baenius is rescued from imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Ruunvald\"&gt;Ruunvald&lt;/a&gt;, he agrees to return to &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; and aid the cause, which is where the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; first witnesses Arkay and Florentius interacting. Once at the fort, Florentius can be seen having traded his robes in for a set of &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Heavy%20Armor\"&gt;Dawnguard Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Relic\"&gt;Lost Relic&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlorentius asks the Dragonborn to retrieve an ancient relic that once belonged to the Dawnguard of old. The artifact must be retrieved from a radiant location. This quest is offered up to three times, each time for a different item.\nWhen asked about the old Dawnguard, he has quite a negative opinion and remarks that they were not the noble defenders that people make them out to be. He believes they were no strangers to looting and pillaging homes, and were even said to have hidden caches that bore their sigil. Supposedly, these caches can be opened using &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Fire%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Sun Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Although these ancient caches no longer exist, the modern day Dawnguard employ a similar method of hiding &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20Cache\"&gt;supply caches&lt;/a&gt; for members out in the field.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue\"&gt;Rescue&lt;/a&gt;.\nSave a random character from a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; at a random location. He explains that he learns about the kidnapping from Arkay. The rescue target will usually express surprise when the Dragonborn rescues them, remarking that nobody knew to look for them.\n&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlorentius will be among the members of the Dawnguard who join Isran, the Dragonborn, and &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, as they assault &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt; and his court and end their threat over Skyrim, along with preventing the fulfillment of the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; prophecy. After eliminating the lower-ranked members of &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt;'s court on the bridge outside, Florentius will stay to guard the entrance while Isran, Serana, and the others head in to deal with Harkon and the rest of his court. Once Harkon is slain, Florentius will return to Fort Dawnguard, allowing the Dragonborn to complete any remaining quests for the Dawnguard relics they had not done beforehand.\nWares.\nIn addition to typical &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; wares, Florentius also sells two rare &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tomes&lt;/a&gt;:\nConversations.\nIsran: \"Everyone!

They can travel with, battle for, perform tasks for, and carry items for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nA subclass of followers is non-humanoid followers, such as &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Troll\"&gt;armored trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;rieklings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Dwarven%20Spider\"&gt;Steadfast Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Steadfast%20Dwarven%20Sphere\"&gt;Steadfast Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt;. These followers can neither carry nor equip items, except in the case of rieklings. The interaction with these followers is limited to the wait/follow commands and dismissal, the only exception again being rieklings.\nFollowers specialize in a variety of &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; ranging from &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;. However, skills outside of combat, magic, and sneaking cannot be directly benefited from. Seven specific followers can also serve as &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skill Trainers&lt;/a&gt;. Many followers can &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marry&lt;/a&gt; the Dragonborn, and most can join the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; after being relocated to &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;. With the addition of , some may also serve as a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homesteads&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeveling.\nFollowers will match the Dragonborn's current &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; up to a certain level cap, which varies from follower to follower. The vast majority of followers cap at level 30. Roggi Knot-Beard and Sven notably cap at level 20. As a result of patch 1.9, followers who would level with Dragonborn to level 81 will no longer experience a level cap, and will continue to level with the Dragonborn. These followers are Dark Brotherhood Initiates, J'zargo, Celann, Ingjard, Durak, and Frea.\nIf patch 1.6 or later is not installed, followers, along with all other levelable characters, are locked at the level at which they first encountered the Dragonborn, and will not continue to level up. The only way to fix this leveling error is to use &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29/Characters\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt; on the PC (codice_1 then codice_2 the character while they are not active followers) or use the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; to turn them into an animal, then wait for them to change back. This resets their stats to the Dragonborn's current level. This does not appear to reset their inventory or quest scripting. Essential characters cannot be transformed, and one can therefore not reset their stats without using console commands.\nThere are a couple very specific occasions in which certain followers will level up due to scripted events in quests. For example, Farkas will level up to the Dragonborn's current level in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Proving%20Honor\"&gt;Proving Honor&lt;/a&gt;\" after his scripted &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;transformation&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, Aela will level up after her transformation in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;The Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;\" because the game de-spawns Farkas and Aela and replaces them with a transformed version, then re-spawns them later, which is the same process that occurs when manually using the console to disable then enable a character. Similarly, Erik the Slayer and Cicero \"level up\" after the first encounter with them, as the version met during the first encounter is actually a different version of the character than the one that can become a follower.\nTargeting a follower and typing codice_3 will make that follower level up with the Dragonborn until they reach level 81. Replacing the last number in that command with a number other than 81 will change their level cap to the given number.\nIt is notable that followers with a lower level cap, such as &lt;a href=\"Jenassa\"&gt;Jenassa&lt;/a&gt;, have more stats (Health, Magicka, and Stamina) and skill points (One Handed, Sneak, etc.) per level than other followers with a higher level cap, such as Aela, or even followers with no level cap, such as J'zargo. As such, it is wise to have a similar follower with a lower level cap, such as Jenassa, up until they reach their level cap, then trade for a similar follower with a higher level cap, such as Aela, to be more effective.\nCombat.\nMorale widely varies from follower to follower. Some (such as the Housecarls, Companions, magicians, Dark Brotherhood assassins, hired mercenaries, and Dawnguard members) will invariably fight to the death, while others (such as Roggi Knot-Beard, Sven, untrained combatants and other civilians) will often flee from combat if seriously injured.\nAll followers favor two-handed weapons over one-handed weapons, even if they are unskilled in two-handed weapon usage. Therefore, letting followers whose primary combat skill is one-handed weapons have two-handed weapons in their inventory should be avoided. Additionally, followers appear to favor magic staves over melee weapons and will default to using a magic staff if given one, only switching to a melee weapon after spending several seconds in close combat.\nMost non-magic-using followers have a bow as part of their default, non-removable equipment. This bow shoots an endless supply of iron arrows, which are not visible in the follower's inventory. To have a follower shoot more powerful arrows, a single arrow of that type should be put in their inventory. This will allow them to use an endless supply of that arrow type. Followers will automatically choose the most powerful arrow type available in their inventory.\nFollowers can dual-wield melee weapons, but only if there is no shield in their inventory, and only if a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Forsworn Sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Axe\"&gt;Forsworn Axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20War%20Axe\"&gt;Falmer War Axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Sword\"&gt;Falmer Sword&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Pickaxe%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; is wielded along with another melee weapon. They will also dual-wield magic staves, regardless of whatever else is in their inventory. Frea and Rayya are exceptions to this, for the former automatically begins with two war axes, and will not require a Forsworn weapon or pickaxe to dual-wield. She will use any two weapons given to her should her axes be pocketed from her. The latter will dual wield &lt;a href=\"scimitar\"&gt;scimitar&lt;/a&gt;s by default.\nIf the Dragonborn enters sneak mode, humanoid followers will follow suit. While in sneak mode, they will not attack unless attacked first. However, animal followers (such as Barbas, Meeko, or Vigilance) do not understand the concept of \"&lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;\" and will charge straight at an enemy as soon as they see one, even if the Dragonborn is hiding.\nDeath.\nEnemies will tend to ignore followers once their health is depleted, and turn their attention to the Dragonborn or any other allied characters. This condition is easily spotted, as the follower will drop to one knee and stay in that position for a short period of time.\nOnce they have regenerated a sufficient amount of health, they will stand up and rejoin the fight. However, this does not mean that they cannot die by physical attacks from characters. In some cases, especially when left no other target, enemies will continue to attack a follower until death. Additionally, in a near-death state, a follower is not in danger of being killed outright unless hit by an attack from the Dragonborn or another follower. Extremely powerful attacks, especially area-of-effect attacks such as those from &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, can also kill a follower.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Companion%27s%20Insight\"&gt;Companion's Insight&lt;/a&gt; reward from \"\" allows players to use attacks without fear of hurting their allies, making it harder for non-essential followers to die, as it eliminates the possibility of friendly fire.\nA handful of followers are essential: Dark Brotherhood Initiates, Cicero (if spared during \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cure%20for%20Madness\"&gt;The Cure for Madness&lt;/a&gt;\"), Erandur (if spared during \"&lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;Waking Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;\"), Barbas (unless hit with &lt;a href=\"The%20Rueful%20Axe\"&gt;The Rueful Axe&lt;/a&gt;), Ahtar, Derkeethus, Mjoll, Farkas, Vilkas, Aela, Frea, and Serana. They cannot be killed by any means except poison \u2014 should their health be depleted, they will fall to the ground, and will get up after a certain amount of their health has regenerated. This makes them especially valuable as distractions for difficult battles. Note that Farkas, Vilkas, and Aela are essential only until after completing the Companions questline. Due to these characters' invulnerability, they are the best options for recruiting new Blade members, since Blades who are slain cannot be replaced by new recruits.\nIt is important to remember that enemies employing poisonous attacks can kill followers, since the poison continues its effect even after the follower drops to their knee. Caution is advised if encountering high-level &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;, poisoned traps, etc. To avoid a follower's death in this scenario, the best course of action is to lead attackers away from the area where the follower is trying to recover. Followers may also be given several healing potions or &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Potions of Cure Poison&lt;/a&gt; to carry in their inventory, which they will automatically use if the need arises. In some cases, the best course of action may be to tell a follower to wait before entering a particularly dangerous area.\nFollowers can be revived using the console command codice_4.\nCommands.\nPermanent followers can be given several commands. Initiate conversation (outside of combat), and tell them \"I need you to do something.\" Dragonborn may also hold down the \"select/activate\" button while pointing at the follower. This method can be done at a distance and is a great way to call the follower to the Dragonborn's position while they are in their \"wait\" mode. They can:\nThere are some additional benefits from using certain commands. Followers do not require lockpicks to pick locks. If there is a &lt;a href=\"torch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt; in their inventory, followers will illuminate dark areas with it. As a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, ordering a follower to sleep will allow the Dragonborn to feed off them. Followers can pick up skill books that the Dragonborn may not want to read just yet; these can be safely taken from their inventory and read at a later date.\nIf told to wait, a follower will wait roughly three days before they get to leave the Dragonborn. They will then return to their home or the location where they were originally found.\nMorality.\nMorality varies from character to character, much like their morale. Certain followers, such as the Companions, are lawful citizens and will report the Dragonborn to the guards if they witness a crime, or simply leave their service. Other followers, such as the mercenaries, will readily commit any crime they are ordered to do and will ignore any criminal behavior by the Dragonborn. Some will report the Dragonborn for a serious crime, such as murder, but not for a petty crime. All followers, regardless of their morality, will not have any possible interactions while trespassing, saying only \"You're not supposed to be in here\" when spoken to, with Cicero and Serana being the only exceptions. They will still fight for the Dragonborn, however, and commands can still be issued by activating them from a distance (holding the \"activate\" button) and telling them the desired task.\nIf not hidden, the Dragonborn will be held responsible if a follower is asked to perform an illegal activity. While hidden, most crimes a follower is commanded to commit will generally be disregarded. However, it is possible for the guards in a town to attack the follower while leaving the Dragonborn alone, and interfering with the battle will be seen as a crime.\nThere are four possible values for morality.\nEquipment.\nFollowers always equip the best possible weapons (highest damage value) or apparel (highest armor value) given to them. Followers will not use equipment that is the same in armor or damage value as their starting equipment unless it has been improved by smithing or enchantments. On occasion, a follower may equip a weapon that they are not skilled in over one they are. For example, Mjoll has more skill in Two-Handed weapons over One-Handed, but if given a sword with a higher damage rating than a battleaxe, she will equip the sword.\nEach follower tends to have their own preference of armor. For example, Aela has no preference and will use heavy armor if she receives it, even though she is a marksman whose default armor is light. However, a Dark Brotherhood Initiate strongly opposes heavy armor unless it is significantly better than their current armor. This is because the initiate prefers light armor, matching their skills. If a follower insists on using an undesirable piece of equipment, the only way to prevent this behavior is to remove it from their inventory.\nIronically, the default equipment of many followers does not correspond to their actual combat skills. For example, Aela's default armor is Heavy Armor, despite her being skilled in Light Armor, and Erik the Slayer's default equipment is Iron Armor and a sword, despite his true skills lying in Two-Handed and Light Armor.\nIf a follower is using their own default bow, placing just a single arrow in a follower's inventory will give them an infinite supply of that type of arrow. Enemies may also exhibit this behavior; shooting an enemy with an arrow more powerful than their own arrows has a small chance of adding that arrow to their inventory, allowing them to equip the more powerful arrow and return fire with an infinite supply.\nIf the Dragonborn dismisses their follower, and later decides to recruit him/her again, the Dragonborn will find the follower wearing their original equipment. The Dragonborn can fix this by either leaving the area or by simply taking away any piece of equipment from them, which will in turn \"reset\" them, causing them to equip their best available equipment. If the Dragonborn chooses to \u201creset\u201d their follower, they will use new or better equipment again.\nFollowers can be used to carry almost any item, either via the inventory menu or picking up &lt;a href=\"Items%23World%20items\"&gt;world items&lt;/a&gt;. However, they also have an unspecified weight limit, which restricts how much they can carry. In the inventory menu, items that would over-encumber them appear grayed out. Quest-related items cannot be given to followers for storage. An exploit is possible to make them carry over their limit. First, place the items in any container and then order the follower to take everything in the container. After this, every single item will be in the follower's inventory. However, these items will be marked as stolen. If these items are dropped and picked up again in plain sight, it will be considered a crime. Alternatively, entering a new area will remove the \"stolen\" label. An alternative exploit is to drop the items on the ground and instruct the follower to pick up each item one at a time. While potentially time-consuming, it is a handy method when containers are not present or handy. Followers will retain their inventories even after the Dragonborn dismisses them. In this way, it is possible to use them for limited storage. If they are killed, the stored items can be looted from their body.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchantments&lt;/a&gt; on weapons work normally, but followers will only benefit from the following enchantment effects on their apparel and armor:\nFollowers.\nMisc followers.\nThese followers are typically attached to a miscellaneous or non-specific quest, which must be completed in order to gain them as a follower; some have no quest attached to them, and gaining them as a follower is a trivial affair, such as beating them in a &lt;a href=\"brawling\"&gt;brawl&lt;/a&gt;.\nMercenaries.\nMercenaries cost 500 to hire for any length of time, and will all fight to the death. Dismissing a merc will send them back to the tavern they were found, unless they married Dragonborn, became a steward, or joined the Blades; hiring them will also be free in these cases. After being dismissed, they will charge Dragonborn another 500 if hired again, although they may be free of charge if they're particularly fond of you, or if you only dismissed them a short time ago.\n&lt;a href=\"Housecarl\"&gt;Housecarl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHousecarls are essentially the bodyguards of noble and important figures. &lt;a href=\"Becoming%20Thane\"&gt;Becoming Thane&lt;/a&gt; of a &lt;a href=\"hold\"&gt;hold&lt;/a&gt; will grant a personal housecarl. In the , almost all available housecarls are Nord warriors, though adds three additional housecarls. All housecarls are one-handed warriors, with the exception of the sorcerer Valdimar. Housecarls will invariably fight to the death, and can be told to attack anybody or anything. However, they possess a set of morals. For example, if one is to trespass on the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wave\"&gt;Red Wave&lt;/a&gt;, the follower will tell the Dragonborn that the latter is not supposed to be there, even though this act does not actually charge the player with a true crime.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt; members all cap at level 50, while the others cap at level 25.\n&lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving \"Dawnguard\" installed adds several more followers, both humanoid and non-humanoid, to the game. Most are dependent on which faction the Dragonborn decides to side with during the &lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt; quest, thus \"&lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Order\"&gt;A New Order&lt;/a&gt;\" needs to be completed.\nNon-humanoids.\nNon-humanoid followers can be used alongside any humanoid follower, which means that the Dragonborn can have one human and one non-human follower simultaneously. Most non-humanoid followers cannot be given items and thus cannot use equipment, the exception being Riekling.\nTemporary followers.\nThese characters are scripted to tag along during a relevant quest, and do not cause your main follower to leave your service, but they will not accept commands and their inventory remains inaccessible. All their morality is set to 3. Farkas, Vilkas, and Serana are the only \"quest followers\" that also eventually become followers permanently. Barbas is also the only non-humanoid follower in this section."}

This is not the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Animals and monsters can be slain if necessary.\nThird, don't steal from the poor. The peasants and beggars are under the personal protection of the Gray Fox, particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreaking any of the three rules means expulsion from the Thieves Guild. If you commit murder, you must pay the blood price to rejoin the guild. Blood price is for each person slain. You can pay any of the guild Doyen.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Doyen\"&gt;Doyen&lt;/a&gt; are the hands and eyes of the guildmaster. You take your orders from them. You get your favors from them. They can pay off the Imperial judges to remove your crimes -- for a small fee, of course.\nOur guildmaster is the Gray Fox. We don't talk about him in public. However, we make sure that most folks think he is just a myth.\nWe're thieves, not masons or scribes. Each member steals at his own discretion. The guild neither helps nor hinders with a burglary. However, you will find that you can only sell stolen property to one of our guild fences. Other merchants won't take hot merchandise.\nYou won't be considered for promotion in the Thieves Guild unless you have sold enough stolen property to the &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fences&lt;/a&gt;. The higher in the guild you rise, the more stolen property you need to have fenced.\nIf you should be called to help the Gray Fox in some special way, remember that the best source of information is the beggars. Their eyes and ears seem to be everywhere. However, be prepared to spend a little coin. They won't tell you anything for free. At least not anything true.\nThe guild takes care of its own. The Doyen can remove the bounty from any guild member. However, it takes money to bribe the guards. The guild member must pay the Doyen half of his total fines to get rid of them."}

Utterly ridiculous. Why be the master of one thing alone when you have the capacity to become so much more?\nI see this way of thinking emphasized especially among fellow practitioners of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;. So often, students are discouraged from exploring the virtues of physical modes of combat or other studies in favor of complete and total dedication to magic\u2014even to areas of the art in which they have no interest or talent.\nIt seems such a waste to raise a generation of mages who focus less and less on practical applications and more on obscure theories and experiments. If you find yourself similarly disenfranchised, then allow me to open your eyes to new possibilities. Step boldly forth and do not hesitate to open new avenues of study.\n&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; has a fine tradition of &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014arcanists who apply their considerable intelligence and magical skill to the mastery of spells that are devastating in combat while being unafraid to pick up a sword and strap on heavy armor, fighting in the front lines to turn the tides of battle. Some of the most powerful heroes throughout history have combined magic and physical prowess, and I wish to see more walk this path.\nDo you want to seek glory on the battlefield and strike terror into your foes? Then master both the physical and the arcane. What could be more frightening than a blast of fire shooting forth from an armored gauntlet? Lightning striking nearby foes as your armor absorbs blows from all around? True power means eliminating all weaknesses, and that can only be achieved through knowledge and experience in multiple areas.\nIf you come from a magical background, chances are you've never been taught to properly wield a weapon or wear armor that offers any real protection. Find someone to train you, even if you must face scoffing and taunts in the beginning. Even the weakest (in the physical sense) sorcerer can develop the strength needed to don heavy armor pieces.\nIt is also possible to practice magic at the same time as combat. By doing so, you will attain incredible levels of concentration, improve your &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Online%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, and learn to weave spell and sword together. This allows you to adapt to any challenge. Too many who study magic neglect their bodies, becoming vulnerable when &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; runs low.\nBecome more than a one-dimensional stereotype, and you will discover that, by diversifying, you build a set of skills that can adapt to any situation. Being the most powerful does not mean simply being very good at one thing. You have the potential for so much more. Expand your repertoire, and when you step onto the field of battle, wherever it is and no matter who your foe is, you will be prepared for anything."}

Oluth warned Mere-Glim that Ix's guards were coming for him. Oluth started to pour blood from his mouth after he was wounded with a knife by a guard. He confessed to Glim that the glimmers, as they called themselves, had broken a tree-root feed and they had left the sign of the vapors.

It is with a pious heart that I stand before the Three. Many here assembled have accused me of heresy, treason, and murder. But I tell you now, everything I have done\u2014everything I have ever done\u2014I have done for the greater glory of the Tribunal.\nWith respect, I must point out the hypocrisy which sends me to my death. Had I taken up the sword in defense of the rich, or the Temple, or my House, the sacrifices I have made would be rightly celebrated. My neck would be draped in dragontongue and ribbon, not left bare, awaiting the axe. But because I acted on behalf of the bound and wretched, I am damned.\nThe scourge of slavery is the defining sin of our people. While the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; prize their swords and the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; prize their trees, we prize our blood-property. We built our Houses on the backs of a proud and mysterious people whose lives we destroy with reckless abandon. We think ourselves better than them because of our true faith and our smooth skin. But I tell you this: there is more goodness in the heart of one &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; laborer than in all the hearts of all the landed oathmen of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; combined.\nOur Lady of Mercy, Blessed &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, teaches us compassion and charity, but are we not like the gluttonous &lt;a href=\"Netch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;netches&lt;/a&gt; that kill out of greed? Are we not like the child-Seht who makes sport of suffering?\nThe esteemed Inquisitor asked me this under oath: \"Are you not ashamed of what you have done?\" I remained silent at the time, but now I say it freely: I feel no shame at all. I have no regrets. While I lament the death of those overseers, I tell you it was all for the good. One day soon there will come a reckoning. All our manifest sins will swell and consume us. We will deserve it.\nKill me if you wish. If I must forfeit my life in furtherance of justice, I say \"let it be done!\" But know this: you kill me in vain. Others will rise to take my place. The sons and daughters of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; will be free. And unless you change course, the children of the Tribunal will pay a great price in blood.\nNow I am done. Do what you will."}

While the most bizarre traditions fell away quickly, &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt;-descended &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; maintained most of the snake-men's more benign rituals. This description is by no means exhaustive, but it should give the junior explorer some sense of what challenges (both scholarly and physical) an Akaviri grave site might present.\nConsider the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Serpents\"&gt;Tomb of the Serpents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; architects originally conceived of it as a mausoleum for &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmenite&lt;/a&gt; royalty. But the overthrow of the Akaviri Potentate in the 2E 400s, and the resulting social upheaval in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, displaced thousands of Akaviri-descended Imperials\u2014sending them crashing over the border into &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Ever the opportunists, the Rimmenite Khajiit granted these new residents the honor of burying their honored dead in Khajiiti crypts\u2014for a price. In time, Akaviri dead vastly outnumbered those of the native Khajiit, thus prompting the renaming of the structure to the \"Tomb of the Serpents.\"\nBy all accounts, classical Akaviri burial customs were highly regimented. Snake-men ritualists bound the bodies of their dead in extravagant silken wraps that covered the whole of the body, aside from the face. Upon the face, they placed elaborate masks, often fashioned from silver for high-ranking persons, or tin for their lesser kin. These masks typically bore the ghastly aspect of a serpent, or other such monstrosity\u2014perhaps to ward off evil spirits, or more likely, superstitious grave-robbers. Most importantly, funeral ritualists placed the ancestral armor of the deceased on pedestals near the body. Such armor remains highly sought after. Robbers routinely rifle through urns and overturn sarcophagi searching for breastplates and helmets to sell to wealthy collectors. Even so, there are risks.\nMany histories speak of armor that rises to defend itself, as if worn by angry spirits. While some dismiss these accounts out of hand, only a great fool would pay them no heed. Remember: in the world of tomb-exploration, a healthy measure of superstition will serve you well."}

Among the human-shaped, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; may be the most fascinating. They are cold-blooded, in both the physiological and psychological sense, and yet they somehow manage to operate in all climes with the same resilience as mammals. Their preference for sub-tropical and tropical climates notwithstanding, to see an Argonian moving through sub-arctic or arctic regions with the same facility as their mammalian rivals is simply astounding.\nWhile most other &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; scholars simply choose to ignore this oddity, I chose to delve into it, and I believe I've discovered its cause. The Argonians maintain they are connected to a mystical force known as \"the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt;.\" As religious beliefs go, it is not terribly complicated, but I believe it has a physical manifestation as well.\nThe Hist supposedly emanates from all nature in Tamriel but is particularly strong in \"Hist trees\"\u2014large, usually ancient, growths found at the center of every sizable Argonian settlement. These Hist trees contain, the Argonians believe, the collective memories and knowledge of all Argonians.\nWhether this is true or not, the sap that flows from a Hist tree contains concentrated &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magika&lt;/a&gt;. I believe that it is this Hist Sap that gives the Argonians the ability to defy the logical limits of their own physiology and also empowers their shamans or \"tree-minders.\" If we can tap the energy contained within a Hist tree, who knows what we, a race used to manipulating magic, may achieve?"}

It's as inevitable as dusk giving way to dawn, but that doesn't mean we have to accept it. And I still have so much work left to accomplish. There isn't enough time in the day, let alone in a lifetime! I find this situation to be completely unacceptable.\nWhile my education started with the arcane arts, since &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; took me under his tutelage I've gravitated toward pursuits of a more scientific and mechanical nature. I have tried to apply these techniques to the problem, but so far my cogs and gears and widgets have failed to achieve any noticeable results. Gadgets and devices can accomplish wonders, but so far I have not found a suitable and compelling mechanism to prolong life in any meaningful manner. For this reason, I must return to my arcane roots and explore what magic may achieve where artificing has failed.\nI haven't let my magic grow stale, despite my concentration on more mechanical endeavors. Indeed, like my master before me, I tend to use magic to bolster the effectiveness of my mechanical creations. But it's through the concerted use of magic that I believe I can extend my existence. Why should the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; alone get to be immortal when there are others (including myself) that have more than a lifetime of achievements to contribute to the betterment of society?\nNow, some may look down upon the magical arts labeled as \"dark,\" but knowledge and technique should never be dismissed out of hand. A use for every tool and a tool for every job, after all, as the Father of Mysteries always liked to remind me. So, my next great adventure shall be to conquer the intricacies of the dark arts and discover the secret to extending the natural lifespan. Who knows?

Of course, not everyone exposed to the storms suffers from one of these afflictions, but I have yet to determine any rhyme or reason as to who dies, who transforms, and who walks away unscathed.\nAs I continue my research into the phenomenon, I can say with some certainty that the harrowstorms are created via some sort of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; magic ritual. The ritual uses various arcane components, including some sort of fetish or totem, and an alchemical mixture, in addition to a ritualistic chant to focus and unleash the magic.\nI still have no idea whether the resulting afflictions represent the ultimate goal of the harrowstorms or if they are just an unfortunate result of some more insidious purpose. Nor do I know for certainty who is behind the supernatural events. More research is required to determine how the storms go about killing or transforming their victims, and whether or not there may be a way to restore what was taken from them. Time will tell."}

These places are often hidden in the most inaccessible and hard to reach places. Such places are rumored to exist deep in the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, on the highest peaks of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, and in an ancient glade of &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;.

Though it is also said that &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; kings and queens maintain a private hive.\nAnother means of achieving immortality is said to exist, but it has only been attempted by the most volatile and unstable. It's also forbidden, both by governments across Tamriel and by the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.

When I was young and stupid (as opposed, I guess, to being old and stupid as I am now), I always had hoped to meet a werebear to see if they were as impressive as legend suggested.

There were always travellers with interesting stories and eccentricities, and the atmosphere in the cellars was always light and friendly. Until that night.\nBy an established tradition, the beggars who were sick or wanted rest more than food and companionship would go to the cots at the farthest, darkest end of the cellar when they could be assured at least relative quiet. We were enjoying a song, and my sister Gethessa was dancing to the amusement of all. The song ended, but a chorus continued from the darkness at the far end of the cellar. As drunk and incomprehensible as most of the carolers were, it took a minute for us to realize that the sound we were hearing was not singing, but screaming.\nNo one was too concerned, for some of the older tramps often suffered from vivid nightmares. Nevertheless, one of father's priests went to silence the screamer and the moment he disappeared into the murk, we heard another sound. The snarl of a wolf. Then we heard the priest screaming as the original scream died off.\n\"Werewolf!\" cried the old bard who had been leading the song. The cellar exploded into chaos.\nI was pushed out the cellar door into the snow with the first wave of panic, but I could see that some of the more brave (or more drunk) hobos were rushing into the darkness to do battle with the lycanthrope. They were all, of course, almost instantly killed.\nMy father, upon hearing of his unwelcome visitor, sealed off the cellar after the last survivor of the carnage had left. A seasoned battlemage from the Falcrenth &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, who owed father a favor, went into the cellar and slew the beast.\n\"Not too tough,\" he said as he emerged, carrying the carcass with him. \"Winter must have been tough on him too.\" Despite his bold words, the blood on his face and chest did not only come from his foe.\nWerewolves do not revert to their human forms upon death, despite what legends will tell you. I had the opportunity to look at the monster's steaming body out in the snow before it was carried away to be burned. The teeth, clotted with the flesh of the beggars, were horrifying, but the claws shocked me even more. I have since seen live lycanthropes battle golems, atronachs, and other beings not harmed by mundane weapons, and concluded that they act as naturally enchanted weapons.\nBecause the werewolf is the most ubiquitous of lycanthropes, the term lycanthropy has been used since ancient days to describe the disease that transforms men into half-beast, although lycanthrope only strictly should refer to men who change into werewolves. But that is semantics. There are certainly differences between the seven documented forms of lycanthropy in Tamriel, but more similarities.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"werecrocodiles\"&gt;werecrocodiles&lt;/a&gt; stalk the swamps. Black Marsh also shares with the Imperial Province and the wetter parts of Elsweyr the vile presence of &lt;a href=\"werelion\"&gt;werelion&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"werevultures\"&gt;werevultures&lt;/a&gt; are not found in any other province. The &lt;a href=\"wereboar\"&gt;wereboar&lt;/a&gt; has found both the climates of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; amenable. As I mentioned before, the werebear is the most common lycanthrope in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and is also found in the northern parts of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Province, and Morrowind. The werewolf can be found in every province. The seventh lycanthrope, which I have never seen but my trusted peers have assured me exists, is a &lt;a href=\"wereshark\"&gt;wereshark&lt;/a&gt; that roams the oceans around Tamriel.\nI have spent my life categorizing and observing lycanthropes, but I sometimes feel that I am still a child trapped in a cellar in my attempts to understand them. I know, for example, that lycanthropy can be cured shortly after infection, but after that time, the victim is doomed. No one of my acquaintance has cured themselves after undergoing the first transformation. On the other hand, I have a colleague investigating a coven of witches in the Glenpoint foothills of High Rock who are rumored to have a cure. I remain dubious.\nPerhaps it is because they are doomed that makes lycanthropes so aggressive. I have removed the contents of a werewolf's stomach and found more remnants of roots and berries than animal flesh. My conclusion is that they do not need to attack and devour humans to survive. Yet, for some reason they do. Does lycanthropy drive them mad, or do lycanthropes feel the need to spread the disease as a form of procreation? I do not know. I am not certain that any of us who are not lycanthropes ourselves will ever know. And then, of course, it's too late."}

Hidden in the background, often purposely obscured but still visible to those of us who know what to look for, was an entire race of humanoids who have been all but stricken from the historic record. This crime against history must not stand, and I pledge to restore these creatures to their proper place in the chronicle of the Empire.\nI'm referring, of course, to the maligned and misunderstood minotaur. These humanoids with bodies that resemble &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and heads that resemble &lt;a href=\"bull\"&gt;bull&lt;/a&gt;s trace their lineage to Empress &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; herself. While no period records survive to state the truth of the situation, many ancient documents from later periods speak of a relationship between the Slave-Queen and &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;'s son, &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Divine sent to aid and advise Alessia. Often depicted as a minotaur, the demigod Morihaus, I believe, gave rise to the race through his dalliances with the Slave-Queen and the birth of her son, &lt;a href=\"Belharza%20the%20Man-Bull\"&gt;Belharza the Man-Bull&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhatever the truth regarding the origins of the minotaurs, they began to appear in greater and greater numbers in the years during and after Empress Alessia's reign. I contend that the early minotaurs were as intelligent and cultured in their own way as any &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. Fiercely loyal to the Empire, the minotaurs were among Empress Alessia's most devoted defenders. Certain art and tomes from the time hint as much, but many of my detractors want to know where the hard evidence is to back up my claims. Unfortunately, much of that evidence was destroyed in the intervening period while the mis-named Alessian Order held sway over the Empire.\nIt was, after all, the Alessian Order that followed the rigorous &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;Alessian Doctrines&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the rules and regulations set forth by the Seventy-Seven Inflexible Doctrines, the most notorious were those firmly opposed to the Elves. I contend that the Order wasn't restricted to anti-Elven sentiment. I believe its resentful followers applied the Doctrines to any non-human races they felt like persecuting\u2014including the minotaurs. One remaining fragment of an ancient tablet, known as the Belharza Stone, shows what most scholars agree is a section of a larger carving depicting Belharza the Man-Bull, second Emperor of the Alessian Empire, facing down enemies. My own study of the fragment tells a very different story.\nBy the cut of their armor and the shape of their spears, I believe the so-called enemies depicted in the carving are actually fanatical precursors of Alessian troops. The spears, jabbed directly at the minotaur's heart, indicate that these proto-Alessians killed or drove off the minotaurs, thus beginning the decline of the race that we still see in evidence in the current day. It's a shame what happened to the once-majestic race of bull-men! But wait, I can hear my detractors already. They demand more evidence\u2014evidence that I fear was wiped out along with a hundred other atrocities committed by the Alessian Order. But I do have one more fact to consider, and it's evident to anyone willing to travel to specific sites and watch the activity of the minotaurs from a safe distance.\nIf you happen to study the minotaur in the wild, you'll find that they often congregate at or near ancient sites of significance to the Empire. Why? I contend it's because they have an instinctual memory of a time when they were fierce defenders of the fledgling Empire. I contend that they are drawn to such sites, compelled to continue to defend them despite the actions of the Alessian Order that arose and all but destroyed these remarkable creatures.\nOh, scoff if you must. Go ahead. I've suffered worse. But take a moment and at least consider what I've presented. Then ask yourself, why do the minotaurs guard these ancient Imperial sites? Maybe in that question, you'll come to appreciate the minotaurs\u2014at least a little.\nTrivia.\nIn datamined content, the book was originally called \"Minotaurs: A Forgotten Heritage\"."}

Against the legions massed west of &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, and the legions west of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cormar%20View\"&gt;Cormaris view&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; had pitifully small militias stiffened by small companies of Redoran mercenaries and elite units of house nobles and Temple &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;. Further complicating matters was the refusal of Indoril, Dres, Hlaalu, and Telvanni to garrison the western borders; Indoril and Dres proposed, rather than defend the western border, instead to withdraw to the interior and fight a guerilla war. With Hlaalu advocating accommodation, and Telvanni remaining neutral, Redoran therefore faced the prospect of standing alone against the Empire.\nThe situation changed radically when &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; appeared in person in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; to announce his negotiation of a treaty with Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, reorganizing Morrowind as a province of the Empire, but guaranteeing \"all rights of faith and self-government.\" A shocked &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;, which apparently had not been consulted, greeted the announcement with awkward silence. Indoril swore they would resist to the death, with the loyal support of Dres, while Redoran, grateful for a graceful excuse to avoid facing the legions unsupported, joined with Hlaalu in welcoming the agreement. Telvanni, seeing which way the wind blew, joined with Hlaalu and Redoran in supporting the treaty.\nNothing is known of the circumstances of the personal meeting between Septim and Vivec, or where it took place, or the preliminaries which must have preceded the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt;. The public reason was to protect the identities of the agents involved. In the West, speculation has centered around the role of &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; in brokering the agreement; in the East, rumors suggest that Vivec offered &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the conquest of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Sumerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; in return for significant concessions to preserve self-rule, house traditions, and religious practices in Morrowind.\nThe Lord High Councilor of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt;, an Indoril, refused to accept the treaty, and refused to step down. He was assassinated, and replaced by a Hlaalu. House Hlaalu took the opportunity to settle some old scores with House Indoril, and a number of local councils changed hands in bloody coups. More blood was shed in these inter-house struggles than against the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; during Morrowind's transition from an independent nation to a province of the Empire.\nThe generals of the legions had dreaded an invasion of Morrowind. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; were widely regarded as the most dreadful and fanatic foes, further inspired by their Temple and clan traditions. The generals had not grasped the political weaknesses of Morrowind, which Emperor Tiber Septim recognized and exploited. At the same time, given the tragic depopulation and destruction experienced by the other provinces conquered by Septim, and the swift and efficient assimilation of Morrowind into the Imperial legal systems and economy, with relatively small impact on lower or upper classes of Morrowind's citizens, the Tribunal also deserves some credit for recognizing the hopelessness of Morrowind's defense, and the chance of gaining important concessions at the treaty table by being the first to offer peace.\nBy contrast, many &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; nobles chose to commit suicide rather than submit to the Empire, with the result that the House was significantly weakened during the period of transition, guaranteeing that they would lose much of their influence and power to &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, whose influence and power was waxing with its enthusiastic accommodation with the Empire. The Temple hierarchy more skillfully managed their loss of face, remaining aloof from political struggles, and earning the good will of the people by concentrating on their economic, educational, and spiritual welfare."}

Cost, both mundane and spiritual, can be very high. Intent is everything. Too much emotion may create a creature so consumed with anger and hate its every action is perverted by its pain. Too little creates a mindless husk with little more than the ability to follow the simplest of commands. A calm mind, its thoughts well-organized and its plans well-considered, is the most necessary ingredient for animating the dead.\nThe soul is necessary, of course, as are many other ingredients listed at the end of this chapter. But as to the body ... take caution. Any corpse may be reanimated, regardless of age or state of decay, but the most useful are those that are mostly intact (or can be made intact with little effort). A whole &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; is better than a fresh, but mutilated, body.\nAs to freshness, be careful in this consideration as well. Have you ever wondered why there are so many skeletons among the reanimated undead, fewer &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Online%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;, and only a scant few &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;revenants&lt;/a&gt;? The longer a body remains inanimate, the less hold its original owner has on the corpse. A spirit can stay tied to its remains for days, weeks, or even years - the shorter the time, the more likely the spirit umbilicus exists.\nA wise &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; does not wish to fight for control of his creation with an angry spirit seeking a way back into the world. Best to be certain all of a creature's soul has departed before reanimation begins. Even should the necromancer win the battle, it is a cruel victory, tormenting a spirit on its way to rest.\nRaising the dead so recent that the soul has not yet fled is ill-advised, as true resurrection is not the purview of the necromancer, but something best left to gods and priests."}

Those who \"trafficke with daimons\" seldom wish it to be a matter of public account. Nevertheless, scattered throughout the literature of the First Era are diaries, journals, notices for witch burnings, and guides for Daedra-slayers. These I have used as my primary source material. They are at least as trustworthy as the Daedra lords I have actually summoned and spoken with at length.\nApparently, Oblivion is a place composed of many lands -- thus the many names for which Oblivion is synonymous: &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It may be correctly supposed that each land of Oblivion is ruled over by one prince. The Daedra princes whose names appear over and over in ancient records (though this is not an infallible test of their authenticity or explicit existence, to be sure) are the afore-mentioned Sanguine, Boethiah, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath, and in addition, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hoermius&lt;/a&gt; (or Hermaeus or Hormaius or Herma-- there seems to be no one accepted spelling) Mora, &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%20Peryite\"&gt; Peryite&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom my experience, Daedra are a very mixed lot. It is almost impossible to categorize them as a whole except for their immense power and penchant for extremism. Be that as it may, I have here attempted to do so in a few cases, purely for the sake of scholastic expediency.\nMehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, Peryite, Boethiah, and Vaernima are among the most consistently \"demonic\" of the Daedra, in the sense that their spheres seem to be destructive in nature. The other Daedra can, of course, be equally dangerous, but seldom purely for the sake of destruction as these five can. Nor are these previous five identical in their destructiveness. Mehrunes Dagon seems to prefer natural disasters -- earthquakes and volcanoes -- for venting his anger. Molag Bal elects the employment of other daedra, and Boethiah inspires the arms of mortal warriors. Peryite's sphere seems to be pestilence, and Vaernima's torture.\nIn preparation for the next in this series, I will be investigating two matters that have intrigued me since I began my career as a Daedra researcher. The first is on one particular Daedroth, perhaps yet another Daedra prince, referred to in multiple articles of incunabula as &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;. Hircine has been called \"the Huntsman of the Princes\" and \"the Father of Man-beasts,\" but I have yet to find anyone who can summon him. The other, and perhaps more doubtful, goal I have is to find a practical means for mortal men to pass through to Oblivion. It has always been my philosophy that we need only fear that which we do not understand -- and with that thought in mind, I ever pursue my objective."}

They are at least as trustworthy as the Daedra lords I have actually summoned and spoken with at length.\nApparently, Oblivion is a place composed of many lands\u2014thus the many names for which Oblivion is synonymous: &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;, etc. It may be correctly supposed that each land of Oblivion is ruled over by one prince. The Daedric Princes whose names appear over and over in ancient records (though this is not an infallible test of their authenticity or explicit existence, to be sure) are the aforementioned Sanguine, Boethiah, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath, and in addition &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hoermius&lt;/a&gt; (or Hermaeus or Hormaius or Herma\u2014there seems to be no one accepted spelling) Mora, &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom my experience, Daedra are a very mixed lot. It is almost impossible to categorize them as a whole except for their immense power and penchant for extremism. Be that as it may, I have here attempted to do so in a few cases, purely for the sake of scholastic expediency.\nMehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, Peryite, Boethiah, and Vaermina are among the most consistently \"demonic\" of the Daedra, in the sense that their spheres seem to be destructive in nature. The other Daedra can, of course, be equally dangerous, but seldom purely for the sake of destruction as these five can. Nor are these previous five identical in their destructiveness. Mehrunes Dagon seems to prefer natural disasters\u2014earthquakes and volcanoes\u2014for venting his anger. Molag Bal elects the employment of other Daedra, and Boethiah inspires the arms of mortal warriors. Peryite's sphere seems to be pestilence, and Vaermina's torture.\nIn preparation for the next installment in this series, I will be investigating two matters that have intrigued me since I began my career as a Daedra researcher. The first is on one particular Daedra, perhaps yet another Daedric Prince, referred to in multiple articles of incunabula as &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;. Hircine has been called \"the Huntsman of the Princes\" and \"the Father of Man-beasts,\" but I have yet to find anyone who can summon him. The other, and perhaps more doubtful, goal I have is to find a practical means for mortal men to pass through to Oblivion. It has always been my philosophy that we need only fear that which we do not understand\u2014and with that thought in mind, I ever pursue my objective."}

As each Orc clan and stronghold has a rich and vibrant oral tradition, this should come as no surprise. What did surprise me was how hard it was to form a coherent picture, as no two oral traditions agreed on even the most basic of concepts.\nIn this time of conflicting faiths vying for the Orcish soul, I found many of the tales I heard to be both extremely moving and extremely disturbing at the same time. Furthermore, I have been unable to locate a single tome related to the topic, or find a reference in any other books on related subjects. The only way to learn about the Orcish concept of life after death or a place of reward or punishment in a world beyond was by asking the right questions and listening to the various oral traditions. For after much research and countless interviews, I finally uncovered the Orc equivalent to the tales of &lt;a href=\"the%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;the Far Shores&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, it was the only thing that the various oral traditions seemed to agree upon. And through them, I have discovered the Ashen Forge.\nFor the Orcs that revere &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, the afterlife promises rewards of immortality, abundant food and drink, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. The Ashen Forge represents the culmination of the three constant truths of life among the Orc clans: the stronghold, the grudge, and the Code of Malacath. Let me explain each of these concepts and discuss how they relate to the Orc afterlife so that the meaning becomes clear (or at least as clear as each different stronghold attempts to make it). What follows is my best attempt to merge the divergent and sometimes conflicting tales into a single narrative.\nThe Ashen Forge sits at the center of Malacath's own stronghold in the &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt;. According to some scholars, Malacath's plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; consists of nothing but dust and smoke and ash. But his followers believe that the eternal emptiness contains all the things they hold dear and deem necessary to enhance their immortal existence. As the ultimate expression of the Orc stronghold, Malacath's Ashpit bastion stretches endlessly across the planes, extending even behind the stars to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;, granting access to every worthy Orc who crosses from this life into the next. In Malacath's stronghold, every Orc is a chief, every chief has a thousand wives, and every wife has a thousand slaves to cater to their every need. The stronghold's walls rise one hundred feet into the smoky sky, constructed of polished steel and worked iron. Inside the walls, stone keeps, iron towers, and massive longhouses surround the central square that houses the Ashen Forge.\nThe Ashen Forge fills the endless space within Malacath's smithy, a massive hearth that burns with a fire said to be hotter than the sun. The thing that keeps this fire alive is the adherence by the Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Code%20of%20Malacath\"&gt;Code of Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, but more on that later. Within this fire, every Orc must undergo the ritual of tempering when first they cross from this life to the next. They are thrust into the coals so that every grudge that he or she carried into the afterlife can be heated, melted, and eventually forged into the next generation of mortal Orcs. With the grudges of Tamriel tempered and returned to the mortal world, the immortal Orcs are now free to begin collecting a new set of grudges related to their new existence. Some particularly memorable grudges can also be hammered and worked into weapons or armor of legendary stature upon the Ashen Anvil, the gigantic work bench that stands beside the Ashen Forge.\nThe heat that fires the Ashen Forge comes from the burning, white-hot coals that are, according to the Orc lore-masters who would talk to me, the literal manifestation of the bloody Code of Malacath. They believe that the code fuels the fires of emptiness, betrayal, and broken promises, imbuing every newly forged Orc with a foundation of grievances and resentments that will take them far in the mortal world. The hope is that every generation will be better than the next thanks to the efforts of the generation before it and its ability to adhere to and follow the Code of Malacath.\nStill, Malacath's faithful believe that they will be rewarded with immortality, nourishment, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. A life-everlasting filled with endless days of warfare, endless nights of fine food and drink, and ongoing opportunities to prove their toughness and demonstrate the quality of their steel.\nFascinating, really, especially when contrasted against the beliefs of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;'s followers. Unlike the oral traditions of Malacath that twist and grow with each telling at every different stronghold, the traditions of Trinimac's faithful was surprisingly consistent and they were happy to share them with me. High-Priestess &lt;a href=\"Solgra\"&gt;Solgra&lt;/a&gt;, especially, was extremely helpful in the preparation of this report. When a follower of Trinimac dies, she explained, he or she ascends to Aetherius to join with their ancestors. It seems that the afterlife for Trinimac's faithful also consists of endless war and celebrations, but with a greater emphasis on once again spending time with family members who came before you. In the end, I guess I found the Trinimac version to be somewhat tame when compared to the more savage and visceral beliefs of Malacath's faithful."}

High Elves believe that they are the direct descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;! They rule over the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; while giving them token positions within the ruling hierarchy to keep them content. Rumors of harsh punishments for disobedience cannot be confirmed as any dissidents quickly disappear.\nThe Wood Elves are a barbaric people who are willing to submit to High Elf rule as long as their practices of cannibalism are allowed to continue. They eat their enemies and even one another. They worship the trees of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, refusing to cut them down or harm the animals that live there. Who does things like that?\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; are almost as bad as the High Elves. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; rulers of the Dark Elves have convinced their people that they are \"Living Gods\" possessing great powers and immortality. These old wizards openly imitate what was called the \"Good &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of their Dark Elf ancestral worship.\nThe Beast Races\nThe Khajiit are the \"cat-people\" of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Many rumors exist about the Khajiit, and they are certainly all true. The Khajiit are a society of thieves and addicts. Most spend their time consuming vast quantities of the &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;addictive substance&lt;/a&gt; distilled from &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt;.

Little is known about their culture save for a few rumors and lots of hearsay. It is known that they believe they originate from the trees that grow in Black Marsh. The environment of the marsh has given the Argonians a resistance to the toxic substances found there. The society of Black Marsh is primitive by the standards of the other races.\nHumans\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; are the hardened folk of the north. Hailing from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, these brutes live for war and conquest. When not fighting others, the Nords fight among themselves. The Nords are not a very bright people. It seems that the thin air in Skyrim has led to a stunting of the mental capacity of the Nords.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt; are a cunning and ruthless people. The central location of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; has given them contact with all the races of Tamriel and made them fine traders and diplomats. It has also made them very shrewd with silver tongues and cheating ways. They have a sense of entitlement to rule. Of all the enemies of the Daggerfall Covenant, it is the people of Cyrodiil that are the most dangerous."}

I was walking through &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; and came upon a small group of &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; musicians. Most were playing clay flutes and lizard-hide drums, but one was playing the craziest instrument I've ever seen. He called it a \"&lt;a href=\"vossa-satl\"&gt;vossa-satl&lt;/a&gt;.\" Apparently, there are all kinds of vossa-satls\u2014some as small as a jaw harp and some as big as a pipe organ! My new friend's vossa-satl was about the size of a game hen. Sounded a bit like a game hen, too.\nThe instrument looks kind of like a polished wooden clam shell with a series of valves along the top. Each segment of the shell is actually a small, hollow compartment with a mouth like a bugle (the one I saw had five). According to the musician, each chamber is a different size and produces a different tone.\nNow here's the craziest part: they put live frogs inside! My friend was kind enough to open his vossa-satl to show me the five small frogs within, one in each chamber! He gushed over them like a new mother showing off her babies. He told me their names, what they did for fun, and what they liked to eat. The only thing he didn't tell me is where he found them. Apparently, the location of their spawning pond is a tightly guarded secret.\nBefore every performance, he squirts a few drops of frog-musk into each compartment. This drives the frogs wild and sets them chirping and croaking like mad. By pushing the valves, he's able to muffle certain chambers while leaving others open. This allows for some bizarre but harmonious notes! I could scarcely believe it! I offered to buy his instrument on the spot, but he refused. Just as well, I suppose. I doubt those frogs would survive a winter in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. I ended up buying you a flute instead. Not the most exciting instrument, but I'm sure it'll sound better than that old goat-horn bugle you love to play!\nYours in Kyne's Divine Afflatus,\nToralf"}

When constructing the final resting places of their noble class, these supposedly \"barbaric\" people proved quite the opposite; developing some of the most sophisticated and clever defenses ever encountered. Coupled with the presence of the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, these tombs have become quite a challenge for the would-be treasure hunter.\nThe most often-overlooked obstacles are the abundance of &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; spread throughout the tombs. Ranging from simple tripwire-activated rock falls to complex pressure plate-triggered dart traps, the Nords utilize these devices abundantly. Most of the traps can be avoided by simply looking for the trigger mechanism and avoiding them. Since they are most often placed in areas where distractions abound, remember to keep your eyes to the floor.\nOne of the keys to survival in a Nordic Ruin is through the clever use of these traps to gain an upper hand against its denizens. In many cases, it's trivial to lure them across the triggering mechanism in hopes that they'll fall victim to the trap's effect. This advantage can come heavily into play when encountering an oil trap. Using a ranged attack, lure your victim onto the oil and then loose an arrow at the fire pot hanging above. The moment the fire pot shatters, the entire pool of oil will ignite and engulf the enemy. Just be certain that you're standing clear of the oil yourself, or else this trick could end your expedition in an untimely manner.\nPerhaps one of the most amazing engineering marvels of all to be found in the ruins has little to do with the traps designed to kill. Utilizing all manner of pull chains, levers, switches and pressure plates, some of the most frustrating obstacles can occur in the form of puzzles that could threaten to block your progress. Watch for the telltale signs of these barriers: groups of levers in a single place, rotating pillars with carvings on all faces and even large arrays of pressure plates covering the floor of a room. In most cases, the puzzle might take experimentation, in others the solution could actually be present elsewhere in the complex. It's recommended to keep a writing implement and a journal handy in the latter case.\nAlthough Nordic Ruins are commonly infested with vermin such as skeever and spiders, these creatures pale in comparison to the mighty draugr. These horrific, animated dead beings are commonly found as guardians in most of the tombs and will defend them mercilessly. Since the draugr tends to lay dormant until someone happens upon their resting place, it's advisable to keep an eye on any niches or sarcophaguses that you encounter. These undead beings animate rather rapidly and silently, so always watch your back - any remains you may have passed could suddenly animate and set upon you without warning.\nThe perils of the Nordic Ruin are not without reward. The burial chambers in some of the larger complexes have been known to contain all manners of riches, from gold coins to even the occasional enchanted weapon or armor. Never dismiss the small ceremonial urns that dot the ruins, they are commonly filled with ancient offerings of great value. There are rumors that most, if not all of these ruins contain large &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;walls&lt;/a&gt; with magical inscriptions upon them, but these have yet to be confirmed.\nWhile this might seem like comprehensive guide to the ruins, there are certain to be dangers lurking within that remain undiscovered. Just be sure to always enter these tombs with plenty of equipment and a good, solid weapon by your side. With a bit of patience, a keen eye and a light step, the Nordic Ruin can bring you great wealth - do without these simple safety measures and you risk becoming a permanent resident like many before you."}

Vengeful &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and other types of incorporeal spirits abound, but they have little substance and can often be difficult to control. Corporeal dead provide more muscle, which comes in handy when you need manual labor or an instant fighting force. Plus, if you use minor &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; spirits to animate them, corporeal undead have no sense of self or memory of past lives. They are more malleable, easier to command, and capable of following simple orders. In short, they make perfect servants for most of a necromancer's minion requirements.\nWhile some necromancers prefer to animate &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Online%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; to perform tasks, other practitioners of dark magic prefer to deal with &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. First, skeletons, by definition, consist primarily of bone, with few or no organs or fleshy bits remaining. In other words, skeletons don't have the habit of dropping bits and pieces of themselves all over your ritual circle or lair, unlike their zombie counterparts. Second, skeletons tend to be more sturdy and dextrous than zombies, making them noticeably faster and, in many ways, more dangerous.\nYou have two sources when it comes to obtaining skeletons to raise and command. One is to pull the bones directly from a fresh corpse (or even from a &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;living&lt;/a&gt; victim, if you have the appropriately powerful spell at the ready). The newly dead provide strong, sturdy bones that can deal and withstand punishment with equal facility, depending on the demands of your service. Newly dead skeletons also tend to exhibit more agility and speed, albeit with the clumsiness common to all new-born creations.\nThe second source to draw upon when seeking to raise skeletal minions remains the tried and true market favored by most practicing necromancers\u2014the graveyard. Of course, any depository of the dead will do, from an ancient necropolis to a long-forgotten battleground ripe with the corpses of fallen soldiers. Older bones often house great power, and the magic you employ will gather the scattered fragments and knit them together with necrotic bindings. Older bones may crumble and shatter before the bones of the newly dead, but they often compensate for that liability with the extra power trapped within these relics and awaiting your command."}

Wood Elves play games and tricks in Baan Dar's name, &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; talk of sneak-thieves and living legends, and bards sing of Baan Dar's exploits like he was some worldly robber.\nTo the outsiders, Baan Dar is a legend, a story, a joke. Baan Dar is not these things. To the true Khajiit, Baan Dar is how we live. All Khajiit who grasp him, from the chained souls toiling on &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; plantations to the sellswords fighting for gold on the blood-stained fields of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, know how we honor Baan Dar.\nWhen ja'khajiit swipes the sweetmeat off your sill to fill her starving belly, she honors Baan Dar. When the slave with blood-matted hair slips her chains and cuts her slaver's throat, she honors Baan Dar. When the nomad gnaws off his foot to escape the trap you left to enslave him, he honors Baan Dar.\nDo you leave your valuables where all can see? Baan Dar will take them. Do you wait for others to break the slaver's chains? Baan Dar will slip away while you mew pitifully in the darkness. Baan Dar will not free you or comfort you or save you, but if you listen for him, Baan Dar will guide you as you save yourself.\nAcross the warm sands, beneath the warm sun, where those Khajiit not coddled by wood and stone and words prowl freely with blade and bow, Baan Dar asks only three things of all who follow him.\nDo not let others take it if you wish to keep it.\nDo not let others chain you if you wish to live without chains.\nDo not let others fool you if you wish not to be fooled.\nBaan Dar does not ask you to praise his name. Baan Dar does not ask you to offer him tribute. Baan Dar asks only that you not be stupid, for the warm sands of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; have no place for stupid Khajiit."}

After extensive research and interviews with &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt; locals, including our society's very own &lt;a href=\"Jee-Lar\"&gt;Jee-Lar&lt;/a&gt;, here are my findings on the subject of voriplasms.\nThe nature of the voriplasm remains something of a mystery. When encountered in the wild, be it in a shallow marsh or along a grassy riverbed, a voriplasm appears as nothing more than a puddle of thick and viscous green slime. On closer examination, however, one will notice that the slime doesn't spread and dissipate like a puddle. Instead, it holds its amorphous shape and undulates in a most disquieting manner. Without any visible sensory apparatus or internal organs of any kind, these remarkable blobs of ooze move, hunt, and consume with great efficiency. In fact, Jee-Lar claims to have seen a voriplasm take notice of a &lt;a href=\"bantam%20guar\"&gt;bantam guar&lt;/a&gt; that was more than twenty paces distant, slide across the ground at a dizzying speed, and engulf the poor creature before it even knew that it was in danger. Within moments, the ooze had devoured its prey and ejected the remaining bones as it slipped back into the pool where it had previously been sunning itself.\nFrom what I've been able to ascertain from the few scholarly works on the subject, voriplasms appear to have a rudimentary intelligence. Certainly, they recognize prey, avoid danger, and flee from stronger opponents, just like most predatory creatures. They cluster in groups and often hunt in packs as well as on their own. How they communicate remains a mystery, as does the methods they use to interact with the world around them. Attempts to dissect the creatures have not met with much success as yet, or so I've been told.\nOne scholar on the subject, Exerius Talos of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt;, speculates that voriplasms reproduce by growing to a large size and then splitting apart to form new voriplasms. This seems to me to be an efficient if somewhat solitary process as far as spawning goes, but it makes sense for ambulatory blobs of slime.\nA more incredible theory concerns a seemingly related creature rumored to roam the wilds of Murkmire\u2014a creature called a voriplasmic corpse. Instead of expelling the bones of prey after a voriplasm devours its flesh, the ooze retains the skeleton and clings to it like a new layer of skin. When encountered in the wild, they appear as skeletal bodies where the flesh has melted from the bones and been replaced with voriplasmic slime. The ambulatory nature of the voriplasmic corpses, despite their name, has nothing to do with necromancy or some other supernatural occurrence. Like a snail that occupies a shell, a voriplasm utilizes a captured skeleton to give the ooze form and a more substantial definition. That, at least, is my current theory. I hope to learn more and update this volume after I finally get to participate in a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic%20Collections%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Cyrodilic Collections&lt;/a&gt; expedition into the heart of Murkmire."}

I learned of magic and machines from the &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Clockwork God&lt;/a&gt;. I searched for the secrets of Oblivion with the Inspiration of Craft and Sorcery. I did all this and more with the Light of Knowledge, the SI in &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;, the Wizard-Mystic of the Tribunal\u2014Sotha Sil.\nAs student and disciple, I spent many long years at the Magus's side, helping to maintain and expand his ultimate creation, the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. Now, rumors and stories and exaggerations galore persist about the fabled complex. The purpose of this book is to neither confirm nor deny these tales. Instead, I plan to add to the mystery and the extraordinary wonder of the place. Hopefully, my old master will approve.\nLet's start with a few basic turns of the gear as I reveal a secret but wrap it in a mystery. The Clockwork City is a giant complex the size of a world, but it fits inside a glass dome no larger than a good-sized &lt;a href=\"Netch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;netch&lt;/a&gt;. Here's another contradiction. Sotha Sil was definitely inspired by the technology of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, but the brass tunnels, giant gears, electrical fountains, and lightning falls are all uniquely the creation of the Magus of the Three, Finally, while it is said that the Clockwork City is a painstaking recreation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; itself, quite the opposite is potentially true. The complex is the perfection of Nirn as imagined by the Clockwork God.\nI spent much of my apprenticeship adjusting cogs and regulating the flow of energy, but my happiest memories consist of tinkering in one of Sotha Sil's many workshops, fabricantoriums, and ateliers (which is just a fancier way to say workshop, but the Magus loved to play with obscure words almost as much as the Warrior-Poet). I loved participating in the endless and varied experiments that were constantly being performed throughout the city. We studied everything, always looking for a new theory to test or a device to improve. \"We build it because we can,\" Sotha Sil told me, but what I heard him say was \"We build it because it's fun.\"\nHere's another mystery to ponder. You must humble yourself and become modest to enter the Clockwork City. Indeed, there's no room inside for anything larger than a shroom-beetle, but once you gain entry it's larger than anyone could ever fully explore. Contemplate that while the gears turn, I dare you!\nThe city has residents, as any city should. Some, like the fabricants, were specifically created to fulfill necessary roles. But others live within the complex as well. Sotha Sil's current students and disciples wander the brass tunnels, maintaining the endless series of experiments that require monitoring and constant minute adjustments. There are also those the Magus invited to become part of one experiment of another, as well as the extraneous cast-offs, lost travelers, and trapped planar explorers. I've had some of the most interesting conversations ever with those I met in the Clockwork City.\nFinally, you have probably heard that Sotha Sil can \"forge the future\" using the Clockwork City. Certainly, the contrivances that spring from this well of invention will one day beat the world into a shape most pleasing to the Father of Mysteries. Beyond that, I cannot say. It is also said that the Clockwork City can be used to \"reshape the world.\" I won't reveal the meaning of that cryptic phrase, but I will confirm that those pistons pump true.\nNow I have my own experiments to return to. There's never enough time in the day!"}

It lies to the west of &lt;a href=\"Lillandril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lillandril&lt;/a&gt;, on a small island outcropping that rises from the sea. The general public cannot access the compound, not without obtaining the permission of the portal master who controls the magical egress that leads from Lillandril proper to the small island. They say this is to protect the sages and maintain the solitude they need to think deep thought and study obscure lore. This chronicler has made repeated attempts to ascertain what exactly goes on in the isolated college compound. Here is what I have uncovered.\nFirst, though, some background on the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; themselves. There are two-hundred-and-twenty-three fully accredited Sapiarchs at any given time, each devoted to and responsible for a specific field of study. The current leader of the Sapiarchs, &lt;a href=\"Lamatille\"&gt;Lamatille&lt;/a&gt; of Lillandril, for example, serves as the Sapiarch of Arcanology, encapsulating the collected knowledge of arcane lore within her prodigious mind. The Sapiarchs, in turn, are each assisted by one or more acolytes. These Sapiarchs-in-training hope to one day replace their masters and earn a seat in the college, though that isn't the only path for aspiring sages to take. Any distinguished &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; scholar could receive a summons at any time and be invited to join the prestigious college.\nIndividually, Sapiarchs conduct and catalog research to expand their particular area of expertise, give lectures, consult when called upon in regards to their field of study, and write papers and books to expound upon their subject matter. As a group, the function of the College of Sapiarchs is to advise the current rulers of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; and train the heirs to the throne. They also issue proclamations as necessary when research and study reveal new information the public needs to know and they review such research to determine if it should be included in scholarly reference material.\nNow let's get back to the physical compound that also goes by the name of the College of Sapiarchs. Now, while this chronicler has not yet been able to personally explore the College compound, I have it on good authority that the following details are mostly true and predominantly reliable. The walled compound fills the small island that lies directly west of Lillandril. The main level of the compound features, from what I've been able to gather, a grand library, study halls, and suites for the most senior members of the College. I understand the dormitories and study cells are available for the use of the lesser Sapiarchs.\nThe true wonder of the College of Sapiarchs, though, not counting their connection to the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, is the massive maze of chambers and corridors beneath the main compound. This area, known as the Labyrinth, serves a number of functions, but its most celebrated use revolves around the matriculation of the royal heirs of &lt;a href=\"Alinor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. When an heir to the throne reaches the appropriate age, they go to the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth to study Altmeri Regal Praxis and Ceremoniarchy for 3,555 days before being crowned.\nThis chronicler is quite certain that the mysterious College of Sapiarchs contains additional secrets, but as long as the sages demand privacy and the &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen&lt;/a&gt; and her agents support such a policy, the people of Summerset will never know what truly lurks within the walls of the College compound."}

These catacombs are in the south of town under the big Colovian-style chapel; head there and you will find Halindor. He will confirm that Ezreba is in here, working with some kind of cultists. \nProceed through the dungeon. You will see a vision of Balras Arenim telling the Dro-m'athra here to free themselves and destroy you; you will have to fight your way through. In the big room in the south, you will run into Balras Arenim himself, performing a ritual on a crystal. Kill him and destroy the crystal, and you will see Ezreba running off ahead.

Some hold that a witch of very ill repute may be spared, and condemned instead to perpetual imprisonment, in return for sure and convincing testimony against other witches. Others hold that the promise of imprisonment should be kept for a time, and the witch be burned later. A third view is that the Witchhunter may safely promise to spare the witch's life, and later excuse himself from pronouncing the sentence, allowing another to do this in his place.\nIf these threats and promises do not induce the witch to speak the truth, the Witchhunters must carry out the sentence, and torture the prisoner according to the accepted methods. During this torture, the witch must be questioned on the articles of accusation, beginning with the lighter charges, for the witch will more readily confess the lighter than the heavier.\nIf a witch confesses under torture, they must afterward be conducted to another place to confirm the confession and certify that it was not due alone to the coercion of the torture. The Witchhunter shall see to it, moreover, that during this interval, guards are constantly with the witches, so the witches will not be visited by &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; influences that might aid them or tempt them into suicide."}

By gathering information, I hope to resolve the issue.\n&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; appear immune to the flu. This has caused conjecture that they actually introduced the flu to retaliate for years of slavery at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt;. These claims have never been proven or disproven, and they require more research.\nMitigation:\nMethods that slowed the rapid spread of the flu included burning the belongings of infected people (which, unfortunately, sometimes including burning remaining family members); segregating the sick into ghettos (or walling them up); or putting the diseased onto ships and setting them adrift. Normal curative spells and elixirs were inconsistent in their ability to cure the flu.\nSymptoms and Course:\nGeneral malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue begins several hours before an afflicted victim develops other symptoms. The afflicted person's eyes water constantly. Skin develops a bright red granular rash that does not itch.\nWithin twenty-four to thirty-six hours, victims suffer nosebleeds, their tears contain blood, and a granular rash spreads over their bodies. At this point, victims develop a deep, raspy cough. Within thirty-six to forty-eight hours, the victims' coughs produce bloody phlegm.\nIn most cases, death takes place in as little as seventy-two hours after the initial onset, but some victims have lingered for five to seven days.\nTreatment:\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; first spread, it seemed unstoppable. No reliable treatment against it has ever been proven.Ten years ago, a young &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Perizada\"&gt;Perizada&lt;/a&gt; claimed she'd had a vision from the Divines. She replicated the cure from this dream, testing it on a village scheduled to be razed (together with its inhabitants). Her cure worked, and the village was saved.\nThe cure required &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;clannfear&lt;/a&gt; claws boiled in salt water. The patient would then drink the liquid. The increased trade of actual and purported clannfear claws on the black market caused prices to soar wildly. So many false cures had proven fatal that Perizada's cure was never officially sanctioned. As Perizada later died of the flu herself, its efficacy was eventually considered dubious at best.\nThe \"Clannfear Cure\" has given rise to many other supposed cures, all of which involve boiling something in a liquid and then drinking the result. For the poorest of the population, chicken broth proved not only cheap, but easily obtained. It typically soothed their coughs, which in turn allowed patients to breathe more easily.\n&lt;a href=\"Chicken%20Broth\"&gt;Chicken broth&lt;/a&gt; is definitely not a guaranteed cure, but it is certainly the most accessible. It is recommended, should this dread disease ever return.\nAs the granular skin rash was non-irritating, many left it untreated. Those whose rash remained covered\u2014whether in bandages, poultices, or simply clothing\u2014seemed less likely to infect those who attended them. This also accounts for the much slower spread of the disease in colder climates and during winter months.\nHave you heard of other cures? If so, please submit your reports directly to me for further investigation."}

It looks to me there are more of you here than there should be, so please check your ledger - if it says &lt;a href=\"Liminal%20Bridges\"&gt;Transliminal Bridges&lt;/a&gt;, you're in the wrong room.\nColdharbour is the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; realm ruled by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of brutality, slavery, &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, and all other assorted abominations. It is not, therefore, a pleasant place. Descriptions of the plane widely vary, as usual in any study of Oblivion, but all accounts agree that Coldharbour is a dismal, cold and largely lifeless place pervaded by a miasma of fear, where lost souls are tormented for eternity.\nThis emphasizes the point made in my previous lectures, that a &lt;a href=\"plane%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;plane of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, being made of the very stuff of chaos, takes on form and character that reflects the nature of its ruler. Coldharbour, therefore, has been molded to embody the purpose of mighty Molag Bal.\nAnd what are those purposes? As it happens, I can speak to this subject with some authority, as I recently acquired the library and papers of the late Cardinal Belforte\u00a0of the Order of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. The Cardinal devoted his life to ridding &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; of all &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; persuasions. He was particularly rigorous with the persecution of the worshippers of Molag Bal, and in his time acquired a number of their repulsive tracts and treaties.\nStudy of these sources reveal that Molag Bal desires, above all things, the enslavement of mortals' souls. Various loathsome means are employed to this end, the ultimate goal being the diversion of a soul from its journey to the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;afterlife&lt;/a&gt; to imprisonment and slavery in the plane of Coldharbour. Upon arriving in Molag Bal's realm, the soul attracts itself to some of the loose creatia of Oblivion, forming a corporeal body with the semblance of the shape it wore in life. These sad slaves, called the &lt;a href=\"soul-shriven\"&gt;soul-shriven&lt;/a&gt;, then toil in torment for the amusement of their master, Molag the Slave-Lord.\nI share these secrets of the cult, heretofore unrevealed, so that you may... what is that confounded commotion out in the hall? How am I supposed to lecture over those bloodcurdling screams? I can't work under these conditions."}

But what is Oblivion? Specifically, what exists in the space between the realms? It has been suggested that the void between the realms is inherently hostile. No corporeal life can reside there, and no incorporeal life witnesses the dark expanse between the planes and returns from the experience unscathed. Daedra themselves refuse to discuss it.\nI put forth that, as with all uncaring forces, Oblivion is not fundamentally hostile, but in its unforgiving nature rests a dangerous predilection for destruction. To expound further, what we call Oblivion does not hold life in contempt, but it does not care about upholding or maintaining life either. This results in quite a large number of realms colliding with each other, as their nature and direction dictate. Many planes are fortunate to have a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; or other force controlling their movement through Oblivion. The ones that do not are often crushed by the path their undirected course dictates. Evidence of these ill-fated planes can be seen in the watery reflections of the &lt;a href=\"Myriad%20Realms%20of%20Revelry\"&gt;Realms of Revelry&lt;/a&gt; or in the dreams of &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt;. They are well documented. See \"Troubled Thoughts of a Corrupt Man\" or \"Sanguine's Rites and Realms,\" both written by the fabled Prisoner of the &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;.\nScholars of Oblivion have struggled to reconcile the myriad of truths that can exist at once within the waters of creatia. They bash their heads against the questions of how is this possible or why is viable mortal life found in so few locations while immortal life thrives? These questions are absolute drivel. I would postulate that any and all questions about Oblivion can be directed to the worshipers of &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Hermaeus Mora and the scholars of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; remain the most reliable resources for true scholarly inquiry, but I personally believe that it best to go right to the source for answers to questions concerning Oblivion. For those who are proficient of thought, you may have already concluded that I deem Clavicus Vile to be the foremost expert on the ways of Oblivion. I would even go so far as to say that he has had a hand in dictating the way that it behaves. Anyone who disputes this claim should remember that not much is known about Oblivion. It behaves in complex and erratic ways. What better Daedric Prince to hold dominion over something as chaotic as Oblivion than the Master of Insidious Wishes?\nTo prove my postulations. I have first consulted with &lt;a href=\"Skaafin\"&gt;Skaafin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fields%20of%20Regret\"&gt;Fields of Regret&lt;/a&gt; and entreated them with my queries. For the gift of my curiosity, they allowed me to study their behaviors (see my book, \"On the True Nature of Daedra\"). During this time, I subtly asked them what they thought of Oblivion. One helpfully suggested that mortals too can recover from fatalities in the chaos of creatia. I plan to conduct an experiment and have enlisted the help of the Skaafin Mazfylax to test whether mortals can reform in creatia as Daedra do. He has agreed to meet me some thirty years hence, thus allowing me to make more progress in my studies\u2014just in case the experiment doesn't yield the results I am expecting."}

It caught me quite off guard when I started receiving letters\u2014and even visits\u2014from scholars, historians, mages, and others of that sort. It seems that the tome I left with the Master of Incunabula at the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; had been requested frequently, and that several copies were created.\nApparently there is a shortage of information about the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; and their practices. As you can imagine, most people they enslave aren't as resourceful (or lucky) as I was, and the clans aren't exactly keen on letting outsiders visit for a sip of tea and a little chat about their wicked magics or Daedra-worship. While I'm happy to help preserve knowledge and the like, I have to admit that I'm getting a little tired of all the intrusions, so let me clear the air on some of the silly speculations I've heard (as if my first book wasn't clear enough).\nIf you want to know about Reachmen, know that they most certainly are not a misunderstood and secretly noble people. They don't even want to be left alone\u2014they want to attack, enslave, and conquer. Has everyone already forgotten the slaughter committed by &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach&lt;/a&gt; as he cut his way through High Rock, murdering and defiling as he went? Sometimes the history books do not lie, and I can assure you they don't exaggerate the cruelty of the Reachmen.\nMany mages I've spoken to ask me about the magic of the Reachmen. I can't say I know much about it, but I can say with authority that it is not the \u201cmostly benign form of nature magic\" suggested by a few of these individuals. I tried to avoid the tribe's shamans as much as possible. They were constantly covered in spiders and other filthy creatures, muttering to themselves as they squatted over foul alchemical brews. And it's an obvious fact that the gravesingers are necromancers!\nI don't know how typical the &lt;a href=\"Crow-Wife%20Clan\"&gt;Crow-Wives&lt;/a&gt; were of Reachmen clans. I do know that they were deeply involved in Daedra-worship of the foulest kind. I was forced to witness horrible rituals, from live burnings and literal blood baths to raucous dismemberments, all in the presence of that horrible Ever-Oozing Altar. I'll never be able to forget the writhing masses of centipedes, roaches, and squirming horrors that formed a thick carpet on the ritual hut's floor when the tribe called out to &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;. The clan often ate these, still alive, right off the ground during worship.\nBesides the evil magic and abominable Daedric rituals, the Crow-Wives engaged in plenty of run-of-the-mill barbarism. &lt;a href=\"Kloavdra\"&gt;Kloavdra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to think pranks (especially those that ended in someone getting hurt) were hilarious, and encouraged all sorts of bullying. She rewarded the clever and nasty and punished the meek. Children deemed too weak were sacrificed to Namira in addition to regular random sacrifices. And, of course, there were the raids. Whether they were on other tribes or small villages, they were always brutally violent affairs, sneak attacks designed to catch the targets off-guard and completely dominate them.\nSo, there, my second book, with as much as I can remember about their horrid practices. Now I'd appreciate it if you'd all let me continue with my life!"}

Our place in it now, our place in it then. Well, you've earned the truth of it then: you've taken your first tusk and been kissed by a &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; Wife, so fine.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; you know are the Nords that were, and any formalization beyond that is southern comfort. We came from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; since the end of the beginning of the last end... and so on as sung by the ysgrimskalds of the world. What's that now? We're descended from the gods? So that must mean, what, they went away at some point and then we started? Sure, that's all true, and, yes, there was a war with the gods of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Old Mary&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; died, and, yes, Old Mary's own stories of \"how everything started\" are just as true as ours. The untangling of it all, though, is where examining the tree nets you nothing for the basket because the fruit is all dead by the time you've reached any sensible conclusion. Which is to say, there is no conclusion, my lad, there is only the telling, and only time will tell the dead, for only by the dead can we tell the time, and so of course it all must fit together, all versions of every last telling, whereso or whensoever it comes from. Yes? Elsewise we'd never have time to tell it again.\n\"See now why asking the Nords for their creation myth is as unbearable to hear for them as it is for you to hear their never-really-an-answer? We'll never think that way, at least not long enough for what some would consider the \"proper\" amount of time-- it's just not how our brainpans were built. As a rule, we change our minds a lot, and properly so, which drives the other take on properlarity crazy. It's intrinsic to our nature; to live in the North is to live with a mind that dances near the hearth lest it slow like old Herkel's lot. (That's what happened to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, by the way: their minds froze to death by thinking one thing over and over until poof, gone in a belch of a mountain.)\n\"But I can see by the droop of your shoulders that none of this has met to your satisfaction. Let me show you then, the proper way to ask the Nords their proper place in history: ask them to tell you the oldest story they know that's also the best. That will get you as close to a creation myth as anything else, even if the next telling changes it a bit, but that's beside the point of being the point.\n\"Just because we hate to waste time in Skyrim, we have lots of it to use with nothing else to do, and there's no better way to use up time without wasting it than by telling a good story. And the best of the oldest stories we still know is [untranslatable], which I guess you'll probably want to hear after you get me another round.\"\nAnother story for another time, maybe. http://img353.imageshack.us/img353/3954/p1050551wb4.jpg got tired of listening to the old man go on and on and on.\nMerry X-Mas, everyone, the snows a'comin',\nMK"}

Given what I knew of its history when compared to the little known about this poor \"Forgotten\" chap, I felt no hope of finding this personage buried therein. That said, one must eliminate the most likely answers before starting into the more troublesome or improbable ones. I'm sure I am not the first person to try there in an effort to find this rumored lost ruler, in other words.\nFirst of all, though named Rimmen, the necropolis itself is not IN &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. A puzzle, that. But, upon asking one elderly &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; about it, who was seemingly soaking up all the jasmine moonshine she could find, I learned an interesting tidbit: Her own studies revealed that the necropolis site came about due to, of all things, a local superstition that has since fallen out of favor.\nUpon providing the elder with further jasmine moonshine, she shared the superstition: At that time, builders in that area who knew they'd be excavating would create some sort of contraption from gold wire. They would then walk around the area to be excavated, holding out the wire. If at any point the wire quivered, they would note its movements and make decisions about how to proceed. In this case, the builders walked quite a ways before the preferred behavior occurred.\nFurther application of jasmine moonshine caused my Breton source to collapse into a senseless heap, so I could not find out exactly what sort of behavior they looked for. I saw to it that she was returned her rented room, then headed toward my first destination.\nNow for the actual journey into the necropolis.\nI fear that I do not remember too much of it. First of all, Rimmen was dealing with this pesky &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Euraxia&lt;/a&gt; situation, so none of the priests and tenders I had expected to find in place at the necropolis remained. An obliging &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt; adept who crossed my path told me of their vacancy, due to some action of the \"Usurper Queen\" Euraxia had taken not long before I entered.\nOf course, I had a commission to finish, so a lack of necropolis tenders did not keep me from my duty.\nWhat did faze me momentarily, however, was the presence of a seemingly reanimated army of &lt;a href=\"Darloc%20Brae\"&gt;Darloc Brae&lt;/a&gt; fighting against that composed of &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; and more throughout the necropolis. I attempted, in my usual fashion, to quietly move past them, but I had to employ my blades more than once before I reached the tomb of the Manes.\nWhere I found quiet!\nThat did not last long, alas. I vaguely remember talking to someone, then I woke up in a corner just outside the Manes' final resting places with a note attached to my hat, flopping over my face in a most inconvenient and startling fashion. Scrawled on it, in some dark substance I do not wish to think about, were these words:\nGo and fulfill your commission, which is not within this necropolis. You will be called when you are needed.\nNow, though I think long and hard upon that missing conversation, I cannot recall it. The only thing that remains in my mind from that time in the necropolis, aside from the curiosity that is the warring of two forces in some sort of grudge match, is a driving urge to find the Forgotten Mane. My past clients may think that I'm always driven to complete my commissions, but this is different. I feel impelled. Also, I'm disturbed that I feel impelled.\nA shame, that. I rather liked taking my time when seeking out pieces of information. Perhaps another day I'll retrace my steps and find out what happened in the Rimmen Necropolis. While I don't wish to interrupt a conflict between the mighty Darloc Brae and the deadly &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps a return will see that conflict ended. I think that perhaps this ongoing fray is more responsible for the absent tenders than anything Euraxia might have done.\nUntil then, I continue my search for the Forgotten Mane. Let us hope that this person actually existed and is not merely a rumor."}

When I ask what they'd like to see, they nearly always reply, \"Throw a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fireball&lt;/a&gt;! A really big one. I'd love that.\"\nThis just shows how poorly educated Tamriel's aristocrats are about the magical arts. The Flame spells have their uses, of course, but the true magical scholar gives pride of place in his grimoire to the &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shock&lt;/a&gt; spells. For whatever reason, manipulating arcane lightning is easier than forcing magical flame, and it can be employed for a greater variety of effects. Here are just a few:\n\u2014The mage can cloak himself in an &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Calling\"&gt;aura of lightning&lt;/a&gt; that will turn aside certain physical and magical attacks, as well as shocking nearby enemies.\n\u2014Lightning can be cast on a surface in the form of a rune that will explode if touched or after a certain delay.\n\u2014A wizard can cast a bolt to a nearby target and then instantly \"ride the lightning\" to that destination.\n\u2014And, of course, lightning bolts can be cast directly at enemies in a number of variations.\nIt is possible, I suppose, that ways to manipulate &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; and Flame will be discovered that make those elemental magics as flexible as Shock\u2014but if I haven't discovered how to do it, who else could?"}

Our greatest discoveries are always written down on charred parchment by an unsteady hand\u2014and so it is with me. The &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; has dramatically enhanced our understanding of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, but at great cost. I can only hope that my work will survive this latest disaster.\nI believe that I am the first to write about &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s elite vanguard, the &lt;a href=\"Xivkyn\"&gt;Xivkyn&lt;/a&gt;. The term \"Xivkyn\" is, of course, heavily &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;icized\u2014a crude portmanteau referencing their resemblance to both Xivilai and &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;. And in fact, they are a hybrid race \"bred\" by Molag Bal to be his personal guard. They refer to themselves by many names; Stolavryk, Khimrykif, or Vyrsago depending on the hour. While they detest all mortal races, they reserve a particular hatred for their confederates, the Dremora. Xivkyn appear to place great emphasis on loyalty, making the Dremora's defection from &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; an unforgivable sin.\nOf all the Daedra, Xivkyn are the most like Molag Bal. They share his unquenchable thirst for mortal souls and his obsession with the acquisition of soul gems. This drive to \"collect\" strikes me as a kind of madness, akin to those suffering from advanced &lt;a href=\"vampirism\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;. While I've never witnessed a physical confrontation between Xivkyn, they routinely scheme against one another in an attempt to gain more soul gems. These plots are commonplace and rarely result in censure from higher ranking Daedra.\nDespite the intrigues, the Xivkyn maintain a rigid code of military efficiency. Their fierce loyalty to Molag Bal combined with their physical and arcane might make them the most terrifying arrival since the Daedric Titan. While I'm sure there's much more to learn, I'm ready for this particular study to end."}

But no matter what our individual achievements, every Direnni since Cygnus has been eaten from within by failure.\nBecause we cannot solve the mystery of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Towers%23Zero%20Stone\"&gt;Zero Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and use it to open the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Aperture\"&gt;Argent Aperture&lt;/a&gt; which it wards.\nAt maturity, every Direnni of high blood is brought into the Tower, conducted to the Foundation Vault, and shown the Zero Stone. We are allowed to touch it\u2014once\u2014so as to feel the transcendent mystical power that courses through it, a power we have never been able to tap. And we are shown the Argent Aperture in the adjacent metallic wall, that door with its lock of thirteen slowly counter-rotating rings, a portal we have never been able to open.\nAnd we console ourselves that if we Direnni have never been able to siphon the Stone or unlock the Aperture, well then certainly, neither could anyone else. We return to the world above, and we do something spectacular\u2014so we will not have to face our failure.\nBut once, as our lives near their ends, each of us gathers together all our knowledge, the fruits of all our achievements, and once more makes that descent to the Foundation Vault. To try it. Just once.\nMost are found within a day or two, dead and horribly distorted. Some, like my darling Heron, live on though terribly disfigured, too brain-blasted to understand what has happened to them.\nMe? I keep to our chambers in the &lt;a href=\"Tourmaline%20Steeple\"&gt;Tourmaline Steeple&lt;/a&gt;, caring for Heron by day, and translating &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; tomes in the library by night. And it's a good enough life, too.\nThough sometimes, when working on an ancient grimoire or librus magus I question whether the arcane writings of our long-lost cousins are not better left a mystery.\nBut then I think, is not all knowledge useful for something? And I think, what might this knowledge be useful for?\nAnd I think I might take that long walk downstairs.\nJust once."}

One-Handed directly affects the damage dealt with one-handed weapons. The perks obtained in this skill tree only affect one-handed weapons. Due to a glitch, this included the &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; weapons &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Headsman%27s%20Axe\"&gt;Headsman's Axe&lt;/a&gt; prior to patch v1.9.\nThe One-Handed skill tree allows damage output to be increased by wielding two one-handed weapons simultaneously. This is referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"dual-wielding\"&gt;dual-wielding&lt;/a&gt;.\" While this potentially doubles damage output, it also removes the ability to block any attacks. It is advisable, though not necessary, to back up a dual-wielding play style with defensive skill trees, such as &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;. An exploit for \"dual-wielding\" is to hold both attack buttons to perform a power attack but before it is performed press both the attack buttons again, which results in a stamina-free power attack. &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; can also bring advantages by allowing the use of various forms of mage armor.\nDespite not adding towards the One-Handed skill, &lt;a href=\"Unarmed%20Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;unarmed&lt;/a&gt; attacks do benefit from Dual Flurry. Perks from other skills that affect one-handed weapons (such as the Backstab perk from the &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; skill) also seem to affect unarmed attacks.\nOne-handed weapons have a shorter range than two-handed weapons, but one-handed weapons move faster and leave an open hand for spells, a shield, or another weapon.\nOne-Handed weapons.\nThe following are the weapons that benefit from this skill:\nCraftable weapons.\nThis is a list of one-handed weapons that can be &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"Forge\"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nNon-craftable weapons.\nThis is a list of weapons that cannot be crafted. They are either received as a quest reward or looted throughout the world. They may or may not be &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith very few exceptions, many of these can be upgraded at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerks.\nThe following are the &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available to select as the skill is leveled up. Some of the perks listed will have more than one rank, with each rank requiring a higher skill.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSkill Effect on One-Handed weapon damage.\nThe One-Handed skill directly increases the damage dealt with one-handed weapons. For each skill level, weapon damage increases by 0.5%. This increase is multiplicative with bonus damage from the Armsman perk for a total of triple weapon damage with 100 One-Handed and 5/5 Armsman. Weapon damage can be further increased by &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nFortify One-Handed enchantments.\nOne-handed weapons receive increased attack power from boots, bracers, necklaces and rings enchanted with the &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20One-Handed\"&gt;Fortify One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; enchantment. However, &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt; are unaffected by these enchantments due to a bug.\nWeapon-specific perks.\nThe usefulness of the weapon specific perks providing extra effects is disputed.\nLeveling.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's One-Handed skill.

She will ask you to get vengeance on the man who killed &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Ehran\"&gt;Lieutenant Ehran&lt;/a&gt;, an orc named &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Makhug\"&gt;Chief Makhug&lt;/a&gt;. Makhug is in the town hall, to the north of the building you are currently in. You will find him on the top floor; kill him, then meet up with Sergeant Linaarie at the bridge to the harbor. \nThe plan now is to have you burn the supplies that the invaders are unloading at the docks, as a distraction. There are a grand total of three crates that you must burn, located in the warehouses. Once you have torched all three, head west to the docks and talk to Sergeant Linaarie there. She will be at the lighthouse. Linaarie will tell you that they managed to trap the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada%20%28Malabal%20Tor%29\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; leader in the lighthouse, and will ask you to do the honours of killing him.

Kill them, then head back out and speak with Sergeant Linaarie again. \nLinaarie will tell you that the Ra Gada and the Orcs have been dealt with, and will inform you of something else that has happened. They found &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Cularada\"&gt;Captain Cularada&lt;/a&gt; hiding beneath the docks, without a scratch on her. Linaarie will tell you to go talk to her, to hear her story. She will be beneath the docks on the southeast side of the island, speak with her and you will find that she was more concerned with her own safety than with the well-being of &lt;a href=\"Velyn%20Harbor\"&gt;Velyn Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and that she decided to hide until the invaders had plundered everything they wanted and left. \nOnce you have heard this story, head to the warehouse district and speak with Linaarie there to finish the quest."}

It goes as follows:\n\"After day turns night, you must follow the light\"\nThe solution to this riddle is a streetlamp a bit to the east. You will find an arrow carved into the lamp, pointing east. Follow the arrow and you will find another street light, with another east-pointing arrow. The next street lamp will point you north. Continue following the directions of the street lamps and eventually you'll come across one that has an X carved into it and an arrow pointing down.

I'm going to tell you a bit about how to make staves. Yes, you too, little Defessus!\nThe first thing I want to make clear is that a staff is a &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Online%29\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; is a staff, whether you're going to use it to knock sense into some lunkhead's skull, or charge it up and shoot shock spells at &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cliff racers&lt;/a&gt;. It don't matter if you're making a quarterstaff or a spell staff, either way it has to be strong enough to withstand the force you're putting through it, and flexible enough not to crack or warp when that force is uneven. This even applies to &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20Staff%20%28Online%29\"&gt;restoration staves&lt;/a&gt;, 'cause healing magic is just as powerful as hurting, and not to be taken lightly.\nYou're going to want to make your staves out of something like &lt;a href=\"maple\"&gt;maple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"oak\"&gt;oak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ash\"&gt;ash&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"elm%20wood\"&gt;elm wood&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever other dense wood you can find, because it has to stand up to being struck hard hundreds, or even thousands of times. But tough as the grain has to be on the inside, a staff has to be smooth as &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;'s bum on the outside, as the staff wielder may have to grip it on almost any part of its length. You don't want to have to face an angry wizard coming to you with oak splinters in his fireball hands."}

One Tamriel enabled characters to interact with other characters regardless of level and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in all &lt;a href=\"zones\"&gt;zones&lt;/a&gt;, where previously every Alliance had its own unique instance of each Alliance zone, including the zones belonging to other Alliances, and these zones were only accessible at certain levels. With One Tamriel, every zone was opened to all characters of all Alliances at once. &lt;a href=\"Dueling\"&gt;Dueling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"ultimate%20skills\"&gt;ultimate skills&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; also accompanied One Tamriel as major features with Update 12.\nBattle leveling.\nOne Tamriel extended the &lt;a href=\"battle%20leveling\"&gt;battle leveling&lt;/a&gt; system to all zones, scaling the &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Online%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; of lower characters to match those of every other character. This meant that the difficulty of content was the same in every zone, rather than becoming progressively higher in level and difficulty as it had been. This also applied to non-Alliance zones, including &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt; zones. Craglorn was redesigned so that not all content in the zone required a group to complete. The main story of the zone was rebalanced to be completable by a single character, with the exception of the three &lt;a href=\"trials\"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; that each have stories to conclude the zone's overarching plot. Previously, quests and doors for certain locations could only be started or opened if the character was in a group with a sufficient number of other characters. The battle leveling system was also expanded to include &lt;a href=\"group%20dungeons\"&gt;group dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, separating them into normal and veteran versions. Group dungeons that previously had a unique veteran version were differentiated by the 'I' and 'II' designations, each of which were given a normal and veteran version.\nLevel restrictions.\nOne Tamriel removed the level ranged previously imposed on content in Alliance zones. Previously, content difficulty was aimed at a level range; characters under this range would tend to find the content more challenging than those above it. Each zone was intended to be completed while the character was within this level range, and each range and requirement was different for each Alliance. Note that characters still need to be at least level 10 to enter &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; became subject to battle leveling with One Tamriel and no longer has a level restriction, it can still only be accessed by completing the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;The Weight of Three Crowns&lt;/a&gt;\" as part of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt;, by teleporting to a group member already there, or teleporting to an owned &lt;a href=\"house\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; there. To compensate for this new mode of progression, main quests were changed to be given to the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they had completed the previous one, rather than being provided every five levels."}

As a prominent champion of the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; I brought prominence to my family and respect to my name. I expected to live out my days in service to Lord &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; without want or regret. I foresaw a glorious end for myself. An honorable death, fit for song, earned on the field of battle. How wrong I was.\nWith all that was known of &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Ur%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bal Ur&lt;/a&gt;, I should have expected our enemy to move quickly on what would be my final post. The &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Aundae\"&gt;Clan Aundae&lt;/a&gt; were aggressively seeking to reclaim locations important to their vampire heritage. They came upon us without making a sound, slaying most of the unsuspecting warriors under my command before any blades were drawn. My response was lacking and I have the blood of many respected Armigers on my hands because of it.\nOutnumbered and isolated, I yielded to my foe. The creature dressed like a gentleman, and I hoped for honorable treatment. I found myself a feast for a blood-drinking monster.\nDays passed in the depths of Bal Ur and in my dying delirium I began to dream. At first it was divine. I felt the warm coastal breeze of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; unblemished by the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt;. Love and kindness surrounded me as I saw the radiant visage of Lord Vivec approaching. I felt forgiveness, and peace, but as Vivec grew closer he twisted into something truly putrid, something vile beyond words. I soon recognized the sight of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s pitiless grin before the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;'s fangs plunged into my heart. In my fright, I woke, shivering and colder than death, but it was the absence of thunder in my chest that revealed my &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Online%29\"&gt;affliction&lt;/a&gt;. My disease.\nShamed by my corruption, and despairing of my own welfare, I passively acquiesced in my gradual integration into the affairs of Clan Aundae. I made no human my prey, only beasts, and kept myself apart from the other clankin; nonetheless, I abandoned hope and lived like a beast.\nNow, I find myself searching for some respite from this thirst. I must feast on the life blood of mortals to sate this gnawing agony, but to condemn another innocent to death, or worse. I would sooner leap into the flames of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. Still, I am uncertain how long my self-loathing can hold back this need. Things cannot continue as they have. I have to do something. But what?\nAshalmawia. My clankin murmur disapproval of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult's&lt;/a&gt; claim over the ruin. They speak of rituals and offerings made to the shrine for the favor of the Lord of Troubles. I share my kin's disgust at these acts, but for very different reasons. I volunteered to keep watch over Ashalmawia and slipped away from Clan Aundae with barely an acknowledgment.\nI must not become used to this. It is easy to think of these cultists as vermin, but I am no less a monster for having slain them. Their blood is a balm, dispelling my agony leaving in its place vigor and bliss. Only in the aftermath do I find the presence of mind to revile what I have done. If I meet my end in this place, I will have deserved it.\nNo, it would be more fitting for this wretched existence to be extinguished where it began. In this torment, my thoughts always return to Bal Ur. Perhaps I should as well."}

It's good to know I can count on you.\"\nConversations.\nTolfdir: \"Welcome, welcome! We were just beginning. Please, stay and listen. So, as I was saying, the first thing to understand is that magic is, by its very nature, volatile and dangerous. Unless you can control it, it can and will destroy you.\"\nBrelyna: \"Sir, I think we all understand that fairly well. We wouldn't be here if we couldn't control magic!\"\nTolfdir: \"Of course, my dear. Of course. You all certainly possess some inherent natural ability. That much is not being questioned. What I'm talking about is true control, mastery of magic. It takes years, if not decades, of practice and study.\"\nJ'zargo: \"Then what are we waiting for? Let's get started!\"\nTolfdir: \"Please, please! This is exactly what I'm talking about. Eagerness must be tempered with caution, or else disaster is inevitable.\"\nOnmund: \"But we've only just arrived here -- you've no idea what any of us are capable of. Why not give use a chance to show you what we can do?\"\nOnmund: \"We're all pretty new to this, right? Let's just give it a chance. What's the worst that could happen?\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continueing with out theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can succesfully use it to block spells, all right?\"\nBrelyna: \"See? He agrees with us too! Why don't you actually show us something?\"\nTolfdir: \"All right, let's settle down. I suppose we can try something practical... In continueing with out theme of safety, we'll start with Wards. Wards are protective spells that block magic. I'll teach you all a ward, and we'll see if you can succesfully use it to block spells, all right?\"\nJ'zargo: \"Oh, don't listen to him.

I'd like you all to continue practicing with wards, please. I think perhaps we're ready to begin exploring some of the various applications of magic throughout history. The College has undertaken a fascinating excavation in the ruins of Saarthal nearby. It's an excellent learning opportunity. I suggest we meet there in a few hours, and see what awaits us inside. That's all for now, thank you.\""}

He\u00a0will mention that he wants to retrieve an amulet, which was given to him by his family.\nOnmund traded this amulet to one of the College's shadiest vendors,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Enthir\"&gt;Enthir&lt;/a&gt;. He regrets this decision, and wants the amulet back as a reminder of his family, despite them not being very close.\nSpeak with Enthir, and he will decline to return the amulet; stating that all trades are final. However, with a high enough skill level in &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt;, Enthir can be persuaded to return the\u00a0amulet, thus updating the quest. Note, however, that the Speech skill needed to convince Enthir to give up the amulet is very high (75, or 53 with the Persuasion perk), so it may not be possible to pass the Speech check at lower levels without assistance (&lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Amulet of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions of glibness&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) of some sort.\nIf the Dragonborn is unable to persuade him, after some argument he will agree to give the amulet back if the Dragonborn can retrieve the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Staff%20of%20Charming\"&gt;Grand Staff of Charming&lt;/a&gt;. This staff can be found inside a radiant location, which will be marked on the map. The area chosen for the staff will usually host spellcasters of some sort, and the staff will be found in the boss chest of that particular dungeon.\nAfter retrieving the staff for Enthir and returning the amulet to Onmund, the Dragonborn will be rewarded with Onmund's friendship. Completion of this quest also marks Onmund as a &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriage&lt;/a&gt; candidate, as well as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;."}

If proven accurate, we can expect this mine to maintain high production levels in the long term.\nWe have encountered one small and unexpected complication that we may need to address in the near future. The local labor force has started to report hearing what they describe as \"murmuring.\" They claim that it comes from somewhere within the mine. At first, we thought perhaps someone had become lost and stuck deeper in the mine. But after a thorough search we determined there was no way someone could have descended beyond our work camps. \nI personally have not heard this supposed murmuring. When I asked one miner whom I generally trust, he described it thusly:\n\"All around us while we work are the clangs and pounding of the mine, right? Most times that's all you can hear. But soon, some of us started hearing a slight whisper just on the edge of it all. At first, I thought Endannor was playing games. You know how he's that type, right? But he swore to me that he heard it, too. \n\"As we dug deeper, it only grew louder. I could hear many voices muttering within the rocks but could never make out the words. But I could tell they were angry. Sometimes they made me angry as well.\"\nI regret to inform you that several of our labors were removed from the site due to losing control of their senses. One began shrieking unceasingly until sedated by a powder of ground herbs. Another banged her head against the stone wall until knocked unconscious. Each was removed from the work camps so they didn't disturb our efforts here.\nAs you can tell, I feel at something of an impasse. Production remains quite high, but the risks appear to grow as we continue. For now, work will continue unabated until I receive guidance from you."}

The Aedra was doubtless of his sphere, and so Molag Bal set upon Nirn to best death.\n&lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; was still young, and filled with danger and wondrous magick when Bal walked in the aspect of a man and took a virgin, &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Beolfag\"&gt;Lamae Beolfag&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; Peoples. Savage and loveless, Bal profaned her body, and her screams became the &lt;a href=\"Shriekwind%20Bastion\"&gt;Shrieking Winds&lt;/a&gt;, which still haunt certain winding fjords of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Shedding a lone droplet of blood on her brow, Bal left Nirn, having sown his wrath.\nViolated and comatose, Lamae was found by nomads, and cared for. A fortnight hence, the nomad wyrd-woman enshrouded Lamae in pall for she had passed into death. In their way, the nomads built a bonfire to immolate the husk. That night, Lamae rose from her funeral pyre, and set upon the coven, still aflame. She ripped the throats of the women, ate the eyes of the children, and raped their men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her.\nAnd so; Lamae, (who is known to us as blood-matron) imprecated her foul aspect upon the folk of Tamriel, and begat a brood of countless abominations, from which came the vampires, most cunning of the night-horrors. And so was the scourge of undeath wrought upon Tamriel, cruelly mocking Arkay's rhythm of life and death through all the coming eras of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;, and for all his sadness, Arkay knew this could not be undone."}

It can be used to make &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; at an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of many &lt;a href=\"insects\"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt; found living in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHarvesting.\nLike most flying insects, the process of harvesting dartwings can be slow-going, although two wings are added to the inventory for each successful catch. Unlike butterflies, dartwings startle easily, and once the player moves near to them it will not be long before they flee the area entirely - thus, they must be captured quickly upon approaching them.\nEarly in the game, a reasonable quantity of dartwings can be obtained in relative safety and without the aid of magic by swimming around &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Ilinalta\"&gt;Lake Ilinalta&lt;/a&gt;. Swimming around the perimeter of the lake, one will encounter groups of 3 small fish swimming near the surface; these fish can be caught for reagents as well, but there will be a group of 3 dartwings hovering just overhead above the surface. It is best to catch the dartwings before the fish, as the former quickly dart away once disturbed whereas the fish will remain. Since this process involves swimming, it may be easiest to carry it out in the first person view. Spotting the group of fish from a distance while under water, then surfacing to line up with the dartwings, then rushing forward to grab as many as possible can be an effective technique. The fish will not startle or swim away and can be harvested themselves for additional reagents afterwards.\nFor faster harvesting later in the game, one can use the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Storm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Storm&lt;/a&gt; which will speed the process up significantly. This is because insects caught in this spell's 'field of effect' are not flung away, but rather remain frozen in place then fall directly to the ground where they may be easily picked up. (Butterfly wings actually make a thump when they hit the ground.) &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; is great for retrieval or to simply locate items in grassy areas.\nThe &lt;a href=\"fish%20hatchery\"&gt;fish hatchery&lt;/a&gt; included in the add-on is the best known location for harvesting. Just cast Ice Storm so that it skims over the water and the frozen dartwings will fall to the bottom. The unique color of the lake floor makes this location ideal for easily locating the frozen dartwings.\nThis technique can also be used inside the garden wing (if built) and if aimed carefully will cause little to no chaos with the placed items. Sometimes casting straight up will cause insects previously unseen to fall."}

Today, these particular clans have disappeared, either absorbed into more powerful clans or simply faded away, but at their height they had remarkable influence on Orc culture and the raising of Orsinium. Let's look at these clans and the symbols that identified them.\nClan Bragosh, the Hammer Clan\nKnown for their &lt;a href=\"smithing\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; skills, this clan created specialized armor and weapons and was known as a trader of goods and supplies. Evidence suggests the clan was eventually absorbed by the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20clan\"&gt;Morkul clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nClan Pandrum, the Fire Clan\nA clan rumored to be filled with primitive &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s and shamans, they supposedly controlled fire, using it as both a weapon and a tool to take care of a variety of tasks. They seem to have disappeared from history after the second siege of Orsinium.\nClan Enclave, the Star Clan\nNot much is known about this mysterious clan, other than they provided aid to other clans for their own purposes. Rumors persist that the clan still exists somewhere deep in the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; wilderness.\nClan Luccin, the Wolf Clan\nThis clan was known for conducting effective and terrorizing raids during the night. They were adept at moving through darkness and often took their enemies completely by surprise. Some believe that the clan was eventually absorbed by the &lt;a href=\"Shatul%20clan\"&gt;Shatul clan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Clan%20Murtag\"&gt;Clan Murtag&lt;/a&gt;, the Rock Clan\nOne of the oldest clans still in existence to the current day, this clan makes its home in the mountains of Wrothgar, carving dwellings deep within the very rock itself.\nClan Ruskahr, the Owl Clan\nA clan of highly skilled archers, they were known for their impressive tracking and hunting skills. They revered owls of all types, but especially the snow owl."}

The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; have lived in Skyrim for centuries in tribal communities based around Strongholds.\nOrcs here live according to the rule of Malacath. &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Orcs, is worshipped in these places. The strongholds are for Orcs only, but the Dragonborn can be granted entry if they complete any of the qualifying tasks. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is an Orc, access will be granted automatically.\nHistory.\nIn the middle of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Orsimer and their leader &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; attempted to halt the movement of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. The Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; ate Trinimac, corrupting his body and spirit, and he emerged as the Daedric Prince Malacath. All of the Orsimer people were also changed into what they are now known as, the Orcs. The early Orcish people founded the tribal and independent lifestyle of living. Instead of claiming one area, they would settle in multiple provinces dependent on the preferences and lifestyles of each individual tribe. These &lt;a href=\"province\"&gt;province&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0came to be known as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The Orcs would form small, tightly-knit strongholds and villages across these provinces while others gradually contributed to the formation of the predominantly Orcish city of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0\nDuring the early &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; and the sacking of Orsinium, many surviving Orcs fled east into Skyrim while others fled into the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and successfully integrated into the clanish strongholds.\nSociety.\nStrongholds are governed by a rigid class system. Every Orc has a specific job and is obligated to perform it. Every man, woman, and child in the fort is also trained from birth to defend it. The strongholds are led by a chief, who killed the previous chief to prove his strength. Only the chiefs are allowed to have wives, and due to this, they often have several. This method is to ensure that the strongest Orc becomes chief, contributing his genes to the next generation of Orcs who, in theory, should be stronger than the last.\nOrcs in strongholds follow their own law called \"The Code of Malacath.\" The will of Malacath is clarified by the stronghold's resident wise woman. The rules of the Code are simple: don't kill, don't steal and don't attack people without reason. They do not have jails; instead, offenders are forced to pay a \"blood price,\" in which the criminal bleeds until the victim is satisfied. In cases where the victim was murdered, the chief is consulted to impose an appropriate penalty. All Orcs in the strongholds belong to a faction called &lt;a href=\"Tribal%20Orcs\"&gt;Tribal Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Committing a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; against any of the Orcs in any of the strongholds results in a bounty in all the strongholds.\nGaining entrance.\nThere are a number of ways to gain access to the Orc strongholds of Skyrim:\nAs an Orc.\nIf the Dragonborn is an Orc, they will be welcomed by the strongholds of Skyrim, upon approaching one of the strongholds, the Orc watching the gate will speak to them, starting the following conversation:\n\"Welcome, child of Malacath. Your kin bid you welcome to our stronghold.\"\nStrongholds.\n&lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are several strongholds in Skyrim;\nAsking a guard at one of the strongholds if there are any others will reveal all the other strongholds on the map as unexplored locations. Some city hold guards might talk about one of the strongholds if the stronghold is in the same hold."}

At a young age Uriel was told by his mother that he was the rightful Emperor, and was married to &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Rakma\"&gt;Princess Rakma&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the support of &lt;a href=\"Farrun\"&gt;Farrun&lt;/a&gt;. \nWar of the Red Diamond.\nIn the year 3E 119, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt; was crowned as Empress following the death of her father, &lt;a href=\"Antiochus%20Septim\"&gt;Antiochus&lt;/a&gt;.

She was betrayed by the Duke of Glenpoint and captured. Uriel then attacked Imperial forts along the eastern islands of\u00a0Morrowind, and the Empress's consort died defending these forts.With the Imperial army split in an attempt to defend High Rock and Morrowind, Uriel's forces marched on the Imperial City and took it after a fortnight. Uriel was crowned Emperor, and the war of the Red Diamond began in the year 3E 121.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt; took control of Western High Rock in 3E 125, Uriel marched an army to meet him. In the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 127 he was defeated and captured, and on the way to &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt; for his trial was attacked by vigilantes.

He was appointed King of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Cassynder\"&gt;Cassynder&lt;/a&gt; abdicated due to poor health. At the time of his succession to Emperor in &lt;a href=\"3E%20202\"&gt;3E 202&lt;/a&gt;, he left High Rock to reign as Uriel Septim IV. To the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nobility\"&gt;nobility&lt;/a&gt;, and the people as a whole, he was a bastard child of Katariah. Uriel did not possess his mother's dynamism, his forty three-year reign being a hotbed of sedition. Despite the Lariat family's respected position (they were distant cousins of the Septims), few of the Elder Council were receptive to his claim as a blood relative of Tiber Septim.\nHis father was Gallivere Lariat, who was a well noted and respected &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; Nobleman. Although Cassynder had legally made Uriel IV a Septim after he became the King of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; (High Rock province), this did not matter to the people, especially since the Elder Council were effectively running the empire. Indeed, its final act of rebellion against him was that his son, &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt;, was disinherited of his title, and &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt; became Emperor instead.\nThe Council had already established itself as a significant authority during his mother Katariah's many travels and the short reign of the frail Cassynder. As such, their power was remarkable, and as a perceivably alien monarch, Uriel IV found it impossible to keep them faithful, or even respectful, of his authority as Emperor. Time and time again, the Council and Emperor were at odds; and time and time again, the Council won the battles. Since the days of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20II\"&gt;Pelagius II&lt;/a&gt;, the Elder Council had consisted of the wealthiest men and women in the Empire, and the power they wielded was, at the time, ultimate. This subjugation continued throughout Uriel IV's reign.\nUriel IV died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20247\"&gt;3E 247&lt;/a&gt; with the throne going to a cousin more closely related to Tiber Septim, &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;."}

He inherited the throne from his father, &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;, in 3E 268. His reign was marked by several ambitious conquests, the last of which was to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. He is regarded as the best warrior Emperor since his ancestor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAscension.\nUpon assuming the throne in 268, Uriel V immediately began to turn opinions, political and otherwise, in favor of the potential power the Empire could wield. At home, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; practically ran the Empire as Uriel V was away with his army. Turning the attention of Tamriel away from internal strife, he began planning his first series of invasions almost from the moment he took power.\nFirst invasion and heirs.\nHis first invasion was to the land of &lt;a href=\"Roscrea\"&gt;Roscrea&lt;/a&gt; (3E 271), which took his forces roughly four years to conquer. His next stop was &lt;a href=\"Cathnoquey\"&gt;Cathnoquey&lt;/a&gt; (3E 276), and after that, &lt;a href=\"Yneslea\"&gt;Yneslea&lt;/a&gt; (3E 279), &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt; (3E 284), and finally his ill-fated expedition to Akavir (3E 288) where he was killed in the \"Disaster at &lt;a href=\"Ionith\"&gt;Ionith&lt;/a&gt;\" in the year 3E 290. His son Uriel was born shortly before he embarked on the journey to Akavir. Uriel Septim V's other children, the twins &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eloisa%20Septim\"&gt;Eloisa Septim&lt;/a&gt; (by a different woman named &lt;a href=\"Thonica\"&gt;Thonica&lt;/a&gt;), were born about a month after he had set off to Akavir.\nAkaviri Invasion.\nUriel spent years amassing a massive naval force to launch an assault on the continent of Akavir. After a period of sailing across the sea to Akavir, his massive expedition disembarked and the attempted conquest began in earnest. However, around two years into the campaign, Uriel V was slain at the Battle of Ionith. Despite his manner of death, Uriel's reputation as a fighter is second only to Tiber Septim's in the people's opinion. His death forced the Imperial army into retreat from Akavir, and the continent has not been revisited by a foreign army since. Upon news of his death reaching &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VI\"&gt;Uriel Septim VI&lt;/a&gt;, at just five years old, was crowned the next Emperor of Tamriel."}

Due to the extreme youth of Uriel, his mother, Imperial Consort &lt;a href=\"Thonica\"&gt;Thonica&lt;/a&gt;, was given a restricted regency until Uriel was of sufficient age to govern satisfactorily. During this time, the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; held most of the kingdom's true power, thus enabling it to make much legislation\u2014some for its own favor and profit. Over the years, Uriel VI had been assuming positions of great variance, and at the age of 22 in &lt;a href=\"3E%20307\"&gt;3E 307&lt;/a&gt;, he was formally given rule over the Empire. However, the then-current mechanisms of government granted him little power, his only power of note being that of the veto.\nThe following six years saw the Emperor use his veto many times. He also revived previously defunct spy networks and guard units to bully and coerce those members of the Elder Council that opposed him. His half-sister &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt; would be an ally throughout this period, her marriage to Baron &lt;a href=\"Ulfe%20Gersen\"&gt;Ulfe Gersen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; putting her in possession of much wealth and influence. The sage &lt;a href=\"Ugaridge\"&gt;Ugaridge&lt;/a&gt; commented regarding this period, \"Uriel V conquered &lt;a href=\"Esroniet\"&gt;Esroniet&lt;/a&gt;, but Uriel VI conquered the Elder Council.\"\nUriel died in 3E 317 when he fell from his horse. He remained in a grave condition for some time, but despite the best efforts of the finest &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; healers, he could not be saved. He was succeeded by his sister &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt;."}

Throughout \"The Elder Scrolls\" series, Uriel plays a major role, with being a notable exception. He acts mainly as the catalyst of the events of each game, whether intentionally, such as sending the protagonist of , known as the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;; or indirectly, such as being kidnapped by the character &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, in the first game, .\nBackground.\nUriel Septim VII is the son of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Pelagius Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;. Uriel came to power in &lt;a href=\"3E%20368\"&gt;3E 368&lt;/a&gt;, and reigned for several decades before his eventual death as an aged monarch in 3E 433. Uriel's reign was marked by great change over Tamriel, as the Empire moved further towards becoming a fully unified state spread across the continent.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nUriel Septim assumed the title of &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel when his father, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Pelagius Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;, died in 3E 368. At the time of Pelagius' death, Tamriel was in the midst of a long process of unification between the provinces, and was close to becoming a fully fledged confederation state. Uriel, at the age of 22, sought to continue this integration by pursuing bold, aggressive policies within the Empire and on its fringes.\nAn Emperor's Life.\nThe early decades of Emperor Uriel's life were marked by aggressive expansion and consolidation of Imperial influence throughout the Empire, especially in the east provinces of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Empire's powers were limited, Imperial culture was weak, and native customs and traditions were strong and staunchly opposed to assimilation. During this period, Uriel greatly benefited from the arcane support and shrewd council of his close advisor, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUriel was married to Lady &lt;a href=\"Caula%20Voria\"&gt;Caula Voria&lt;/a&gt; and had three sons together, &lt;a href=\"Geldall%20Septim\"&gt;Geldall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enman%20Septim\"&gt;Enman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebel%20Septim\"&gt;Ebel&lt;/a&gt;. Though she was said to be a beautiful and charming woman who was much loved and admired by the people, the Empress in private was also a deeply unpleasant, arrogant, ambitious, and grasping person. Uriel found himself subjugated in his relationship and came to regret his mistake of marriage. He was repelled by her, and thus he fathered at least two illegitimate sons, &lt;a href=\"Calaxes%20Septim\"&gt;Calaxes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;. The latter of the two eventually succeeded him to the throne, if only briefly. The relationship gradually grew more bitter, and their three children were to bear witness to this unhappy marriage.\nThrough this time, however, it became evident that Uriel was in possession of an agile mind; he had outstripped his masters in the skills of threat and diplomacy. Uriel's success in co-opting &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; as an advance guard of Imperial culture and economic development in Morrowind is a noteworthy example. However, during this time, Uriel also grew in pride and self-assurance. Through this time, Jagar Tharn had purchased the complete trust that led to Uriel's betrayal and imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and Tharn's usurpation of the Imperial throne, which followed the dark period known as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nCast Away.\nUriel spent ten years in Oblivion, being sent there in 3E 389, before his eventual rescue in 399. Little is known of Uriel's experience while trapped in Oblivion. He says he remembers nothing but an endless sequence of waking and sleeping nightmares. He explains he believed himself to be dreaming, and had no notion of the passage of time. Publicly, he long claimed to have no memory of the dreams and nightmares of his imprisonment, but from time to time, during the interviews with the Emperor that form the basis of this biography, he would relate details of nightmares he had, and would describe them as similar to the nightmares he had when he was imprisoned in Oblivion. He seemed not so much unwilling as incapable of describing the experience.\nReturn to Nirn.\nThe Emperor emerged from Oblivion as a changed man, while in &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; he was young, full of pride, energy, and ambition. By the time of his restoration, after his rescue and return to the throne, he was aging, grave, patient, and cautious. He also became conservative and pessimistic, and it became clear that the days of his bold policy-making were over. Uriel accounts for this change as a reaction to and revulsion for the early teachings and council of Jagar Tharn. Uriel's exile in Oblivion also drained and wasted him in body and spirit, although his mind retained the shrewd cunning and flexibility of his youth.\nIn his absence, a period known as the Imperial Simulacrum, the traitor mage Jagar Tharn had neglected and mismanaged Imperial affairs. This resulted in a steady decline in the Empire's economic prosperity, and allowed many petty lords and kings to challenge the authority of the Empire. It also permitted strong local rulers in the East and the West to indulge in open warfare over lands and sovereign rights.\nWhen Jagar was finally deposed in &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, Uriel Septim turned from the aggressive campaign of military intimidation and diplomatic accommodation of his earlier years, and relied instead on clandestine manipulation of affairs behind the scenes, primarily through the agencies of the various branches of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo achievements occurred in the post-Jagar period. These include the Miracle of Peace, also popularly known as &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;, that transformed the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region from an unruly assortment of warring petty kingdoms into the well-ordered and peaceful modern counties of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Secondly, the colonization of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, presided over by the skillful machinations of &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;King Helseth&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind and &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Lady Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen-Mother, brought Morrowind more closely into the sphere of Imperial influence.\nThe Empire entered a period of peace and prosperity comparable to the early years of Uriel's reign. With the Imperial Heartland and West solidly integrated into the Empire, Uriel was able to turn his full attention to the east - to Morrowind.\nExploiting conflicts at the heart of Morrowind's monolithic &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the long-established Great House system of government, Uriel took advantage of the terrible threat that the corrupted divine beings at the heart of the Tribunal religion presented to the growing colonies on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Uriel worked through the shadowy agents of the Blades and through the court of King Helseth in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; to shift the center of political power in Morrowind from the Great House councils to Helseth's court, and took advantage of the collapse of the orthodox Tribunal cults to establish the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; as the dominant faith in &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and Vvardenfell districts.\nDeath.\nAt the beginning of , Uriel Septim VII still ruled Tamriel. The game is set in the year 3E 433, the year of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. The very beginning of the game covers the final hours of Uriel Septim's reign. Uriel gives the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, before he is killed by a dagger wound inflicted by an &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; cult. The emperor, having heard of the recent assassinations of his other sons, was attempting to make his escape through a network of passages underneath the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;. The Emperor had reigned in Tamriel for 55 years (65 including his time in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;), and was aged 87 when he died. Uriel was fully aware of his impending demise, of the looming threat to Tamriel as a whole, and of the cosmic importance of the prisoner in the cell containing the secret passage (the Hero of Kvatch), probably from his nightmares during his incarceration in Oblivion during \"Arena\".\nShortly before the Emperor's death, it is revealed to the mysterious prisoner accompanying the Emperor that an illegitimate heir remains, thus keeping alive the hope that the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20bloodline\"&gt;Septim bloodline&lt;/a&gt; may continue. The Emperor's death marked the beginning of the invasion of Tamriel by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; and Oblivion. It is explained that, as long as an Emperor of Septim blood wears the Amulet of Kings and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; are kept alight, the forces of Oblivion are held at bay. Uriel's death, and the subsequent extinguishing of the Dragonfires, thus allowed the barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion to be breached, heralding the end of the period of peace which Uriel fostered in his later years.\nHis illegitimate son, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;, briefly became the 22nd official &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, before sacrificing himself to save Tamriel during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;."}

Throughout the caverns, many mummies are positioned on strategic places, holding weapons or armor or seemingly reading books. The burial objects are most likely personal belongings, referring to the once living Ashlander. Also, a great number of skulls are inserted in stone pillars.\nLocation.\nThe caverns are located in a remote area of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands%20Region\"&gt;Ashlands Region&lt;/a&gt; south-southeast of &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Camp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and a fair distance from any major towns or cities.\nSublocations.\nWithin the cave, the explorer will discover seven distinct burial caverns:\nAstral Burial.\nThe Astral Burial is the first part of the caverns upon entering. A door leads to &lt;a href=\"%23Karma%20Burial\"&gt;Karma Burial&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are two undead defending the area (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Champion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Skeleton Champions&lt;/a&gt;), as well as a lower type (i.e., a &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;) toward the back. At the start of this chamber are two inactive mummies, each holding an object for the taking, and each seated atop a stone pillar. Note: the objects (&lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amulets%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) found with the mummies throughout the burial caverns, are positioned in the arms or next to the corpses \u2014 not inside them. To reach the mummies throughout the caverns will require good &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;, jumping, and &lt;a href=\"Levitate%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;levitation&lt;/a&gt; skills. Halfway down the chamber, there are jutting boulders above (available only with levitation). These form a natural bridge, connecting two chambers running perpendicular (one on each side) to the chamber below. Each has a single mummy, and each has a single defender of a type similar to what was below.\nFragile Burial.\nAccess to thus chamber is via the first (lowest) door along the outer wall of the &lt;a href=\"%23Laterus%20Burial\"&gt;Laterus Burial&lt;/a&gt; (found by following the ascending stone path, clockwise, to the left upon entering from the &lt;a href=\"%23Karma%20Burial\"&gt;Karma Burial&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere are two mummies atop stone pillars in the flooded entry chamber. From here, there are three sub-chambers.\nThe one to the left (northeast) has two urns: one containing &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt;; the other, random &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. Atop the center stone pillar sits a mummy, holding an amulet (i.e., a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Charm\"&gt;Bone Charm&lt;/a&gt;), and \"&lt;a href=\"Feyfolken%20I\"&gt;Feyfolken I&lt;/a&gt;\" (the &lt;a href=\"Enchant%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Enchant&lt;/a&gt; skill book). There is and a trapped, 35-lock small chest, as well (containing random loot: potion, books, sundries, etc.). There is one enemy, an &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Ghost\"&gt;Ancestral Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sub-chamber to the right (southwest) has enemies guarding it (a Skeleton Champion, and farther back, an &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Ghost\"&gt;Ancestral Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and another Skeleton Champion in the back. There is one mummy, with which lies a &lt;a href=\"Firebite%20War%20Axe\"&gt;Firebite War Axe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bonemold%20helm\"&gt;Bonemold helm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bonemold%20Tower%20Shield\"&gt;Bonemold Tower Shield&lt;/a&gt;). There is &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20Worm%20Lord%27s%20tomb\"&gt;a key&lt;/a&gt; that lies near the bottom of the shield (used for the submerged door to the southeast sub-chamber). On the ground lies a &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Adventurer\"&gt;Dead Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; containing items to loot (random weapon, &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;lockpick&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"probe\"&gt;probe&lt;/a&gt;).\nStraight ahead (southeast from the entry) and underwater is a trapped, 10-lock door (which can be opened using the key found using the southwest sub-chamber). This opens to the southeast sub-chamber. Somewhat near the entrance lies a lower-level piece &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Ringmail%20Cuirass\"&gt;Nordic Ringmail Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;, under the shallow water. At the end is another flooded area with three mummies, along with a &lt;a href=\"Worm%20Lord\"&gt;Worm Lord&lt;/a&gt; enemy (who can summon a helper). With the mummies are a &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Shield%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Glass Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20Talara%2C%20Part%204\"&gt;Mystery of Talara, Part 4&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Closed%20Helm%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebony Closed Helm&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to, or upon existing, another enemy (Skeleton Champion, etc.) may be present.\nJuno Burial.\nIn the last room of the Juno Burial, the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Wraith of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt; can be found, who must be killed during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Meet%20Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Meet Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt;\" in order to obtain the quest-required &lt;a href=\"Bonebiter%20Bow%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a cultic vestibule with more guardians.\nThis is the last, and highest, of the four chambers off the &lt;a href=\"%23Laterus%20Burial\"&gt;Laterus Burial&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering the chamber, it is likely the Skeleton Champion, up ahead at the first bend, will spot will the Nerevarine and come to attack. At this bend, there is a ledge above, which is the same path, only looping back. Levitating to take this shortcut will still not avoid the second Skeleton Champions guarding the path at that point.\nAssuming that the 'shortcut' was not taken, the path winds its way along and then up and back to that overlook point. Continuing along, the path soon arrives at an open-space chamber, where a third and fourth Skeleton Champions will attack, if they haven't already joined in the previous battle battles with the first two.\nIn the first part of the open chamber are two of the now familiar skull-ringed pillars, surrounded by glowing basins. The first, almost directly ahead, has a &lt;a href=\"Standard%20Fortify%20Magicka%20Potion\"&gt;Standard Fortify Magicka Potion&lt;/a&gt; on the rim of one of the glowing basins. Another has a &lt;a href=\"Journeyman%27s%20Armorer%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Journeyman's Armorer's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Saber%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Iron Saber&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second skull-ringed pillar is at the right side (southwest corner) of this first chamber. One the rim of one glowing basin is a &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Glass%20Bowl\"&gt;Yellow Glass Bowl&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%27s%20Probe\"&gt;Apprentice's Probe&lt;/a&gt; inside it, and &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Leather%20Boots\"&gt;Netch Leather Boots&lt;/a&gt; next to it. There is a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Dagger%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Steel Dagger&lt;/a&gt; on the rim of the other glowing basin.\nAs your character heads farther back, through the caves double-archway hall to the back chamber, the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Wraith of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt; will be there, ready to attack.\nIn that back chamber, a mummy sits atop a pillar on one side, with a &lt;a href=\"Quality%20Frost%20Shield\"&gt;Quality Frost Shield&lt;/a&gt; potion in front of it. On the opposite wall sits a second mummy. In its hand is a &lt;a href=\"Common%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Common Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt; filled with the soul of a &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;, and with a portion of &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dreugh Wax&lt;/a&gt; at its feet.\nA word of warning: make sure you have the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; take the &lt;a href=\"Bonebiter%20Bow%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt; from the ash-pile remains of the &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Wraith of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt;, once he is defeated. After three game days, if the bow has not been taken, it will disappear along with the wraith's remains (for more information, see the article regarding the \"&lt;a href=\"Meet%20Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Meet Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt;\" quest.\nKakuna Burial.\nThe entrance to this chamber is the third door up the winding stone path in the &lt;a href=\"%23Laterus%20Burial\"&gt;Laterus Burial&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are three enemies (Skeleton Champions) farther along the passage. One is farther back along the flooded path, and two are originally up on the raised plateau of the inner chamber. Regardless, one or two will come to attack if they see the PC at the entrance. Otherwise, they will need to be dealt with deeper along (and if seen, those above will jump down to attack).\nThe chamber is smaller than the others, with the cavern's open space just a few steps along the passage. Nevertheless, much of the exploring is up above on the high-and-dry plateau at the right side of the open space. The character can reach it by levitation, or via the narrow, and slightly tricky stone pathway that winds back from the left wall. The tricky part is jumping the gap at the top. If still weak in Acrobatics, it may be easier to aim for the left 'landing' space (flat-topped pillar) than the right \u2014 then jump-and shimmy up among the rocks that form a type of stepping-stone path on the plateau.\nOn the stone directly ahead from the 'jumping on' point is seated a mummy holding a &lt;a href=\"Chitin%20Shortsword\"&gt;Chitin Shortsword&lt;/a&gt;. The stone above it has an urn with random ingredients. The stone to the left, on the other side of the glowing, stone basin, sits a second mummy. This one holds a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Halberd\"&gt;Steel Halberd&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing along to the left of that, in a type of ascending path (hopping stone to stone), is another urn of random ingredients. After that is a third mummy, atop another, higher, rock situated more toward the middle of the plateau. It is holding a &lt;a href=\"Chitin%20Spear\"&gt;Chitin Spear&lt;/a&gt;, and has an urn next to it (with still more random ingredients).\nJumping down from there onto the next stone below, there is a fourth mummy. This one holds a magic scroll (&lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Hellfire\"&gt;Scroll of Hellfire&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 one can only hope the ancient who put it there wasn't wishing such a fate on that particular, long-departed mummy).\nOn the plateau ground, next to the glowing, stone basin to the right of this fourth mummy, is the fourth urn holding random ingredients. A few feet to the right of that is another urn, between two of the rocks. This one (unlike the others) holds several different types of magic scrolls.\nBack to the left on the plateau, next to the skull-circled totem pillar, lies yet another &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Adventurer\"&gt;Dead Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; (like the others, this one contains random weapon, armor, lockpick, and probe, and possibly a gold coin \u2014 but its likelihood may be stronger to find a better weapon, some orcish armor, and master and grandmaster lock-breaking equipment).\nThe backdrop to all these lower stepping stones are higher stepping stones. On top of the highest, back toward the right side of the plateau, there are two chests. One with random potions, books, and sundries or gold. The other, a 20-lock chest, contains potions.\nThere is another part to the chamber, back beyond the raised plateau, behind the waterfall. Half-way up is a stone ledge. If you have a levitation spell or already found the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Wizard's Staff&lt;/a&gt; on the high ledge in &lt;a href=\"%23Laterus%20Burial\"&gt;Laterus Burial&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine can fly to it. On this ledge are two mummies. Next to one is a small chest containing random gems, and a &lt;a href=\"Devil%20Cephalopod%20Helm\"&gt;Devil Cephalopod Helm&lt;/a&gt;. Next to the other are two urns containing random ingredients (in case you haven't got enough already).\nKarma Burial.\nKarma Burial features an underground lake with several miniscule islands. With the appropriate &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; skill, the Nerevarine can hop from one to the other along. A dead adventurer lies on one of the islands. A door leads to &lt;a href=\"%23Laterus%20Burial\"&gt;Laterus Burial&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe initial path leading down contains two undead defenders. After which it opens to the small, slightly flooded chamber \u2014 crossed by swimming, water walking, or by a series of stones that may be reached by jumping. On one of these flat stones (at the northeast of this little space) is the body of the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Adventurer\"&gt;Dead Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; (containing a mix of armor, weapons, etc.). Next to that (to the north; right) amidst the glowing ritual pools and pillared ring of skulls, are two urns (one containing several scrolls). The similar, skull-ringed pillar directly to the southwest has a small, 20-lock chest containing a random bit of loot (typically, gold coins).\nThe path north from there leads to another small open chamber, guarded by two more defenders of similar type. In here are three more mummies with weapons available to loot.\nThe short path to the south, guarded by a lower-level defender (a rat, etc.), leads to the entrance into the Laterus Burial chamber.\nKefka Burial.\nGoing up the winding path in the &lt;a href=\"%23Laterus%20Burial\"&gt;Larerus Burial&lt;/a&gt;, the second door leads into the Kefka Burual.\nImmediately upon entering the chamber, a Skeleton Champion will attack from a raised ledge.\nAfter that encounter, there is a pool of water to the right, a short distance into the passage. Following the bubbles down under the water to the bottom will be a &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Cuirass\"&gt;Dreugh Cuirass&lt;/a&gt;.\nFarther along, there is a stone ramp leading to the open sub-chamber towards the right. There will be three more Skeleton Champions to contend with. If they all attack at once, an emergency option is to run back to the entrance and climb or levitate to that upper ledge from where the first enemy attacked. This is a place they cannot reach. From that position, ranged weapons or magic, or summoning, can eliminate them with minimal risk.\nThe open space beyond the stone ramp contains three of the now-familiar pillared stones, lit by glowing pools and surrounded by the skull totems (draped in an artistic or rather cultlike manner). A fourth is a bit farther back, in the small space connected to this main chamber.\nThe first totem pillar has a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Flin\"&gt;Flin&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of one of its glowing pools, and a &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Club\"&gt;Dreugh Club&lt;/a&gt; on another. On the ground next to it lies a &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Adventurer\"&gt;Dead Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who, obviously did not survive the multiple foes present there. Like the others in the preceding chambers, she contains a random weapon, armor, lockpick, probe, and gold coin.\nTo the right are the second and third totem alters, each against the walls. One has a Chitin Shield. The other has two mummies \u2014 one with a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Sujamma%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sujamma&lt;/a&gt; next to it.\nThe final glowing totem pillar is in the sub-chamber to the back. It has two mummies, as well. One has a &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Claymore\"&gt;Nordic Claymore&lt;/a&gt; at its feet.\nLaterus Burial.\nThe Laterus Burial consists of a very high grotto with several cascades running down on the stone formation in the middle into an underground lake. Access to it is gained from the &lt;a href=\"%23Karma%20Burial\"&gt;Karma Burial&lt;/a&gt;. This burial chamber is the centerpiece of the whole site, linking to several other chambers. A stonetrail leads up to four door, leading to &lt;a href=\"%23Fragile%20Burial\"&gt;Fragile Burial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Kefka%20Burial\"&gt;Kefka Burial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%23Kakuna%20Burial\"&gt;Kakuna Burial&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%23Juno%20Burial\"&gt;Juno Burial&lt;/a&gt;. The unique &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Claymore%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Glass Claymore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magebane\"&gt;Magebane&lt;/a&gt;, can only be found here.\nIn this multi-story chamber there are eight mummies: four sitting among the rocks and outcrops on the central stone stalagmite, and four high above on ledges along the outer cliff wall. Most can only be reached by levitation.\nAround the center, one sits above the shortest, lowest waterfall to the east. It holds \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Suitors%20of%20Benitah\"&gt;The Four Suitors of Benitah&lt;/a&gt;\" book. Another, sitting above the northern waterfall, holds a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Helm\"&gt;Demon Helm&lt;/a&gt;. The third, is just before the narrow stone bridge that leads to door to Kakuna Burial. This mummy the weapon &lt;a href=\"Magebane\"&gt;Magebane&lt;/a&gt;). The fourth, counter clockwise and slightly higher from here is holding a relatively low-level amulet (i.e., &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Amulet\"&gt;Frost Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and has an urn next to it (containing a random ingredients).\nThe other four are along the outer cliff wall. Way up high in the chamber's west side is a bolder, the top of which serves as a ledge. On this ledge is a mummy holding a &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Staff\"&gt;Wizard's Staff&lt;/a&gt; (so, if you're low on levitation powers or potions, use such first to reach this powerful levitation staff). The &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Silence%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;\" is with this mummy, as well \u2014 as is an urn containing scrolls, and a 45-lock small chest containing a random stash of gems. All-in-all, a very generous mummy.\nOn the opposite cliff wall (east), on another boulder ledge sits another mummy, with &lt;a href=\"Glass%20Greaves%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Glass Greaves&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Kanet\"&gt;Gold Kanet&lt;/a&gt; flower at its feet. Clockwise from there are the two remaining mummies, both on similar ledges. These have nothing outside outside of themselves, but for one next to an urn containing random ingredients.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Meet%20Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Meet Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to be initiated into the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribe of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Urshilaku&lt;/a&gt; during the main quest, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; must bring back the &lt;a href=\"Bonebiter%20Bow%20of%20Sul-Senipul\"&gt;Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul&lt;/a&gt;, the Urshilaku's &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;Ashkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s father's old bow.\nNotable items.\nThe following table describes the items that may be found at this location and in which cavern:"}

She supports &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; and expresses anger towards &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; who wish to abolish it in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. She is solicitous, and will respond to cries for help from anyone nearby.\nWhen engaged in dangerous confrontations, she tends to stay and fight rather than flee, unless she becomes severely wounded and is in great distress. Conversely, Urtiso is fairly passive and will not initiate combat unless she has reason to dislike another person and witnesses them committing a crime.\nInteractions.\nAlthough Urtiso is not directly involved in any quests, with sufficient &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; she can provide useful information concerning people and items required for various quests.

Then she goes on the offense, casting &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Storm%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/a&gt; to damage her opponent's Health, followed by &lt;a href=\"Soulpinch\"&gt;Soulpinch&lt;/a&gt; to damage Magicka. She continues to cast varying offensive spells, and as her Magicka nears depletion she casts &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Dagger%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bound Dagger&lt;/a&gt; then switches to melee combat. When her bound items expire she continues the fight with her enchanted short blade, which inflicts &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; damage, until either she or her opponent is dead."}

I bought a sizable piece of land with a run-down farmhouse for dirt cheap just outside of &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;. No one else wanted it, on account of how rocky it is. Too many boulders, the other men said. But Jonquil and I have strong backs and willing hearts; we'll get those boulders out, and turn this fertile land into a plantation they could only dream of.\nThis will be the perfect place to raise our little Rin.\n21st of Second Seed\nLong day. Hand hurts almost too much to write. Farmhouse is repaired, and the first plants are in the ground. Feels good. We did it. Jonquil kissed me tonight like she did when we were first married. Her eyes are calling me.\n1st of Sun's Height\nWe harvested our first crops today. It wasn't much, but it's a start. When I watched the sun's rays first break over the horizon on our fields today, I knew what to name this place - Goldenhills Plantation, after &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;'s glorious light. Soon, it will be an worthy of our son. Just a bit longer, I know it.\n23rd of Frostfall\nMy heart is troubled. Rin is fast growing into a strapping young boy, though he spends too much time playing with that &lt;a href=\"Wooden%20Sword\"&gt;wooden sword&lt;/a&gt; of his and dreaming of running off to join the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut my dear wife, Jonquil... her strangeness worries me. Sometimes she'll disappear for hours at a time, and then turn up in the house as though she'd been there all along. I often see her carrying a basket full of strange dark flowers, and she won't tell me what they are or where she got them. And last winter, when Rin fell ill with fever, Jonquil produced a small black bottle from who knows where and poured who knows what down his throat... only a few minutes later, the fever was gone. Jonquil refused to tell me what was in the bottle, or where she got it. I was so happy that she saved our little boy, of course, but...\n&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; preserve me, but I'm afraid that my wife is a Daedra worshipper, or a witch.\n16th of Mid Year\nRin has been missing for three days. My little boy.\nI've searched everywhere, but there's no trace of him. Even his favorite toy sword is missing. What if wolves got him? Or brigands snatched him away?\nJonquil has been watching me. I don't like the look in her eyes. And she hasn't cried at all. What kind of mother doesn't cry when her child is missing?\nWhat if- I dare not even put the thought to paper. It's unthinkable.\nI found it. I found Jonquil's secret. This is the place she's been disappearing to. The potions, the plants, the books... such evil and unnatural things I found down there. &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; help me, my wife is a witch.\nI didn't want to open her foul books, but I had to know, I had to-\nDeadly &lt;a href=\"Nightshade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nightshade&lt;/a&gt;. That's what the plant is called, the one I saw her sneaking around with. She grows it everywhere in this hidden place.\nShe must have poisoned my son. I've seen the sneer on her face, the laughter in her eyes as she watched me tearing apart the farm looking for him. She was mocking me.\nI've never felt rage like this. I'm shaking with it, sweating with it. I know exactly what I've got to do. My son's spirit whispers to me, demanding vengeance.\nI keep an axe by the door for dealing with wild animals. It will do for a dealing with a witch as well."}

I'm more certain than ever that &lt;a href=\"Graguz\"&gt;Graguz&lt;/a&gt; and his \"initiation\" of fire is a terrible approach to recruitment. It has a poor survival rate. Besides, fire panics people, and a panicked person cannot be reasoned with. A true conversion requires us to get into the candidate's mind, show him or her a way out of their fear, and help them come to the proper acceptance of Trinimac's holy grace.\nI think my method is a much more solid approach. (Ha. A pun. Solid. My ice is certainly that!) Rooting an individual and trapping him or her using the new ice bindings I have crafted provides both pain and security without the unnecessary panic. The added benefit of giving a recruit the option to end the mild (in my opinion) torment is a brilliant idea if I do say so myself. I must remember to send a note to Hengart to thank him for the design of the switches and ice platforms.\nMy latest variation in the process seems to be the most effective yet. At the very least, it provides me with a certain level of amusement. I placed two candidates on the ice platforms at the same time and have provided each of them with a switch. And here's the genius of it! Each switch sets the other candidate free! So, which one will decide to sacrifice their own life so that the other may live? And the survivor? His or her guilt will open the path for Trinimac's light. The survivor will accept Trinimac more fully because he or she cannot accept that they caused another to die. The mind and soul will belong to the &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;, and Trinimac, utterly and completely.\nThis dual method is a bit slower, I confess, but I am enjoying watching each candidate's resolve as it starts to crumble. More as the experiment proceeds."}

On the surface, guarding the entrance, will be a necromancer and two bandits. If alerted, the necromancer will use a Conjuration spell to reanimate a third bandit's corpse, or one of the other two if they were killed with a sneak attack first. When the spell is broken, the reanimated corpse will dissolve into an ash pile. If it wasn't either bandit that was originally alive, expect to find the ash pile still there upon a return visit after the area respawns, and free to loot again for low-level armor, gold, and a weapon. If traveled through, a door to \"Ustengrav Depths\" will be found. The depths have leveled enemies (mostly &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and a few\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;), and at the base of the depths, next to a waterfall, one will find a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; that will give a word of\u00a0Become Ethereal shout.\nIn order to advance in the dungeon, one needs to solve a puzzle with three stone pillars that will glow red when walked past. As they glow, a gate ahead will open for a couple of seconds. One will need to use the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; Shout to open all three gates and pass through before they close again.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will send the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; on a final task to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; from Ustengrav, Jurgen Windcaller's burial site. A &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; can be gained if the horn is returned to his tomb after the quest.\nTrivia.\nMale necromancer: \"These thralls of yours are slower than Argonians in a blizzard.\"\nFemale necromancer: \"Feel free to grab a pick and help them out. I prefer not to sully myself with manual labor.\"\nMale necromancer: \"There goes another one.\"\nFemale necromancer: \"Bah! Weak-willed rabble. Even dead they're almost useless.\"\nMale necromancer: \"They seem less intelligent each time you raise them, if that's even possible.\"\nFemale necromancer: \"As long as they can swing a pickaxe where I tell them, they're as smart as we need them to be.\"\nMale necromancer: \"You hear that?

Thus, she was not accepted into the Companions, and bears a grudge against them which the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can ask about.\nInteractions.\nShe challenges the Dragonborn to a &lt;a href=\"Brawling\"&gt;brawl&lt;/a&gt; with a wager of 100 .

She can be both a follower and a spouse simultaneously.\nThe Dragonborn can also buy things from, and sell things to, Uthgerd, but if she is also acting as a follower, she instead tries to sell the items traded with her back to the Dragonborn and does not offer her original wares.\nAfter the wedding ceremony, if she goes back to wearing her default armor, despite having upgraded armor given to her prior to the wedding, wait a day or so and she will begin wearing the better armor, and the steel plate armor can be purchased from her.\nSteward.\nUthgerd can become a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; for one of the newly &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;constructed homes&lt;/a&gt; if the DLC has been installed.\nDeath.\nIf Uthgerd dies, the Dragonborn receives an &lt;a href=\"inheritance\"&gt;inheritance&lt;/a&gt; of 100\u2013400 , minus the Jarl's tax. Her &lt;a href=\"Coffin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;coffin&lt;/a&gt; will appear in Whiterun's &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\nUthgerd the Unbroken's primary skills are &lt;a href=\"One-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;One-Handed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Heavy Armor&lt;/a&gt;.

She fights best using either a one-handed weapon/shield combo, or dual-wielding one-handed weapons combined with strong Heavy Armor to make up for the lack of a shield. Her skill with a bow is decent, allowing her to perform fairly well at long range combat (especially if equipped with higher-grade arrows), even though it is not her primary strength.\nConversations.\nA jester in Whiterun.\nUthgerd: \"\"By &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, it's true.

He was born in 3E 375, and was kidnapped and died in 3E 400.\nDeath Note.\nThe following is directly transcribed from Vact's deathnote, found by the Agent.\n\"\"23 Morning Star 3E 400 The Fortress of Fhojum\"\n\"Two days ago I was sealed within this crypt without food or water. I do not know whether hunger or poor health or one of the creatures who share this dank hole with me will kill me first -- I only know that I will soon be dead, and not even my bones will remain. My hope is that in the years that come, this letter will be read and the sad story of Vact, Prince of Sentinel will be told.\"\n\"I am fifteen years old at the time of this writing, and have been plagued with bad health for most of my life, to the frustration of my hearty parents. The finest healers and apothecaries in western Tamriel have labored over my every cough and fever, but while they could save my life time and time again, they could not improve my sickly constitution. In retrospect, I received little real affection from the king and queen, embarrassed as they were about begetting such a cripple as the heir of the kingdom. I cannot say I missed the love; I received much attention from the doctors, priests, and herbalists constantly at courts. Certainly I was not the sort of warrior that King Cameron was, but one of my dearest friends, a priest of Stendarr said that I might be the first scholar-king in the history of Sentinel.\"\n\"My younger sister Aubk-i was the true favorite of my parents: athletic, beautiful, and charming. It is hard to think of an uncomplimentary word her her. I am resigned to my imminent death, and yet, I would like to see her once again. For six years, Aubk-i and I were the only children of Sentinel. Eight years ago, the queen had a boy child and named him Greklith, after the ancient Redguard word for Strong King. Few speak that tongue any longer, but all the scholars and nobles of Hammerfell understood. And Greklith is a strong boy indeed -- I have never so much as seen him cough. The Queen's next child, born only a year after Greklith, had an even more ominous birthname -- Lhotun. Second Boy. Perhaps had I been less sheltered, more suspicious by nature, I might have read into these nominations. Lhotun and Greklith are common enough names in our family, I reasoned. Now I know that even then, I was disinherited -- even if it was not official yet. For several months before Lhotun's birth and over three years afterwards, I was in the throes of a very serious fever. The doctors despaired of me, but somehow and very, very gradually, I recovered. For the first time, and the last, I read an expression on my father, the King's face that was not indifference. It was disgust.\"\n\"That was fortnight ago. Three nights ago, I was seized by men I had never seen while I was having a walk. My nursemaid stood by watching placidly as I was gagged and tied and thrown roughly into a sack. I do not know how long they rode with me, but I was eventually left here. When I finally freed myself from my bonds, I found that I was alone. My wanders have gotten me nowhere. This place is filled with undead creatures that prevent me from finding any exit. \"\n\"I have no hope left, but no fear either. A few regrets. Perhaps had I studied magic instead of history and science I could free myself of this place. One of my tutors told the story of the Underking, how he had placed his lifeforce in the body of a powerful being and had thus conquered all Tamriel long, long ago. Had I only had the strength of a more powerful body like that.\"\n\"But I did not study magic. I studied history, so I leave this letter -- not to revenge myself, but as an historic document.\"\""}

After a true, remembered encounter with the Daedric Lord, her followers often claim that nothing on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; holds any fear for them, as nothing can possibly be as frightening as being in Vaermina's presence.\nVaermina does not appear much in the lore of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, with one notable exception. When seeking a cure for &lt;a href=\"vampirism\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, in , Vaermina is named as the source of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s information on how to cure the disease.\nQuests.\nOblivion.\nDuring Vaermina's quest, the player gets a first-hand look at her penchant for psychological terror. To even speak to the Daedra, you must present a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;, a device whose purpose is to trap the soul of a sentient creature. You are then tasked with retrieving an artifact stolen from Vaermina by a wizard.\nWhen you track down the wizard's hideout, you enter a nightmare world full of lesser daedra and bizarre, otherworldly scenery. Some portions of the wizard's tower resemble the Deadlands, including the ever-present lava and claw-like bridges. Vaermina's final warning to you strongly implies that she, not the wizard, is responsible for the state of the tower. The wizard himself is found comatose, nearby Vaermina's precious Orb. Upon returning her artifact, the Daedra tells you that the wizard will be trapped in his nightmare forever, as punishment for his theft.\nVaermina rewards you with the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, a staff capable of creating a nightmare double of any humanoid creature, which automatically attacks the original being with a vengeance.\nSkyrim.\nIn the town of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will encounter\u2014either inside the inn or just outside of it\u2014a couple of citizens speaking with a robed man, speaking to them about their horrific nightmares. The man, named &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt;, seems to know something about the situation, but will not fully explain what it is when he's approached by the Dragonborn. The man claims to be a Priest of Mara, and that he can indeed remedy the situation, but is in need the Dragonborn's help.\nHe then leads the Dragonborn to a tower overlooking the town. Upon reaching the tower, the priest explains that the tower used to be a shrine dedicated to Vaermina. Long ago, a band of &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; invaded the tower and had a bloody conflict with all those dwelling inside. As a last-ditch effort to prevent the Orcs from seizing the inner sanctum in which the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Skull of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; stands, the priests released &lt;a href=\"the%20Miasma\"&gt;the Miasma&lt;/a&gt;, a gas which instantly puts all those who inhale it into an unbreakable deep hibernation, while also keeping those slumbering perfectly preserved.\nUnfortunately, the longer one stays asleep under the Miasma's influence, the more their mind breaks down. As such, upon entering the tower and breaking the air-tight seal, the Miasma recedes, allowing the Orcs and priests to awaken and begin attacking in a frenzy. Upon entering the shrine, the priest explains to the Dragonborn how the Skull of Corruption is the source of everyone's nightmares, since it devours dreams and memories for Vaermina to collect.\nAlong the way to the inner sanctum, the Dragonborn must drink a special potion called &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%27s%20Torpor\"&gt;Vaermina's Torpor&lt;/a&gt; in order to get past a magical barrier. This potion allows one to enter a state of being called \"The Dreamstride.\" In theory, this allows someone to physically teleport across great distances. Any who drink it instantly fall asleep and enter a dream-like world of the memories from someone nearby. Where they are in the world during The Dreamstride when they wake up is where their physical body will be in the physical world. As such, the hero visits the memory of a Priest of Vaermina on the day that the Orcs invaded, allowing the hero to witness as this priest runs to the device that sets up the barrier and releases the Miasma. Upon doing this in the dream, the hero awakens in the physical world, looking at the barrier control device (a soul gem).\nHaving circumvented the barrier, the priest and the hero make their way into the inner sanctum where they find two of the priest's former companions. Upon defeating them and having the Skull within sight, Vaermina's disembodied voice speaks out, telling the Dragonborn that the priest is trying to deceive them, and that they should kill the priest and claim the staff for their own. If the priest is allowed to finish the ritual, he won't turn against the player, and he may be recruited as a companion. As a result, though, the Skull can not be obtained. Alternately, if he is killed by the Dragonborn, then the Skull of Corruption will be rewarded to them and count towards the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Walker\"&gt;Oblivion Walker&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nOnline.\nVaermina serves as the main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; region in . Vaermina's cultists led an assault against Stormhaven, with her having her lover and champion, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Terror%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Night Terror&lt;/a&gt;, help her in &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;'s kidnapping to bring to &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt; through the use of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina%27s%20Mirror\"&gt;Vaermina's Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. Upon saving the king and killing the Night Terror, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is promised that even if he or she escapes from Quagmire then, she would cause extreme suffering for killing her lover in the future."}

Head in there, and you will find yourself in a version of Wayrest filled with the shades of &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt;. Your objective here is to locate King Emeric; he will be to your southeast past several buildings. Along the way, you will see several visions of Emeric's friends and loved ones betraying him. Emeric himself will be standing by the guillotine, sentencing someone to death. Speak with him, and it will be revealed that the man to be executed is in fact the old king Emeric; once the conversation is over, the fake Emeric will disappear and you can speak with the real one. \nSir Hughes: \"When Galthis rules Stormhaven, I will return for Sir Hughes!\"\nHosni at-Tura: \"When Galthis is king, Hosni At-Tura will not elude me again.\"\nGeneral Godrun: \"When the Night Terror has seized Stormhaven, General Godrun will obey me again!\"\nEmeric will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Galthis\"&gt;Galthis&lt;/a&gt; is located in Emeric's castle, but you must first find the keys to get in there. These keys can be collected in any order. The Key of the Knight will be directly west of your current location, in a temple. You will find a demonic version of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Hughes\"&gt;Sir Hughes&lt;/a&gt; guarding it. The Key of the Thief will be south of here, atop a flight of stairs. This key will be guarded by &lt;a href=\"Count%20Hosni%20at-Tura\"&gt;Count Hosni at-Tura&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, you will find the Key of the General to the southeast, guarded by &lt;a href=\"General%20Godrun\"&gt;General Godrun&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have all the keys, head to the king's palace near where you found the Key of the Thief. Inside, you will find Galthis in the throne room. This can be a difficult fight, so come prepared. Galthis will take the forms of King Emeric, Sir Hughes, Count Hosni and General Godrun before facing you in his true form, in which he can summon hordes of skeletons to his aid.\nOnce Galthis is defeated, head outside and talk to King Emeric. Free him, and he will disappear. You will then hear Vaermina's voice; she will ask you to come through the mirror she just sommoned and speak with her. Head through, then follow the path ahead of you. You will reach a shrine to Vaermina; talk to it, and Vaermina will congratulate you on your victory over her and then threaten to keep you in &lt;a href=\"Quagmire\"&gt;Quagmire&lt;/a&gt; forever. Four mirrors will now spawn in the area; each of them will take you to a battle with one of the individuals Galthis has impersonated before sending you back to the waking world.\nBack in the real world, speak with High King Emeric. He will apologise for how weak he was in the dream and how you had to save him, and then he will tell you to come with him to the throne room. Talk to him there to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Road%20to%20Rivenspire\"&gt;The Road to Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Along with &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dukaan\"&gt;Dukaan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt;, he is one of the five named dragon priests found on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. His full name translates to \"Guardian\" in the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; tongue.\nHistory.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; folklore, Vahlok served as a dragon priest during the rule of &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of his contemporaries, a priest named Miraak, was seduced with promises of power and forbidden knowledge by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Knowledge and Fate, &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;. Miraak began to secretly plot against his dragon overlords, however Vahlok discovered his plans and confronted him. The two fought a lengthy battle that was said to have lasted for days and was so destructive that &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart from the mainland of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt this point, the series of events that took place is unclear. Skaal legend mentions that Vahlok eventually defeated Miraak, but just as he was about to kill him, Hermaeus Mora saved Miraak by transporting him to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;. For his victory, Vahlok gained much glory and his dragon masters appointed him as ruler of the island, but not before he was compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for Miraak's return.\nOther accounts report that Miraak was defeated and then banished to Solstheim where he was imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;a tomb&lt;/a&gt; built by the ancient Skaal. Vahlok was made his jailer and when he eventually died, he was buried in the same tomb so that he could maintain his vigil beyond death. In any case, Vahlok was instrumental in the downfall of Miraak and put a stop to whatever plans he might have had.\nLegacy.\nVahlok's legacy is a sharp contrast to his contemporaries on the mainland. Legend paints him as a paragon of loyalty and nobility in his battle against Miraak and goes as far to say he inspired great courage in both men and dragon. His reign was said to be a time of peace and prosperity for the people of Solstheim and, unlike the priests of Skyrim, he was remembered as a wise and just leader by the ancient Skaal.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Legacy\"&gt;Lost Legacy&lt;/a&gt;.\nVahlok can be encountered at the end of &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Vahlok's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nDuring combat, Vahlok will cast &lt;a href=\"Ebonyflesh\"&gt;Ebonyflesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Cloak\"&gt;Flame Cloak&lt;/a&gt; to protect himself, summon a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt;, and attack with high-level fire spells like &lt;a href=\"Incinerate\"&gt;Incinerate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fireball%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;."}

Activate the switch on the right column, which raises the stairs in the middle of the room, providing access to the center platform. Go up these stairs. One of the four columns on the platform contains a push button to reveal the goal, an unenchanted Ancient Elven Helm.\nWhen going up the platform, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Ghost\"&gt;Ancient Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Guardian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Skeleton Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Liches&lt;/a&gt; are summoned (&lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;level-dependent&lt;/a&gt;).\nOnce the helm is taken, go back up the southeast stairs.

There are some stashes full of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; items and gold to the left and right. There are a few more wraiths here, and at least one Lich.\nOnce the enemies are defeated, follow the corridors back to Skaleel and speak to her.

The Dawn Era ends with the exodus of the gods and magic from the World at the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Adamantine%20Tower\"&gt;Adamantine Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term 'Merethic' comes from the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic, literally, \"Era of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;.\" The Merethic Era is the prehistoric time after the exodus of the gods and magic from the World at the founding of the Adamantine Tower and before the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; the Nord in Tamriel.\nThe following are the most notable events of the Dawn Era, presented roughly in sequence as it must be by creatures of time such as ourselves.\nThe Cosmos formed from the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; (chaos, or totality) by Anu and Padomay. &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;) formed and Time began. The Gods (&lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;) formed. &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; convinced -- or tricked -- the Gods into creating the mortal plane, &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. The mortal plane was at this point highly magical and dangerous. As the Gods walked, the physical make-up of the mortal plane and even the timeless continuity of existence itself became unstable.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;), architect of the plans for the mortal world, decided to terminate the project, the Gods convened at the Adamantine Tower, &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Tower\"&gt;Direnni Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest known structure in Tamriel and decided what to do. Most left when Magic did. Others sacrificed themselves into other forms so that they might stay (the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;). Lorkhan was condemned by the Gods to exile in the mortal realms, and his heart was torn out and cast from the Tower. Where it landed, a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt; formed. With Magic (in the Mythic Sense) gone, the Cosmos stabilized. Elven history, finally linear, began (&lt;a href=\"ME%202500\"&gt;ME2500&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Merethic Era.\nThe Merethic Era was figured by early &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; scholars as a series of years numbered in reverse order backward from 'beginning of time' -- the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, recorded as Year Zero of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The prehistoric events of the Merethic Era are listed here with their traditional Nordic Merethic dates. The earliest Merethic date cited by King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;'s scholars was ME2500 -- the Nordic reckoning of the first year of time. As such, the Merethic Era extends from ME2500 in the distant past to &lt;a href=\"ME%201\"&gt;ME1&lt;/a&gt; -- the year before the founding of the Camoran and the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"White%20Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; as an city-state.\nAccording to King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;'s bards, ME2500 was the date of construction of the Adamantine Tower on &lt;a href=\"Balfiera%20Island\"&gt;Balfiera Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the oldest known structure of Tamriel. (This corresponds roughly to the earliest historical dates given in various unpublished Elvish chronicles.)\nDuring the early Merethic Era, the aboriginal &lt;a href=\"beastpeoples\"&gt;beastpeoples&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel -- the ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; and other beastfolk -- lived in preliterate communities throughout Tamriel.\nIn the Middle Merethic Era, the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i (mortals of Elven origin) refugees left their doomed and now-lost continent of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; (also known as 'Old Ehlnofey') and settled in southwestern Tamriel. The first colonies were distributed at wide intervals on islands along the entire coast of Tamriel. Later inland settlements were founded primarily in fertile lowlands in southwest and central Tamriel. Wherever the beastfolk encountered the Elves, the sophisticated, literate, technologically advanced Aldmeri cultures displaced the primitive beastfolk into the jungles, marshes, mountains, and wastelands. The Adamantine Tower was rediscovered and captured by the Direnni, a prominent and powerful Aldmeri clan. The Crystal Tower was built on &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; and, later, White Gold Tower in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Middle Merethic Era, Aldmeri explorers mapped the coasts of , building the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; High Elven wizard towers at &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Redaynia\"&gt;Ald Redaynia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Fell\"&gt;Bal Fell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mora\"&gt;Tel Mora&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. It was also during this period that &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;, [Wild Elven] settlements flourished in the jungles surrounding White Gold Tower (present day Cyrodiil). Wild Elves, also known as the Heartland High Elves, preserved the Dawn Era magics and language of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. Ostensibly a tribute-land to the High King of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, the Heartland's long lines of communication from the Summerset Isles' sovereignty effectively isolated from the High Kings at &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Late Middle Merethic Era is the period of the High Velothi Culture. The &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, ancestors of the modern &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, or Dark Elves, were dynamic, ambitious, long-lived Elven clans devoted to fundamentalist ancestor worship. The Chimer clans followed the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; out of the ancestral Elven homelands in the southwest to settle in the lands now known as Morrowind. Despising the secular culture and profane practices of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, the Chimer also coveted the lands and resources of the Dwemer, and for centuries provoked them with minor raids and territorial disputes. The Dwemer (Dwarves), free-thinking, reclusive Elven clans devoted to the secrets of science, engineering, and alchemy, established underground cities and communities in the mountain range (later the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;) separating modern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Late Merethic Era marks the precipitous decline of Velothi culture. Some Velothi settled in villages near declining and abandoned ancient Velothi towers. During this period, Velothi high culture disappeared on Vvardenfell Island. The earliest Dwemer Freehold colonies date from this period. Degenerate Velothi devolved into tribal cultures which, in time, evolved into the modern &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses%20of%20Morrowind\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind, or persisted as the barbarian &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The only surviving traces of this tribal culture are scattered Velothi towers and Ashlander nomads on Vvardenfell Island. The original First Era High Elven wizard towers along the coasts of Tamriel were also abandoned about this time.\nIt was in the Late Merethic Era that the pre-literate humans, the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic Peoples&lt;/a&gt; from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; (also 'Altmora' or 'the Elder Wood' in Aldmeris) migrated and in northern Tamriel. The Nord culture hero Ysgramor, leader of a great colonizing fleet to Tamriel, is credited with developing a runic transcription of Nord speech based on Elvish principles, and so Ysgramor is considered the first human historian. Ysgramor's fleet landed at &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; at the extreme northern tip of Skyrim's Broken Cape. The Nords built there the legendary city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. The Elves drove the Men away during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, but Ysgramor soon returned with his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso during the Late Merethic Era the legendary immortal hero, warrior, , and king variously known as &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, Harrald Hairy Breeks, &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, Hans the Fox, etc., wandered Tamriel, gathering armies, conquering lands, ruling, then abandoning his kingdoms to wander again."}

This quest serves to acquaint the Dragonborn with the open world of Skyrim and further equip them for the challenges ahead.\nBackground.\n\"Hadvar suggested that I head to the nearby town of Riverwood. His uncle is a blacksmith there and should be able to help me.\"\n\"Ralof suggested that I head to the nearby town of Riverwood. His sister Gerdur is the mill owner there and should be able to help me.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe Dragonborn emerges into the bright light of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Hold&lt;/a&gt;, due north of the still-smoldering ruin of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; (depending on whom the Dragonborn followed) watch as the dragon responsible for disrupting the execution flies away to the north. After that occurs the Dragonborn must talk to whoever they followed, and then head to Riverwood. Following them down the hillside heading to the next town, it may be possible to lose him. Simply continue on and meet up with Hadvar's or Ralof's contact in Riverwood.\nOn the way to Riverwood there is the possibility of a chance encounter, but that is nothing that cannot be handled with the help of Hadvar or Ralof. Along the path taken are three &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Stones\"&gt;Guardian Stones&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Warrior Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Mage%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Mage Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Thief Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Pick one according to the preferred playing style and continue following the path. If Ralof or Hadvar is still with the Dragonborn at that point, they will explain the Guardian Stones to them, and comment accordingly to the stone they select.\nRiverwood.\nAfter arrival in the village, assuming the Dragonborn traveled the entire way with their companion, the hero is led to a house depending on who was followed in the opening quest\u2014either Ralof's sister &lt;a href=\"Gerdur\"&gt;Gerdur&lt;/a&gt; and her husband, &lt;a href=\"Hod\"&gt;Hod&lt;/a&gt;, or Hadvar's uncle, &lt;a href=\"Alvor\"&gt;Alvor&lt;/a&gt;. Following the quest markers, the Dragonborn will be offered a gift of supplies. All of the items offered can be taken without anyone complaining. The Riverwood contact will also recommend that a report be made to Jarl Balgruuf, in Whiterun, regarding all of the events that have transpired.\nWhiterun.\nHeading straight to Whiterun can skip Riverwood altogether. The journal will still be updated as if they went there and spoke with the contact of their friend. Exiting Riverwood to the north and following the path with the waterfall rapids to the east will lead the Dragonborn to Whiterun. Head west on the road from the two bridges, on the opposite side of the stream, to &lt;a href=\"Chillfurrow%20Farm\"&gt;Chillfurrow Farm&lt;/a&gt;, and pass the &lt;a href=\"Honningbrew%20Meadery\"&gt;Honningbrew Meadery&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the surrounding farmland, the Dragonborn may find members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; engaged in a battle with a giant at the &lt;a href=\"Pelagia%20Farm\"&gt;Pelagia Farm&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn may choose to assist them if they want. If they do so, Aela and the others react positively, whereas not helping causes her to chastise the Dragonborn for not contributing to helping slay the giant. After the combat, &lt;a href=\"Aela%20the%20Huntress%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aela&lt;/a&gt; will tell the Dragonborn to speak with Kodlak Whitemane in Whiterun if they are interested in joining the Companions. This will begin the quest &lt;a href=\"Take%20Up%20Arms\"&gt;Take Up Arms&lt;/a&gt;. If Whiterun is approached via a different route, it is possible to completely miss this fight and the resulting dialog with Aela.\nOnce the Dragonborn passes the &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Stables\"&gt;Whiterun Stables&lt;/a&gt; that mark the outside entrance to the city, and continues up the hill and over the drawbridge, they will find the main gate. One of the guards standing watch at the gate will come down to stop the Dragonborn from further approach as the city is closed with the news of dragons. The Dragonborn only needs to tell him that Riverwood calls for the Jarl's aid and the guard will grant them permission to enter Whiterun. Once inside, head through the town to Dragonsreach. The Jarl's Housecarl, &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt;, wants to know the Dragonborn's business as she confronts them with her enchanted steel sword drawn before they get too close to the Jarl and his steward, but regardless of the answer the Dragonborn will end up talking to Jarl Balgruuf while Irileth holsters her sword. The conversation with him can be lead in any direction, but in the end the quest will be completed, and a reward will be received from the Jarl. Balgruuf will then ask the Dragonborn to follow him to meet with his court wizard, &lt;a href=\"Farengar%20Secret-Fire\"&gt;Farengar Secret-Fire&lt;/a&gt;, to follow up on why the dragons are reappearing now after dispatching Irileth to send a detachment of Whiterun guards to defend Riverwood."}

During pregnancy, the Queen had been more than twice as wide as she was tall, and the act of delivery took three months and six days after it had begun. It is perhaps understandable that the Lahpyrcopa elected, upon expelling Eslaf to frown, say, 'Good riddance,' and die.\nLike many Nords, Ytluaf did not care very much for his wife and less for his &lt;a href=\"Children\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;. His subjects were puzzled, therefore, when he announced that he would follow the ancient tradition of his people of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; of following his beloved spouse to the grave. They had not thought they were particularly in love, nor were they aware that such a tradition existed. Still, the simple people were grateful, for the little royal drama alleviated their boredom, which was and is a common problem in the more obscure parts of northern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in wintertide.\nHe gathered his household staff and his five fat, bawling little heirs in front of him, and divided his estate. To his son Ynohp, he gave his title; to his son Laernu, he gave his land; to his son Suoibud, he gave his fortune; to his daughter Laicifitra, he gave his army. Ytluaf's advisors had suggested he keep the inheritance together for the good of the kingdom, but Ytluaf did not particularly care for his advisors, or the kingdom, for that matter. Upon making his announcement, he drew his dagger across his throat.\nOne of the nurses, who was rather shy, finally decided to speak as the King's life ebbed away. 'Your highness, you forgot your fifth child, little Eslaf.'\nGood Ytluaf groaned. It is somewhat hard to concentrate with blood gushing from one's throat, after all. The King tried in vain to think of something to bequeath, but there was nothing left.\nFinally he sputtered, irritably, 'Eslaf should have taken something then' and died.\nThat a babe but a few days old was expected to demand his rightful inheritance was arguably unfair. But so Eslaf Erol was given his birthright with his father's dying breath. He would have nothing, but what he had taken.\nSince no one else would have him, the shy nurse, whose name was Drusba, took the baby home. It was a decrepit little shack, and over the years that followed, it became more and more decrepit. Unable to find work, Drusba sold all of her furnishings to buy food for little Eslaf. By the time he was old enough to walk and talk, she had sold the walls and the roof as well, so they had nothing but a floor to call home. And if you've ever been to Skyrim, you can appreciate that that is scarcely sufficient.\nDrusba did not tell Eslaf the story of his birth, or that his brothers and sister were leading quite nice lives with their inheritances, for, as we have said, she was rather shy, and found it difficult to broach the subject. She was so painfully shy, in fact, that whenever he asked any questions about where he came from, Drusba would run away. That was more or less her answer to everything, to flee.\nIn order to communicate with her at all, Eslaf learned how to run almost as soon as he could walk. He couldn't keep up with his adopted mother at first, but in time he learned to go toe-heel toe-heel if he anticipated a short but fast sprint, and heel-toe heel-toe if it seemed Drusba was headed for a long distance marathon flight. He never did get all the answers he needed from her, but Eslaf did learn how to run.\nThe kingdom of Erolgard had, in the years that Eslaf was growing, become quite a grim place. King Ynohp did not have a treasury, for Suoibud had been given that; he did not have any property for income, for Laernu had been given that; he did not have an army to protect the people, for Laicifitra had been given that. Furthermore, as he was but a child, all decisions in the kingdom went through Ynohp's rather corrupt council. It had become a bureaucratic exploitative land of high taxes, rampant crime, and regular incursions from neighboring kingdoms. Not a particular unusual situation for a kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, but an unpleasant one nonetheless.\nThe time finally came when the taxcollector arrived to Drusba's hovel, such as it was, to collect the only thing he could - the floor. Rather than protest, the poor shy maid ran away, and Eslaf never saw her again.\nWithout a home or a mother, Eslaf did not know what to do. He had grown accustomed to the cold open air in Drusba's shack, but he was hungry.\n'May I have a piece of &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;?' he asked the butcher down the street. 'I'm very hungry.'\nThe man had known the boy for years, often spoke to his wife about how sorry he felt for him, growing up in a home with no ceilings or walls. He smiled at Eslaf and said, 'Go away, or I'll hit you.'\nEslaf hurriedly left the butcher and went to a nearby tavern. The tavernkeeper had been a former valet in the king's court and knew that the boy was by right a prince. Many times, he had seen the poor ragged lad in the streets, and sighed at the way fate had treated him.\n'May I have something to eat?' Eslaf asked this tavernkeeper. 'I'm very hungry.'\n'You're lucky I don't cook you up and eat you,' replied the tavernkeeper.\nEslaf hurriedly left the tavern. For the rest of the day, the boy approached the good citizens of Erolgard, begging for food. One person had thrown something at him, but it turned out to be an inedible rock.\nAs night fell, a raggedy man came up to Eslaf and, without saying a word, handed him a piece of fruit and a piece of dried meat. The lad took it, wide-eyed, and as he devoured it, he thanked the man very sweetly.\n'If I see you begging on the streets tomorrow,' the man growled. 'I'll kill you myself. There are only so many beggars we of the guild allow in any one town, and you make it one too many. You're ruining business.'\nIt was a good thing Eslaf Erol knew how to run. He ran all night.\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;."}

Most are so poor they have only the &lt;a href=\"clothes\"&gt;clothes&lt;/a&gt; on their backs. They &lt;a href=\"Food%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;eat&lt;/a&gt; the scraps the rest of us throw out. We toss them a coin so that we don't have to think too long about their plight.\nImagine my surprise when I heard the tale of the Beggar Prince. I could not imagine what a Prince of Beggars would be. Here is the tale I heard. It takes place in the first age, when the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;gods&lt;/a&gt; walked like men and &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; stalking the wilderness with impunity. It is a time before they were all confined to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere once was a man named Wheedle. Or maybe it was a woman. The story goes to great lengths to avoid declaring Wheedle's gender. Wheedle was the 13th child of a king in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. As such Wheedle was in no position to take the throne or even inherit much property or wealth.\nWheedle had left the palace to find independent fortune and glory. After many days of endless forest roads and tiny villages, Wheedle came upon a three men surrounding a beggar. The beggar was swaddled in rags from head to toe. No portion of the vagabond's body was visible. The men were intent on slaying the beggar. With a cry of rage and indignation, Wheedle charged the men with sword drawn. Being simple townsfolk, armed only with pitchforks and scythes, they immediately fled from the armored figure with the shining sword.\n\"Many thanks for saving me.\" wheezed the beggar from beneath the heap of foul rags, Wheedle could barely stand the stench.\n\"What is your name, wretch?\" Wheedle asked.\n\"I am &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;.\" Unlike the townsfolk, Wheedle was well learned. That name meant nothing to them, but to Wheedle it was an opportunity. \"You're the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Lord\"&gt;Daedric Lord&lt;/a&gt;!\" Wheedle exclaimed. \"Why did you allow those men to harass you? You could have slain them all with a whisper.\"\n\"I am please you recognized me.\" Namira rasped. \"I am frequently reviled by townsfolk. It pleases me to be recognized for my attribute, if not for my name.\"\nWheedle knew that Namira was the Daedric lord of all thing gross and repulsive. &lt;a href=\"Disease\"&gt;Disease&lt;/a&gt;s such as leprosy and gangrene were her domain. Where the others might have seen danger, Wheedle saw opportunity. \"Oh, great Namira, let me apprentice myself to you, I ask only that you grant me powers to make my fortune and forge a name for myself that will live through the ages.\"\n\"Nay, I make my way alone in the world, I have no need for apprentice.\" Namira shambled off down the road. Wheedle would not be put off. With a bound, Wheedle was at Namira's heel, pressing the case for an apprenticeship. For 33 days and nights, Wheedle kept up the debate. Namira said nothing, but Wheedle's voice was ceaseless. Finally, on the 33rd day, Wheedle was too hoarse to talk. Namira looked back on the suddenly silent figure. Wheedle knelt in the mud at her feet, open hands raised in supplication. \"It would seem you have completed your apprenticeship to me after all.\" Namira declared, \"I shall grant your request.\" Wheedle was overjoyed.\n\"I grant you the power of disease. You may choose to be &lt;a href=\"afflicted\"&gt;afflicted&lt;/a&gt; with any disease you choose, changing them at will, so long as it has visible symptoms. However, you must always bear at least one. I grant you the power of pity. You may evoke pity in anyone that sees you. Finally, I grant you the power of disregard. You may cause others to disregard your presence.\"\nWheedle was aghast. These were not boons from which a fortune could be made. They were curses, each awful in its own right, but together they were unthinkable. \"How am I to make my fortune and forge a name for myself with these terrible gifts?\"\n\"As you begged at my feet for 33 days and 33 nights, so shall you now beg for your fortune in the cities of men. Your name will become legendary among the beggars of Tamriel. The story of Wheedle, the Prince of Beggars, shall be handed down throughout the generations.\"\nIt was as Namira predicted, Wheedle was an irresistible beggar. None could see the wretch without desperately wanting to toss a coin at the huddled form. However, Wheedle also discovered that power of disregard gave great access to the secrets of the realms. People unknowingly said important things where Wheedle could hear them. Wheedle grew to know the comings and goings of every citizen in the city.\nTo this day, it is said that if you really want to know something, go ask the beggars. They have eyes and ears throughout the cities. They know all the little secrets of the daily lives of its citizens."}

They act as the eyes for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes have valuable information about quests; though they are often dishonest if the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; does not pay them respect with a few &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt;. They can tell how to join the Thieves guild if one raise their &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; to 70. While talking to beggars, one will have the option to give them a Septim. This raises their disposition by one point.\nBeggars' bedrolls and foodbags can often be found around the edges of the major cities of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, usually near city walls or behind buildings. Sometimes they are filled with gold, and if not part of the Thieves Guild, one can steal it. It is a crime, so make sure no guards are around.\nThey are often considered convenient prey for Heros infected with &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;.\nA member of the Thieves Guild is not permitted to kill or steal from any of the beggars as they are all under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;. Feeding on NPCs is also considered a crime, so vampires who are Thieves Guild members should avoid feeding on beggars.\nEvery minor city has two beggars each, apart from &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, which has only one. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; has one beggar per district, excluding the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Emperor%20Way\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt;."}

Even as a young cat on the prowl, he dreamed of grand adventures, honor, fame, and a place in history. And with his own claws and a positive disposition, he achieved all that and more. But he did so in a way that endeared him to others. It was something in his smile.\nTake, for example, the time he hired a scribe to follow him around and record his exploits. The scribe, an unimposing &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt; whose name has been forgotten, dutifully wrote down pages and pages of anecdotes from the daily life of Khunzar-ri. She constantly remained by his side, despite circumstances, danger, or propriety, in order to carry out her assigned duties. &lt;a href=\"Anequina%20Sharptongue\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; became so annoyed by the Alfiq's presence, that she refused to associate with Khunzar-ri until the scribe departed. Khunzar-ri shrugged and wished Anequina well during their sabbatical. \"Too much of Zar makes the heart beat too fast,\" said Khunzar-ri with a sigh as she walked away.\nA few days later, as dusk spread across the land, Khunzar-ri and his Alfiq scribe came upon a young Khajiit warrior. He appeared upset and unsure what to do, holding his spear and staring across the stream at a trio of ravening &lt;a href=\"river%20troll\"&gt;river troll&lt;/a&gt;s. \"You seem troubled, friend warrior,\" said Khunzar-ri, his scribe writing furiously to record every word. The young warrior turned. \"Those &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; attacked this one's village,\" he said, \"killing some, maiming others, and stealing the great &lt;a href=\"wamasu\"&gt;wamasu&lt;/a&gt; that was roasting over the village cooking pit for our &lt;a href=\"Festival%20of%20the%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Festival of the Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;. This one came to retrieve the carcass, but fear of the three trolls stays his hand. This one will be marked a coward and never gain honor and prestige in his own home.\"\nKhunzar-ri considered the young warrior, the spear, and the three river trolls across the way. He held out his hand and motioned for the young warrior to give him the spear. Once he had tested the weight and straightness of the weapon, Khunzar-ri called to the trolls. \"River trolls of a most ugly and disgusting countenance,\" he yelled, \"this one has a gift for you!\" Curious, the three river trolls lined up to see who had dared call out to them. They looked like a single body with three heads, one peaking out from behind another. \"Perfect!\" said Khunzar-ri, and he threw the spear with all his might. It pierced all three trolls and pinned them to a nearby tree, where their blood flowed down to feed its roots.\n\"Go,\" Khunzar-ri said to the young warrior,\" retrieve the festival meal and return to your village as a hero.\"\n\"But Khunzar-ri,\" the Alfiq scribe asked, \"that was your kill! And a great kill it was, too! What of your ambition?\"\nKhunzar-ri shrugged. \"Zar's ambition is as strong as ever, but the young warrior needs this honor more. Besides, there will be an even more spectacular adventure tomorrow, Zar just knows it!\"\nThese are the words, and the words are true."}
