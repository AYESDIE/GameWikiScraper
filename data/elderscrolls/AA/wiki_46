Throughout history, Winterhold was the capital of Skyrim and was the center of progress in the entire province. Winterhold lost its status after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Collapse\"&gt;Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;, when a large majority of the city had plunged into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe scope of Greater Winterhold is left largely unknown. There are no accurate representations of Winterhold before the Great Collapse, the only time it has appeared before the event was in . The ruins of Winterhold during the Fourth Era is smaller than the other cities in Skyrim, being smaller than the poverty-driven &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. The road that runs through the town leads to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, located on a mountain sticking out of the Sea of Ghosts. The College and the town are connected by a bridge that is ransacked from the Great Collapse. The city of Winterhold is the most isolated city in the &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, it is located in the snowy mountains of the north, around &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the city has plunged into the Sea of Ghosts, leaving ruined homes in its wake. The &lt;a href=\"Jarl%27s%20Longhouse%20%28Winterhold%29\"&gt;Jarl's Longhouse&lt;/a&gt; was most likely not the seat of power in times before the Collapse, but being the largest building left, it became the Jarl's Longhouse.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Origins of Winterhold &amp; Shalidor.\nThe foundation of Winterhold has been told through myths, describing the exploits of the Great Wizard &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. According to some rumors, Shalidor created the city of Winterhold with a simple whispering spell, what followed after was the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Shalidor was one on the opposite spectrum on magic accessibility, while &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; believed that magic should be given to the common-folk, Shalidor wanted to enhance the standard on magic within magic users. This ideology led to the creation of the different schools of magic and the College of Winterhold, something that would become the staple of the city. Shalidor would later create the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt;, a haven for the Mages of Tamriel, it was eventually absorbed into the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt; and brought back into Tamriel.\nThe Fall of Borgas; the War of Succession.\nDuring the early years of the first era, &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; was the High King of Skyrim, residing in the city of Winterhold, the capital of Skyrim. Borgas was a staunch supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, the religion that is worshipped throughout the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing that the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; were not followers of the Order, he had orchestrated an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. This joint war resulted in the initiation of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, a ritual performed by the Bosmer where they turn into feral forms of themselves, to the point where they act like feral animals. The Wild Hunt killed Borgas. As a result, records say his body was never found until the &lt;a href=\"fourth%20era\"&gt;fourth era&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt;. Borgas was the last of the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, a family dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; itself. A &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was created to determine a new High King to rule the province. The Moot, however, proved to be a failure when it failed to recognize &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Hanse\"&gt;Jarl Hanse&lt;/a&gt; of Winterhold to be the next High King, this sparked the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, where many fought for the throne. This war ended in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; became High King and the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;, which states that the Moot is only used when a King dies without any heirs. The Moot has filled this role admirably and has been used several times through the eras.\nThe Winterhold Rebellion &amp; Emperor Kastav Cyrodiil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202804\"&gt;1E 2804&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Winterhold had manifested a rebellion within its walls known as the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. It was in response to Emperor &lt;a href=\"Kastav\"&gt;Kastav Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s order to kidnap several people from &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that the local &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s would fulfill the conscription quota he had enforced. The master of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; did not allow them to help quell the rebellion for unknown reasons. The Emperor had also cut off their supplies much to the dismay of the Dragonguard. Regardless, the Grandmaster supported the master's actions even though it had violated the &lt;a href=\"Oath%20of%20Allegiance\"&gt;Oath of Allegiance&lt;/a&gt;. After some time, Kastav had stepped down as the Emperor and was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to fix all of Kastav's mistakes, this included the Winterhold Rebellion. Reman II orchestrated a treaty between the two factions and Winterhold remained a part of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonguard &amp; the Fool who sacked Winterhold.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202805\"&gt;1E 2805&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard had denied an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; man named &lt;a href=\"Kalien\"&gt;Kalien&lt;/a&gt; and their sanctuary, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; was besieged in Kalien's rage. He was denied entrance into the Dragonguard for a reason and so after he destroyed the temple, he traveled to the city of Winterhold and sacked it with his powerful magic, this event would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;Sack of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. After the siege on the temple was lifted, Reman II was named Emperor and the Dragonguard was honored to guard the Emperor during his travels in Skyrim, boosting their prestige. With this new found respect, the Sky Haven Temple was able to construct &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; and the Blood Seal of Sky Haven.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinterhold during the Reman Interregnum.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt;, who was a close ally of Versidue Shaie and was unfortunately assassinated around the same time in &lt;a href=\"2E%20431\"&gt;2E 431&lt;/a&gt;. Eyes were looking towards &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt;, Logrolf's daughter, assuming she would become the next High Queen leading Skyrim into the future. Controversy would soon arise from the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; would claim that Freydis was illegitimate for the throne and that a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt; was required to determine the new leader. The Moot had spoken, and the leaders of Skyrim voted for Svartr to become the High King. However, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;, the one that has chosen the High King for generations since &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; had chosen Freydis to become the High Queen. The province became divided, the Nords of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; followed Freydis while the Nords of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; followed Svartr. Skyrim had split into two separate kingdoms which would later affect the province for the next few years. The city of Winterhold, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; region, would join the Eastern Skyrim Kingdom.\nYears later, the Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim would come under the control of &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of Freydis and the son of &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. The current ruler of Winterhold is currently unknown. The Nords of Winterhold are a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; folk), and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; of the border regions in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Septim-Gersen Alliance; The Rise of Morihatha Septim.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20313\"&gt;3E 313&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; had ruled over the continent since the beginning of the third era. At this time, the Empire was governed by &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VI\"&gt;Uriel Septim VI&lt;/a&gt;, who was not given actual control until he was twenty-two years old. He would boast about how he rules over Tamriel; he would defunct spy networks and manipulate the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;. One of his allies was &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who had substantial power after marrying &lt;a href=\"Ulfe%20Gersen\"&gt;Ulfe Gersen&lt;/a&gt;, the Baron of Winterhold. The Septim Empire would rule over the Barony of Winterhold, giving them significant wealth and power. When Uriel VI fell off his horse and died, Morihatha had taken the throne at the age of twenty-five. She has been described as the most beautiful women in Tamriel and was considered a shrewd politician and well-trained. She had brought the Archmagister of Skyrim into Cyrodiil, bringing the second Imperial Battlemage ever since &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; back in &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s age.\nThe Staff of Chaos &amp; the Labyrinthian.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Winterhold in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Winterhold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Erarne\"&gt;King Erarne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Winterhold on their quest to find the second piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the distant north, to the city of Winterhold in the province of Skyrim. There the traveler ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Winterhold Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; where they met &lt;a href=\"Thelen%20Kaarn\"&gt;Thelen Kaarn&lt;/a&gt;, a mage from the within the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; ranks. Kaarn gives the Eternal Champion a proposition if they retrieved an ancient tablet from the &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20of%20Ice\"&gt;Fortress of Ice&lt;/a&gt;, the long forgotten home of Shalidor, he would reveal the location of the piece. After defeating the monsters in the stronghold, Kaarn showed the way to the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient maze located southwest of the city. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the second piece of the staff. The Champion had moved on to find the third piece of the staff somewhere in Tamriel.\nThe Winterhold Renaissance; The Westward Migration.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the city of Winterhold had undergone a renaissance due to the sudden influx of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i refugees from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, many going to the College of Winterhold. The Dark Elves had brought fresh new ideas and enriched their culture, stimulating its old mercantile spirit. Scholars from all over Tamriel traveled to the College to look into the &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Collective\"&gt;Ysmir Collective&lt;/a&gt;, which has books salvaged from the east and the cornerstone of academic life. The Elves of Morrowind have come from as far as the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20District\"&gt;Telvanni District&lt;/a&gt; in eastern Morrowind. As time went on, the Nords had grown distrust, resulting in the lives of magic enthusiasts to become stressful. Many Dark Elves would later move back to the Morrowind after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; in the next era.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Red Year and backlash against the Dunmer refugees.\nIn the aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis, there was a huge distrust against mages, ironic since mages were the forefront against the Daedric Invaders of the Deadlands. The College of Winterhold expected this backlash and was hoping to have it pass by, this was not the case, however. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt; had impacted &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; significantly when the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; had crashed onto the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. This event caused &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to erupt and plague the province with endless seas of Ash. The Dunmer have fled westward across the mountains to places all across the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;, with Winterhold becoming a popular attraction. As time went on, the Dunmer-folk began to leave and return to Morrowind. The island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; was given to the Dark Elves by the High King of Skyrim, and it was there they re-established the town of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Councilor Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;. There were small pockets of Dunmer living in Winterhold that endured the growing hatred from the local Nords. Things would take a turn for the worst.\nThe Great Collapse; Winterhold's Demise.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20122\"&gt;4E 122&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Winterhold was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Valdimar\"&gt;Jarl Valdimar&lt;/a&gt;, who had a close friendship with &lt;a href=\"Deneth\"&gt;Arch-Mage Deneth&lt;/a&gt;, the then leader of the College of Winterhold. For about a year, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; have experienced a series of ravaging waves that had damaged the city significantly. On one fateful and unexpected day, the city had given way resulting in a devastating event known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;the Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;. The College was not affected by the Collapse, due to powerful magic safeguarding the college. Many citizens of Winterhold have believed that the Mages of the College have prepared for the event as if they were involved with the crisis. This rumor caused the distrust of Mages to increase substantially, and it had spread across Skyrim like the plague. The relationship between the Court of Winterhold and the College had slowly diminished, affecting the pursuit of magical studies in Skyrim for several years.\nWinterhold during the Skyrim Civil War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Winterhold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Korir\"&gt;Jarl Korir&lt;/a&gt;, who was raised to hate the College of Winterhold, being the first generation to experience Winterhold after its destruction. Korir and his court had a distrust with the mages, resulting in even more hostility between the College and the city-state. Around the same time, the province of Skyrim had undergone a Civil War between the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl Korir was a supporter of the Stormcloaks, which operated from the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; under the administration of Jarl &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. Winterhold in its current state was unable to offer any substantial help to the rebellion but served nonetheless. The Stormcloaks had a holding in the region known as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Kastav\"&gt;Fort Kastav&lt;/a&gt;, named after Emperor Kastav Cyrodiil and located in between &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; and the northern Winterhold coast. The Stormcloaks of Winterhold were under the control of &lt;a href=\"Kai%20Wet-Pommel\"&gt;Kai Wet-Pommel&lt;/a&gt;, who operated out of the Jarl's Longhouse in eastern Winterhold City.\nThe Eye of Magnus &amp; the College of Winterhold.\nIn the same year, the College of Winterhold had uncovered an ancient artifact dating back to the Merethic Era known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. A giant orb with magical properties that were initially sought out by the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt; settled and founded &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition was led by &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; Master, &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, who took several mages on a field trip to Saarthal. The Eye remained confined within the walls of the College, leading to several magic guilds from all over Tamriel to come and witness the artifact. This ranged from the &lt;a href=\"Synod\"&gt;Synod&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;, to even the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, who hails from the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ancano\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; had kept a close eye on the Eye of Magnus, believing that it could prove useful to the Thalmor, who had substantial control over Tamriel. Ancano, however, had tempered the Eye to such an extent that it caused magicka essence to sprawl all across Winterhold. The explosion killed &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Arch-Mage Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt;, the Master Wizard of the College. The College was able to subdue the &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Anomaly\"&gt;Magical Anomaly&lt;/a&gt; that swarmed the city, but Ancano needed to be stopped.\nAncano of the Thalmor; the Staff of Magnus.\nA &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;certain student&lt;/a&gt; was given the task to find the location of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, after delving into the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Mzulft\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Icewind%20Peaks\"&gt;Icewind Peaks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, the student was able to find the Staff, which was located deep within the ruins of the Labyrinthian. The student traveled into the Labyrinthian and defeated &lt;a href=\"Morokei\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt;, the long dead &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;. With the staff in hand, the student returned to the College of Winterhold and disabled Ancano's magical barrier. The two fought in a battle of magic which resulted in Ancano's demise. The Psijic Order, believing the Eye should not be in the hands of the ambitious, brought the Eye back to their monastery in Artaeum. The student was proclaimed the Arch-Mage of Winterhold and served the school diligently by mastering all five schools of magic."}

Winterhold is the epitome of Skyrim, perfectly representing the frozen wasteland that Skyrim has been personified by the other nations. Winterhold was where the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire of Nords&lt;/a&gt; originated, from leaving &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; in the far north.\nDescription.\nGeography.\n&lt;a href=\"Western%20Winterhold\"&gt;Western Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reaches of Western Winterhold are barren, virtually void of living beings, only the dying &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; packs and the demented &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; Elves live in this frozen wasteland. This region has a massive mountain range that separates this area with &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt; in the west, on the other side of the mountain. There is a barren dirt road leading into the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; ruins of the Pale and the lightly-forested area of Western Winterhold. The only settlement is the &lt;a href=\"Frostflow%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Frostflow Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, located on one of the highest peaks in Western Winterhold. There are other stone structures in the general area, albeit abandoned because of the cold area, with the nearest settlement being &lt;a href=\"Dunstad\"&gt;Dunstad&lt;/a&gt;, which is far as it is.\n&lt;a href=\"Central%20Winterhold\"&gt;Central Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nCentral Winterhold is where the once grand-city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; was located, along with other Ancient Nordic structures, like the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Tomb of Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironbind%20Barrow\"&gt;Ironbind Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. These original settlements were buried by the unforgiving snowstorms of Winterhold with Saarthal for example being buried deep in the snow for years. &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt;, in the south is where many pilgrims from the eastern province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, to see the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt;. It was built by the immigrants from Morrowind who left the province due to the disastrous event known as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;. Mount Anthor was also the site of a great battle that led to the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Winterhold\"&gt;Eastern Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe eastern portion of Winterhold consists of the northeastern Skyrim coast and the many uninhabited islands throughout that part of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Eastern Winterhold is more easily distinguished from the rest of Winterhold, due to the mountain range that starts from the northeastern &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Yorgrim\"&gt;Lake Yorgrim&lt;/a&gt; to northwestern &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20City\"&gt;Winterhold City&lt;/a&gt;. This area of Winterhold is more populated when compared to the rest of the region. The city of Winterhold, as well as the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, are located in the northernmost point of the mainland, overlooking the Sea of Ghosts. Southwards is the &lt;a href=\"Whistling%20Mine\"&gt;Whistling Mine&lt;/a&gt;, an isolated mine with several miners is located in between Winterhold City and the Yorgrim Crossroads. The &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Glaciers\"&gt;Winterhold Glaciers&lt;/a&gt; is home to several shipwrecks that perish in between cities.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area known as Blackreach is a large vast cave, which houses ancient settlements dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; and the time of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. The gates to Blackreach are virtually impossible to find; records indicate that there are three dwarven cities throughout the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; that have tunnels leading into Blackreach. But these towns are said to be riddled with Dwarven Animunculi and the demented &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. According to mage groups in Winterhold, there is an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; located somewhere in Blackreach, one that the &lt;a href=\"Moth%20Priests\"&gt;Moth Priests&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; have yet to find. Blackreach is the home to several creatures including &lt;a href=\"Chaurus\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Giants\"&gt;Giants&lt;/a&gt;, and even rare plants like the mythical &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Nirnroot\"&gt;Crimson Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;.\nFauna.\nWolves.\n&lt;a href=\"Wolves\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are some of the most common predators of Tamriel and are at their most dangerous in the frozen wastelands of Winterhold. Wolves travel in packs and tend to live in caves or ancient ruins found throughout the area. Because of how rare the life is the region, wolves are desperate scavengers that hunt for anything wandering the region. The &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wolves\"&gt;Ice Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are a much stronger breed of wolves that have more tolerance for the blizzards and icy water, making them the alpha of certain packs. The Ice Wolf has white fur, giving them the environmental advantage for hunting. Wanders must be wary and to stay on the road, rather than exploring off the path. But the road is rather straightforward, from the Pale to the city of Winterhold.\nIce Wraiths.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith\"&gt;Ice Wraith&lt;/a&gt; is a serpentine creature that floats wistfully throughout the air and is extremely dangerous. Ice Wraiths are long and slither through the air, the fangs of a wraith are rather important when it comes to preservation and consumption. Merchants traveling would use the Ice Wraith fangs to preserve the food they carry or use the essence from the fang to gain resistance to the frozen snow. Ice Wraiths are very prominent throughout the Old Holds, specifically in the Pale and the Winterhold region, more so in the latter. Wraiths are commonly found throughout the Sea of Ghosts, including the &lt;a href=\"Serpentstone%20Isle\"&gt;Serpentstone Isle&lt;/a&gt;, north of Winterhold City. The best way to combat them is to use Fiery Destruction Magic, which is obvious considering their name. They can dash into the air and kill a passerby instantly.\nDwarven Animunculi.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; had strongholds found throughout the northern provinces of Tamriel, ranging from the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bthzark\"&gt;Bthzark&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Galom%20Daeus\"&gt;Galom Daeus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and Winterhold was no exception. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mzinchaleft\"&gt;Mzinchaleft&lt;/a&gt; were just examples of the many Dwarven strongholds that existed in Skyrim. These ruins hold the secrets of the Dwarves, and because of this, the ruins are infested with the machinations the Dwemer designed to keep intruders out. The &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider\"&gt;Dwarven Spider&lt;/a&gt; is the basic construction worker of the ruins, they watch over the ruins and repair any broken pipe or leakage found throughout the catacombs. The Spider can produce electricity and spread to other machinations. Once defeated, and if they hold electricity, they dispel a discharge that can severely damage someone. The &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere\"&gt;Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt; is the general guardsmen of the ruins, the sphere can move very quickly and come equipped with a Dwarven Crossbow and a Dwarven Sword attached to one of their arms. Perhaps the most deadly animunculi found in the ruins is the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt;, a gigantic robot powered by the searing steam of the ruins. They have doubled the size of the tallest Altmer and can truly pack a wallop. The Centurion can disperse large sprays of steam that can burn the armor off anyone. Their left arm comes equipped with a large axe that can break a wall down with a mighty swing. Best avoid the Dwarven Ruins if you value your life.\nWispmothers.\nThe most inhospitable regions in Tamriel hold the most secrets, right under the nose of the common-folk. The &lt;a href=\"Wispmother\"&gt;Wispmother&lt;/a&gt; is one such entity, feared by the denizens of both Winterhold and &lt;a href=\"Morthal\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. Wispmothers always take the form of a ghostly woman (sometimes appear in Elven form), surrounded by an eerie mist and tethered rags. They occasionally inhabit the inner tunnels of Blackreach and other areas throughout &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt;. Many scholars have different opinions about the Wispmother, members of &lt;a href=\"the%20Synod\"&gt;the Synod&lt;/a&gt; claim that Wispmothers are an elemental entity in a similar vein to the Elemental Atronachs or a &lt;a href=\"Spriggan\"&gt;Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;. Another scholar named &lt;a href=\"Sadren%20Sarethi\"&gt;Sadren Sarethi&lt;/a&gt; believed that the Wispmother is a variety of &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;-dom, where a mortal becomes an immortal and corrupted version of themselves. Notable liches include &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suturah\"&gt;Suturah&lt;/a&gt;. Victims of the Wispmother turns into a &lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;, ghastly orbs of light that act similar to a &lt;a href=\"Will-o-the-Wisp\"&gt;Will-o-the-Wisp&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Wisps are always surrounding the Wispmother and are always protecting them when harmed.\nFalmer.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; was once the original denizens of Skyrim, with ancestors dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and by that extent, to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, the Atmorans began a purge against the Falmer, leading to many of them to relocate or resist with little results. The &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by the Atmorans at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt;, located on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. The ones that had relocated sought help from the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; living in Skyrim and Blackreach. Untrusting towards the Falmer, the Dwemer tricked the Snow Elves into consuming toxic fungi that caused them to grow blind, even affecting their future kin. The modern-day Falmer are corrupted and goblin-esque creatures who live in the ruins of the Dwarven Cities and even Blackreach. Falmer depends on the &lt;a href=\"Chaurus\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;, large grotesque bugs that spit poison and have hardened shells. The Falmer makes weapons, armors, and housing out of the Chaurus, and lucky for them, the Chaurus breed millions of eggs. The only few aspects of Falmeri Culture that remain in modern-day Skyrim are ruins found in &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and somewhere near &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlora.\nWinterhold is a frozen wasteland with a lack of living organisms, but the underground has more secrets than anyone knows on the surface. But beginning with the surface, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; coastline has a wide variety of life, ranging from the many fishes of the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt; and the flora of the coast. The &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; is truly a unique plant, giving off a light hum and a glow that makes it obvious amidst the violent blizzards. The Nirnroot grow mainly in West Skyrim, but a unique type of Nirnroot grows in Blackreach, it is called the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Nirnroot\"&gt;Crimson Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, which is more powerful than the normal Nirnroot. This Nirnroot has been sought after by Alchemists from &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; had possession of a sample in their city of &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt;. Blackreach houses other bizarre flora, ranging from large versions of &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Mushroom%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;glowing mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; and thick vines that envelop around the ruins. These Mushrooms tower over the Dwarven Ruins and emit a powerful glow that brightens up the dark chasms of Blackreach. The area around &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt; grows other plants, albeit sparsely throughout the mountain range. One of the most commonly seen plants are the &lt;a href=\"Snowberries\"&gt;Snowberries&lt;/a&gt;, which are helpful in surviving the winter.\nGovernment.\nFor the longest time, the city of Winterhold has been the capital of Skyrim until the city was obliterated due to the disastrous events called &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;the Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;. During the time of Ysgramor, the capital of Skyrim was the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim River&lt;/a&gt; leading into the Sea of Ghosts. Ever since the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reforms\"&gt;Alessian Reforms&lt;/a&gt; in the first era, to the times after the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth era, Winterhold has always been the capital of Skyrim and the seat of power for the region. Leaders of Winterhold are known as the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, who for the most part, have been named that title by birthright. Unless the last High King dies with any heirs, a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt; is conducted which determines the next High King among the current &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of Skyrim. &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;, was the last High King of the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and was a loyal ally of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the First Empire of Cyrodiil. Borgas would later be killed in Valenwood, and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the province since many Jarls wanted the power of High King. When the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; chose &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; to be the High King, the war ended.\nWinterhold has had influence and interventions from the Empires of Cyrodiil and other groups originating throughout the Old Holds. As mentioned before, Borgas was loyal to the Alessian Empire, which resulted in his demise at the hands of the Wild Hunt. In the late years of the first era, the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; had caused the city-state to be divided into two factions, one opposing the ruler. &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt; became the Emperor of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, he had intervened in the dire state of Winterhold and created an agreement to bring it back to its original state. In the third era, &lt;a href=\"Ulfe%20Gersen\"&gt;Ulfe Gersen&lt;/a&gt; was a Baron living in Winterhold at the time and was presumingly the leader of Winterhold. To establish a relationship with Winterhold, &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha Septim&lt;/a&gt; married Gersen while her brother, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt; was ruling over the Empire. There have been two examples where Winterhold has allied with the Old Holds to achieve a common goal. In the second era, Winterhold was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance with Morrowind and Black Marsh. Representing Skyrim was &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt;, who originated and ruled from Windhelm. In the fourth era, Winterhold was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;s, a rebellious group against the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;Mede Empire&lt;/a&gt; and their allies, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nReligion.\nBecause Skyrim has been staunch supporters of the Empires of Cyrodiil, the main religion that Winterhold has worshipped is the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, it is unknown which Divine that Winterhold had temples dedicated to since there have been no real depictions of Winterhold as a fully-established city. But the Nine Divines is not the only religion worshipped in the Winterhold, with the sudden migration of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; into Skyrim, many of them had brought their culture and religion not to stray away from their roots. Before the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; guided her followers out of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and brought them into Skyrim and to that extent, the Winterhold region. In thanks for this foresight, the Dark Elves built a &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20to%20Azura\"&gt;Shrine to Azura&lt;/a&gt; on the uppermost peaks of Mount Anthor, and news spread about this site, causing many Elves to migrate towards this monument.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; was the main religion of Skyrim during the time of Ysgramor and years later. Even after the modern-day &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; became as big as it is today, several groups throughout the province still follow the Ancient pantheon their great ancestors have brought from Atmora, one of these groups is the &lt;a href=\"Ternion%20Monks\"&gt;Ternion Monks&lt;/a&gt; who operate out of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The Pantheon worships the animals of the region, animals deriving from the sea and some deriving from land. The Ancient Nords worshiped creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Whale\"&gt;Whale&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and this is evident upon traversing ruins such as Saarthal or &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;. According to legend, the Whale represents &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt; of the modern Nordic Pantheon and that the bridge between &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; are made out of the bones of a massive Whale.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAcross the Sea of Ghosts; The Tale of Ysgramor.\nCivil war has plagued the northernmost continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in many civilians to evacuating the region, to greater prospects in the south. Departing from the city of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; in Southern Atmora, &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and several thousand Atmorans traveled across the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and landed on &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt; of Winterhold. After arriving onto Hsaarik Head, the Atmorans built the city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, which is located southwest of modern-day Winterhold city. The immigrants called the new region, &lt;a href=\"Mereth\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt;, due to the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting the area. The Atmorans and the Snow Elves live together in harmony as more travelers from Atmora came to Mereth, further establishing Saarthal. When the Atmorans were building Saarthal, they discovered an ancient &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; with tremendous magical abilities. Ysgramor knew that this object would be sought after, and so he had the artifact buried deep within in Saarthal, much to the dismay of the Snow Elves. The events that followed bring about the end of the Snow Elves and usher the Age of Man.\nThe Fall of the Snow Elves; the Night of Tears.\nThis ancient artifact that the Atmorans had hidden away had peaked the interest of the Kingdom of Snow Elves, to the point where they would betray their new brothers in the cold. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt; is an event that would go down in history as the beginning of the Snow Elves' demise and ultimate extinction. The Sack of Saarthal ended with the deaths of several thousand Atmorans and it caused the remaining defense under &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; to return to Atmora, to rally a counterattack. Ysgramor looked over at his wonderous city of Saarthal, burning to the ground by the dastardly Snow Elves, it was said that he cried tears of pure of &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ore\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt;, which was fashioned into the legendary axe known as &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;. The journey back to Skyrim was known as the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the death of &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, the eldest son of Ysgramor. Saddened by his death, Ysgramor built a tomb located on the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim Estuary&lt;/a&gt; and built the modern-day city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; afterward.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Reign of Borgas; the War of Succession.\nThroughout the years, the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire of the Nords&lt;/a&gt; have expanded their territory beyond the province of Skyrim, to the western point of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, and to areas throughout the region of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. The High King, the leader of Skyrim, reside in the city of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, which is located northeast of the ruins of Saarthal. &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt; was the one who paved the way for this great empire and his descendants soon followed. The &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; eventually ended with the reign of High King Borgas, who resided in Winterhold. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was prominent in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the Nords of Skyrim were considered a part of this empire. Borgas was a firm believer in the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; and the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. When he realized the province of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; did not follow the Alessian Religion, he created a joint war with the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in his death. The Bosmer initiated the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient ritual which devolved the Bosmer into a feral and primitive state of mind, causing them to go berserk on the Nords and Alessians. Borgas would die, and his body was seemingly lost. In reality, Borgas and the &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Crown\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; were taken back to Skyrim and buried in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt;, on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"the%20Pale\"&gt;the Pale&lt;/a&gt;, near the township of &lt;a href=\"Dunstad%20Grove\"&gt;Dunstad Grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tale of Olaf One-Eye; Battle atop of Mount Anthor.\nThe death of High King Borgas caused animosity throughout the &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim. Borgas was the last of the Ysgramor Dynasty and had no heirs to inherit the throne. The &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; had failed to recognize &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Hanse\"&gt;Jarl Hanse&lt;/a&gt; of Winterhold to be the next High King, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. This conflict caused many of the territories that the Nords had conquered to dwindle down to the modern-day province of Skyrim. The conflict officially ended with the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, giving the Moot a more admirable job. It has only been used in similar crises where the High King died without heirs.\nAs the War of Succession raged on in the province of Skyrim, a powerful &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt; has rampaged over the region, burning villages and terrorizing the denizens. Because of the war, Numinex was given free rein since the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s were focused on fighting each other, rather than beating a common foe. &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Jarl Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; decided to take it upon himself to defeat Numinex and traveled to his lair on the highest peak of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Anthor\"&gt;Mount Anthor&lt;/a&gt;. Numinex and Olaf fought each other valiantly, each using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to defeat one another. Numinex was finally subdued and taken to &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of power in Whiterun. The people of Whiterun were astonished yet impressed by Olaf's trophy, because of his battle, Olaf was named the High King of Skyrim and ended the War of Succession. But some people doubted Olaf's vigor, one such person was &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, a bard who wrote &lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;King Olaf's Verse&lt;/a&gt;, a book portraying Olaf as a liar and a deceiver.\nChronicles of the Dragonguard; the Winterhold Endeavor.\nDuring the reign of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Kastav\"&gt;Emperor Kastav&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Kastavian Empire has had problems with the cities of Skyrim, specifically with the city of Winterhold and the Hold of Winterhold. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; have been used by the Emperor to enforce his ideas into the denizens of Winterhold, putting the faction in a difficult position. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202804\"&gt;1E 2804&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; had occurred and despite the Dragonguard's sworn oath to protect the people of Skyrim, were not given to suppress the rebellion. What made matters worse was when the Emperor cut supplies to the Dragonguard, but lucky for the group, they had an arrangement with the local &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, giving them sufficient resources.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202805\"&gt;1E 2805&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonguard had denied an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; man named &lt;a href=\"Kalien\"&gt;Kalien&lt;/a&gt; a spot in the Dragonguard, which made him furious. In retaliation, Kalien sacked the temple and traveled to the city of Winterhold, besieging it with his powerful magic, this event would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;Sack of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and it severely brought down the trust both the Dragonguard and the Nords had established for years. But when Kastav stepped down as Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20II\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil II&lt;/a&gt; gave the Dragonguard, a boost in popularity for being the honor guard for the Emperor, during his trip into Skyrim. When Reman traveled to Winterhold, he was able to negotiate a truce with the rebellion; he was able to instate a leader that managed to rule over Winterhold without any bloodshed. Through Reman II's funding, the Temple was rebuilt with a stylish wall known as &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; and the Blood Seal of Sky Haven. Reman II would even visit the wall, to bask in its glory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim.\nDuring the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by an unknown assailant. With Logrolf's passing, many people felt that &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Freydis\"&gt;Queen Freydis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; should assume the throne and the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt; did, in fact, choose her as the next heir, but this would come with controversy. &lt;a href=\"Svartr\"&gt;Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Freydis was an illegitimate heir to the throne and that a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; should be conducted to determine an actual usurper. The Moot had chosen Jarl Svartr to be the High King, contrary to what the Crown of Verity had chosen. This event caused a divide between the Nords of Skyrim with the denizens of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; joining Svartr in his Kingdom of Western Skyrim and the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; joined Freydis in her Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim. Eastern Skyrim consists of the Old Holds, which includes the region of Winterhold. Winterhold joined the Eastern Kingdom of Skyrim and would do so for several years since the Old Holds and a unique bond.\nThe Battle of Stonefalls &amp; Ebonheart Pact.\nSeveral years later, Freydis' descendant, &lt;a href=\"Nurnhilde\"&gt;Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt; ruled from the city of Windhelm and had two brothers, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn\"&gt;Jorunn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fildgor\"&gt;Fildgor&lt;/a&gt;, both of which ruled alongside their eldest sister in the Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim. However, the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; invaded the provinces of eastern Tamriel, first the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, to the rivers of the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt;. Windhelm was sacked by the Snow Demons, killing both Nurnhilde and their mother, &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt; were killed amidst the conflict. Jorunn, arriving from his travels, ventured to Windhelm and defended the city to the best of his ability. In dire need of help, Jorunn travels to the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, to the monastery of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, to ask for help in this invasion. &lt;a href=\"The%20Greybeards\"&gt;The Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; conjured &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; out of Ash, to help Jorunn lead the assault on the Kamali. After pushing the army from &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt;, the Kamali was cornered in the region of &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, where he was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; from the south, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; from the east. The battle became known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;, and the Snow Demons were ultimately defeated. Out of the conflict came the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, a grand alliance consisting of the Nords of Eastern Skyrim, the Dark Elves of Morrowind (except for &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;), and the Argonians of Black Marsh. The Nords of Winterhold were present at the Battle of Stonefalls as well as the Ebonheart Pact foundation. Jorunn the Skald-King would be named the leader of the Pact and used the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Moot\"&gt;Great Moot&lt;/a&gt;, to settle ties with each of the provinces.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinterhold during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Battlemage named &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; impersonated Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; and casted both him and &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn had a mighty staff called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; which was the key to releasing Uriel and Warhaft from the Deadlands. To secure his control, he broke the Staff of Chaos into several pieces and hid them across the provinces in Tamriel. Tharn's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; caught wind of this and planned to tell the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, however, Tharn killed her with his vile magic. Ria Silmane's spirit sought the aid of a warrior also kept imprisoned by Tharn. Silmane help the warrior escaped and tasked them with finding the pieces of the Staff of Chaos throughout Tamriel. At one point, this warrior traveled to the city of Winterhold during their quest to gather the pieces. The warrior defeat Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; and freed both Uriel VII and Talin Warhaft, this young warrior was named the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region of Winterhold was undefined, and many settlements dotted the landscape or at least the general area. Winterhold was located on the northernmost cape of Skyrim, ideally, on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Cape\"&gt;Broken Cape&lt;/a&gt;, it was somewhat close to the border. Smaller townships such as &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Amol\"&gt;Amol&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dunpar%20Wall\"&gt;Dunpar Wall&lt;/a&gt; existed in the area. Winterhold was ruled by &lt;a href=\"King%20Erarne\"&gt;King Erarne&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinterhold Renaissance &amp; the Migration from the East.\nDuring the waning years of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Winterhold flourished with the Winterhold Renaissance. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind migrated across the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and lived in Winterhold and other parts of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Elves had fled the province of Morrowind, sometime after the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had departed from the living plane. With them, they brought their culture and arcane knowledge, further expanding the knowledge of magic to the Winterhold populous. A new collection was added to &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Collective\"&gt;Ysmir Collective&lt;/a&gt;, which housed books from the destruction that befell the east, that caused the Dunmer to leave Morrowind. Even the Dark Elves of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; would frequent Winterhold, from places such as &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, there was a disdain interest towards the Dark Elves, causing tension between the Nords and the Dunmer.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great Collapse; The Destruction of Winterhold.\nWith the passing of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, there was a grown distrust with the Mages of Tamriel, even though they were in the forefront against the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; Armies of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;. With the already established hatred in the Dark Elves in Winterhold, the anger towards them had staggered, and racial tensions between the Dunmer and Nords were astronomical. But in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind had left the province in ruins, specifically the sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. When the Island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; was given to the Dark Elves by the then High King of Skyrim, many Dunmer left Skyrim to inhabit the town of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20122\"&gt;4E 122&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Winterhold was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Valdimar\"&gt;Jarl Valdimar&lt;/a&gt;, who had a close relationship with &lt;a href=\"Deneth\"&gt;Deneth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time, the region of Winterhold was hit with a volley of tidal waves and other waves for about a year. What was significantly affected by the tidal waves was the city of Winterhold, where it finally gave way, resulting in a majority of the town being plunged into the waters of the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly enough, the College of Winterhold was unaffected by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Collapse\"&gt;Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;, raising suspicion and even more animosity towards the College. The College had survived due to the powerful magic that the College instated around the whole structure What remained of Winterhold was a couple of buildings and minor ruined homes. The once great capital of Skyrim was reduced to a shanty town of its former self.\nA Land Divided; The Skyrim Civil War.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;. The two ruled from the city of Solitude after the former capital, &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed in an event called the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Collapse\"&gt;Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;. Torygg has ruled the Imperial Province of Skyrim in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, which was considered the catalyst of the coming &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; believed in the independence of Skyrim in a way that is just shy of treason. In the old ways, when one considers themselves a good High King, they would challenge the current one in a duel for the title. Ulfric traveled to Solitude to seek an audience with Torygg, to challenge his title. Before Torygg could react, Ulfric used the power of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to shatter Torygg, killing him in the process. Ulfric escaped to Windhelm, and soon the Civil War commenced.\nWinterhold, along with the rest of the Old Holds joined the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of Winterhold for a while was, &lt;a href=\"Korir\"&gt;Korir&lt;/a&gt;, who was raised to hate and despise the College of Winterhold. Ruling from a broken city, Korir yearns for a Greater Winterhold and has a deep appreciation for the past of the former capital. At one point, Korir sought out the Helm of Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hanse\"&gt;Hanse&lt;/a&gt;, the former Jarl of Winterhold after the death of Borgas. Sending an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; to find it, Korir was able to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;Helm of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; from the ruins of Skyrim.\nDeep within in the ruins of Alftand; the Elder Scrolls.\nAround the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; had occurred throughout the province of Skyrim. The Nordic God, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; the World-Eater returned in 4E 201, and the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; arose, as foretold in the prophecy described on Alduin's Wall. The Dragonborn revealed themselves to the denizens of Skyrim after defeating the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;, saving the city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; from destruction. The Dragonborn traveled to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; and spoke with &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, who guided the warrior to their grandmaster, &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, who lives atop of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. Paarthurnax ordered the Dragonborn to find the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, the one that sent Alduin into the future.\nThe Dragonborn traveled to the College of Winterhold and was told to meet &lt;a href=\"Septimus%20Signus\"&gt;Septimus Signus&lt;/a&gt;, a senile old man located in the frozen north of Winterhold, in the desolate glaciers. Signus would then have the Dragonborn travel to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Alftand\"&gt;Alftand&lt;/a&gt;, located in the middle of the Winterhold frost fields. Deep within Alftand, the Dragonborn discovered &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt;, where they found the Elder Scroll nestled on a Dwarven pedestal. Taking the scroll, the Dragonborn returned to the Throat of the World, where they and Paarthurnax fought Alduin, only for him to retreat into &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe College's Excavation of Saarthal; the Eye of Magnus.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the College of Winterhold had weak ties with the denizens of Winterhold and had watchful eyes from the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, in the form of &lt;a href=\"Ancano\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;. The College was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, who is a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; and succeeded the previous Arch-Mage. &lt;a href=\"Mirabelle%20Ervine\"&gt;Mirabelle Ervine&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Wizard\"&gt;Master Wizard&lt;/a&gt; of the College, almost like the principal of the College. The College had begun archaeological pursuits throughout the Winterhold region, with their eyes on the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, the Master Alteration Mage at the time, conducted an expedition with his students, to learn about the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt; and the Atmoran civilization in Saarthal. One of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;students&lt;/a&gt; traveled deep into the ruins and was encountered by the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, who told them about a powerful magical artifact deep within the ruins of Saarthal. The Student and Tolfdir traveled into the ruins and witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, a large orb of magical properties that was guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; remains of &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating the Draugr, the College took the Eye and left it inside the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. Magic Guilds from all over Tamriel came to Skyrim, to view the eye, even Ancano of the Thalmor.\nAncano of the Thalmor; the Eye of Magnus Incident.\nAs time went on, the College studied the Eye, slowly learning the power that the Eye can possess and what the power can be used for. Ancano realized that the Eye could be used by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, to establish their rule over the provinces further. Ancano used powerful magic to harness the Eye, creating a barrier around himself, as he saps the energy from the Eye. The College attempted to break open the barrier and to defeat Ancano, but to no avail, not even Savos Aren nor Mirabelle Ervine were able to phase into the barrier. Savos tasked the student to find the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Aedric%20Artifact\"&gt;Aedric Artifact&lt;/a&gt; originating from &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the God of Magic. Ancano would disperse an explosion of magic from the Eye, killing both Mirabelle and Savos in the process and unleashing magical anomalies into Winterhold City. The College rushed into the town and saved the citizens from magical creatures. With knowledge of the staff, the student traveled to the distant region of &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, to the ruined city of the &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;, where they retrieved the Staff of Magnus from &lt;a href=\"Morokei\"&gt;Morokei&lt;/a&gt;. With the power of the staff, the student broke down the barrier separating Ancano and defeated the Thalmor agent. The student became the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; of Winterhold, with Tolfdir being the Master Wizard. The Psijic Order would take the Eye from the College and bring it back to &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, where they would keep from mortal hands."}

This\u00a0event is now known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;the Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrangely, the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was unaffected, remaining firm on a now freestanding spire of rock.\u00a0This has led some to believe that the mages in the College of Winterhold were experimenting, and that this was the cause of the Great Collapse.\u00a0Many inhabitants of Winterhold, both mages and magic-fearing Nords, were forced to abandon the city, and those who remain still eye the College with suspicion.\u00a0Alternate theories regarding the Great Collapse are held by some, however; one is that it was a result of the eruption of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; volcano in Vvardenfell, which was not felt until years after the actual incident.\nRegardless of the genesis of the Great Collapse, it is certain that since that time, the population of Winterhold has continued to dwindle. Other than the College, only a handful of buildings still stand. What remains of the town\u2019s economy is based around serving the needs of the College. As such, Winterhold has become something of a haven for mages in Skyrim, a safe refuge from distrustful Nords.\nSince the Great Collapse, the city (or what's left of it) has suffered an economic downturn. Before the catastrophic event, the city flourished culturally due to refugees from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; who, far from burdening the eastern city, brought with them new ideas, enriching the city's culture and stimulating its old mercantile spirit. Scholars from all over Tamriel have descended on the county since it became home to the &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Collective\"&gt;Ysmir Collective&lt;/a&gt;, a library rescued from destruction in the east, and the cornerstone of academic life at the College of Winterhold. Yet after the &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;The Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt; and the event known as &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, relations between the populace of Winterhold and its Morrowind immigrants began to sour. Winterhold's large population of dark elves was driven out by Nords convinced they were involved in evil magic. Many Dunmer mages chose to stay at the College rather than relocate however, much to the displeasure of the Winterhold Nord populace. In the past few decades, many of the other &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; began to disregard the opinions of the Jarl of Winterhold.\nLibrary.\nScholars from all over &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; have descended upon the hold since it became home to the &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Collective\"&gt;Ysmir Collective&lt;/a&gt;, a library rescued from destruction in the east and the cornerstone of academic life at the College of Winterhold.\nProperty.\nDue to a lack of residences caused by the cataclysm, it is not possible to purchase a &lt;a href=\"Houses%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;house&lt;/a&gt; in Winterhold. Even with the DLC, Winterhold remains the only hold where it is not possible to purchase property. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will have to enroll at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, which will entitle the Dragonborn to a dormitory within the College. Completing the entire College quest line will confer upon the Dragonborn the position of Archmage at the College, and thus ownership of the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archmage's quarters&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter encouraging &lt;a href=\"Ranmir\"&gt;Ranmir&lt;/a&gt; to settle his debts with innkeeper &lt;a href=\"Dagur\"&gt;Dagur&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Hearth\"&gt;The Frozen Hearth&lt;/a&gt; Inn, the beds in the rooms on the left hand side of the inn are available to use for free. It is permanent and can easily substitute as a house, although there is not as much space.\nBecoming Thane of Winterhold.\nKorir, Jarl of Winterhold, honors the Dragonborn with the title &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of Winterhold, &lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;after performing certain duties in the service of the Hold&lt;/a&gt;. It is first required that the Dragonborn recover the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;Helm of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; from a random location before the Jarl recognizes their worth as a potential Thane.\nDuties the Dragonborn may perform to become Thane:"}

It is one of the four oldest holds in Skyrim, known collectively as &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt;. At one point Winterhold was the capital of Skyrim. The coat of arms is a three-point crown.\nDescription.\nWinterhold is located on the northeast corner of Skyrim. It is an intensely cold region, and most of the hold is covered in snowy tundra plains and high mountain ranges. Along the coast is a polar environment of glaciers and icebergs. The surrounding holds are &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, to the south; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;, to the west.\nIt is home to the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;. Winterhold has fallen on rough times ever since &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Collapse\"&gt;the Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%20122\"&gt;4E 122&lt;/a&gt; destroyed most of the town. In the aftermath, most of the residents moved away, and those that refused or could not afford to were left behind to witness the slow death of the town. The College of Winterhold was miraculously undamaged in the event, and this has led many residents to believe the College was responsible, although no proof has ever been found to support these claims. Once a source of pride for residents, the College became a hated institution, a reminder of all they had lost. Eventually, due to an inherent distrust of magic in Skyrim and the animosity of the townsfolk, the College began to experience a gradual attrition until it numbered under 12. The town sees little business these days, except for from nobles looking for enchantments, or aspiring mages looking to learn at the College, due to the fact that &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; is so out of the way."}

There are two turn-handles to find, which are easy to find when the fort is properly explored.\nThere is also a puzzle that consists of four rows of three floor-tiles. The clue to solving this is found in a \"&lt;a href=\"Conjurer%27s%20Note%20%28Fort%20Bulwark%29\"&gt;Conjurer's Note&lt;/a&gt;\", which is found on the body of one of the conjurers. The relevant section reads: \"Make note of the candles along the walls if you would pass through.\" Each of the four rows has one, two or three candles at one end. The number of candles is the solution to the row - in order, these are: 1-2-3-1.\nApply this by mentally numbering the tiles in each row from left to right (facing north) as one to three, and standing on one tile from each row, where the tile number corresponds to the code. In other words, stand on the left tile in the first row, the middle tile in the second row, the right tile in the third row, and the left tile in the fourth row.\nThe correct tiles have a distinct \"click\" noise when activated; the incorrect tiles sound different when stepped upon. Do not stand on any other tiles in between - there should be adequate space to walk between the tiles rather than jumping. If done correctly, the gate ahead will then open.\nSecond section.\nAfter passing into the second area of the Fort, there is a prisoner in a cell on the right. Release the prisoner, who is named &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thedret\"&gt;Sir Thedret&lt;/a&gt;, and he will tell them \"When the eyes of the Guardians are upon you, &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; will show you favor.\" He will then head to the Priory of the Nine while they continue searching the fort.\nDrawbridges of Death.\nThere are two draw bridges that must be crossed, the handles to open them are next to the bridge itself, however there are several dart traps that can easily kill the Hero if they time things wrong. Assuming stocked up on the health potions dropped by the conjurers, lower the first draw bridge and time their run all the way to the handle for the second bridge, if they stand close enough to it they will be safe while to regain their health. Lower the second draw bridge and run through to safety on the other side when the darts stop.\nPuzzle one: Turning the statues.\nHead into a large room with several conjurers and several guardian statues. Eliminate the conjurers and turn a switch on each side of the statues to get them all facing the center.\nStand in the center of the statues and the door to the left of the room will unlock. They will have to turn the two statues closest to the scolar's statue multiple times to get them facing the center.\nPuzzle two: Matching the items.\nFollow the passage to another puzzle room. This simple, but iterative puzzle that involves matching the right item to the right chest. There are nine items listed below and nine chests, one for each item.\nTo start, stand on the switch in the center and take the item in the chest in front of the switch. This item will be randomly chosen from one of the nine. This will also cause the image of one of the other eight objects to glow above its corresponding chest. Remember which chest that image belongs to. Put the first object in any of the chests except the switch chest. This will cause a new randomly selected item to appear in the switch chest. If the image for that item has not been seen, put that item it in any of the lower chests.\nAt some point, an item will appear in the switch chest that corresponds to an image already seen. Put the item in that chest. The chest will sparkle white and the statue above it will turn around.\nContinue in this way, pulling items to learn the locations of other items and waiting for items with known locations to appear in the chest.\nEventually, when all nine items are placed in the correct chests, the lights dim and a door in the center opens, allowing them into the next room to claim the shield. Grab it and head back to the priory.\nWhile the selection of the item in the box is random, the chest for each is always the same. E.g., the sword always goes in the first chest to the right of the entrance. The solution is thus shown in the chart below, roughly representing the two L-shaped arrangements of the chests."}

The Argonians want to help me in my quest, but they seem to be divided over something related to their Hist tree.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhen approaching &lt;a href=\"Haj%20Uxith\"&gt;Haj Uxith&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige will encounter an Argonian named &lt;a href=\"Treeminder%20Xohaneel\"&gt;Treeminder Xohaneel&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her, and she will tell you that the people of Haj Uxith are willing to help against Molag Bal, but are divided over the fate of their &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; tree. She will tell you to head to the city and complete their trials before she will tell you more.\nHead to Haj Uxith and you will witness an interaction between the Treeminder and &lt;a href=\"An-Jeen-Sakka\"&gt;An-Jeen-Sakka&lt;/a&gt;, who reminds the Treeminder that they will not help outsiders until they have figured out the fate of the Hist. After they are done, speak with the Treeminder again. She will tell you there are two trials you need to complete, the trial of spirit and the trial of body. You can choose which of these trials you wish to do first. For the trial of spirit, the Treeminder will give you three amulets, which you must take to the people on the south pyramid. Each person must be given the amulet that best represents their spiritual quality.\nHead up the pyramid and speak with the people there to learn who should get which amulet. The correct answers are to give the Amulet of Endurance to &lt;a href=\"Desh-Wazei\"&gt;Desh-Wazei&lt;/a&gt;, the Amulet of Courage to &lt;a href=\"Teelawei\"&gt;Teelawei&lt;/a&gt; and the Amulet of Preservation to &lt;a href=\"Ashgar\"&gt;Ashgar&lt;/a&gt;. When you give them the correct amulets, they will give you the Gems of Endurance, Courage and Preservation, respectively. Head to the pyramid's upper level and place these gems into the statues. The gem of endurance goes in the statue of life, the gem of preservation goes in the statue of time and the gem of courage goes into the statue of the unknown. When this is done, return to the Treeminder to finish the trial of spirit. She will now explain what she meant with the fate of the Hist tree; the crystal that keeps it alive in this foul realm also poisons it and condemns it to constant suffering. The town's scholars wish to end the Hist's suffering and let it die, while the warriors are of the view that any existence is better than death.\n\"&lt;It appears that a gem would fit within the face of this statue.&gt;\"\nFor the trial of body, speak with An-Jeen-Sakka. His trial involves disrupting the daedric operations to harvest sap from the Hist. Head across the bridge to the north and enter the north pyramid, then head through to the &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Sap\"&gt;Hist Sap&lt;/a&gt; Chamber. Collect the treated wood lying around the room and throw it on the fires under the sap vaults to overheat them. Be aware that you will have to dispose of many dremora in this room. Once you've done this, leave the facility and talk to An-Jeen-Sakka. At this point, you have to decide the fate of this clan's Hist tree. You can either side with An-Jeen-Sakka's warriors or with the Treeminder's scholars. \nIf you side with An-Jeen-Sakka, you must then convince Treeminder Xohaneel. She will tell you that in order to convince her, you must face a champion in honourable combat, or you can intimidate her to skip this step. Otherwise, kill the Champion and speak with An-Jeen-Sakka. If you side with the Treeminder, you must then convince An-Jeen-Sakka. He will tell you that in order to convince him, you must face a champion in honourable combat, but you can intimidate him to skip this step. If you don't intimidate him, . After Sakka is convinced, you must head up to the Hist tree and destroy the Vampiric Shard keeping it alive. Then talk to Treeminder Xohaneel to finish the quest."}

Fall not for weaknesses that would trip lesser beings.\n\"Nihnzey miir wah viik.\"Betrayal is the path to defeat.\nBetrayal, literally, a poisoned brother, fractures alliances. It can be the beginning of the end.\n\"Nihnzey miir wah krongrah.\"Betrayal is the path to great victory.\nThe Masters are wise. Sometimes breaking an alliance is necessary to achieve victory.\n\"Rul jol, lok.\"When unsteady, rise.\nI first misunderstood this, for I thought that \"lok\" meant just \"sky,\" and that we should look to the sky, but now I understand fully. It is not a command to look to the sky and seek help from above. It is a metaphor for flight. \"Rise.\" Brace yourself and push yourself harder above the turbulent winds. Do not seek the safety of the ground. Rise and seek greater glory instead.\n\"Nunon mey bo strun voqostiid naal sov.\"Only a fool flies in a storm and is surprised by the shock.\nBe aware of your circumstances. Do not be so blind to your surroundings or focused on your goals that you forget to see the obvious dangers around you.\n\"Dey on folook fey ko ven ahrk ron.\"Implausible spirits haunt a grove in the wind and rain.\nWhatever you think you see, look again. Look closer. Is there a more reasonable explanation?\nA note: The word \"dey\" seems to have a rather bawdy direct translation. At its core, it means \"false,\" but has the connotation of \"laughably false,\" laughing at those who make a claim. \"On\" is a little more slippery. I think it means something like \"soul,\" but more empty. Something lifeless.\n\"Nid jiid, nid kun.\"No moon, no moonlight.\nEnsure that your resources are secure. That you know where they come from and that you do not take them for granted.\nThese are but a few of the pieces of wisdom that I have overheard in my time near the Masters. I feel I have a good grasp of their ancient language, but I must listen closely for the wisdom in the words. I will stay close, as I am able. I am not an important officer, but my duties allow me to listen. And I will report, that you may hear their wisdom, as well. I will share more when the time is right."}

They also act as &lt;a href=\"Healer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spellmaking%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;spellmakers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alchemist%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, even offering services to outsiders who have gained their trust. The &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;Ashkhan&lt;/a&gt; will often seek her counsel and obey her visions. On rare occasions, if a tribe does not have an Ashkhan to lead them, the wise woman may instead take up the mantle. Traditionally, permission must be sought first before an outsider is permitted to enter her yurt and speak with her. Some wise women reject the established rules for women's behavior that govern Ashlander culture, particularly in the practice of &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Snake\"&gt;Ghost Snake&lt;/a&gt; magic, and become &lt;a href=\"mabrigash\"&gt;mabrigash&lt;/a&gt;\u2014renegade witch-warriors.\nTo become a wise woman, a farseer has to complete a ritual called the Red Path. One of the requirements for the ritual of ascension includes wearing a blindfold that symbolises looking beyond what the eyes can see.\nHistory.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, Ashlander wise women played a crucial role in guiding the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; towards their destiny in uniting the conflicting tribes and destroying &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; and rise of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the spirituality of the often persecuted Ashlanders was largely vindicated in the eyes of the settled &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; people, having always kept true to the old ways. As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; it is now quite common for many &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; to make the arduous pilgrimages into the desolate ash wastes to seek the counsel of the wise women, who have done much to dispel &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; worship."}

There are fourteen known Covens in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; of varying sizes, with the most prominent group known as the the &lt;a href=\"Glenmoril%20Witches%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Glenmoril Witches&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile not a major faction in Daggerfall, the Covens have their own reputation system, and are capable of revealing &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20of%20Power\"&gt;Artifact of Power&lt;/a&gt; and summoning various &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;.

Once found, however, the Agent will see the Coven marked on their various maps, either in town or as a black dot on the region map, listed under the \"Dungeons\" tab. All Covens will be non-hostile the first time the Agent comes across them.\nIt is rumored that the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; also has respect for the various Covens, although a direct relationship between the two factions is unlikely.\nQuests.\nThere are ten potential, repeatable, quests available to complete for the Covens, four of which are locked behind the &lt;a href=\"Reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; system.

The Beldama are found within the thick forests of central &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;, which are problematic to the explorer due to the broken terrain and heavy vegetation. Precious few have enountered the &lt;a href=\"Beldama%20Wyresses\"&gt;Beldama Wyresses&lt;/a&gt; (another name for a group of ward-sisters, or witches), but those who have speak of dark encampments under the canopy of ancient oak trees and cavorting rituals to honor &lt;a href=\"Jephre\"&gt;Jephre&lt;/a&gt;, an aspect of &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, the most venerated god of the Bosmeri deities.\nThe all-female Beldama Wyrd trace their origin to the time Y'free transformed himself into the first &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; (or \"Earth Bones\") and established the laws of nature. While this is obviously mere myth, the Beldama Wyrd all fiercely believe they are descendants of the Ehlnofey. It is uncertain whether the Wyresses should be considered beneficial or malefic, but all agree they are uncanny and forceful. They see themselves as wardens of the forests with an unwavering reverence for nature. Most &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; consider them dangerous witches, to be placated rather than revered. It is no wonder, then, that the Beldama Wyrd dwells in the least populated region of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Beldama tend to congregate around a mysteriously and reputedly gigantic &lt;a href=\"Wyrd%20Tree\"&gt;Wyrd Tree&lt;/a&gt;, which glows with an unnatural light and looks unlike any other tree in the northern forests of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Should the Empire consider an invasion, threats of deforestation might be a way to cow the local population, although the Beldama Wyrd may have unknown magic capable of forestalling incursions."}

In both games, Witchhunters serve as adept anti-&lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; combat artists. The Witchhunter uses various schools of magic and &lt;a href=\"marksman\"&gt;marksman&lt;/a&gt;ship to combat foes. To assist its combat prowess, the witchunter excels at &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"athletics\"&gt;athletics&lt;/a&gt;. Since the skills of the witchhunter are skills which both &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; are proficient in, they make the most effective Witchhunters. &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, excelling at magic, also make effective Witchhunters, so long as they wield &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"items\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Magic\"&gt;resist magic&lt;/a&gt; or elemental damage.\nUsage.\nSkills.\n&lt;a href=\"Witchhunter\"&gt;Witchhunter&lt;/a&gt;s are dedicated to rooting out and destroying the practices of dark cults and profane sorcery. They train for martial and magical war against &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, cultists, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"creature\"&gt;creature&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Bow\"&gt;Bow&lt;/a&gt;s, both real and &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Bow%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bound&lt;/a&gt;, are the standard &lt;a href=\"weapons\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; of any Witchhunter. A skilled &lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; can shoot a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; while avoiding any incoming &lt;a href=\"spells\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt; and outrun any slow &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; while peppering them with &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and spells.\nAlso essential to the Witchhunter is the magical skill of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. These spells can augment arrows and are quite effective at exploiting or creating weaknesses of the enemies, as well as disintegrating their &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and weapons. Close-range Destruction &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Touch\"&gt;Cold Touch&lt;/a&gt;, gives Witchhunters an advantage in melee encounters, whereas projectiles would be less effective.\nIn conjunction with these two skills, &lt;a href=\"Athletics\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt; is very useful. It allows the Witchhunter to keep a distance between themselves and enemies. As one of the few &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es without either an armor &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Spell%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; spells, keeping away from damage is a useful strategy.\nArmor.\nAs mentioned above, the Witchhunter lacks any &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; skill. Thus, it is important they make use of &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;. Some Witchhunters may consider this school of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt; as the tools of the enemy and creates a risk of contamination, but these spells are so useful that no Witchhunter can do without. &lt;a href=\"Summon\"&gt;Summon&lt;/a&gt;ing a creature to take the melee damage instead of the caster, or &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Cuirass%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;binding a cuirass&lt;/a&gt; on oneself are both very effective when taking on fast and powerful enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Clannfear\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt; is also a great spell for a Witchhunter, especially when cleansing a lair of &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCounteracting magic.\nThe other &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; of the Witchhunter is &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, primarily to &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dispel&lt;/a&gt; any summoned creatures from their summoner (simply hit the necromancer with a Dispel on target and the summoned creature will disappear), but this skill also comes in handy to &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; enemies. The more powerful spells of &lt;a href=\"Reflect\"&gt;Reflect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Absorption\"&gt;Spell Absorption&lt;/a&gt; are also useful later in the game when going up against powerful warlocks.\nWhen investigating a potential vampire or necromancer, often evidence of their true nature or habit is behind locked doors or in a locked container. The Security skill allows any Witchhunter to open such locks.\nFinally, a Witchhunter knows how to use the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Poison\"&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt;ed &lt;a href=\"Arrow\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; and a few powerful &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; can be all it takes to tip the balance in favor of the Witchhunter. Potions of &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Restore\"&gt;Restore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt; are the most useful when fighting vampires or necromancers, as are the &lt;a href=\"Damage\"&gt;Damage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silence\"&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt; poisons.\nRaces.\n&lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; make effective Witchhunters due to their proficiency with both defensive and offensive magic. The Breton's innate ability to &lt;a href=\"Resist\"&gt;Resist Magic&lt;/a&gt; gives them extreme defense against hostile magicka-users.\n&lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, while weak to Magicka, boast stronger magical power and a vaster &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; pool. &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; gain bonuses to Marksmen and Destruction, making them adept offensively for the Witchhunter class. Their proficiency with &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; helps counter the Witchhunter's vulnerability to melee attacks.\nLastly, Argonians excel at Illusion and Mysticism, two helpful skills for the Witchhunter build, while their experience with &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; allows them to craft &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;s to dip their &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; in. Poisons that &lt;a href=\"Damage%20Magicka\"&gt;damage magicka&lt;/a&gt; help when combating mages, forcing them to rely on physical prowess in battle."}

The courier generally takes between one and three days to arrive, depending on whether the Dragonborn sleeps or if they are close to a town or a settlement.\nBackground.\n\"Astrid, of the Dark Brotherhood, informed me that by killing Grelod the Kind, I have robbed her organization of a kill. I have been taken captive and moved to some remote shack. Astrid will only give me the key if I kill someone she has taken captive, to \"repay my debt.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nThere are two ways to complete this quest, the first is to follow the orders given by Astrid, the assassin. The second, to defeat her.\nThe Mysterious Note.\nThe quest typically begins after the Dragonborn has received the Mysterious Note from the courier and sleeps in a bed, however, sleeping in a bed even before receiving the note may trigger it.\nMeeting Astrid.\nThe Dragonborn will awake in an &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Shack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;abandoned shack&lt;/a&gt;, located in the marshes north of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; assassin named Astrid will speak to them. She reveals that the Dark Brotherhood is aware of their murderous deed and is pleased that &lt;a href=\"Grelod\"&gt;Grelod&lt;/a&gt; is dead, but since the Aretino child performed the Black Sacrament, they demand that a debt be paid for the kill that was stolen from them. Astrid has brought three other people to the shack where the Dragonborn awoke. &lt;a href=\"Fultheim%20the%20Fearless\"&gt;Fultheim the Fearless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alea%20Quintus\"&gt;Alea Quintus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vasha\"&gt;Vasha&lt;/a&gt; are tied up and wearing &lt;a href=\"execution%20hood\"&gt;execution hood&lt;/a&gt;s, but are able to answer questions. Astrid tells the Dragonborn that there is a contract out on one of their lives, and the Dragonborn must figure out whom to kill.\nJoining the Dark Brotherhood.\nKilling any one of them, or any two, or all of them; will please Astrid, who will unlock the shack, and direct the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn must\u00a0now go to the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary near &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, where speaking with Astrid completes the quest, and the next quest,\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;,\"\u00a0begins.\nTo enter the sanctuary, one needs to speak to the Black Door:\n\"What is the music of life?\"\nNote that entering the sanctuary before starting &lt;a href=\"Delayed%20Burial\"&gt;Delayed Burial&lt;/a&gt; will fail that quest.\nKilling Astrid.\nAlternatively, choosing to kill Astrid will fail \"With Friends Like These...\" and begin a new quest, \"Destroy the Dark Brotherhood!\", now the next objective is to report the events to a guard. To open the locked door, the key to the shack must be looted from Astrid. It is also possible, before leaving, to untie and free all the captives. However, they can also be killed and the player will not be charged with murder.\nQuotes.\nEach kill or combination of kills evokes a different response from Astrid upon speaking to her afterwards."}

To &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, knowledge is power, but Mephala concerns herself with only the choicest morsels: knowledge secluded, undisclosed.\nThe various Daedric artifacts associated with Mephala share this disposition, chief among them, the Ebony Blade, of which little is known. The records of the Tong themselves disagree on the properties locked within the Blade's metal. But I'll share what I know about it, and in return, you will complete your first assignment for the guild. I hope you'll find the &lt;a href=\"Flowers%20of%20Gold\"&gt;Flowers of Gold&lt;/a&gt; a suitable base of operations. Your room is a favorite of mine. Warm and dry.\nFirst: the Blade initially passed into the Morag Tong's notice (this decade, at least) when our brother &lt;a href=\"Orndras\"&gt;Orndras&lt;/a&gt; obtained it, taking it from &lt;a href=\"Rivis\"&gt;Rivis&lt;/a&gt;, another brother. Rivis had the Blade kept in a safehouse for years, hidden from his fellow Morag Tong. How did Orndras find Rivis out? He'll take that secret to his grave, but his handlers whispered that the Web Spinner herself had told him. Even the Tong is unsure how the Blade is connected to Mephala, whether it is an extension of her physical form, or if her essence is bound to it, but it's important to her. And that makes it important to us.\nSecond: Rivis was an ambitious mage, one of the Tong's most powerful. And he was not about to allow Orndras to leave his safehouse with the Ebony Blade in tow. There was a duel between them, and when Orndras drew first blood with the Blade\u2014and failed to kill\u2014he was surprised Rivis did not engulf him in a fiery spell. It's possible the Blade can silence a mage, stymie the flow of magicka, or simply absorb it.\nThird: Rivis was keen with an edge, and better skilled than Orndras. But Orndras wielded the Ebony Blade, and the wounds he suffered stitched themselves together as the battle continued\u2014as Orndras dealt his less-precise cuts. Perhaps a restorative property of the Blade.\nFourth: Rivis' last words were, \"The Vampire will be the end of us all.\" Orndras believed he was referring to the Blade, that Rivis had hidden it out of legitimate fear. I believe that even the most venerable of the Morag Tong will say anything when backed into a corner. I have.\nFifth: Orndras retrieved the Blade, made a detailed report to his handlers\u2014and then attempted to slaughter them. He murdered all but one. His actions had no discernible rhyme or reason or motive, and he was last seen on the third floor of the Flowers of Gold.\nReturn the Ebony Blade to us, whether Orndras comes with it or not. Look for a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; with a scar under his left eye."}

Finally, grudgingly: \"Because I have a conversation, darling, it flows in alphabetical order. Just like I told you. I think the only way to stop it is not to talk at all.\"\n\"Couldn't you just be imagining this?\" said Kazagha patiently. \"It wouldn't be the first time you had an insane paranoid delusion. Remember when you thought the royal &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; was hiding behind every tree with lewd intent, intent on making you -- a middle-aged, fat, balding tailor -- into his personal sex slave? You don't need to be ashamed, but it's &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s way to make us all a little crazy sometimes. If you go to the healer--\"\n\"Damn it, Kazagha!\" snarled Zaki and stomped out, slamming the door behind him. He nearly collided with Siyasat, his neighbor.\n\"Excuse me,\" she said to Zaki's back. He clamped his hands over his ears as he stormed down the street, turning the corner to his tailor shop. His first customer was waiting out front, smiling widely. Zaki tried to keep his temper under control and took out his keys, returning the customer's smile.\n\"Fine day,\" said the young man.\n\"Gods!\" hollered Zaki, sending the young man flying with a well-placed punch, and dashing away.\nAs much as he hated to admit that Kazagha was right, it was evidently time, once again, for one of the healer's herbal cocktails. Tarsu's temple to health, mental and physical, was several streets north, an impressive obelisk. Halqa, the chief herbalist, met him before he came in the hall.\n\"How are you today, Sa'Zaki Saf?\"\n\"I need to make an appointment with Tarsu,\" said Zaki in his calmest voice.\n\"Just one moment, let me see how his schedule looks.\" Halqa said, looking over a scroll. \"Is this an emergency?\"\n\"Kind of,\" said Zaki, and slapped his head. Why couldn't he say yes, or absolutely, or sure?\n\"Let's see,\" said Halqa, frowning. \"The best I can do is next &lt;a href=\"Day\"&gt;Middas&lt;/a&gt;. Would that work for you?\"\n\"Middas!\" cried Zaki. \"I'll be a complete psychotic by Middas. Isn't there anything earlier?\"\nHe knew what the answer would be before she said it. There was no alternative. In a way, he had forced the response. If only he had kept the conversation going until \"Y.\"\n\"No,\" said Halqa. \"I'm sorry. Do you want me to make the appointment--?\"\nZaki walked away, gritting his teeth. He wandered the streets, his head down to avoid all conversations, until he looked up and discovered that he had walked all the way to the wharf. A sweet breeze was blowing along the water and he took several deep breaths until he felt almost normal. When his temper cooled, he could think again. What if this alphabetical conversation wasn't a delusion at all? What if what he felt wasn't paranoia, but acute awareness? He knew it was the classic dilemma: am I crazy or is there really something weird going\non?\nAcross the road was a shop called ParaDocks, featuring a display of herbs, crystals, and vapors trapped in orbs. The sign in the window read \"Mystical Consultation sunrise to noon.\" It was worth a shot, though Zaki was dubious. The only people who generally came down the wharf for healing were stupid adventurers who didn't\nknow any better.\nIncense burned in copious billows of pink and gold, obscuring and then revealing the clutter within. Jijjic death masks glowered down from the walls, smoking censors hung by chains from the ceiling, and the floor was a maze of bookshelves. At a wellworn table in the back a small man wearing a headress was tabulating a young lady's purchases.\n\"Okay,\" said the man. \"Your total comes to fifty-seven gold pieces. I threw in the restorative scale conditioner for free. Just remember, the candle should be lit only after you invoke Goroflox The Unholy, and mandrake root does best in partial shade.\"\nThe customer gave a quick, shy smile to Zaki and left the store.\n\"Please help me,\" said Zaki. \"Every conversation I hear or get involved in seems to be arranged alphabetically. I don't know if I'm going insane or if there are some kind of bizarre forces at work. To be honest with you, I'm normally a skeptic when it comes to your type of business, but I'm at the end of my rope. Can you do anything to make this madness end?\"\n\"Quite a common problem, actually,\" said the man, patting Zaki on the arm. \"When you get to the end of the alphabet, do conversations then go to reverse alphabetical order or start at the beginning of the alphabet?\"\n\"Reverse alphabetical order,\" said Zaki, and then corrected himself. \"Damn it! I mean, it starts from the beginning, all over again. I'm in agony. Can you call on the spirits and tell me, am I insane?\"\n\"Sauriki,\" said the man with a reassuring smile. \"I don't have to. You're quite sane.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Zaki, frowning. \"By the way, my name's Zaki, not Sauriki.\"\n\"Unusually close, eh?\" said the man, patting Zaki on the back. \"My name's Octoplasm. Follow me, please. I think I have just what you need.\"\nOctoplasm lead Zaki down the narrow corridor behind the desk. The two men pushed past dusty cabinets filled with strange creatures in liquids, past heaps of neolithic stones, past stack after stack of moldering leather-bound books, into the dank heart of the store. There he picked up a small, squat cylindrical drum and a book, and handed them to Zaki.\n\"'Vampirism, Daedric Possession, and Withershin Therapy,'\" said Zaki, squinting his eyes to read the book in the gloom. \"What in Oblivion does this have to do with me? I'm not a vampire, look at this tan. And what's Withershin Therapy, and how much will it cost me?\"\n\"Withershins, from the Old Cyrodilic withersynes, which means backwards,\" said Octoplasm in a serious tone. \"It's the art of reversing the direction of things in order to gain access to the spirit world, and break curses, cure vampirism, and trigger all manners of apotropaic healing. You know the story about the guy who was told that slaughterfish live in hot water, so he said, 'Well, let's boil them in cold water'?\"\n\"Xenophus,\" said Zaki instinctively, his brother having taken a rather esoteric upper level course in Cyrodilic philosophy as an elective in at the Imperial College thirty-one years before, and immediately wishing he hadn't. \"And what do you do with the cylindrical thingy?\"\nOctoplasm lit a candle and held the object over it so Zaki could see more clearly. All along the cylinder were narrow slits and when Zaki peered within them, he saw a succession of old black and white drawings of a naked man leaping over boxes, one frame after the next.\n\"You spin it like so,\" said Octoplasm, slowly whirling the device clockwise so the man within leapt over the boxes over and over again. \"It's called a zoetrope. Pretty neat, eh? Now, you take it and start spinning it counterclockwise, and while you're doing it, read this incantation I've marked in the book.\"\nZaki took the zoetrope and began spinning it counterclockwise over the candle, so the little naked man within seemed to bound backwards over the boxes. It took a little coordination and concentration to keep whirling at a steady pace, but gradually the man's awkward and jerky backjumps became more and more fluid until Zaki could no longer see the individual frames flipping. It looked just like a little humanoid hamster on an endless reverse treadmill. While he continued to spin the zoetrope with one hand, Zaki took the book in the other and read the underlined passage.\n\"Zoetrope counter-spin, counter-spin, counter-spin / Pull my life from the rut that it's in / I invoke the Goddesses &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drisis\"&gt;Drisis&lt;/a&gt; / To invert my potentially metaphysical crisis / My old life may have been rather pointless and plain / But I dislike the prospect of going insane / Make the pattern reverse by this withershin / Zoetrope, counter-spin, counter-spin, counter-spin.\"\nAs he chanted the spell, Zaki noticed that the little naked man in the zoetrope began to look more like himself. The moustache vanished, and the hairline receded. The man's waistline expanded, and the buttocks sagged to the shape and texture of half-inflated balloons. Scales approximating his own &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; pattern appeared. The man began to trip as he bounded backwards over the boxes, taking bigger breaths and sweating. By the time Zaki reached the end of the incantation, his twin was clutching his chest and tumbling end-over-end over the boxes in a free-fall.\nOctoplasm took the zoetrope and the book from Zaki's hands. Nothing seemed to have changed. No thunder had rumbled. No winged serpents had sprung out of Zaki's head. No fiery explosions. But Zaki felt that something was different. Good different. Normal.\nAt the counter, when Zaki pulled out his satchel of gold pieces, Octoplasm merely shook his head: \"Are treatment radical such of effects term long the what sure be can't we, naturally. Charge no.\"\nFeeling the first real relief he had felt in days, Zaki walked backwards out of the shop and down the road to his shop."}

He is the son of &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the previous &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt; Ulfric has been leading a Civil War against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which escalated after he killed &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nRulership.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric has both positive and negative aspects. The largely Nordic population of Windhelm supports both Ulfric and his rebellion, as Ulfric is considered loyal, and a good leader to his kinsmen. This is contrasted with the Dunmer and Argonian populations of the city. When Argonians, Dunmer, or Khajiit caravans are ambushed by marauders, Ulfric does not care for their deaths, so long as the marauders do not threaten Nord land. The Dunmer and Argonians are further segregated from the rest of Windhelm's population. The Argonians were all forced outside of Windhelm's walls by a decree written by Ulfric, and the Dunmer are forced to live in a slum known as the Gray Quarter. It is further implied that Ulfric desires a Skyrim full of Nords, without other races.\nHistory.\nEarly life and the Great War.\nWhen Ulfric was young, he was chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; to study with them. He was meant to become a Greybeard himself. After almost 10 years of training, Ulfric had learned the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shout\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt;, then the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; broke out between the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric decided to take part in the Great War on the side of the Empire, where he fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, Ulfric was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; during their campaign for the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and interrogated by &lt;a href=\"Elenwen\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;, who later became the ambassador to Skyrim. Ulfric was led to believe that the information he provided led to the fall of the city, though it had in fact fallen before Ulfric had broken. After the interrogation, Ulfric was assigned as an asset to Elenwen, and was allowed to escape.\nThe aftermath of the Great War.\nAfter the Great War ended, Ulfric was back in Skyrim and had established a militia. Direct contact had also been established between Ulfric and the Thalmor and he started proving his worth as an asset to them, particularly during the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;. During the Incident, Ulfric attacked Markarth and drove out the Reachmen, restoring Markarth to Nordic rule after Markarth had fallen to the local Reachmen during the Great War as a result of troops being recalled to Cyrodiil. With the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s still being in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the Great War ending, the Jarl of Markarth, &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, could not turn to them for aid. As an alternative, he found Ulfric Stormcloak and his militia. While the Reachmen were making overtures to make peace with the Empire, and be recognized as a legitimate kingdom, Hrolfdir was arranging an agreement with Ulfric. Hrolfdir and Ulfric eventually came to an agreement, Ulfric demanded he and his militia would be allowed to worship &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; again, and in return the Stormcloaks would take back the city.\nHrolfdir promised that Talos worship would be allowed in Markarth, and so the Stormcloaks marched on Markarth. Ulfric and his militia were said to have been relentless when they took over Markarth, with Ulfric saying \"You are with us, or you are against Skyrim.\" It is said that many of the native Reachmen were killed by Ulfric through executions, though Hrolfdir also played a part in this. After the Legions had returned home from the Great War, they were blocked entrance into Markarth until they too accepted Ulfric's term of free Talos worship. With the rumors of deaths rising by the day in the city, the Empire accepted the deal and were permitted entry. The Empire and Markarth's Jarl hoped the Thalmor would not find out. When they did find out about it, they demanded Ulfric and his militia be arrested or the Empire risking plunging into a new Great War. The choice was clear, and Ulfric and his entire militia were imprisoned, which was particularly valuable for the strategic goals of Thalmor regarding Skyrim. However, it resulted in Ulfric becoming uncooperative to direct contact with Thalmor, causing them to reclassify him as a \"dormant\" and \"uncooperative\" asset. This event also forced the Emperor to crack down on Talos worship by allowing the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s into Imperial territory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, and High King &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a result of the Markarth Incident, the militia Ulfric had used to conquer Markarth from the Reachmen were now turned into a rebellious group, known as the Stormcloaks. These Stormcloaks started the Civil War in Skyrim under Ulfric's demand. The name \"Stormcloak,\" according to some, refers to the last name of Ulfric, and was meant as a mockery by the members of the Legion to belittle the Stormcloak's cause. Others state that the name was created by the Stormcloaks themselves to show Ulfric's ambition for the throne. Regardless of the origins of the name, the Stormcloaks gladly accepted being named after Ulfric, and wear the name with pride, as they consider Ulfric the true High King of Skyrim and an exemplar of their Nordic values. During his time in prison, his father, &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag&lt;/a&gt; died. Ulfric was allowed to leave prison as a result. After this Ulfric made his way back to Windhelm and the people there set him on the throne.\nOne of the deeds that Ulfric did as Jarl was force the Argonian population outside the city walls via a decree, and segregate the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; population to the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Quarter\"&gt;Gray Quarter&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric also did not act if a group of &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, Dunmer refugees, or a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20Caravan\"&gt;Khajiit Caravan&lt;/a&gt; is ambushed, only sending aid or investigating when Nords are being threatened. He also continued waging the Skyrim Civil War from Windhelm, originally being rather unsuccessful, and not gaining a lot of support, the Empire did not pay much attention to Ulfric. Some skirmishes were fought between the Stormcloaks and Imperials, even outside Windhelm itself, but the war had not yet fully escalated. The High King at the time, &lt;a href=\"Istlod\"&gt;Istlod&lt;/a&gt;, had held Skyrim together for 25 years, and following his death the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was held. Though Istlod's son, Torygg had, by tradition, a justified claim to the throne he still allowed the Moot to meet. Ulfric was at this Moot, and he spoke of Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason, for which Torygg greatly respected the man. Torygg was elected as High King by the Jarls of Skyrim, and would rule until his death in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn 4E 201, Ulfric Stormcloak asked for an audience with the High King and the Court of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The people thought that, because Ulfric wanted independence, he would ask Torygg to declare independence from the Empire, but instead, Ulfric challenged Torygg to a &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Nordic%20Duel\"&gt;Traditional Nordic Duel&lt;/a&gt;. By Nord tradition, once such a challenge is issued in court, the High King has to accept, or risk another Moot meeting. Torygg died when Ulfric unleashed the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt; during the battle, though Ulfric himself claims it was his sword piercing Torygg's heart that killed him. Historically, such duels did not result in death, thus some considered Ulfric a murderer, while others in Skyrim considered it justified and a fair kill. Regardless of whether the kill was murder or not, the death of the High King got the Empire's attention, and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; joined Ulfric's cause.\nAs a result of the civil war becoming a big obstacle, General Tullius got sent to Skyrim. Tullius turned things around for the Empire in the short months he had been in Skyrim. Before Tullius' arrival, Ulfric and his Stormcloaks had always managed to evade capture by the Imperial Legion. But under Tullius' leadership, the Imperial Legion became more organized and Ulfric was captured at &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, Ulfric was meant to be transported back to Cyrodiil, but it was later decided that he would be executed at Helgen. At Helgen, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; made his first appearance since the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, and in the chaos, Ulfric managed to escape. After the destruction of Helgen, Ulfric made his way back to Windhelm, where he continued to wage the Skyrim Civil War. The Jarls were upset that there was not a High King, and demanded the Moot to meet. But Ulfric did not allow it to meet as he did not want to risk Elisif, the Jarl of Solitude and widow of Torygg, to become High Queen.\nSeason Unending.\nIn 4E 201, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, on his quest to beat the World-Eater, needed to capture &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;a dragon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, the palace of the Jarl of Whiterun. As Dragonsreach is located in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; was neutral in the Skyrim Civil War, the Jarl of Whiterun, &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;, was hesitant to allow the Dragonborn to capture a dragon. The Jarl feared that if he made one wrong move, either the Stormcloaks or Imperials would try to invade his Hold. The Dragonborn and the Jarl made an agreement that if the Dragonborn managed to create a temporary truce between the two factions, the Jarl would help in capturing the dragon. When the Dragonborn asks Ulfric to attend to this council, he is hesitant at first, because not all the Jarls were fully committed to supporting him as High King, and he did not want to risk appearing weak. However, the Dragonborn is eventually able to convince him."}

Ulfric supports &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s independence from the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which he believes has been corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and too weak to protect its citizens. Some describe Ulfric as a hero, while others label him an opportunist.\nA veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric's holds deep resentment of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; between the Empire and Aldmeri Dominion, particularly the ban of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship. During the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric marched soldiers into &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; under the pretext that this action would re-legitimize Talos worship, but was eventually detained.\nHe is first seen bound and gagged, accompanying the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and a few other prisoners\u00a0of war while traveling to &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; for their execution.\nBackground.\nEarly life.\nAs a boy, Ulfric was chosen by &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; to study with them at &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. He trained with them for almost ten years and developed his skills in the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;. He was to become a Greybeard himself, but his life took a different path when the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; began in &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric felt compelled to help the war effort and left High Hrothgar to join the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, much to the disdain of &lt;a href=\"Arngeir\"&gt;Arngeir&lt;/a&gt;, who believed that the Way of the Voice should only be used for the worship of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Great War.\nDuring the Great War, he fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;; however, he was captured by the Aldmeri Dominion during the Dominion's campaign for the Imperial City.\nWhile imprisoned, he was interrogated by &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt; for information, under which they learned of his potential value (being the son of the Jarl of Windhelm), and considered him an asset to their influence in Skyrim.\u00a0He was made to believe information obtained during his interrogation was crucial in the capture of the Imperial City in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0even though it had fallen before any information could be gained.\u00a0The \"\" on Ulfric says he was then allowed to escape; whether he escaped on his own and the Thalmor were unable to apprehend him or if he was intentionally set free is not known.\nThe Markarth Incident.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;, the Great War ended with the Empire signing the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, an act which banned the worship of Talos\u00a0in the Empire. During the war, the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; lost possession of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; due to an uprising by a group of &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0known as &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt;, son of the previous Jarl of the Reach, stated his family and their Imperial colleagues sought help from Ulfric in ousting the Reachmen invaders. Igmund's father, &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt;, promised Ulfric that if he re-took the Reach, then Hrolfdir as Jarl would allow free worship of Talos in Markarth again. Ulfric agreed and marched his militia to the gates of Markarth and retook the city, supposedly using the power of his &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe leader of the Reachmen, &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;, was captured, but was spared by prominent Markarth citizen &lt;a href=\"Thonar%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thonar Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt;, as he was deemed more valuable alive than dead, and was incarcerated in &lt;a href=\"Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. The surviving Reachmen fled to the hills of the Reach and became known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the battle, later known as the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric stationed a Nordic militia in the area to aid in keeping the Forsworn that had retreated from retaking Markarth. Hrolfdir initially kept his promise to Ulfric and allowed free worship of Talos for a time.\nWhen the Imperial Legion arrived to restore the rule of law, Ulfric allegedly refused them entry into the city until they also agreed free worship of Talos would be allowed. With chaos supposedly running through the streets of Markarth and the reports of deaths rising every day, the Empire had no choice but to grant Ulfric and his men their worship, thus jeopardizing the peace agreement with the Aldmeri Dominion. Igmund however, implies that the Empire simply hoped that the Dominion wouldn't find out about the free Talos worship, and when they eventually did, scapegoated Ulfric and his militia in order to avoid incrimination and prevent a potential second Great War with the Dominion.\nEventually, the Empire rescinded the agreement due to pressure from the Aldmeri Dominion, and Ulfric and his militia were expelled from the city and imprisoned shortly after with Hrolfdir's help. This betrayal left Ulfric bitter towards the Empire and is considered to be the initial conception of the Stormcloak rebellion.\nJarl of Windhelm.\nHis father &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl of Windhelm, usually referred simply as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bear%20of%20Eastmarch\"&gt;The Bear of Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;,\" died during his incarceration. Ulfric, his only son, was forced to deliver his eulogy via a letter that he had smuggled out of prison. Leaving prison, Ulfric returned to Windhelm to find the city in mourning. The citizens were said to have been calling out for justice and war against the Aldmeri Dominion. Naturally, they sat Ulfric on the throne and he became Jarl.\nAfter the death of High King &lt;a href=\"Istlod\"&gt;Istlod&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; convened to elect a new king. During this Moot, Ulfric continually spoke about Skyrim's independence in terms just shy of treason. Eventually, the Moot had elected Istlod's son, &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;, as the new High King of Skyrim.\nHigh King Torygg.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, after years of brewing resentment for what he and his followers considered the Empire's betrayal of Skyrim after the Markarth Incident, Ulfric challenged\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;High King Torygg&lt;/a&gt; to a duel. Ulfric maintains it was to show how weak Skyrim had become under Imperial rule. He also claims that it was a challenge of rule in the \"Old Nord Way\" and that Torygg accepted the challenge. Others in Skyrim, such as &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt;, denounced the act as murder and an attempt to usurp the throne.\nAfter Torygg's death, Ulfric fled back to Windhelm. Some time after this event, the Imperial Legion managed to ambush Ulfric at &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in order to capture him. The ambush was successful and Ulfric surrendered himself without a fight.\nPolicies and beliefs.\nMuch of Stormcloak doctrine stems from Ulfric's views that Skyrim should secede from what he considers a corrupt crumbling Empire; one that already is defeated by the Thalmor. After witnessing the deaths of an untold number of Nords who sacrificed themselves during The Great War, Ulfric considered the White-Gold Concordat treaty between the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion to be a complete betrayal of the Empire's citizens.\nUlfric also seeks to become the next &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, as he believes there has not been a \"true\" High King in Skyrim for generations, and that previous kings were puppets that were hand-picked by the Emperor. Some Nords feel that his opposition to the White-Gold Concordat and the banning of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0worship in Skyrim\u00a0is simply a fa\u00e7ade for him to gain more supporters to gain his true goal of becoming High King of Skyrim. Asking Ulfric how he became Jarl of Eastmarch, however, will reveal that he is very dedicated in following the ways of traditional Nord beliefs. He says that the throne he sits on is &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;'s and his father's, rather than his, and that he only hopes he can do both of them proud. \nFurthermore, Ulfric's dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; reveals that he does not relish the lives that will be lost in his rebellion and is considerate of the Nord families who will lose loved ones in his civil war. Even so, Ulfric feels he must see his quest for Skyrim's independence to its final conclusion as he sees the Empire as an inept parasite that continues to bleed Skyrim dry to recoup their losses from the Great War that they chose to surrender in. He also sees the Empire as an obstacle which is preventing his people from ridding his homeland of &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; influence. In addition to his qualms about how the Empire's politics are affecting his homeland, he also resents the Empire for what he sees as unjustly criminalizing the Nord people for desiring to rule themselves and disregarding the sacrifices of all the soldiers who fought in the Great War by appeasing the oppressive demands of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith several of his policies being nationalistic in tone, many non-Nord and some Nords consider Ulfric to be prejudiced. He is believed by some to have sequestered the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29%23History\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; population in Windhelm to the slums of the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Quarter\"&gt;Gray Quarter&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Assemblage\"&gt;assemblage off the docks&lt;/a&gt;, issuing a decree forbidding the Argonians from living within the city's walls, contrary to his father &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag's&lt;/a&gt; more \"soft\" policy, however this hostile belief toward outsiders is shared by much of Windhelm's populace. Dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Niranye\"&gt;Niranye&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; who lives within the city\u2014actually suggests that it is the Dunmer who chose to live in the Gray Quarter due to being \"too proud and naive to understand the way things truly are.\" Similar comments are made by &lt;a href=\"Belyn%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Belyn Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, a Dunmer who owns property in Windhelm.\nPleas from Dunmer citizens often fall on deaf ears, leading them to believe he has nothing but disdain for them. Some even claim Ulfric refuses to send aid to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20Caravan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit caravans&lt;/a&gt; and non-Nord towns that have been raided by bandits. Dialogue shared between Ulfric and his steward &lt;a href=\"Jorleif\"&gt;Jorleif&lt;/a&gt; indicate, however, that he does not attend to the issues in his city because he is too preoccupied with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the greater issues of Skyrim to worry about them, saying it is the guards' jobs to deal with such issues. He also allows non-Nords to live peacefully in Windhelm and own businesses, including\u00a0Altmer and &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;. He also allows a Dunmer, &lt;a href=\"Belyn%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Belyn Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, to own a &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Farm\"&gt;successful farm&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the outskirts of the city, and employ an &lt;a href=\"Adisla\"&gt;elderly Nord woman&lt;/a&gt;.\nUlfric admits to having fallen from the Greybeards' strict teachings about using the Way of the Voice for anything other than the worship of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, however he still believes that his Thu'um should not be used lightly and rarely uses his training. He also still refers to Arngeir as \"Master Arngeir,\" despite not training with them for a number of years.\nInteractions.\nExecution at Helgen.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric is among the prisoners awaiting execution along with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. He can be identified easily by the cloth he is gagged with, preventing him from using the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to escape his captors. He is scheduled to be executed when a &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, later revealed to be Alduin the World Eater, attacks the town. Ulfric escapes his execution and survives the dragon attack with the help of his men, and returns to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; to resume his office of &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;. When the Dragonborn meets him again, they discover that he and his &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; plot to gain control over all of Skyrim, an act opposed by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormcloak Rebellion.\nIf choosing to aid Ulfric in the Stormcloak resistance, the Dragonborn is sent to &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;the Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;. Ulfric's second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;, believes the relic will secure his claim to the throne. Retrieving it, he sends the Dragonborn to the neutral city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to deliver his axe, a symbol of challenge, to &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl. Balgruuf, reluctantly refusing to side with the Stormcloaks, returns the weapon to Ulfric. Not long after, Ulfric sends the Dragonborn to help his Stormcloaks assault Whiterun; when the city is conquered, he secures Stormcloak control by stationing &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; as the Jarl there. To expand the amount of Stormcloak-controlled territory in Skyrim, Ulfric sends the Dragonborn to the various other Imperial-controlled &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt; to free them in preparation for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;.\nThane of Eastmarch.\nUpon completing a personal task for Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, the Dragonborn is offered a place in his court as &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. However, a Thane needs to be known by the Jarl's subjects and therefore the Dragonborn must complete a series of tasks for the people of Eastmarch. To become Thane, the Dragonborn must purchase &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, a previously condemned estate in Windhelm, and have completed \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFate.\nUlfric can be killed during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War%20Quests\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn chooses to side with the Empire. During \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Windhelm\"&gt;Battle for Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn storms his throne room, where a final battle ensues. During the battle, Ulfric uses his Thu'um against the attackers, the shout &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0being among those in his arsenal.\u00a0When defeated, Ulfric\u00a0requests that the Dragonborn kill him, as \"it will make for a better song.\" Upon his death, he can be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; as a specter, regretting his decision to fight \"a doomed struggle against fate,\" instead of turning his attention on the return of the &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;World-Eater&lt;/a&gt;, as the souls of the Nords that died in the Civil War only made Alduin stronger.\nAlternatively, Ulfric can become the unofficial High King of Skyrim after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Solitude\"&gt;Battle for Solitude&lt;/a&gt;,\" if the Dragonborn chooses to side with the Stormcloaks during the war. Ulfric will help in the battle, and will be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt; in the final scene. Surprisingly, he does not expatriate &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt; from Solitude after the battle is won, despite her support for the Empire; she swears fealty to him and continues to live in the city even after the war has ended. After the battle, Ulfric returns to the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; in Windhelm.\nEquipment.\nIt is possible, after completing the Legion questline, to obtain Ulfric's apparel after his death. His apparel is comprised of &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%27s%20Clothes\"&gt;Ulfric's Clothes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%27s%20Boots\"&gt;Ulfric's Boots&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%27s%20Bracers\"&gt;Ulfric's Bracers&lt;/a&gt;."}

He asks them to return tomorrow and says he will bring new information.\nAfter returning in 24 hours, Hosidus says to meet with the Count outside, west of town at 2 AM. Head out to the marker on the map (between the wine fields and the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Mine\"&gt;Cursed Mine&lt;/a&gt;) and wait until 2 AM. At this point there will be an ambush by Mercator who says that the Count isn't coming and they are going to kill the Hero. Mercator and two other necromancers, &lt;a href=\"Arterion\"&gt;Arterion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mondrar%20Henim\"&gt;Mondrar Henim&lt;/a&gt; attack. Just as the enemies are beaten, the Count will intervene at the end of the fight.\nHe will run to the Hero so don't mistake him for a necromancer. However, if he is hit he will say he's on their side or he will just collapse and then stand up in a few seconds. It turns out that there really is no book and this was just false information given to the Hero to try to bring the necromancers out of hiding.

He is the main antagonist of the expansion, and is noted as the chief enemy of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. Called \"the unfeathered\" because of his wings, he was an immortal sorcerer, favored of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and the son of an &lt;a href=\"Et%27ada\"&gt;Et'ada&lt;/a&gt;, who is noted as being a god of a previous &lt;a href=\"kalpa\"&gt;kalpa&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nUmaril is described as \"half-&lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt;,\" with a god as a father, which may have involved Pelinal and &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; in some way. He, along with other Ayleids of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;, and was named the champion of her &lt;a href=\"Aurorans\"&gt;Aurorans&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle with Pelinal and death.\nHe was the first of Pelinal's foes to challenge him directly, and commanded armies of Aurorans to harry the Whitestrake as he moved south following conquests in the west of Cyrodiil. The two faced each other during the siege of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, despite Umaril's preference for ranged combat. Pelinal ultimately slew Umaril, but the remaining Aurorans and the Ayleid kings dismembered him in the aftermath of their battle.\nHis return foretold.\n&lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; took up Pelinal's severed head after the battle with Umaril, and spoke with it for several hours. With the \"foresight of death,\" Pelinal's head later told the Man-Bull that Umaril would return now that he could no longer protect Cyrodiil.\nReturn.\nUmaril returned to life during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, as Pelinal foretold. It is speculated he could do this because he had bound himself to the &lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;, Meridia's realm of Oblivion. His specific goals were unclear, but they appear to be based around striking back at the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, who he refers to as \"mortal gods\".\nUmaril began systematically defiling chapels of the Divines across Cyrodiil with the Aurorans, striking at Anvil from &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;.

Continue to Umaril's location.\nAlternative way.\nThe\u00a0Hero should be able to sneak-run past the Aurorans. The knights will still fight the Aurorans, just push the button in the first room and sneak to the exit as fast as possible. In the next area\u00a0destroy the orb and continue to Umaril's location. The two final Aurorans will follow the Hero\u00a0even if they cannot be seen, but they will not attack in that case, and will disappear once Umaril is reached. The fight with Umaril cannot be avoided.\nFighting Umaril.\nFrom that moment the Aurorans and the Hero's\u00a0Knights will disappear and they will be left to fight Umaril on their own.\nUmaril\u00a0appears on top of the stairs. Kill him, then use the spell the Blessing of Talos to gain access to his daedric plane. This is in fact the clouds over the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and Umaril's tactics have not changed. Defeat Umaril again.

He will explain that after the battle they entered the last room and found both the Knight commander and Umaril dead on the ground. After seeing the commander dead, the surviving knights decided to keep the death a secret to prevent any threats from taking advantage of this moment. After being told Umaril is dead in both body and spirit, he will lead the way outside to inform the other knights.\nWhen outside, Thedret will tell the knight the good news, that Umaril is dead and the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; have restored the commander to life.

It ultimately broke free of Vile's will, creating a body for itself but remaining trapped within Vile's Realm. In order to escape, it forged a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;, providing the power necessary to create the floating city Umbriel.\nHistory.\nAs the Umbra Sword.\nThe Umbra Sword was created by &lt;a href=\"Naenra%20Waerr\"&gt;Naenra Waerr&lt;/a&gt; to trap souls, at &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;'s request. As part of the creation process, Vile embued it with part of his essence. This essence would ultimately overtake the wielders and become the driving force in their lives. Several wielders noted that their lives became nothing other than a quest to use the sword in constant battle. Some even named themselves after the sword, possibly foreshadowing its eventual independence.\nOver time, either through the process of trapping so many souls or by the design of Vile or Waerr, the sword gained its own sentience. Umbra somehow managed to cut a piece from Clavicus Vile himself. He injured the &lt;a href=\"daedric%20prince\"&gt;daedric prince&lt;/a&gt; so badly that Umbra became almost as strong as Vile. Vile circumscribed his plane against Umbra, so that it could not escape from his influence.\nAs an independent spirit.\nShortly Vile received the Umbra Sword from the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, Umbra escaped the sword and stole some of Vile's power, greatly weakening the Daedric Prince. The Umbra spirit fled with the sword to one of the cities in Vile's realm to avoid being trapped again. After the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt; that kept the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; exploded, it was catapulted into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. It ended up in Vile's realm, probably because of the Prince's joy for souls. Umbra took advantage of the situation, and he tossed the sword through the rift the ingenium came through. The sword fell to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, and it was recovered by &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul Sathil&lt;/a&gt;, who went mad as soon as he touched the blade.\nUmbra took &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; captive. Vuhon promised him that if he spared his life, he would build a new ingenium, capable of escaping even Vile\u2019s circumscription. Umbra agreed, so Vuhon built a second ingenium that allowed Umbra's city, &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt;, to escape into &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. They merged into one being, Vuhon/Umbra could control Umbriel, while the energies Umbra had stolen from Vile powered the Ingenium. They drifted through many realms and places beyond even Oblivion.\nVuhon made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; to summon &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. However, they could not leave the city because of Vile\u2019s circumscription. Umbra and Vuhon tried to get the city to the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; to complete its separation from Vile. However, he decided to take the city north into Morrowind to find the Umbra Sword, as it could be used to destroy both Umbra and the Ingenium.\nUltimately, &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Attrebus%20Mede\"&gt;Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; were able to find the Umbra Sword, and use it to destroy the Ingenium. Vuhon's body twisted, deformed, grew blacker. Umbra, who was now in full control of Vuhon's body, strangulated Sul. Yet, after some time Umbra (the sword) finished destroying the Ingenium, and Umbra (the spirit) was trapped in the blade. Clavicus Vile possessed Attrebus, and he wielded Umbra against Sul. With his last breath, Sul grabbed the hilt of Umbra and pulled himself up the blade, and with everything left in him he struck Attrebus in the jaw. Attrebus released the sword, and Umbra and Sul seemed to melt together with the Ingenium into a dark smoke with a heart of lightning."}

The sword possessed the ability to ensnare the soul\u00a0of any living creature it encountered, trapping that soul within a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;. While this was the sword's primary enchantment, it also seemed to possess a form of sentience, that was either implemented by Naenra herself or was developed over time.\nHistory.\nWhen her creation was discovered, Naenra was slain, though she managed to hide the sword before her execution. Eventually, the Umbra Sword would be found, and thus begin its long history of bloodshed. At length, the sword came into the possession of an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;, a warrior who in taking the sword also decided to take its name, calling himself &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;, after his weapon. It is unknown if this was the first instance of a warrior taking the sword's name, yet it is highly plausible that it was not. The Orc Umbra went on to become one of the fiercest warriors of his day, slaying any and all enemies that challenged him. Eventually he became weary of his success, wishing for nothing more than a noble warrior's death. He hid for a time near the city of &lt;a href=\"Suran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;, in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. There he was discovered by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, who consented to duel him and grant him his warrior's death. Somehow, through time, the sword ended up in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; woman's hands.\nPowers.\nThe Umbra Sword is capable of capturing a creature's soul upon killing it, provided that there is an appropriate Soul Gem to capture the soul in. Beyond this, it would seem that the sword gains some strength from the souls of those it kills, regardless of the presence of a gem.\nThe two individuals known to have used the sword after its creation both took the name Umbra after the blade. It would seem that the sword exerts some power over its wielder, influencing them to kill in an effort to satiate the blade's thirst for souls. In the case of the Orc warrior, it appears he was able to break the sword's hold on him and tire of his career of killing. In the case of Lenwin, however, the sword consumed her almost completely.\nUsing &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with Umbra makes the pair a soul capturing team to behold.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbra%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Orc named Umbra challenges the Nerevarine in a duel, in order to fullfil his wish of a having the death of a warrior. After he is killed, the blade can be looted from his body.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Museum\"&gt;The Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , this sword can be donated or sold to the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Artifacts\"&gt;Museum of Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Godsreach\"&gt;Godsreach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Torasa%20Aram\"&gt;Torasa Aram&lt;/a&gt;, the curator of the museum, offers a sum of 30'000 for the sword, which is the maximum amount of gold she is willing to pay for one artifact."}

Umbriel existed within a bubble of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, and was described as an upside down cone. Within lay a conical valley filled with a water lake called the Sump, warrens cut into the valley slops for workers and lesser denizens, ever more splendid palaces for the Lords, and at the very tops of the city the home of the highest Lords. On the rim at the very top lay a thick forest of trees very similar to the Hist. The Lord of Umbriel is named &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;.\nUmbriel's denizens were beings that grew within the sump from worms which grew in cocoons until they resembled Humans or Mer, or other lifeforms encountered by Umbriel as it traversed the various realms of existence. When \"born,\" Umbrielians appeared as adults and were assigned their lot in life. Some became Skraws who gathered food grown within the Sump, while others became Kitchen workers for the numerable kitchens around the city. Other Umbrielians would go on to become Lords controlling weaker servants, whose movement around the city was tightly controlled. These Lords were known for their varied appetites, and were fed on cuisine ranging from physical food to the energy of captured souls. Many of the denizens have no idea of the outside of Umbriel, and cannot leave even if they wished: Due to the bubble of Oblivion that Umbriel existed within, any being connected with Umbriel would begin to lose cohesion a certain distance from the city.\nThere is an exception to this rule, however. The island sends down insectoid creatures called Larvae, which dissipate into black mist before taking control of humanoid creatures and using the corpses as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army, which can affect the world in a way Umbriel cannot. The souls of these victims are captured by using thick \"gossamer-like\" fibers. Some of the souls are sent to the Kitchens for the use of the residents, although most are sent to the Ingenium to keep the island aloft. Umbriel first appeared in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; 49 years after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally powered partly by the power of &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;, a being that stole a great chunk of power from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "1003735", "revid": "26213507", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1003735", "title": "Umbriel Crisis", "text": "The Umbriel Crisis was an event that threatened Tamriel during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; were the most affected provinces, although &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; was also involved in the conflict.\nBackground.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance, the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt; was built to keep the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; afloat. The Ingenium needed &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; to be powered. At first, it consumed as much as ten souls per day. Criminals were used to power the Ingenium, but eventually, a &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; discovered that appropriate souls could power it for months. He selected a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt; to power the Ingenium. Ilzheven's man, &lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt;, thought that Vuhon had selected her because she loved him instead of Vuhon. Sul tried to save Ilzheven, but he destroyed the Ingenium and killed Ilzheven.\nThe explosion hurled Vuhon and Sul to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. The ministry crashed into &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, triggering the events of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;. Vuhon and Sul ended up in &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;'s realm. A being named &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; took them captive. Umbra had become an independent being from the eponymous sword, and he had somehow managed to cut a piece from Clavicus Vile himself, stealing a lot of power from him. Vile circumscribed his realm against Umbra so that he could not escape. When Vuhon and Sul came to his realm, Umbra took advantage of the situation and threw the blade through the rift they had entered from.\nVuhon made a deal with Umbra, he offered him to build a new Ingenium so that Umbra and him could escape from Vile's realm. Sul managed to get away from Umbra, he wandered through the different &lt;a href=\"realms%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;realms of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; trying to return to Tamriel. Since Umbra could not leave Vile's realm, Vuhon managed to wrap Umbriel, Umbra's city, in a Oblivion bubble. Vuhon and Umbra merged into one being who could control Umbriel at their will. The only thing Vuhon/Umbra, henceforth called Lord Umbriel, needed to break free from Vile was to go to Tamriel in their bubble and use the power of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; to free them.\nLord Umbriel made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; to summon Umbriel into Tamriel and allow him to use the power of the White-Gold Tower. In exchange, Hierem could overthrow &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20I\"&gt;Titus Mede I&lt;/a&gt; and become the new emperor. Hierem made a trip to &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt; and performed a ritual in the &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; of the city to summon Umbriel. The &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; allowed him to perfom the ritual as long as Umbriel only killed non-Argonians and Lukiul (the assimilated).\nSummoning.\nUmbriel, the flying island, was summoned in the southwest of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. It approached Lilmoth through the sea. The flying city was followed by an undead army that murdered the population and destroyed the city. The deaths supplied Umbriel with the souls needed to power the Ingenium. One of the only survivors of the massacre were &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg%20Ho%C3%AFnart\"&gt;Anna\u00efg Ho\u00efnart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt;. They drank levitation potions that brought them to Umbriel. Anna\u00efg was decided to save Tamriel from the incoming threat, so she sent a message to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Attrebus\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt; warning him about Umbriel. Anna\u00efg gained the trust of the Umbrielians and worked in the kitchens of Umbriel in order to keep Prince Attrebus informed about anything she could discover about Umbriel. She eventually was promoted to chef, even preparing a meal for Lord Umbriel himself.\nAmbush on Prince Attrebus.\nAttrebus Mede was a hero to the people. When he received the message he informed his father about Umbriel. Titus had already received reports about the flying city, but according to the reports, it was heading to Morrowind. He would not send an expedition to stop it unless it threatened the Empire.\nAttrebus did not pay attention to his father, so he secretly prepared his men for an expedition. In their march to Umbriel, they were ambushed by a criminal organization hired by Hierem to kill the prince. However, &lt;a href=\"Radhasa\"&gt;Radhasa&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the ambush decided to keep Attrebus alive and sell him to a eccentric &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. During their journey, Radhasa revealed to Attrebus that all his guards knew he was a mediocre warrior, and certainly not a hero. His father had risen him to believe he was a legendary hero, and Attrebus had believed so.\nUmbra and Vivec City.\nSul, who after serving &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; had managed to return to Tamriel, received a vision from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Azura warned him about Umbriel and hinted him to find Attrebus, so that he could avenge Ilzeheven. Sul rescued Attrebus from Radhasa. Sul explained to the prince all he knew about Umbriel. He expected that Umbriel would head to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; to recover Umbra's sword, the only artifact capable of defeating Lord Umbriel. In order to beat Umbriel to Vivec City, they had to take a shortcut trough &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hircine's Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. They were aided by the &lt;a href=\"F%27aashe%20clan\"&gt;F'aashe clan&lt;/a&gt;, who sacrificed so that Sul and Attrebus could escape from &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce in Vivec City, Sul searched for Umbra. He encountered Ilzheven's ghost, who warned him that a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; who wore a signet ring with a draugr had already taken the sword. Umbriel arrived at Vivec City, and the zombies captured both Attrebus and Sul. They talked to Vuhon, who revealed to them that he was now heading to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Sul tried to kill Vuhon, but it was useless without Umbra. He opened a door to &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;, and Attrebus and him escaped from the flying city.\nSolstheim.\nAttrebus and Sul were healed by Malacath. Sul deduced that the Dunmer who had taken Umbra must be in &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. They convinced Malacath to send them to Solstheim. They discovered that the man who recovered Umbra was &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul Sathil&lt;/a&gt;. He went mad as soon as he touched the blade, so his father had to lock him up in the depths of their castle. Attrebus and Sul had to kill Elhul. Once they owned the sword, they were summoned by Clavicus Vile to his realm.\nClavicus demanded them to return him his sword. Yet, they needed it to defeat Vuhon and stop Umbriel. They made a bargain with the prince to allow them to defeat Umbra and return him the power he had stolen from him. In exchange, Vile demanded a soul, but Attrebus refused to the additional requirement. After all, Vile needed their help as much as they needed him.\nCyrodiil.\nUmbriel razed everything in its path. The fallen men and women were resurrected as zombies, thickening Umbriel's army of undead. &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; was sieged by the zombies, but the city guard and the legionaries that had withdrawn to the city opened a gap in the enemy line so that the citizens could evacuate.\nOnce the citizens evacuated the city, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Arges\"&gt;Captain Arges&lt;/a&gt; ordered to split into two groups, one north and one south of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Road\"&gt;Blue Road&lt;/a&gt;, and hope the main army of zombies did not come after both of them.\nThe zombies headed to the Imperial City. &lt;a href=\"General%20Takar\"&gt;General Takar&lt;/a&gt; lead the last attempt to stop Umbriel from attacking the Imperial City. He commanded five thousand men, mostly mounted infantry and mages, and eight siege engines. He launched an attack on Umbriel, half of the legion suddenly left the ground, along with the engines, and flew toward the city. The attack was repelled by flying creatures, and Takar retreated to the Imperial City.\n&lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20the%20Imperial%20City%20%284E%2049%29\"&gt;Siege of the Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nVile sent Attrebus and Sul to his shrine in Cyrodiil. The approached the Imperial City by boat. They were captured by Hirem's agents. Inspector &lt;a href=\"Colin%20Vineben\"&gt;Colin Vineben&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; who had been tasked to investigate Attrebus' pretended murder and who discovered that Hierem was involved in the Umbriel Crisis, received a report that claimed that Prince Attrebus had been seen at the waterfront. He was abducted, taken away with a bag on his head.\nColin and &lt;a href=\"Letine%20Arese\"&gt;Letine Arese&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of the Emperor who had worked in Hierem's ministry for ten years and gained his trust, broke in Hierem's chambers. They rescued Attrebus and Sul, and they designed a plan to stop Vuhon and Hierem.\nHierem was finalizing the plan to attack the Imperial City with Vuhon in Umbriel. Attrebus and Sul waited for him in the sigil he used to teleport. When Hierem came back to his chambers, Attrebus and Sul were teleported to Umbriel.\nColin and Letine fought Hierem, who died butchered by a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; summoned by Arese. Arese stabbed Colin with her knife and she headed to a room that was in the very axis of the White-Gold Tower. She had discovered that Hierem intended to become a god draining the power of the tower and using the power of the souls in Umbriel. Letine had suffered for ten years, and she wanted to something in exchange, to feel safe again. Colin recovered from the stab and stopped Arese from performing the ritual. He hit Letine in the eye with the knife he had nailed in his body, ending with her life. Colin died of his wounds shortly after.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial soldiers&lt;/a&gt; made a massive push toward the northwest side of the city. That was where the enemy was massed most deeply, and had begun actively trying to break through the gate that led to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;. It was also where Umbriel would arrive, if it continued on the course it was presently following. The left flank collapsed, and the zombies threw themselves on the city wall, building ladders with their bodies.\nAnna\u00efg poisoned the trees in Umbriel to weaken Vuhon. Sul tried to use Umbra on Vuhon, but the sword did not seem to work. Anna\u00efg warned Sul and Attrebus that Lord Umbriel's soul was in the Ingenium. Attrebus wielded Umbra to destroy the Ingenium. Umbra briefly possessed Vuhon's body before being trapped in the sword. Just then, Clavicus Vile possessed Attrebus, Vile demanded a soul for their bargain. Sul sacrificed himself to save Attrebus from Vile. Umbra and Sul melted together with the Ingenium.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Ingenium was destroyed and Vuhon was defeated, the zombies became inanimate. Attrebus spared Vuhon's life so that Mere-Glim could avoid Umbriel from falling into the Imperial City. Glim lead Umbriel into the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;Realm of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttrebus gave credit of the victory to &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;The College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;, who had cooperated to stop Umbriel, in order to start their reconciliation and have their political support now that Hierem was dead."}

You're speaking to Ulfric Stormcloak, the true High King.\"\nLokir: \"Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? You're the leader of the rebellion. But if they've captured you... Oh gods, where are they taking us?\"\nRalof: \"I don't know where we're going, but Sovngarde awaits.\"\nLokir: \"No, this can't be happening.

Divines, please help me.\"\nRalof: \"Look at him, General Tullius, the Military Governor. And it looks like the Thalmor are with him. Damn elves. I bet they had something to do with this. This is Helgen. I used to be sweet on a girl from here. Wonder if Vilod is still making that mead with juniper berries mixed in. Funny, when I was a boy, Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe.\"\nHaming: \"Who are they, daddy? Where are they going?\"\nTorolf: \"You need to go inside, little cub.\"\nHaming: \"Why? I want to watch the soldiers.\"\nTorolf: \"Inside the house.

Who are you?\"\nCharacter creation.\nCharacter creation is operationally similar to but incorporated a greater level of detail and customization. The Dragonborn's race, weight, gender, and facial structure can be determined via value sliders. The race and gender of the Dragonborn will occasionally affect how the people of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt; react to the them.\n&lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt;'s comment when he calls the Dragonborn will change based on the race chosen:\nExecutions.\nHadvar: \"Captain. What should we do? He/She's not on the list.\"\nCaptain: \"Forget the list. He/She goes to the block.\"\nHadvar: \"By your orders, Captain.

Carry on.\"\nCaptain: \"Yes, General Tullius. Give them their last rites.\"\nPriestess of Arkay: \"As we commend your souls to Aetherius, blessings of the Eight Divines upon you, for you are the salt and earth of Nirn, our beloved...\"\nStormcloak Soldier: \"For the love of Talos, shut up and let's get this over with.\"\nPriestess of Arkay: \"As you wish.\"\nStormcloak Soldier: \"\"Come on, I haven't got all morning. My ancestors are smiling at me, Imperials. Can you say the same?\"\n\"[With those last defiant words to Tullius, the Imperial Captain, and the Legionnaires, the Stormcloak is beheaded by the executioner. The Imperial Captain then shoves his lifeless body off to the side of the chopping block]\"\nStormcloak: \"You Imperial bastards!\"\nVilod: \"Justice!\"\nIngrid: \"Death to the Stormcloaks!\"\nRalof: \"As fearless in death as he was in life.\"\nCaptain: \"\"Next, the [player race]!\" (\"Next, the Nord in the rags!\" if the player is a Nord; or \"Next, the renegade from Cyrodiil!\" if the player is an Imperial; or \"Next, the lizard!\" if the player is an Argonian; or \"Next, the cat!\" if the player is a Khajiit)\n&lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Attack&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust before the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Headsman\"&gt;Imperial Headsman&lt;/a&gt; has the opportunity to decapitate the Dragonborn and end the game before it begins, Alduin arrives and disrupts the execution, raining meteors and fire down upon the town.\nNow, Alduin roars for the second time, drawing attention from Tullius, Ulfric, and everyone else again while unsettling Hadvar, but the Imperial Captain remains unfazed.\nHadvar: \"There it is again. Did you hear that?\"\nCaptain: \"I said, next prisoner!\"\nHadvar: \"To the block, prisoner. Nice and easy.\"\nThe Dragonborn approaches the chopping block. As they kneel down and place their head into position to be sliced off by the headsman's axe, looking up at the headsman as he raises his axe to execute them, Alduin's third roar occurs, and he makes an appearance atop the tower, flying into view from behind the nearby mountains before touching down on the tower and launching his attack, causing the headsman to stumble forward right when he was about to swing his axe down on the Dragonborn's neck.\nTullius: \"What in Oblivion is that?\"\nCaptain: \"Sentries! What do you see?\"\nImperial: \"\"It's in the clouds!\"\n\"[Weapons are heard being drawn as all eyes turn to look at Alduin]\"\nStormcloak: \"Dragon!\"\nAlduin: \"[Meteor-shower shout]\"\nHeadsman: \"\"Hunh...\"\n\"[Alduin then unleashes his &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; shout, killing the headsman and throwing the Dragonborn away from the chopping block in the process]\"\nAlduin: \nTullius: \"Don't just stand there! Kill that thing! Guards, get the townspeople to safety!\"\nRalof: \"Hey, [race-dependent comment]. Get up! Come on, the gods won't give us another chance!\"\nWith the execution halted and the town in chaos, the Dragonborn escapes execution with hands still bound. In the carnage, Ralof calls to him from a nearby watchtower, where he and Ulfric Stormcloak are hiding with several other Stormcloak prisoners.\nRalof: \"This way!\"\nRalof: \"This way, come on!\"\nRalof: \"In here!\"\nRalof: \"Over here!\"\nImperial Soldier: \"\"What in the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; is this thing?!\"\nImperial Soldier: \"Yeargh!\" (hit by meteor)\"\nImperial Soldier: \"Keep your eyes on it!\"\nImperial Soldier: \"How in Oblivion do we kill this thing?!\"\nImperial Soldier: \"It's still coming!\"\nImperial Soldier: \"\"By &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;! Nothing kills it!\"\"\nImperial Soldier: \"Die! For the love of the gods, die!\"\nOnce the Dragonborn enters the watchtower, Ralof closes the door and the soldiers recuperate and tend to their wounded. Ulfric Stormcloak removes his gag.\nRalof: \"Jarl Ulfric! What is that thing? Could the legends be true?\"\nUlfric: \"\"Legends don't burn down villages.\"\n\"[Thundering explosion from outside]\"\nUlfric: \"We need to move. Now!\"\nRalof: \"Up through the tower, let's go!\"\nStormcloak: \"They're hurt, but they'll live. Another second out there with the dragon, and they'd both be dead...\"\nRalof: \"Let's go! With me, up the tower!\"\nStormcloak: \"We just need to move some of these rocks to clear the way!\"\nAlduin bashes through the wall next to the staircase as the Dragonborn is ascending it, killing another Stormcloak in the process, then leaves. Ralof follows the Dragonborn and looks out of the hole.\nAlduin: \nRalof: \"See the inn on the other side? Jump through the roof and keep going! Go! We'll follow when we can!\"\nAfter jumping out of the hole and into the ruins of an adjacent inn, the Dragonborn finds Helgen heavily damaged, with many buildings destroyed and burning. After the Dragonborn runs into the street, an Imperial soldier, &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt;, will tell the Dragonborn to follow him to safety.\nHadvar: \"Haming, you need to get over here. Now! That a boy. You're doing great. Torolf! Gods... Everyone get back!\"\nAlduin: \"\"Yol...Toor...Shul!\"\n\"[Alduin uses his &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; to incinerate Torolf, killing him instantly]\"\nHadvar: \"\"Still alive, prisoner? Keep close to me if you want to stay that way. Gunnar, take care of the &lt;a href=\"Haming\"&gt;boy&lt;/a&gt;. I have to find General Tullius and join their defense.\"\"\nGunnar: \"Gods guide you, Hadvar.\"\nHadvar: \"Stay close to the wall!\"\nAlduin will now land on the wall above the Dragonborn. Hadvar will then lead the Dragonborn to the &lt;a href=\"Helgen%20Keep\"&gt;Helgen Keep&lt;/a&gt;. At the keep's entrance, Ralof catches up.\nAlduin: \"Yol...Toor...Shul!\"\nHadvar: \"Quickly, follow me!\"\nTullius: \"Hadvar! Into the keep, soldier, we're leaving!\"\nHadvar: \"\"It's you and me, prisoner. Stay close!\"\n\"[If the Dragonborn hesitates and stays with the General, his troops, and a dying Vilod...]\"\nTullius: \"\"Run, you idiot!\"\n\"[The Dragonborn and Hadvar approach Helgen Keep, only to find Ralof having made it there himself, having broken off from Ulfric and the other Stormcloaks to escape alone]\"\nHadvar: \"Ralof! You damned traitor. Out of my way!\"\nRalof: \"We're escaping, Hadvar. You're not stopping us this time.\"\nHadvar: \"Fine. I hope that dragon takes you all to Sovngarde.\"\nRalof: \"You! Come on, into the keep!\"\nAt that point, either Hadvar or Ralof\u00a0must be chosen to accompany the Dragonborn the rest of the way. The choice will create some minor changes in the story during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; questline; however, this does not affect the side that can be taken in the war later in the game.\nIf Ralof is followed:\nRalof: \"Through here. Let's go!\"\nIf Hadvar is followed:\nHadvar: \"Quick, I can cut you loose inside the keep.\"\nHadvar: \"Come on! We need to get inside!\"\nAlduin: \nThe Dragonborn will still be cut loose regardless of who is followed. As Alduin speaks, he can be seen grabbing one of the Imperial Legionnaire archers in a &lt;a href=\"Kill%20Camera\"&gt;Kill Camera&lt;/a&gt; finisher, tossing them into the air to leave their body to crash to the ground afterwards.\nHelgen Keep.\nThe only main difference at the beginning of the game between following Ralof and following Hadvar is that if Hadvar is followed, the Dragonborn gets light armor, but if Ralof is followed, the Dragonborn gets heavy armor (which is separately obtainable later), but can then double back to where he would have entered the keep with Hadvar to acquire light armor as well.\nFollowing Ralof.\nUpon entering the keep, the Dragonborn and Ralof discover the body of a dead Stormcloak, &lt;a href=\"Gunjar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Gunjar&lt;/a&gt;. After freeing the Dragonborn from their bindings, Ralof instructs the Dragonborn to take Gunjar's gear, as he will not be needing it. While it is being equipped, Ralof examines the doors. He discovers one door is locked, and the other cannot be opened from the inside. Luckily, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Captain\"&gt;Imperial Captain&lt;/a&gt; from the executions and an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; soldier will come through and open the door from the other side (if the Dragonborn is seen before the gate is open, the captain will be alert and shout \"It's the Stormcloak prisoners!\"). Once they open the door, they must be killed in order to recover the key to the other gate from their bodies. Also, a full set of heavy &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be taken from the Imperial Captain's corpse. The newly opened path leads them down the stairs. As they walk down the hallway, the dragon's activities above will cause the ceiling to fall, forcing them to divert through a door on their left that leads into a store room, where two more Imperial soldiers gathering supplies.\nAfter defeating the soldiers, Ralof advises the Dragonborn to go through the barrels to find potions. There is time for a thorough search of the area and all containers and to become familiar with Skyrim's controls and menus. A search will find a barrel with &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; potion over near the table with bread, tankards, and a potion of minor healing. Between the barrel of potions and the cabinet, there is a crate containing five &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Warbler%20Egg\"&gt;rock warbler eggs&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. Taking any of these things is optional, which means the Dragonborn does not need to take them in order to proceed.\nContinuing down, a battle between an Imperial &lt;a href=\"Torturer\"&gt;torturer&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Torturer%27s%20Assistant\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt; against two Stormcloaks is discovered. If either Stormcloak survives the combat, the following conversation will be heard:\nRalof: \"Was Jarl Ulfric with you?\"\nStormcloak: \"No, I haven't seen him since the dragon showed up.\"\nRegardless of the battle's outcome, Ralof will then look around the room.\nRalof: \"[walks up to the center cage] Wait a second. It looks like there's something in this cage. [pause] Ah, its locked. See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need that gold when we get out.\"\nRalof gives 12 picks to pick open the cage, which contains a dead mage who is wearing a &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Hood\"&gt;novice hood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Robes\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt;. Along with this, he has 25 and two potions of minor magicka. Next to him are a few &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the locked cells can be picked for lockpicking experience. In the armory there are two lockpicks, an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron shield&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Mace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron mace&lt;/a&gt; and a couple of books. On a table outside the cage is a knapsack containing four lockpicks and some gold. Next to it are \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;The Book of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\" and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron dagger&lt;/a&gt;. The torturer who was killed also has a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel dagger&lt;/a&gt;, the only one in the keep.\nBeyond is a hallway lined with cells. One of these cells contains a skeleton, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, and a coin purse. After that, a room is entered with prisoners in cages. All of them are deceased, and there are three more skeletons, all of which also carry bone meal, or on rare occasions, may be empty. They may have gold on them as well. In one of the cages, there is a dead Stormcloak wearing &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Robes\"&gt;ragged robes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, a natural cave is entered, filled with soldiers guarding it for General Tullius. There are few Imperial soldiers in the cavern, along with another soldier wearing &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt;. The archers all are positioned dangerously close to a pool of flammable oil, which can be set on fire using the &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; spell. After killing them, any surviving Stormcloak Soldiers will stay behind, waiting for Ulfric Stormcloak, wishing Ralof and the Dragonborn good luck and asking that &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; guide them to safety.\nNext is a drawbridge that connects to another part of the cave that is not occupied by the Imperials. Shortly after arriving in this cave, Alduin will roar, destroying the bridge behind the Dragonborn. When following Ralof, there is a skeleton near the passage leading towards the cavern that leads to &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;. Near the skeleton is an iron dagger, a potion of minor healing, and a coin purse. The next cavern consists of two to four of the smaller variety of frostbite spiders, plus two larger ones (not to be mistaken for &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;giant frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;) that will drop down from the ceiling. &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Venom\"&gt;Frostbite venom&lt;/a&gt; can be collected from their corpses. There are also &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Egg%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt; in the egg sacks and &lt;a href=\"skeever%20tail\"&gt;skeever tail&lt;/a&gt;s in the hanging web sacks, as well as some gold or a lockpick or two in the hanging desiccate corpse. Once the spiders are defeated, the Dragonborn and Ralof exit through another passageway.\nIn the next cave, a potion of health is at the fire at the other side of the water. There is also another iron dagger. The potion cannot be seen from a distance, because it is too close to the fire. After getting the potion, Ralof tells the Dragonborn to stop at the cart, as there is a &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; on the other side. He suggests &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; by, but he also gives the Dragonborn a &lt;a href=\"Long%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Long Bow&lt;/a&gt; and twelve &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron arrows&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn chooses to fight the bear, its damage will be reduced by 80% to make the battle easier. In the cart next to the Dragonborn are two bottles of &lt;a href=\"Alto%20Wine\"&gt;Alto wine&lt;/a&gt; and a coin purse. In front of the cart, near the skeleton, is an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron helmet&lt;/a&gt; and a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Mead\"&gt;Black-Briar Mead&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the bear is an exit to the cave. Upon exiting, Alduin can be seen flying overhead. Ralof will direct the Dragonborn to his sister, &lt;a href=\"Gerdur\"&gt;Gerdur&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. At this point the Dragonborn can choose to follow Ralof to Riverwood, or split up and find their own way. If the Dragonborn decides to split up, some unique dialogue can be missed. If they choose to follow Ralof, a bandit and three wolves will attack.\nFollowing Hadvar.\nAfter entering the keep with Hadvar, he unbinds the Dragonborn and tells them to look for equipment. In the corner of the room there is a warden's chest where an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron sword&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Armor%20%28Armor%20Piece%29\"&gt;Imperial light armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Boots\"&gt;Imperial light boots&lt;/a&gt;, and a Helgen Keep key can be found, in a chest in front of one of the beds an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Light%20Helmet\"&gt;Imperial light helmet&lt;/a&gt; can be found. After opening the door with the key, pulling the chain will open the wooden gate. Behind the gate there are two hostile Stormcloaks. After defeating them there is another door, leading to the stairs. As they walk down the hallway, the dragon's activities above will cause the ceiling to fall, forcing them to divert through a door on their left that leads into a store room, where two more Stormcloaks are gathering supplies.\nWhen the fight is won Hadvar advises the Dragonborn to go through the barrels to find potions. There is time for a thorough search of the area and all containers and to become familiar with Skyrim's controls and menus. A search will find a barrel with &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; potion over near the table with bread, tankards, and a potion of minor healing. Between the barrel of potions and the cabinet, there is a crate containing five &lt;a href=\"Rock%20Warbler%20Egg\"&gt;rock warbler eggs&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;. Taking any of these things is optional, which means the Dragonborn does not need to take them in order to proceed.\nGoing down, there is a torture room, where the &lt;a href=\"Torturer\"&gt;torturer&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Torturer%27s%20Assistant\"&gt;assistant&lt;/a&gt; are battling the two Stormcloaks. If the torturer survives, the following dialogue will occur:\nTorturer: \"You fellows happened along just in time. These boys seemed a bit upset at how I've been entertaining their comrades.\"\nHadvar: \"Don't you even know what's going on? A dragon is attacking Helgen!\"\nTorturer: \"A dragon? Please. Don't make up nonsense. [pause] Although, come to think of it, I did hear some odd noises coming from over there.\"\nHadvar: \"Come with us. We need to get out of here.\"\nTorturer: \"You have no authority over me, boy.\"\nHadvar: \"Didn't you hear me? I said the keep is under attack!\"\nIf the Torturer's Assistant is alive, he will say at this point: \"Forget the old man. I'll come with you.\" If not, his line is skipped. Either way, the conversation continues:\nHadvar: \"Wait a second. Looks like there's something in this cage.\"\nTorturer: \"Don't bother with that. Lost the key ages ago. Poor fellow screamed for weeks.\"\nHadvar: \"See if you can get it open with some picks. We'll need everything we can get.\"\nTorturer: \"Sure, take all my things. Please.\"\nHadvar: \"Grab what you can, and let's go.\"\nTorturer: \"There's no way out that way, you know.\"\nThere is a dead mage in the central cage that wears a &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Hood\"&gt;novice hood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Robes\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt; and carries 25 and two potions of minor magicka. There is also more &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;septims&lt;/a&gt; on the floor of the cage, and a &lt;a href=\"Sparks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sparks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt;. The cage (and other prison doors) can be picked open with the &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; skill. In the armory there are two lockpicks, an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Shield%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron shield&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Mace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron mace&lt;/a&gt; and a couple of books. On a table outside the cage is a knapsack containing four lockpicks and some gold. Next to the knapsack are \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;The Book of the Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\" and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond the torture room is a hallway lined with cells. One of these cells contains a skeleton, &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Meal\"&gt;bone meal&lt;/a&gt;, and a coin purse. After that, a room is entered with prisoners in cages. All of them are deceased, and there are three more skeletons, all of which also carry bone meal, or on rare occasions, may be empty. They may have gold on them as well. In one of the cages, there is a dead Stormcloak wearing &lt;a href=\"Ragged%20Robes\"&gt;ragged robes&lt;/a&gt;.\nEventually, a natural cave is entered, filled with about ten more Stormcloaks to kill. Some of them are near a pool of oil which can be set ablaze with the &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; spell. If the Torturer's Assistant is still alive at this point, he will stay behind to make sure the Torturer is alright and wish Hadvar and the Dragonborn good luck. Then, a bridge which is activated by a lever nearby must be crossed. After going through the bridge and entering the cave, Alduin will roar, which causes the ceiling above the bridge to collapse.\nNow, the Dragonborn only needs to follow the quest marker along with Hadvar. There is a skeleton near the passage leading towards a cavern. Near the skeleton is an iron dagger, a potion of minor healing, and a coin purse. The next cavern consists of two to four of the smaller variety of &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;, plus two larger ones (not to be mistaken for &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Frostbite%20Spider\"&gt;giant frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt;) that will drop down from the ceiling. &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Venom\"&gt;Frostbite venom&lt;/a&gt; can be collected from their corpses. There are also &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Egg%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt; in the egg sacks and &lt;a href=\"skeever%20tail\"&gt;skeever tail&lt;/a&gt;s in the hanging web sacks, as well as some gold or a lockpick or two in the hanging desiccate corpse.\nAfter killing the spiders, exit through another passageway. In the next cave, a potion of health is at the fire at the other side of the water. There is also another iron dagger. The potion cannot be seen from a distance, because it is too close to the fire. After getting the potion, a sleeping &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; is found. Hadvar gives the Dragonborn a &lt;a href=\"Long%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Long Bow&lt;/a&gt; and twelve &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron arrows&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting either sneaking past or killing the bear. If the Dragonborn chooses to fight the bear, its damage will be reduced by 80% to make the battle easier. In the cart next to the Dragonborn are two bottles of &lt;a href=\"Alto%20Wine\"&gt;Alto wine&lt;/a&gt; and a coin purse. In front of the cart, near the skeleton, is an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron helmet&lt;/a&gt; and a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Black-Briar%20Mead\"&gt;Black-Briar Mead&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the bear has been dealt with, the two can exit the cave. Upon exiting, Alduin can be seen flying overhead, retreating to parts unknown after completing his rampage of Helgen.\nAfter exiting the cave, Hadvar will direct the Dragonborn to his uncle, &lt;a href=\"Alvor\"&gt;Alvor&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. At this point the Dragonborn can choose to follow Hadvar to Riverwood, or split up and find their own way. If the Dragonborn decides to split up, unique dialogue can be missed.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages.\nFollowing Ralof (Stormcloaks) grants slightly better &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; because one of the guards who must be killed is the Imperial Captain from the executions, which means that her Imperial armor can be picked up. This gives very helpful protection in the early part of the game. After continuing to Riverwood, Gerdur will give the Dragonborn her house key.\nIf the Dragonborn sides with Hadvar (Imperial Legion), the pile of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel ingots&lt;/a&gt; which spawn next to the workbench outside of &lt;a href=\"Alvor%20and%20Sigrid%27s%20House\"&gt;Alvor and Sigrid's house&lt;/a&gt; can be taken freely. This gives the Dragonborn a better weapon from the start if they have &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Steel Smithing&lt;/a&gt;. The armor and weapons next to the grindstone and in the basement of his house can also be taken. However, even if the player sides with Ralof, all these items can still be acquired if the Dragonborn later assists Alvor in smithing, improving their &lt;a href=\"Disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; with him."}

He told me that the court accidentally released creatures from magical wards the Nedes set up long ago. He plans to reestablish the wards, but he needs help.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOutside Skyreach Pinnacle, you will meet a man called Mederic Vyger. He will tell you that his former allies, the &lt;a href=\"Scaled%20Court\"&gt;Scaled Court&lt;/a&gt;, removed a ward within that sealed away some powerful creatures of Nedic origins. He will ask you to protect him while he goes in to try and restore these wards. \nHead inside and clear the way to the main chamber. You will have to fight your way through several waves of Daedra, including Ogrims, Winged Twilights and Clannfears. Once you have made your way through to the main room, Mederic will attempt to restore the wards there. Once you use the Celestial Ward, enemies will start appearing and you have to defend Mederic from them. While he is restoring the first ward, you will face off against several waves of crocodiles and banekin, culminating in a fight against the Daedroth &lt;a href=\"Dresuu%20Var\"&gt;Dresuu Var&lt;/a&gt;. Once the daedroth is dead, activate the central ward again to start round two. This time, you will be facing snakes and lamias; the final boss of this round is the lamia &lt;a href=\"Exkeleku\"&gt;Exkeleku&lt;/a&gt;. Once she is down, use the central ward for the third time and Mederic will start working on restoring the third ward. This time, you will be faced with hordes of Clannfears, Winged Twilights and Ogrims, culminating in a boss battle with the Watcher &lt;a href=\"Lazonthagish\"&gt;Lazonthagish&lt;/a&gt;. When he is dead, use the central ward for a final time so that Mederic will start working on the final ward. Your enemies this time are hordes of spiders, bats and scorpions, with the boss being the Spider Daedra &lt;a href=\"Bol%20Veppik\"&gt;Bol Veppik&lt;/a&gt;. Once she is dead, the wards will be restored, but you will still have to face one final foe: a giant &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Titan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedric Titan&lt;/a&gt; named Aetherion. Every time you bring Aetherion's health to zero, he will revert to his core form for a while and summon a number of enemies. This core is the true enemy you need to defeat; since it will only stay in this form a short while each time, it is best to focus on the core while he is in this form, and deal with the other enemies when Aetherion is back to his normal form. \nOnce Aetherion is defeated, head outside and talk to Mederic to finish the quest."}

Others who crave danger, like this one. When brothers and sisters still mewed and cowered under mother\u2019s skirts, Turuk conquered the tallest shelf in the kitchen only to pounce on her head when came to bake the sugar biscuits. Since those early days of tiny, fiery courage, my exploits have become much more ambitious. As a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt;, this one's noteworthy accomplishments should be recorded, and how better to scribe them than with his own claws?\nThis one was never destined for the sugar fields, despite mama\u2019s pleas. The thrill of risk and peril called, and brothers and sisters found joy in devising ever-greater dares\u2014a practice that got your hero Redclaws in trouble more than a few times. The life of digging and planting and chopping could not match the rush of poking a sleeping &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Senche Tiger&lt;/a&gt; with a stick and running, or any of the other wild challenges that gave such a surge of excitement.\nIn the end, it was too much for my dearest mother to handle. It was not good for her poor heart, the constant worry over broken bones and similar minor consequences of budding heroism. She signed poor Turuk away to apprenticeship in the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; as soon as they would allow. Happily, this turned out to be a reasonable arrangement for some time. With them, this one trained with many weapons and learned the basics of the adventuring life.\nAlas, it was not long before boredom began yanking at the tail. The Fighters Guild had so many tedious rules and regulations, and took so much caution with jobs that they sucked the fun right out of any contract. \u201cNo, no, Turuk, you cannot take on a cave of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;frost trolls&lt;/a&gt; by yourself armed only with a butter knife; it is unwise.\u201d \u201cTuruk, you mustn\u2019t run so much in the dungeon\u2014there could be traps!\u201d \u201cMake sure to bring enough healing potions.\u201d Bah! Milksop blubbering!\nArmed with training and an insatiable hunger for greater danger, this one struck out on his own path, wandering &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and chasing beasts from farmers\u2019 legends and local rumor. No cave or ruin was too frightful, from nests of necromancers to the lairs of mighty beasts. These very claws ended &lt;a href=\"Grush-grush\"&gt;Grush-grush&lt;/a&gt;, the deadliest &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt; known in the provinces, and dealt the final blow to &lt;a href=\"Spinesnap\"&gt;Spinesnap&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Snake%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Giant Snake&lt;/a&gt; that plagued the fields of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; and devoured goat and horse alike. The list goes on and on\u2014perhaps this one shall write another volume just for these tales!\nIt was through these journeys that this one met a few others with the taste for taking on the greatest challenges without flinching or hesitation. Of these like-minded comrades, only &lt;a href=\"Mighty%20Mordra\"&gt;Mighty Mordra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kailstig%20the%20Axe\"&gt;Kailstig the Axe&lt;/a&gt; could truly keep up. They knew of many dangerous locales, and we dared each other to challenges most deem utterly insane\u2014take the naked dungeon run, for instance. Tales of our deeds began to spread, and others sought us out. The Undaunted were born."}

It is likely that undead found in the latter locations are responsible for the relatively well-kept appearance of such areas; many underground tombs and barrows feature lit torches, candles and sconces, which are likely maintained by resident undead.\nVariations.\nThe undead can consist of:\nThere is some ambiguity surrounding Vampires. While classically thought of as a form of undeath, &lt;a href=\"vampirism\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is caused by the diseases &lt;a href=\"Porphyric%20Hemophilia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Porphyric Hemophilia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sanguinare%20Vampiris\"&gt;Sanguinare Vampiris&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that these diseases kill in such a way that the body becomes immediately reanimated as a vampire. In &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, a player who becomes a vampire is considered undead for purposes of the perk &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt;, and also the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Rising%20at%20Dawn\"&gt;Rising at Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTactics.\nUndead are generally quite potent enemies, particularly to those not using suitable weapons/magic. This is especially so for Ghosts and Wraiths, who can only be hit with &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;, or enchanted weapons. Undead are typically weak to fire, so a fire weapon or spell is recommended when fighting them. They are usually found in large numbers, and stronger undead (such as Liches and vampires) will often be surrounded by weaker ones.\nA helpful spell is &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Undead\"&gt;Turn Undead&lt;/a&gt;, which causes undead to flee temporarily (the same effect as &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; on mortal enemies). This can allow a player to hit them as they run away, or just take a moment to recover, and is especially helpful when several undead attack at once. As with other such spells, higher-level enemies require higher-level spells.\nIn , the player has a greater number of options versus undead. The &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20the%20Mind\"&gt;Master of the Mind&lt;/a&gt; allows the use of &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; magic against them, and &lt;a href=\"Necromage%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Necromage&lt;/a&gt; further boosts spell power versus undead specifically (which includes &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells)."}

The disregard for ritual I have seen and the reduction of complexities inherent in the study to crass, inadequate categorizations is not to be tolerated. Feeble though my efforts may be, I must do my best to confront this watering-down, the devolution of the highest arts into common \"practical\" applications, by recording the proper approaches to be shared with those who wish to pursue the study seriously. I shall start with the fundamentals: the proper garments for a true initiate of the arts.\nThere is only one appropriate attire for anyone who wishes to unlock the higher secrets, for one who devotes the proper time to research and practice, and that is robes of cloth. On a practical level, one need not waste precious time being instructed in the ways of wearing robes. Magic is your armor, and devoting your time to anything else is folly. If you wish to lower yourself to such vulgar means, don't be surprised when your efforts to wrangle with leather or metal stunt your progress in the realm of the true understanding of &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; and its applications.\nThere are considerations you must take into account, of course; not any filthy rags will suffice. Physically, the material should be sturdy and treated for resistance to the elements. Your experiments will result in exposure to dangerous effects, so long sleeves and full coverage are essential. As &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; is naturally aligned with magical study, pockets and pouches for useful plant samples and other materials are very useful. If you cannot afford to hire your own exploratory teams and must work in the field, ensure proper layering, waterproofing, and additional space for specimens.\nOf course, appearance is critical. One must put forth the proper air of the enlightened to command respect from allies and enemies alike. My own robes feature detailed embroidery enumerating and naming the most powerful individuals of my lineage, along with sacred incantations I have interwoven with protective wards. Some prefer to display detailed &lt;a href=\"Aetherial\"&gt;Aetherial&lt;/a&gt; charts or other complex weavings to emphasize a particular area of study, and at least one wizard I am acquainted with has woven such potent illusions into his raiment that all who look upon him see exactly what they expect a powerful wizard to wear.\nYour robes are an extension of yourself and your ability to impress your will upon the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. I implore again that you abandon any ridiculous ideas of charging into battle clad in pointless, constricting &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, and instead focus on perfecting your art in every way. You will not require mundane protections when you are able to turn enemies aside using your own power, whatever form you choose for it to take: mighty lightning strikes, poisoning minds with fear, or any of the limitless options you will have if you truly devote yourself to discovery and mastery."}

This quest is also mandatory if the side quest \"&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;\" is to be completed.\nBackground.\n\"Tolfdir has decided to take us to investigate the ruins of Saarthal to explore the more practical uses of magic.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTolfdir's class meets outside the ruins of Saarthal before beginning an academic exploration of the ruins. The Dragonborn may travel there with the other students as a group, and they will help deal with any &lt;a href=\"Bear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bears&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; encountered on the way.\u00a0\nSaarthal excavation.\nAfter some touring inside, Tolfdir will ask the Dragonborn to find &lt;a href=\"Arniel%20Gane\"&gt;Arniel Gane&lt;/a&gt; (one can simply run ahead to the quest marker and speak to Arniel without waiting for Tolfdir).\nThe Dragonborn must now find four artifacts, one of which is the &lt;a href=\"Saarthal%20Amulet\"&gt;Saarthal Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. The other three are very small and hard to see &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanted Rings&lt;/a&gt;, but clearly marked on the quest indicator as long as they are taken before the Amulet, or else the quest markers will disappear. The artifacts do not have to be returned to Arniel and can be kept.\nRetrieving the Saarthal Amulet will trap the Dragonborn. Escape can be achieved by equipping the amulet and casting any spell (&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Shouts&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; are also effective) on the tablet from which it originally came. (Tolfdir will approach outside the trapped area and suggest using the amulet if the Dragonborn should try to return to Arniel.) The tablet will break into pieces, revealing a passage and removing the blocking gates.\nTolfdir will then take the lead. When he gets to the room at the end of the passage, &lt;a href=\"Nerien\"&gt;Nerien&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, will appear in a vision, which only the Dragonborn will see. After talking to Tolfdir about the vision, the Dragonborn will have to deal with &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; that appear from the three coffins in the room. The draugr can be killed with little or no risk of injury using &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;archery&lt;/a&gt;; Tolfdir cannot be killed, so an effective tactic would be to shoot the draugr attacking him. If Tolfdir is knocked down the draugr will likely switch their attacks to the Dragonborn until Tolfdir gets up again.\nTolfdir will pass through the middle coffin and The Dragonborn should then follow Tolfdir to a barred gate in a room. Tolfdir will stop and wait there and do nothing until the Dragonborn pulls the lever and opens the gate. The lever to open the gate is on the right; the room beyond holds more draugr to be dealt with. Both will lead into a large room where four draugr will arise from their wall crypts. The Dragonborn must help Tolfdir slay all of them (again, good &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; and Archery can help the Dragonborn remain unnoticed and unharmed).\nThe two chains, one on each side of the gate, open the way to the next area.\nSaarthal proper.\nThere are a number of inconveniently placed &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; that have the potential to provide a great deal of problems for some of the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt;. Most are pressure pads, so they can be avoided with some caution. The swinging pendulums are also difficult for followers to navigate, so keep healing spells handy or be ready to wait.\nIdeally the Dragonborn should proceed alone, killing draugr as necessary. In a large room, there is a draugr, a rune trap, and two more draugr. An effective tactic would be to kill the first draugr and get the attention of the next two, so that when they approach, the trap can be triggered to damage them.\nFirst pillar puzzle.\nAfter several more rooms and traps, there will be a door on the second floor near a broken coffin. Beyond there is a puzzle with six different movable pillars. The correct position for each pillar is shown on the wall directly behind and above them. This fact could easily be missed if the Dragonborn were not up close to the pillars. The &lt;a href=\"Candlelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Candlelight&lt;/a&gt; spell (or &lt;a href=\"Night%20Eye%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Night Eye&lt;/a&gt;)\u00a0makes them easier to see. Once the pillars are properly set, the lever can be activated to open the gate.\nIn the next room there are two wooden ramps. As the\u00a0Dragonborn\u00a0nears the top of either one,\u00a0a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Wight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Wight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Scourge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Scourge&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;level dependent&lt;/a&gt;) arise. An effective tactic would be to lure the draugr back to the pillar puzzle room and shut the gate. The Dragonborn would then be able to shoot &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; at the enemy whenever it appears from around the corner. The nearby coffin also makes a fine obstacle against melee, though you need to then pursue and kite him back to the coffin as he attempts to recover. Alternatively, a high Sneak skill and a potion of invisibility could be combined to sneak through the door near the top of the ramp, and close it. Provided the Dragonborn were quiet, the draugr would almost certainly remain unaware. There is a chest and other items to loot here. Beyond an iron door, there are two rune traps to pass. Activating either trap using a shout or magic will make noise and attract the draugr, while walking over the traps will not. The first rune trap can be easily avoided by walking around it, while the second rune trap in the doorway can be avoided by using any type of magic on it, or jumping over it. Passing over the second trap means the draugr is ultimately evaded.\nSecond pillar puzzle.\nThere are four pillars that give you the solution to the spinning puzzle pillars ahead. The second pillar on the left should be turned to whale first (because it turns the other three with it.) Then, the first pillar on the left should be turned to snake (that will turn the two on the right.) Next, the second pillar on the right should be turned to hawk (that one will turn the last one.) And finally, the first one on the right should be turned to whale.\nFinal battle.\nAfter passing through the gate, Tolfdir will reappear. There is an\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the north side of the room. Take caution, however, as there is also a poison dart trap trigger in the center of the floor.\nThrough another iron door, in the final room, approaching the glowing orb will summon the draugr-shape of &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, Jyrik is invulnerable, but after about 30 seconds, Tolfdir is able to weaken Jyrik by casting a spell on the glowing orb in the room, allowing the Dragonborn to deal damage. Jyrik can be a very difficult foe for a lower-level Dragonborn, as he knows a variety of &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells, and wields an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20War%20Axe\"&gt;Ancient Nord War Axe&lt;/a&gt; with a frost enchantment on it. He also sports an elemental cloak that changes between fire, ice, and lightning, rendering him immune to Destruction spells of that element while the cloak is active.\nJyrik Gauldurson is powerful, on the level of a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn possesses good sneaking and archery skills, he can be defeated without risk. The Dragonborn should stay on the balcony, standing close enough to see the floor below without standing near the balcony's edge, and shoot Jyrik with arrows. He will run up to the balcony, but will only run along the edge and will fail to spot the Dragonborn; enough arrows and he will eventually perish. This requires a very high Sneak skill, as he will notice the movement of the Dragonborn otherwise. \nAnother alternate strategy can be achieved very quickly by utilizing the game's mechanics to the Dragonborn's advantage. Wait until Jyrik Gauldurson charges the balcony. As he comes up the stairs, use the full force \"Unrelenting Force\" shout to knock him off the balcony. He suffers massive damage, aproximately 40%, from this fall. Hit him with a few arrows or spells, anything ranged. Wait until the shout recharges, then lure him up again and repeat. This should work after only two shouts.\nConclusion.\nJyrik's corpse bears a &lt;a href=\"Gauldur%20Amulet%20Fragment\"&gt;fragment of the Gauldur Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Writ%20of%20Sealing\"&gt;Writ of Sealing&lt;/a&gt;. The writ, when read, will start the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;\", if it has not been previously started. The Dragonborn should talk with Tolfdir to advance to the next stage of the quest (Return to the College). The &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Staff of Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;, which is on the altar, is an artifact worth collecting. Through the door behind the artifact and down to the garden is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; with the Dragon shout &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a chest with &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled loot&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Upon finally leaving Saarthal, the Dragonborn should travel back to the college to find Arch-Mage Savos Aren and inform him of the discovery. He will usually be found upstairs in his personal quarters. The Arch-Mage will reward the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magelight\"&gt;Staff of Magelight&lt;/a&gt;, and the quest\u00a0\"&lt;a href=\"Hitting%20the%20Books\"&gt;Hitting the Books&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0will start."}

The Guard survivors have taken refuge in an old tower on Hinault Farm, where they continue to be under seige by Montclair's forces.\nGeneral Walkthrough.\nWhile near the &lt;a href=\"Hinault%20Farm\"&gt;Hinault Farm&lt;/a&gt;, a wounded Shornhelm Guard soldier approaches the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. The wounded soldier asks the Vestige to gather healing supplies and return to &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Fairfax\"&gt;Lieutenant Fairfax&lt;/a&gt; in the old tower nearby. There are 4 healing supplies the Vestige needs to collect.\nAfter collecting the healing supplies and traveling to the old tower, Lieutenant Fairfax waits to speak with the Vestige. grants the Vestige entry with orders to get the supplies to Heloise. Upon entering the old tower, the Vestige gives &lt;a href=\"Heloise%20Menoit\"&gt;Heloise Menoit&lt;/a&gt;, a healer, the supplies. She then asks the Vestige to accompany her to check on the Hinault family, the owners of the farm. The Vestige agrees to accompany her and meets her outside the tower. \nHeloise leads the way to the Hinault Farmhouse door. After knocking on the door, a man, answers telling the Vestige they have locked themselves inside and refuse to open the door unless the Vestige brings them weapons to defend themselves. Heloise reveals the man to be &lt;a href=\"Gennove%20Hinault\"&gt;Gennove Hinault&lt;/a&gt;, and tells the Vestige she saw some soldiers tossing weapons into the barn and believes the weapons Gennove asked for will be there. She comments that she can smell fresh blood and decides to return to the tower to get her healing kit.\nThe Vestige enters the barn, finding two of the weapons on the first floor. The Vestige then locates the remaining weapons upstairs. Upon returning to the Hinault Farmhouse, the Vestige finds the door unlocked. Entering, Heloise is found examining the corpse of Gennove, with the rest of the family nowhere to be seen. After asking Heloise what happened, she explains the front door was unlocked when she returned. She tasks the Vestige with finding the rest of the family, warning that sometimes the dead return as bloodfiends. If any of the Hinaults are found dead, the bodies will need to be burnt and the ashes collected for the family. \nThe remaining four members of the Hinault family can be found hiding among the farm. &lt;a href=\"Jowan%20Hinault\"&gt;Jowan Hinault&lt;/a&gt; and his sister &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Hinault\"&gt;Mayla Hinault&lt;/a&gt; are found alive and the Vestige sends them back to the Shornhelm Guard camp at the old tower. Unfortunately, &lt;a href=\"Marrec%20Hinault\"&gt;Marrec Hinault&lt;/a&gt; and his mother &lt;a href=\"Melita%20Hinault\"&gt;Melita Hinault&lt;/a&gt; have already become bloodfiends. After defeating them, the Vestige uses the torch to burn the bodies and collect the ashes. \nAfter finding the surviving members of the Hinault family, the Vestige returns to the old tower to speak with Fairfax. He sends the Vestige inside to check on the Hinaults. The Vestige tells Jowan that his mother and younger brother were both dead, but gives him the ashes that were collected. While speaking to Jowan, Heloise enters and the two Hinaults accuse her of being the monster, the bloodfiend, that killed their father. Heloise denies the accusations and flees from the tower. \nThe Vestige pursues Heloise outside the tower, but finds she has disappeared. The Vestige follows a trail of items Heloise dropped while fleeing, the book &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Herbs%20of%20Northwest%20Tamriel\"&gt;Healing Herbs of Northwest Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, a healing kit, a backpack containing papers with Heloise's name upon them, and a paper is found titled &lt;a href=\"Healer%20Heloise%27s%20Notes\"&gt;Healer Heloise's Notes&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige finds Heloise inside a nearby burned building. Speaking with her, she admits to attacking Gennove and tells the Vestige she was injured by a bloodfiend during the Montclair attack. \nThe Vestige is then presented with a choice to either kill her or let her go. If the Vestige chooses to kill her, Heloise will beg the Vestige to reconsider, saying that she does not want to die. However, she will understand this is the only safe path, and reveal the poison she has made. She will ask the Vestige to tell Fairfax that she is sorry. She then drinks the poison, dying instantly. The Vestige returns to the tower tell Fairfax what has happened. \nIf the Vestige chooses to let her go, Heloise states she will go far away, that she will survive on animals. She confesses to a fondness between her and Fairfax, and asks the Vestige to tell him not to come looking for her. The Vestige returns to the tower to tell Fairfax what has happened. He will reveal that he knew something was wrong, but promises to find her once the fight with the Montclair's is over. "}

Not only do we consider the other cultures and races to be inferior to the Dunmer, we deem any extended contact with them where we were not in total control to present a danger to Dunmer society. Ideas, like a plague, can spread without warning and prove to be impossible to contain. Instead, we should concentrate on inter-House relations and improving the position of the Dunmer to make our society stronger and eternal."}

Some call us opportunistic like it's a curse. But as Grandmaster Hesleth always implored, \"The Dunmer who ignores opportunity deserves every failure that comes his way.\" From the earliest days of the House, Hlaalu focused on trade and crafts. Our maxim was simple. The goal for every housekin was to succeed in business and turn a tidy profit. The Book of Grasping Fortune reminds us to \"seize every chance to make a profit, but remember that your reputation also has value.\"\nWithout huge armies or vast holdings, it fell to our housekin to become experts at diplomacy and negotiation. Our words became our strength. Oh, there were also the less-savory attributes that went along with fast-talking and deal-making. We became thieves and sneaks, blackmailers and backstabbers. Still, we always appreciated the value of the deal. As the Book of Grasping Fortune tells us, \"The perfect approach to negotiations is to compromise with an eye toward securing the best possible deal.\"\nOur influence and our wealth has always been distinguished by our willingness to live in peace with our neighbors. While there can be short-term profit in conflict and war, sustainable growth only comes from harmony and fair trade. It falls to House Hlaalu to acknowledge our Dunmer culture with one hand while using the other to adapt to changing conditions as necessary in order to succeed. And what is success? A satisfying deal and a tidy profit, of course!\nThere is a dark stain on our history, however. Our natural tendencies encourage others to use bribes and favors to influence our housekin. This means that for every honest and fair councilor Hlaalu produces, there might be as many as four or five that are underhanded and corrupt. Does this concern us? Not overly, as history shows us that even the corrupt can wind up serving the common good. Or, at least, the profit earned has no moral component. As the Book of Grasping Fortune proclaims, \"You can trade with a friend forever, steal from a fool once or twice, and bargain with the dead not at all, so always go for the most sustainable profit.\""}

I continue my study and exchange of information with the little &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, as you ordered. (Why you sent Rigurt away after he only just arrived, I don't completely understand, but I suppose my mission is very important.) As I set foot\u2014well, both feet, really\u2014into &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the thought of this mission makes Rigurt so excited! Trading culture with allied nations so that we can learn more about each other is almost better than cold mead on a hot day. Almost. This time, I travel to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the so-called Living Gods of the Dark Elf people. The wonderment of it all gives Rigurt the skin bumps!\nNow, unlike our good and proper &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;gods of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\u2014gods who listen to our prayers but have the good graces to stay out of Nord business\u2014the Dark Elf gods actually walk among the people and rule over them the way the Skald-King parades around Windhelm. (No offense, Skald-King!) The god-kings of Morrowind seem to answer to various titles, although the most common appellations appear to be \"Lord, Mother, and Wizard.\" Rigurt spent many long hours attempting to converse with knowledgeable little Dark Elves, but much of what they told me just made my head go spinny-spin. Here's what I learned about the Tribunal gods. Maybe you can make better sense of it all.\nThe most popular of the three, at least in Vvardenfell, is the warrior-poet, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. They sing his praises in the cornerclubs and shout his victories from the rooftops. Really, the faithful on every street corner eagerly shoved pamphlets containing his lessons and sermons at me if I so much as smiled in their general directions! Lord Vivec is called the Master of Morrowind. I tried to read some of his poetry, but it just made my eyes hurt. Not at all as interesting or bawdy as the great &lt;a href=\"Fjokki\"&gt;Fjokki&lt;/a&gt;, and full of allusions that any who aren't drenched in Dark Elf culture just wouldn't understand. Truth be told, even I\u2014Dark Elf expert that I am\u2014had trouble with some of the more esoteric concepts. He preaches duty to faith, family, masters, and all that is good. He saved his people on numerous occasions, including helping to repel at least two &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;Akaviri invasions&lt;/a&gt;\u2014most recently, the invasion that led to the creation of our cherished &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. He apparently has some sort of connection to the &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, who the Dark Elves call one of the \"good Daedra.\" He does have a dark side, though, as I've been told that he has an unnatural attraction to lustful thoughts and murderous intentions. So, not very different from the rest of the puny Dark Elves, right? He lives right here in a grand palace in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, which conveniently has the same name that he does. I spent a few minutes in his presence, but I couldn't help but stare at his strange appearance. Also, he tended to float around the chamber. As a tactic to make us mortal creatures feel inferior, it worked surprisingly well. Still, I was happy to have been able to spend some quality time with such a personage of impressiveness!\nNext, I tried to discover everything I could about the one they call Mother Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it turns out she mostly inhabits the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple%20%28Online%29\"&gt;temple in Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, so I wasn't able to get a face-to-face with the Dark Elf patron of healers and teachers. I admit I'm very disappointed, as I am given to understand that for a goddess, she's the elk's antlers! They also claim that she embodies the best of Dark Elf culture and determination, which would fit into my area of expertise quite nicely. One priest told me that she protects the poor and the weak, and that her wisdom guides the Dunmeri through all their affairs. A drunk Dark Elf in a cornerclub also mentioned that she was kind of a stick in the mud, but an &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt; dragged her away before I could ask what she meant by that. Oh well.\nThe most mysterious of the three god-monarchs is &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Mystery of Morrowind and the Wizard of Wonderishness. (I believe that's what the priest called him. I misplaced those notes and am writing this last bit from memory while having a few mugs of mead.) Although rumors abound, no one that I could find has claimed to have seen Sotha Sil in a horker's age. The best I could learn from asking around is that Sotha Sil is the patron of artificers and mages, and many\u2014especially Dark Elves\u2014consider him to be the most powerful magicka user in all the land. I even heard an amazing tale about a &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;city of clockwork gears&lt;/a&gt; that Sotha Sil crafted to study the inner workings of the world. And they claim it's only as big as a small mammoth! Now that's something I'd give my last rabbit meatball to see! He's also credited with negotiating some kind of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20Compact\"&gt;compact&lt;/a&gt; with a number of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, but I decided not to look too deeply into this rumor. As Fjokki says, the fool who stares gets noticed by the Daedra. Rigurt is not so foolish as to do something as stupid as that! (Did you roll your eyes, Thane Vigli? I bet you rolled your eyes.)\nThe three living gods of the Dunmeri empower the Tribunal Temple and embody the will and discipline of Dark Elves everywhere. Well, except for the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, who refuse to bend their knees to Vivec, Almalexia, or Sotha Sil. Some sort of family squabble, I imagine. I'll look into that while I'm here.\nRigurt the Brash, Ambassador-at-Large for the Nord Cultural Exchange"}

Both he and his nephew &lt;a href=\"Aicantar\"&gt;Aicantar&lt;/a&gt;, can be found here, leading an excavation effort of the ruins. The sheer size of the structure, and ability to be well guarded, negates some of the instability the location has recently suffered from.\nInterior.\nEntrance to the Mournful Throne.\nThe first time the keep is entered via the main doors, &lt;a href=\"Thongvor%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thongvor Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt; is having a heated discussion with Brother &lt;a href=\"Verulus\"&gt;Verulus&lt;/a&gt; about the worship of the outlawed deity, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. At this huge intersection of stone and fire, head left to &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s entrance, or right to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Museum\"&gt;Dwemer Museum&lt;/a&gt; or forward to meet the Jarl, who is guarded by both Markarth guards and Thalmor soldiers. &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Igmund\"&gt;Jarl Igmund&lt;/a&gt; sits on the Mournful Throne, usually with his Steward and Housecarl by him. Outside, on the upper top of the stairs where &lt;a href=\"Ondolemar\"&gt;Ondolemar&lt;/a&gt; and his guards like to stride about, are two stone tables. The one to the right houses an &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; skill book, \"\".\nKitchens.\nTo the left (south) of the throne room are the kitchens. The two hounds around here are large but friendly. Inside, &lt;a href=\"Voada\"&gt;Voada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rondach\"&gt;Rondach&lt;/a&gt;, and the short-tempered &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Virane\"&gt;Anton Virane&lt;/a&gt; may be found. As would be expected, there is a large amount of food in here.\nJarl's Chamber.\n&lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt; rests here, behind the large golden door to the left of the throne room. If one is going to sift through his personal belongings, remember to try the ones on the stone shelf facing the subterranean river that dominates the rear of the chamber. The &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; skill book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Warrior%27s%20Charge\"&gt;The Warrior's Charge&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found here.\nUnderstone Forge.\nThis is located to the right (north) of the throne room. &lt;a href=\"Moth%20gro-Bagol\"&gt;Moth gro-Bagol&lt;/a&gt; works here, while his sister &lt;a href=\"Ghorza\"&gt;Ghorza&lt;/a&gt; tends to the blacksmith forge outside. A blacksmith forge, grindstone, tanning rack, and workbench are available here.\nBedrooms.\nBeing in this area counts as trespassing. To the right (northwest) are bedrooms for the more important members of the Jarl\u2019s counsel. &lt;a href=\"Faleen\"&gt;Faleen&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s room is to the right, with the large dinner table, a Key to Markarth Keep that opens the two other nearby doors, and the Jarl\u2019s Quarters. &lt;a href=\"Raerek\"&gt;Raerek&lt;/a&gt; houses the steward, a key, and his secret Talos-loving reading materials. Up the stairs is a third room leading to the Imperial War Room, where &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Emmanuel%20Admand\"&gt;Legate Emmanuel Admand&lt;/a&gt; is overseeing the Civil War in this territory.\nMarkarth Wizard's Quarters.\nUnless approval has been received from &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt;, being in the following areas is also considered trespassing. Unless the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hard%20Answers\"&gt;Hard Answers&lt;/a&gt;\"\u00a0is active, the laboratory and tower are inaccessible.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Museum\"&gt;Dwemer Museum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dwemer Museum showcases Calcelmo's collection of artifacts recovered from ruins across Skyrim. Only three guards patrol this area, keeping watch for intruders. This space is normally off-limits\u2014the guards will aggressively arrest any trespassers here\u2014but Calcelmo's permission to visit the museum can be attained in any number of ways; see the Thieves Guild quest page \"&lt;a href=\"Hard%20Answers\"&gt;Hard Answers&lt;/a&gt;\" for details. The museum has the finest collection of Dwarven artifacts (weapons, armor, items, and books) in the entirety of Skyrim and the highest concentration of locked containers in any area of the game. There is even a small selection of Falmer items. To the south is an apprentice-locked gate leading to a small workshop with an &lt;a href=\"Unusual%20Gem\"&gt;Unusual Gem&lt;/a&gt;. To the northwest is a locked gate to a two-level storage room. Up the steps to the west is the laboratory door.\n&lt;a href=\"Calcelmo%27s%20Laboratory\"&gt;Calcelmo's Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis area is the main living and research quarters for &lt;a href=\"Calcelmo\"&gt;Calcelmo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aicantar\"&gt;Aicantar&lt;/a&gt;, although they typically spend most of their time in the Keep, closer to the &lt;a href=\"Nchuand-Zel%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Nchuand-Zel Entrance&lt;/a&gt;. Most of this area is locked unless the Thieves Guild quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hard%20Answers\"&gt;Hard Answers&lt;/a&gt;\" is ongoing.\nMarkarth Wizard's Balcony.\nThe great balcony atop the keep connects Calcelmo\u2019s laboratory to his tower, a separate structure off the main body of the Keep. There is a clear view of the city from here. One section of the balcony wall has broken away, exposing a path around the cliffside that ends in a waterfall, which can be reached by a jump.\nCalcelmo's Tower.\nThe tower has a lower-level entry hall, an upper-level office, and a massive stone relic containing a text in Dwemer and Falmer on the same granite slab. This stone is the key to Calcelmo\u2019s current research, a secret he jealously protects."}

{"id": "215281", "revid": "3266517", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=215281", "title": "Unearthed (Dragonborn)", "text": "Unearthed is a &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; that takes place in &lt;a href=\"Kolbjorn%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Kolbjorn Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, given to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ralis%20Sedarys\"&gt;Ralis Sedarys&lt;/a&gt;. Ralis tells the Dragonborn that he has an investor who wants the relics of &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal\"&gt;Ahzidal&lt;/a&gt;, but they are buried deep within Kolbjorn Barrow. Multiple investments and many days will be required in order for Kolbjorn Barrow to be excavated.\nBackground.\n\"Outside Kolbjorn Barrow, I met Ralis Sedarys, an explorer who came to Solstheim in search of relics within the barrow. But when he arrived, he found it buried by the ash. He had all but given up on excavating it, but if I can supply the funds, he offered to make me a partner in his expedition.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest can be activated by speaking to Ralis Sedarys, who can be found at the ruins of Kolbjorn Barrow.\nFirst Investment.\nAfter speaking with Ralis, he will ask to help fund his excavation. This will cost 1,000 . After a few days a letter from Ralis will be delivered by a courier asking for help back at the ruins. Speaking with Ralis will reveal that draugr have been awakened and the workers have been killed.\nIn order to continue the excavation, the draugr must be neutralized. Ralis also requests scouting for a passage deeper into the ruins.\nBeyond the door to the barrow, the path heads generally northwest and is guarded by a draugr. Eventually, a room is found defended by leveled draugr. A large table in the center of the room contains a strangely marked &lt;a href=\"Skull%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt;. Removing it activates a mechanism which opens a door straight ahead to a large chamber filled with dust. &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Boots%20of%20Waterwalking\"&gt;Ahzidal's Boots of Waterwalking&lt;/a&gt; are in this chamber, on a pedestal. Otherwise, just beyond the table is an adept-locked chest up some steps against the left (southwest) wall. Once the draugr are killed and the door opened, the quest is continued by returning to Ralis.\nSecond Investment.\nAfter the ruin has been cleared, Ralis will request more money to recommence his investigation. This time he will ask for 2,000 gold. After some time has passed, a courier will deliver another letter asking the Dragonborn to return to the ruin. It turns out all the miners were again killed as they dug deeper into the ruin. Ralis requires the draugr to be killed again so that the exploration can continue.\nThis time, upon entering the barrow, a staircase on the right side is now open, with a novice-locked chest at the bottom. Otherwise, it is a dead end. A dead miner is at the top of the left side steps.\nIn the first main room are four new draugr, plus several dead miners and chests to be looted. The room beyond the doorway to the northwest has been further excavated. A leveled draugr is on a catwalk surrounding a central pillar, which can be reached by jumping from a pile of ash near the doorway on the northwest side to a ledge just below the catwalk, then up to the catwalk itself. A doorway to the northwest is blocked by a gate that cannot yet be opened. The faint chanting of a nearby &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt; can be heard, but it is buried under the rubble and cannot be reached yet.\nBelow that doorway is an open doorway leading to a crypt area protected by two draugr, that contains the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Bradyn\"&gt;Bradyn&lt;/a&gt;. Another draugr and a pull chain that opens a door to the right (northeast) are in the second room. Behind that door is another crypt with a draugr and a pull chain that, when activated, opens a door to the southwest from the previous room. Behind that door is another chamber with another draugr and a Dwarven Greatsword. A passageway leads to the left (southeast), but is protected by a floor trigger to a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; trap.\nThere is a doorway to the left (northeast) blocked by three gates with four handles on the right-hand side. Do not pull the third (from the top), as it releases a dart trap. Pull the switches in the following order: first, second, fourth, first.\nThe corpse of &lt;a href=\"Mireli%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Mireli&lt;/a&gt; lies in the center of the next room, as well as four draugr. Once they are killed, the gate to the right (southeast) is opened (this was the one that was seen to be locked earlier). In an alcove to the left of Mireli, a leveled battle axe can be found. Proceeding further northeast, on the right side behind a wall is a handle that, when activated, opens a secret area further to the northeast. &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Ring%20of%20Necromancy\"&gt;Ahzidal's Ring of Necromancy&lt;/a&gt; is here on a pedestal.\nThird Investment.\nOnce the search is complete, upon returning to Ralis and informing him the miners are dead, he will explain that the next stage of the excavation will cost 3,000 gold as he plans to hire some mercenaries to protect the miners.\nAfter some time has passed, a courier will deliver a third letter asking the Dragonborn to return to the ruin. Much like last time, more draugr awakened as the miners dug deeper into the barrow, but thanks to the mercenaries that Ralis hired, at least some of the miners escaped with their lives. Ralis asks that the draugr be killed so that the digging can continue.\nThis time, the steps on the right (northeast) side are opened all the way, although this just leads to the same set of stairs used before. Several draugr appear when descending them, and while moving deeper into the barrow. In addition to dead miners, there are several Kolbjorn guard corpses scattered about.\nMuch more of the ruin has been dug out at this point. A wooden bridge has been installed crossing from the second room's entrance to the central column, and a set of ramps now lead to the bottom of the room. At the bottom of the ramp, the chanting of the word wall is even louder, and on the left (southwest) side of the room, there is a point where the edges of the word wall animation can be seen - however, the wall remains buried. Also, on the right (northeast) wall is a drawbridge that cannot yet be opened, with a gate behind it.\nAcross the catwalk to the northwest, through the doorway that was opened the last time, to the left (southwest) is an expert-locked iron door. Beyond that door are two &lt;a href=\"Albino%20Spider\"&gt;albino spiders&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Cloaked%20Spider%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;poisonous cloaked spider&lt;/a&gt;. There is also an &lt;a href=\"emerald%20geode\"&gt;emerald geode&lt;/a&gt; to the right (northwest), a trapped chest straight ahead, and shelves on the left containing random potions and soul gems.\nBack in the previous room, a doorway to the right (northwest) is rigged with a floor trigger for a swinging log trap. In the room beyond is another draugr. The path turns right (northeast), leading down a few steps and through doorways that were opened the last time (pull chains on the right, then left, open the doors if they are closed). Proceeding past the second pull chain is a dead end room, with another pull chain that opens and closes the door between the first and second pull chains.\nBack at the second pull chain, turning to the southeast leads to another opening into the large room with the central column and the wooden ramps. An alcove on the right (southwest) has a leveled &lt;a href=\"Stalhrim%20War%20Axe%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; lying on the ground. To the left (northeast) is another room with two more draugr, an iron door that leads straight ahead, and another pull chain on the right. The pull chain opens a hidden door to the northeast in the previously seen \"dead end\" room. Behind it are &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Gauntlets%20of%20Warding\"&gt;Ahzidal's Gauntlets of Warding&lt;/a&gt; on a pedestal. Taking them off the pedestal unleashes a poison dart trap.\nBack at the room with the door, beyond it the path slopes sharply downward, and there is a falling rock trap. There are numerous leveled draugr. If the quest is active in the quest log, these draugr will be marked with quest markers. After they are all killed, the objective to clear out the barrow is complete, and it's now possible to return to Ralis. However, proceeding on, the path turns right (southeast) and proceeds up a set of stairs to a large room with several dead miners and &lt;a href=\"Kolbjorn%20guard\"&gt;Kolbjorn guard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the center of the room is a strange series of pressure pads that emit a blue glow when stood upon, however the light fades after a few seconds. Lighting all of the plates at once will open the gate on the left, where &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Ring%20of%20Arcana\"&gt;Ahzidal's Ring of Arcana&lt;/a&gt; lies on a pedestal. This can be done by running across all the plates quickly before their lights go out, which is most easily achieved with the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Time\"&gt;Slow Time&lt;/a&gt; shouts. Having the &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Light%20Foot\"&gt;Light Foot&lt;/a&gt; does not interfere with triggering the plates. Alternatively, casting &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt; on the ring, it may be retrieved through the closed gate without solving the floor puzzle.\nAt the southeast side end of the room is an embalming table with random loot. Up the wooden ramp to the right are several soul gems, and a gate with a chain to its left. Activating the chain opens the gate, but also triggers a swinging axe trap ahead. A short path forward leads to a set of stairs up to the right (northwest), then turns left, where the swinging axes protect the other side of the gate with the drawbridge that was seen earlier. A pull chain is directly above the gate which, when activated, stops the axes, opens the gate, and drops the drawbridge, providing a shortcut to get back out of the barrow.\nFourth Investment.\nOnce the draugr are defeated, upon returning to Ralis and informing him of the situation, he will mention that the next step of investment will cost 5,000 as they have gained quite a reputation. He plans to hire some stronger mercenaries this time.\nAfter some time has passed, a courier will deliver a final letter requesting a return to the ruin. Upon arrival at the campsite outside the ruin it appears there has been some sort of massacre as the corpses of several miners and guards are strewn about. Reading Ralis' journals, volumes \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Ralis%20Sedarys%20-%20Volume%2019\"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;\"-\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Journal%20of%20Ralis%20Sedarys%20-%20Volume%2023\"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;\", found on a table in a tent, reveals the chilling fate of the miners and Ralis' true intention all along; Ralis had been manipulated by the voice of Ahzidal since the beginning. The Dragon Priest had been talking to Ralis, controlling him, driving him to madness and forcing him to sacrifice the miners for his resurrection. The hired guards were just a bonus.\nThe first part of the barrow appears unchanged, but there are ugly scenes like a miner's body on the first table. However, the second major room has been excavated to the floor. This has exposed the once buried Word Wall. A word of the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; shout can be learned from it. The quest marker to locate Ralis is straight ahead to the northwest, but it is not reachable via that path. Instead, the path from the second room to the right (northeast) across the dropped drawbridge needs to be followed. There are several draugr along the way. In the room with the pressure plates, the staircase to the northwest leads down to a newly excavated area straight ahead.\nThis next room contains three sleeping draugr on thrones and a pillar puzzle. Upon entering the room, a gate immediately closes behind the Dragonborn, which can lock out a follower (the gate does not close until the Dragonborn enters). Once the draugr are defeated, there are two gates to be opened: one on the floor in the middle of the room, and the other in the south corner. The chains on the opposite walls (southwest and northeast) each control a rotating stone with a hole that, once visible, reveals a pillar that provides a clue to the puzzle (each shows a whale). The south corner gate can be opened by aligning both pillars behind the throne to the whale totem, then activating the lever between the pillars. The gate will raise to reveal &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Armor%20of%20Retribution\"&gt;Ahzidal's Armor of Retribution&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a pedestal.\nThe clues to open the gate on the floor are on the shields visible across the room from the thrones, near the ceiling near the southeast wall. The gate opens when both pillars behind the thrones are turned to the hawk and the lever activated again. At the bottom of the spiral stairway are a table with various potions, and then down more stairs to the northwest, more draugr, a &lt;a href=\"stalhrim\"&gt;stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; deposit (in the alcove to the northwest), and another pillar puzzle to the right (northeast). Pulling the chain with the incorrect symbols will send flames out of the wall that may ignite the oil on the floor. The correct alignment is two snake symbols. The gate will open to reveal &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Helm%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Ahzidal's Helm of Vision&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a pedestal, but there is a floor trigger for a spear trap just beyond the gate. Taking the helm will cause the pedestal to shoot out a powerful jet of fire from the bottom of the pedestal.\nBack at the bottom of the stairs, there is a tomb to the left (southwest) at the bottom of the ramp up to the southwest that contains a valuable weapon. However, there is a floor trigger for a poison dart trap directly in front. At the top of the ramp is an iron door, at which Ralis can be heard repeatedly saying, \"It is time,\" and \"Ahzidal - awaken!\"\nA Rude Awakening.\nRalis will be found in the middle of a large room. He is standing on top of a circular stone structure, which is inscribed with similar runes as seen in the room where the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodskal Blade&lt;/a&gt; is found. The edges of the structure are filled with a large pool of blood, and the area is littered with sacrificed miners. Ralis is attempting to summon the Dragon Priest Ahzidal using the energy from the miners' blood. He is successful; the ground shakes and he is flung to one side of the room. Ralis is knocked unconscious as Ahzidal emerges and battle begins.\nDuring the battle several draugr burst out of the surrounding sarcophagi to aid Ahzidal. If the draugr are killed, others will awaken to take their place. He may also raise the corpses of defeated draugr and miners lying in the chamber. Ahzidal primarily uses &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire based&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells including a unique pulse of fire similar to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt; that cause large amounts of damage. Once he has been defeated his ash pile can be searched for &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;his mask&lt;/a&gt;.\nRalis will wake up at this point and seems confused by what has happened:\n\"Oh, gods... what happened? What have I done?\"\nWhat's going on here? \"I...I don't remember. Ever since I got here... to Kolbjorn... I've heard whispers. Voices. Thoughts. Imaginings. They've only gotten louder since I've stayed. Pounding, driving. A couple of times I blacked out. It was... It was just before the draugr woke up.\"\nDid you... kill the miners? \"I don't know. I... maybe? It's what he wanted. He just needed their energy. I don't know! I hope I didn't. But... maybe I... please, you have to believe me?\"\nChoosing to kill Ralis will result in him becoming hostile and fighting back. Choosing to spare Ralis will cause him to run out of the ruin and back to &lt;a href=\"The%20Retching%20Netch\"&gt;The Retching Netch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Either option completes the quest.\nOnce Ahzidal is defeated, a tunnel opens at the southwest end of the room. Beyond the opening, the tunnel curves left (southeast). There is a chest with leveled loot, then there is a gate opened by a chain. The circular room beyond contains the \"\", as well as a chest with leveled loot to the right (southwest).\nContinuing on the path left (northeast) of the room with the Black Book, at the end of the short tunnel, there is a stalhrim deposit in a sarcophagus behind the spiral staircase opened by the lever (which is to the right as the Dragonborn enters; the deposit is to the left). The stairs lead up to the second large room in the barrow.\nUpon exiting the ruins, the entire campsite will be gone.\nReward.\nAlong with finding a word for the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, and obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%27s%20Armor\"&gt;Ahzidal's Armor&lt;/a&gt; set and &lt;a href=\"Ahzidal%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Ahzidal's mask&lt;/a&gt;, should Ralis be spared he will offer his services as a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssuming he is killed, the only notable item he carries is a unique &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pickaxe\"&gt;Ancient Nordic Pickaxe&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost\"&gt;Hoarfrost&lt;/a&gt;. However this weapon can still be acquired from him by sharing inventory items while he is a follower, if he is spared.\nThis quest will cost 11,000 altogether. One may be able to find a few septims on looted bodies or loot bodies and sell the items in order to recover some of the cost. The relics themselves are worth 9,430 ."}

The &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; have assaulted the foreman and his crew. I need to find the foreman, &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Gandis\"&gt;Gandis&lt;/a&gt;, and figure out what the Reachmen are doing here.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing &lt;a href=\"Beneath%20the%20Stone\"&gt;Beneath the Stone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Gandis\"&gt;Foreman Gandis&lt;/a&gt; will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; went into a Companions tomb deeper in the mine and sealed the entrance using two relics. He tells you that you will need those relics to get in. He will also ask you to look for his miners while you are exploring the cave, which hints at the quest &lt;a href=\"Move%20out%20Miners\"&gt;Move out Miners&lt;/a&gt;. That quest takes place in the same cave as this one, so it is efficient to do both simultaneously.\nThe first of the relics, the &lt;a href=\"Fireheart%27s%20Medallion\"&gt;Fireheart's Medallion&lt;/a&gt; will be located in the cavern north of the eastern big room. It will be guarded by a reasonably strong boss, so take care. The second relic is the &lt;a href=\"Darkhammer%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Darkhammer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; which will be in the northwestern room, also guarded by a boss. Keep in mind that the cave's map is somewhat unintuitive; you cannot directly pass between the big rooms and you have to go through the cavern to the south.\nOnce you have both of the medallions, head to the door to the Tomb of the Companions, which is located in the passage between the big chambers. place the Fireheart's Medallion on the skeleton of &lt;a href=\"Jalarma%20Fireheart\"&gt;Jalarma Fireheart&lt;/a&gt; and the Darkhammer's Amulet on the skeleton of &lt;a href=\"Bron%20Darkhammer\"&gt;Bron Darkhammer&lt;/a&gt; and they will open the door, informing you that evil lurks beyond there. Proceed along the path, and you will come upon a ritual to revive &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorpse: \"Rise Sinmur! Return, and taste the blood of Ysgramor's heirs!\"\nThey will disappear after a few seconds, leaving you free to examine the text on Sinmur's tombstone. It details Sinmur as a terrible monster. Head outside and tell &lt;a href=\"Vigrod%20Wraithbane\"&gt;Vigrod Wraithbane&lt;/a&gt; what you have discovered to finish the quest."}

He had several dog-eared volumes and a dozen scrolls relating to the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; mixed in with his research on the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, even a few originals. I almost dismissed them due to Quintus's slovenly nature, but even he wouldn't have overlooked that much material being out of place. There's still a lot to go through, but it seems like the witless bastard actually found something.\nI never thought I would be grateful for Quintus's abysmal organizational skills, but here we are. Who knows how long these volumes would have sat gathering dust while I focused my efforts on the Dwemer? He was translating correspondence between Ayleid kingdoms during the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; with the help of an &lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleid language&lt;/a&gt; treatise by the late &lt;a href=\"Tjurhane%20Fyrre\"&gt;Tjurhane Fyrre&lt;/a&gt;. I intend to decipher the source material myself, but from what I can gather the Ayleids were scrambling to respond to the fall of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nMy translation of the Ayleid scrolls confirms that several of the Ayleid kingdoms at war with their rebelling slaves were concocting a plan to turn the tide back in their favor. There are numerous references to an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Wrathstone\"&gt;Wrathstone&lt;/a&gt;, which the Ayleids believed was their answer. They suspected that the Dwemer had it in their possession. They intended to take it from them, by force, and it seems they failed, but I need to confirm that.\nI take back everything nice I said about Quintus' mess. I'll die of old age before I find what I need in his collections. If there is a method to this madness, it's lost on me, but he never appeared to have difficulty finding what he was looking for in his squalor. Much as I'd like to never see his face again, I'm going to need that treacherous mind of his.\nI'll have to keep that necromancer in mind if I ever return to &lt;a href=\"Volenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;. I don't usually trust the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; with delicate matters, but she seemed to have a good head on her shoulders. She was more than happy to \"reunite\" me with my late husband, though it took some convincing to get her to let me keep him. The pneumeria chamber I modified is working better than I hoped. Quintus is locked up tight and I can communicate with him as needed. Unfortunately, I can't shut him up as needed.\nQuintus spent a week venting before he finally realized that his obstinacy was pointless. He's agreed to help me complete his research on the Wrathstone. Enduring his witless barbs is small price to pay.\nI made the right decision. Quintus was really on to something. He always did have a head for conspiracy. According to the historical record, the Ayleid attacks on the Dwemer were thwarted and they were ultimately crushed by the Alessians. End of story. But if that was the case, why were the &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharns&lt;/a&gt; surveying Ayleid ruins not long after the death of Tjurhane Fyrre, and how did House Tharn convince the &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; to divert resources to building a remote coastal fort during the middle of the biggest civil war in the Empire's history? Aside from &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;the one&lt;/a&gt; right now, of course.\nI don't know how Quintus got his hands on some of these records, but I'd suspect a few favors from the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; were involved. The official story of Fort Mistwatch was that it collapsed and was washed away by unseasonable flooding, but that news comes suspiciously after an object was unearthed under the fort. Details are slim, but by the description it could be the Wrathstone. Did they cover up their discovery? I need to see for myself. They may have left something behind that will put me on the trail."}

A quest marker pops up, leading them to &lt;a href=\"Sundercliff%20Watch\"&gt;Sundercliff Watch&lt;/a&gt;, a fort ruin on the extreme eastern edge of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, right next to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Canulus\"&gt;Lake Canulus&lt;/a&gt;. If starting a new game with this plug-in loaded, the quest will be given to the Hero right after they enter the sewers from the sanctum in the tutorial level.\nSundercliff Watch.\nUpon entering the ruin, the Hero will see a small bandit-style camp in the first room, with a few &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Soldier\"&gt;Drothmeri Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s. Kill or evade the soldiers and proceed down the corridor to a double door. Trying to open it, they are told that \"A voice beyond the door calls out: Who gathers stormclouds over Nirn?\"; at first, the only option in response is to say nothing.\nCheck the \"abandoned knapsack\" right next to the door to find a \"&lt;a href=\"Small%20Diary\"&gt;Small Diary&lt;/a&gt;\". Of immediate interest is the password \"Chimer\". The rest of the diary is an entertaining read, revealing that the steward on the other side of the door, according to a note, is supposed to keep an eye on the cousin of Drothan, who appears to be in charge of opening the door. In order to find &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Drothan&lt;/a&gt; there is a journal in his cabin that provides more information.\nUse the password to open the door and deal with the &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Recruit\"&gt;recruits&lt;/a&gt;, soldiers, and &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Veteran\"&gt;veterans&lt;/a&gt; on the other side. The &lt;a href=\"Steward%27s%20Registry\"&gt;Steward's Registry&lt;/a&gt; on the table reveals that Drothan has been amassing a few troops here. Continue exploring the fort ruins, and the Hero will find a door to the next area, Sundercliff Village.\nBefore leaving this area, one may wish to go back to the start and leave the loot in the inventory in the &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; on the left side of the first room or another suitable container.\nSundercliff Village.\nThere really is a village in Sundercliff Village... the village is in a huge underground cavern, large enough to contain a half dozen houses, occupied by more of the &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Army\"&gt;Drothmeri Army&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Laborer\"&gt;Argonian laborers&lt;/a&gt;. Follow the map arrow, which is leading through to the next area, Sundercliff Commune, in search of Drothan's cabin. The commune has two entrances, both on the west side of the main cave, one on the upper level, and one on the lower level. The map arrow suggests one should proceed to the commune through whichever of the two doors is closest.\nPassing the \"Jail\" on the way, in the northwest corner of the main cave, go inside and one will find a &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20Assassin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Morag Tong assassin&lt;/a&gt; locked in a prison cell. A &lt;a href=\"Jailor%27s%20Letter\"&gt;Jailor's Letter&lt;/a&gt; on a table reveals that the jailor has been trying unsuccessfully to find the writ revealing the assassin's target. On the same table are two pairs of the rare, zero-weight &lt;a href=\"Wrist%20Irons\"&gt;Wrist Irons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe assassin isn't particularly talkative, and doesn't seem interested in asking to be released. What to do with him is really just a matter of personal preference. If one release him, he will skulk off to proceed with his assassination; the Hero are likely to cross paths with him again later and he may help by killing off a few enemies. If he is let go, he will end up outside of the &lt;a href=\"Inn%20of%20Ill%20Omen\"&gt;Inn of Ill Omen&lt;/a&gt;, unless he's killed.\nSundercliff Commune.\nSundercliff Commune features an upper level with a few more houses. A deep chasm in the middle can be descended via a long wooden ramp, revealing another house and the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Varsa%20Baalim\"&gt;Varsa Baalim&lt;/a&gt;. For now the ruin is inaccessible, because some type of enchantment is blocking the entrance. The destination now is Frathen Drothan's Quarter's on the upper level to the north of the chasm. Depending upon which door one used to get here from Sundercliff Village, one may be on either the upper or the lower level.\nIn Drothan's cabin they will find his &lt;a href=\"Drothan%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a table; reading it updates the quest to tell them that the next job is to find two &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20bezoar\"&gt;enchanted bezoar&lt;/a&gt;s in order to be able to access the Ayleid ruin Varsa Baalim. Before moving on it is worth doing a thorough search of Drothan's cabin. Items of particular interest include:\nDrothan's journal said that the enchanted bezoars were entrusted to his two lieutenants, the &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Commander\"&gt;Drothmeri Commander&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgemaster%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Forgemaster&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest is to start with the commander, whose house is right next door. If one released the Morag Tong Assassin, he is likely to show up here just as the Hero arrive and assassinate the commander for them. The bezoar is upstairs on a side table.\nOne may also want to explore the Veteran's Lodge on the lower level, where there is another boss-level chest and a couple Drothmeri veterans to fight. Outside in Sundercliff Commune one can also find several chests with and an underground potato plant patch, complete with its own gardener. Follow the marker to the next destination, the forge.\nSundercliff Forge and Mines.\nTo find the Forgemaster the Hero will need to head back to Sundercliff Village and cross to the east side of the main cave, where the door to Sundercliff Forge is. When entering the Sundercliff Forge one will realize it's the upper of two levels, but there is no way at the moment to get to the lower level; one can just look down through some shafts in the floor. There is a rock wall right by the entrance, but it can't be opened from here. The only option is to proceed to the next area: Sundercliff Mines.\nThe Hero will enter the mines on the lower level of a large cavern, filled with iron veins where many &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20Laborer\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Laborer\"&gt;Argonian laborers&lt;/a&gt; are mining, and who like to fight with &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Rake\"&gt;rakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hoe%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;hoes&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt; two-handed &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe passage to the upper level is in the southeast corner. The various parts of the upper level are connected by narrow walkways; continue to the northeast corner where one will find a small passageway that leads back to the Forge (watch out for rockfalls!).\nThis door leads to the lower level of the Forge, occupied by an &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Apprentice\"&gt;Armor Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20Apprentice\"&gt;Weapons Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; and the Forgemaster himself. The &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%27s%20Note\"&gt;Apprentice's Note&lt;/a&gt; on the table in one room, and the &lt;a href=\"Letter%20Home%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Letter Home&lt;/a&gt; on the table in another provide some entertainment.\nThe target here is the Forgemaster. Killing him will yield a couple unique enchanted items, namely a &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Forgemaster's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%27s%20Smock\"&gt;Forgemaster's Smock&lt;/a&gt;; his other armor and weapons may also be enchanted. The bezoar is in the Forgemaster's tent, along with some gems and a boss-level chest (and look under the Forgemaster's bed to find his hidden bedtime reading material). Having accomplished the goal of finding the second bezoar, one can now return to Sundercliff Village via a shortcut passageway in the northwest corner of the forge; pull the rope to lower the rock wall.\nVarsa Baalim.\nProceed to open the door to Varsa Baalim, the entrance is back at the lower level of Sundercliff Commune. Activate each of the two \"Enchanted Pedestals\" by either side of the door to put the bezoars in place; the Hero will then be told that they have dispelled Drothan's barrier.\nThey will first enter an Excavated Ruin, where one can watch a combat between a pair of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; and a Drothmeri soldier. Other than that, there is little of interest. Run through to the other side, and open the door to Varsa Baalim proper.\nAs soon as the screen loads, there'll be another quest update, saying that \"there's no telling what I may encounter here...,\" a not-so-subtle warning to be ready for combat. The Hero should see some people fighting below... more of Drothan's army taking on a handful of vampires. Both groups will gladly attack the Hero given the chance, so they're best off hanging back and letting them do as much damage to each other as possible before joining the fray.\nOnce everyone has been taken care of, an option is to take some time to explore this new area, which consists of yet another huge underground cavern, filled with surface-type Ayleid ruin features or continue on and follow the map marker to the Cava Beldameld. It is located to the west, past some very tilted sets of stairs and it leads to a new section of Varsa Baalim.\nHere the Hero will find more Drothmeri and vampires fighting each other. Backtracking to the east of the door to Cava Beldameld one will find a chest and an Ayleid cask with some gold and other loot. Then proceed northward through a maze of ruined walls, eventually angling to the northeast. Keep an eye open for Ayleid Casks hidden in a few corners and also watch out for more vampire attacks. The destination is the door to Cava Marspanga where another group of Drothmeri and vampires are battling along with a dead Drothmeri veteran. After all are killed, collect the loot from the Ayleid casks and head back up the stairs into yet another section of Varsa Baalim.\nAs an alternative to this method, those with sufficient &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; skills will be able to leap onto a halved pillar, then vault over a nearby wall allowing a quick and easy entry to the Nefarivigum without having to clean out two caverns first.\nHead to the left (northeast) out of the door, up a small ramp of debris that leads to the top of some ruined walls. Stay up there, crossing the platforms and walls and one will come to a garden-variety Ayleid Ruin spiral entrance. This is at last the Nefarivigum, which based on Drothan's journals was his destination and the location of Mehrunes Razor.\nNefarivigum.\nContinue down the stairs and Drothan is there, studying what appears to be a statue, but in fact is the frozen form of Dagon's champion, &lt;a href=\"Msirae%20Faythung\"&gt;Msirae Faythung&lt;/a&gt;. If he hasn't seen the Hero, sneak over to his bedroll and read his &lt;a href=\"Drothan%27s%20Field%20Journal\"&gt;field journal&lt;/a&gt; to find out what he's learned about retrieving the Razor.\nThere are a few ways to choose from at this point.\nEither way, the champion will wake up and attack, however he will steadily lose health throughout the fight if one chose to take the heart. Alternatively take the heart and then force the gate. The champion will awaken and still take damage but the Hero won't get Cannibal's Prion, Porphyric Hemophilia, or the four infamy points. Once the champion is killed he will vanish along with his weapon (even trying to pick it up, it will crumble to dust).\nRegardless of which method one chose, proceed through the door and pick up the Razor. The back wall drops out revealing a door to the Forgotten Tunnels. There's a couple of &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mud crabs&lt;/a&gt; in here. When getting to the end there's a submerged door that will exit out in Lake Canulus just south of Sundercliff Watch."}

This quest is one of three quests within \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bloodthorn%20Plot\"&gt;The Bloodthorn Plot&lt;/a&gt;\" quest one must complete to proceed. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; has invaded an ancient &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; graveyard and is raising zombies. The &lt;a href=\"Seamount%20Clan\"&gt;Seamount Orcs&lt;/a&gt; are concerned but are waiting for reinforcements.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon nearing &lt;a href=\"Grimfield\"&gt;Grimfield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rozag%20gro-Khazun\"&gt;Rozag gro-Khazun&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that on the king's orders, the place is off limits. He'll suggest that if the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; wants to kill cultists, they head to the crypt in the center. Doing so will show the ghost of Frederique.\nSpeaking to the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Frederique%20Lynielle\"&gt;Frederique Lynielle&lt;/a&gt; she will reveal that she was a former priestess of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;. If they promise to help her get rid of the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Necromancers&lt;/a&gt;, she will give them the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Staff of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, which is empty after a long period of disuse. Killing the necromancers will release the dark energy that they use to raise the dead, which the staff converts into power.\n&lt;a href=\"Crafty%20Lerisa\"&gt;Crafty Lerisa&lt;/a&gt; will appear at this point, and give a set of &lt;a href=\"Disguises%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bloodthorn Robes&lt;/a&gt;, a disguise that will make Bloodthorn Zombies not attack. Head to the locations where the cultists perform their rituals and disturb them so the motes of power are released. Gather six to recharge the staff of Arkay.\nTalk to Frederique again and she'll tell the Vestige how the staff will reveal circles of corruption amongst the crypts - and that in these, the Bloodthorn Cult's abominations reside, hidden in \"pockets of Oblivion\". Planting the staff in a circle will draw the abomination to Nirn, where it can be killed. Three Abominations exist in this graveyard - the Abomination of Hate, Abomination of Wrath, and the Abomination of Hatred.\nSpeak to Frederique again and she will ask them to speak to &lt;a href=\"King%20Renwic\"&gt;King Renwic&lt;/a&gt;, who has more information.\nKing Renwic will reveal that the Seamount Orcs attacked generations ago and took their island. His failure to defend his people was unforgivable, but his attempt to defeat the Orcs was worse as he attempted &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. An ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; relic is buried on the island and the Bloodthorn seek its power.\nKing Renwic then opens a portal, the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;Vision of the Past&lt;/a&gt;, that will allow the Vestige to \"see his last day through the eyes of his enemies\".\u00a0After entering they will be &lt;a href=\"Warcaller%20Targoth\"&gt;Warcaller Targoth&lt;/a&gt;, a well-respected Orc and see through his eyes. Talking to &lt;a href=\"Hunt-Wife%20Othikha\"&gt;Hunt-Wife Othikha&lt;/a&gt; she will tell them to stop the King who has sealed himself off deeper into the mine, preparing some foul spell that will kill all &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;. Make the prisoner's talk, look through their belongings and if they can't be coerced to reveal any plans they must pay the blood price. Use this charm to chain their ghosts after they are executed and ask them, ask wisely as there is only one question for each.\nA number of possessions such as &lt;a href=\"Drago%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Drago's Orders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Note%20to%20Nurese\"&gt;Note to Nurese&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crumbling%20Breton%20Scroll\"&gt;Crumbling Breton Scroll&lt;/a&gt; can be found next to the characters &lt;a href=\"Drago%20Auberdine\"&gt;Drago Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Nurese\"&gt;Queen Nurese&lt;/a&gt; respectfully. Frederique will ask to stop her king, but cannot help any further. Threaten the King's daughter, by saying they will kill her mother, for a non-lethal resolution to the mission.\nAfter interrogating the prisoners and finding out more of King Renwic's plans, summoning an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; Ayleid army, head on to talk to &lt;a href=\"War%20Chief%20Yzzgol\"&gt;War Chief Yzzgol&lt;/a&gt; waiting by the door to the ruin interior. He is talking about victory, and that Renwic will surrender and join his people in exile. If he doesn't surrender he'll be killed.\nTurn both runestones to open the door to the ruin interior where King Renwic is preparing his spell in the center of the room. Confront Renwic, who will then open a teleport back to the current time. Even his death failed his people. He tried to use the relic and Yzzdol killed him. He realized the relic's power and it demanded souls and he didn't want to pay that price but the Bloodthorn will. They will raise this undead army and kill all.\nHe will also tell the Vestige that the Ayleid Relic is the key, he no longer remembers its location and that they have to find the relic before they do, as the relic craves souls. He offers them the &lt;a href=\"Kingsguard%20Hammer\"&gt;Kingsguard Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and some for the souls saved this day."}

I have never been much for journaling, but I imagine I will spend most of these pages drawing the various &lt;a href=\"Fungi\"&gt;specimens&lt;/a&gt; instead of writing about them. I think illustrations are more instructional than mere words. Perhaps because I am not much of a writer.\nBut it seems Master Pythis believes in me. A fact that does not cease to bewilder me every time I encounter it. His work with botany has inspired me for quite some time. When he offered to become my mentor, I was at a loss for words. Why would someone as well-established as he is want to waste time teaching a new recruit like me? I am incredibly grateful, of course. It's a dream come true.\nHe tends to be quiet. Not unkind, but not overly warm, either. Which is fine for me since I tend to be fairly quiet myself. I merely hope that his propensity for silence is not out of sullenness toward his new apprentice.\nThe master's been fairly secretive about our newest project. I've noticed that many of the other &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; don't take botany quite as seriously as he and I do. I don't mind too much. I find it's better for any group when their interests and talents are varied. But I think Master Pythis keeps our research mostly between the two of us because we have true passion for it. He hasn't said outright that the others wouldn't understand (and I certainly haven't found that to be the case when talking to them) but I get the sense he would rather they stay out of our affairs."}

As the owner of &lt;a href=\"Calixto%27s%20House%20of%20Curiosities\"&gt;Calixto's House of Curiosities&lt;/a&gt;, he offers tours of the items he and his sister collected during their travels in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nDuring his adult life, Calixto and his sister, &lt;a href=\"Lucilla%20Corrium\"&gt;Lucilla&lt;/a&gt;, were bequeathed a large fortune. Traveling Tamriel, they collected several rare items, such as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Book%20of%20Fate\"&gt;The Book of Fate&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"The%20Dancer%27s%20Flute\"&gt;The Dancer's Flute&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Soup%20Spoon\"&gt;Ysgramor's Soup Spoon&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, his sister died during this time, and so after settling in Windhelm, he opened a curiosity shop in her name to display their collection.\nSecretly, the grief of losing his sister was too much for him to bear, and Calixto began to lead a life of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of resurrecting Lucilla, which involved the murder of several young women in Windhelm. The basis for this ritual appears to be of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; origin, and was then interpreted by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s and first transcribed by the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;. To help this, he authored a &lt;a href=\"Butcher%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; in three parts, which describe the exact elements needed for the magic to work, and for this purpose, he acquired the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20Amulet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Embalming%20Tool\"&gt;embalming tools&lt;/a&gt; to use on the victims. \nIn addition to an unknown first murder, his second victim in the necromantic ritual was &lt;a href=\"Friga%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Friga Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the twin sister of &lt;a href=\"Nilsine%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Nilsine&lt;/a&gt;; doing so gave him access to &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, which he took up residence for the ritual. He then planned to kill &lt;a href=\"Susanna%20the%20Wicked\"&gt;Susanna the Wicked&lt;/a&gt;, believing her tendons to be of exquisite quality, and apparently came close to doing so before being thwarted by the appearance of guards. The ritual is almost complete as the Dragonborn arrives in Windhelm. His actions have earned him the name \"the Butcher,\" to which &lt;a href=\"Viola%20Giordano\"&gt;Viola Giordano&lt;/a&gt; has placed letters all throughout the city in order to warn the people of Windhelm about him; however, Calixto has taken most of these down so they do not hinder his efforts.\nPersonality.\nCalixto is a relatively jovial man, happily proclaiming for all to visit the House of Curiosities for their enjoyment. He appears to enjoy displaying his collection, saying that he believes his sister would be proud to bring smiles to visitors. That being said, after Wuunferth reveals the true nature of the &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Amulet\"&gt;Strange Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, he claims that Calixto and his books are \"often confused\" on such matters, although Wuunferth does say that it happens to \"the best of us,\" suggesting that the mage holds some respect for Calixto. &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Guards&lt;/a&gt; also seem to respect him to a degree, saying he \"has a good eye\" for strange trinkets. &lt;a href=\"Jorleif\"&gt;Jorleif&lt;/a&gt; believes Calixto to be a bit \"odd,\" although he stops short of suspecting anything dubious about the imperial. \nCalixto secretly criticizes the mages at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; for dabbling in magic with which they are already familiar, glamorizing the possible innovations of necromancy. He also appears to have little respect for Windhelm, calling the guards \"idiots\" and describing portions of the city and its populace as \"rugged bits.\" He is completely devoted to the necromantic ritual, to the point of showing little to no remorse for murdering women besides a passing comment at Susanna's murder scene; however, this could be but an act. His devotion appears to come from his relationship with his sister, whom he loves dearly, and describes as someone who loved the world so much while he did not. On top of everything, though, he appears to hold a sense of righteousness to what he is doing, believing that the women he has murdered \"would surely thank me for the great gift I give them.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20on%20the%20Ice\"&gt;Blood on the Ice&lt;/a&gt;.\nCalixto Corrium appears at the scene of Susanna the Wicked's murder. When questioned by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, he says he saw the culprit run off, but can give little else. He, along with &lt;a href=\"Silda%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Silda the Unseen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helgird\"&gt;Helgird&lt;/a&gt;, are released as suspects after their questioning. After learning that the killer used &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Embalming%20Tool\"&gt;embalming tools&lt;/a&gt; from Helgird, the Dragonborn later discovers a Strange Amulet at &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, and are directed towards Calixto for further investigation into it. Calixto claims the amulet to be a ceremonial Wheelstone, and that it belongs to &lt;a href=\"Wuunferth%20the%20Unliving\"&gt;Wuunferth the Unliving&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Wizard\"&gt;court mage&lt;/a&gt;. After lying that Wuunferth dabbled in necromancy before serving the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, Calixto requests to buy the amulet for 500 . The Dragonborn can accept this or refuse, although refusing will make the Necromancer's Amulet unobtainable. \nBased on this information, the Dragonborn will accuse Wuunferth of the crime. If they choose to speak to Jorleif, he will shortly arrest the court mage, and the case will close. Windhelm will appear safe again for a few days. Unfortunately, the Dragonborn will find a new female body outside of &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt;, where guards will be in disbelief since the killer had been caught; Calixto will be at the scene again, although he will have nothing special to say. The Dragonborn goes to the imprisoned Wuunferth, who will make it clear that the true murderer eluded capture. He will then assist the Dragonborn in catching the Butcher. Alternatively, the Dragonborn can speak to Wuunferth directly in the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;, who will prove his innocence by telling that he was investigating the murders himself. In this case, Calixto will not claim a fourth victim. Regardless of the path chosen earlier, Wuunferth predicts where and when the next murder will occur and, suspecting the killer will strike again that same night, he sends the Dragonborn to the Stone Quarter. \nArriving in the market, the Dragonborn will find Calixto standing to the side; unlike everyone else in the market, he will keep to himself. After a moment, his next victim\u2014&lt;a href=\"Nilsine%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;Nilsine Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jora\"&gt;Jora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hermir%20Strong-Heart\"&gt;Hermir Strong-Heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Idesa%20Sadri\"&gt;Idesa Sadri&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Arivanya\"&gt;Arivanya&lt;/a&gt;\u2014will suddenly scream as Calixto approaches. The guards do not react to the murder, and so it is up to the Dragonborn to save the victim. If not stopped in the marketplace in time, Calixto will kill his target and then run to &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, where he will be hostile to the Dragonborn upon entering. Calixto is shortly killed and the murderous streak is brought to an end.\nTour.\nWhile in the House of Curiosities, Calixto offers tours of the trinkets he and his sister collected for 2 ; paying this will begin the tour of his collection. Of \"The Book of Fate\", he will claim that it displays the destiny of those who read it, although it appears blank to the Dragonborn. He will then direct the Dragonborn to Ysgramor's soup spoon, where he will remark that it is indeed a fork, but that this did not stop Ysgramor from using it. He will next inform them of The Dancer's Flute; he tells that it has destroyed empires and won wars, claiming that it will force those around to dance uncontrollably, although he will stop short of activating it. The tour completes after this, although it can be repeated as many times as desired.\nDialogue.\nInside Calixto's House of Curiosities:\n\"Welcome to the House of Curiosities! I offer a brief tour for a few coins, or you can simply browse at your leisure.\"\n\"Always a shame when someone has to die.\"\nAfter investigating Hjerim:\n\"Welcome to the House of Curiosities!

But it was white, like alabaster, with three bright rubies set in it.\"\nCalixto: \"Be very careful with that. It sounds as if it may be the Death Ring of Dro'farahn. A ring of the most dangerous sort.\"\nElda: \"Oh dear. What should I do?\"\nCalixto: \"Bring it to me straight away when you find it. Don't dally.

Decades of effort gone in an instant. Vanished in a fruitless experiment, never to be repeated. Under any other circumstances, I'd be furious, but driven to discern the root of the failure.\nI perfected this &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt; over countless iterations, each with its own challenges to overcome. This time, I only feel numb. Sitting alone in this literal pit of despair among the broken bodies of my companions, and the last vestiges of a bygone era.\n&lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;The Dragon&lt;/a&gt; is gone and its precious &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; along with it. The last of its kind, or near enough to make no difference. To the victor goes the spoils? Not this day. I've won nothing but a mountain of decaying meat and scales.\nI mustn't squander this opportunity. Even without its soul, this corpse contains a wealth of potential. Dissection and preservation will take precedence. There won't be much sleep to be had in the coming days.\nThe creature's undamaged organs have been transferred to receptacles more suitable for preservation. Foodstuffs and simple reagents can be replaced. My search of the Dragon's den revealed a hoard of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; wealth, much contained in air-tight mechanical lockboxes.\nEmptying them out, I discovered a significant quantity of an unknown material: raw chunks of vibrant blue crystal that give off their own light. They'll receive closer examination once I've sealed the remaining perishable &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; parts in the emptied containers. I take a certain gratification in the irony that these treasure chests will soon mostly contain the Dragon itself.\nThe crystals are useless. To call them inert is an understatement. They are the essence of stasis. Unchanging and unalterable. I can safely put their study aside indefinitely.\nMy remaining rations spoiled more quickly than anticipated. I don't know if it was the dank of the ruins, or the prevalence of &lt;a href=\"fungus\"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; that lead to this outcome, but I'll be dining on Dragon meat until I find an alternative source of food.\nRoast Dragon is an adequate repast, though the meat is dense and thick with ligaments. If I had to describe the taste, I would say it was \u2026 fowl.\nThe claims that Dragon remains retain innate &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; properties are not exaggerated, though I would categorize them as more catalytic than anything. Potential applications are broad, though I will refrain from &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; studies, given the impossibility of acquiring replacement materials.\nThis creature does not give up its secrets easily. I could spend centuries unravelling them, but that's time I don't have. I have little left to eat and I fear I've lingered too long already.\nWithout the strength to descend &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Teeth%20Mountains\"&gt;the mountains&lt;/a&gt;, it's time I come to terms with my situation. I will die here, but I intend to do so on my terms. The question is, will those immutable crystals comply?"}

From his wife, Queen &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;, Camaron has &lt;a href=\"Greklith\"&gt;Greklith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lhotun\"&gt;Lhotun&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aubk%27i\"&gt;Aubk'i&lt;/a&gt;. He had one more son, but due to the frail condition of the child, Camaron decided to eliminate the child as he felt that the child was unfit for the throne of Sentinel. The official word is that the Underking got him.\nHistory.\nWhen Lord &lt;a href=\"Mogref%20of%20Betony\"&gt;Mogref of Betony&lt;/a&gt; vassalled the small fishing village to King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Lysandus of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, King Camaron objected. He claimed that &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28City%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; illegally took the village that had been rightfully Sentinel's. The &lt;a href=\"War%20for%20Betony\"&gt;War for Betony&lt;/a&gt; began.\nDuring the War for Betony, the Lord of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; tried to facilitate a peace negotiation between the two warring city states. On the appointed day, King Lysandus and King Camaron met at the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Palace of Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; to discuss a truce. However, the treaty was never to be. &lt;a href=\"Vanech\"&gt;Vanech&lt;/a&gt;, High Priest of Daggerfall, considered Betony to be holy land of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. Any attempt to give up the island was blasphemous to him. Vanech faked the treaty, and the false treaty offended Lysandus. The room disrupted into chaos. King Camaron knew of Vanech's treachery. He pursued and finally slew the priest. However, the chaos was too severe, a great riot broke out throughout Reich Gradkeep. Almost the entire royal family of Reich Gradkeep was killed.\nThe war continued and took its climax at &lt;a href=\"Cryngaine%20Field\"&gt;Cryngaine Field&lt;/a&gt;. King Lysandus was killed in the middle of the battle. &lt;a href=\"Gothryd\"&gt;Gothryd&lt;/a&gt;, son of King Lysandus, was crowned King of Daggerfall. Inspired with the new king's bravery the Daggerfall force fought with renewed determination. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Bridwell\"&gt;Lord Bridwell&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, slew King Camaron. The Sentinel army retreated in disorder. Lord &lt;a href=\"Oresme\"&gt;Oresme&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel surrendered. He later committed suicide on the way back to Sentinel.\nKing Camaron's widow, Queen Akorithi, took the reign of Sentinel, because the official heir, Prince Greklith, was just 11 years old."}

Camlorn is the cultural center of Glenumbra, as many artisans and scholars live within the walls of the city, and the greater area of the &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Hills\"&gt;Cambray Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nCamlorn is a large city-state, built atop a bluff that overlooks the entirety of the Cambray Hills, which coincides with the control Camlorn has over the land. While Daggerfall is a major trading spot in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Camlorn is the equivalent for the mainland Glenumbra. The towns of &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Brook\"&gt;Eagle's Brook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt; are settlements that bridge the gap between Camlorn and the waters of the Iliac, and the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond these townships, there are various historical landmarks in Cambray Hills, such as the ancient battlegrounds of the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt; and the haunted lake town of &lt;a href=\"Westtry\"&gt;Westtry&lt;/a&gt;. On the outskirts is the &lt;a href=\"Cambray%20Pass\"&gt;Cambray Pass&lt;/a&gt;, a road that leads into the highlands of &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, with the large farmstead of &lt;a href=\"Gaudet%20Farm\"&gt;Gaudet Farm&lt;/a&gt; found along the eastern base. To the southeast are the expansive marshes of &lt;a href=\"Hag%20Fen\"&gt;Hag Fen&lt;/a&gt;, home to various witches and hags. Beyond the Kingdom of Camlorn and the Iliac Bay, is the &lt;a href=\"Oloine\"&gt;Duchy of Oloine&lt;/a&gt;, who have ties to the royal family of Camlorn.\nThe city-state of Camlorn itself is walled-off, with only entrance being at the southern base of the bluff. On the northern tip of the city is the &lt;a href=\"Cavilstyr%20Rock\"&gt;Cavilstyr Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a site popular among the dancers and revelers of Camlorn. During the &lt;a href=\"Flower%20Festival\"&gt;Flower Festival&lt;/a&gt;, many Bretons gather at the rock and light torches as the sun goes down. The seat of power, Castle Camlorn can also be found in this area, overlooking the Sea of Ghosts as Cavilstyr. It is a long street between the Castle to the main gate, with various homes and businesses in between. Another portion of the city diverts to the west, containing the massive cathedral on the northern wall, as well as, more buildings. Amidst the city are the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethiete\"&gt;Temple of Sethiete&lt;/a&gt;, a temple dedicated to the obscure deity, &lt;a href=\"Sethiete\"&gt;Sethiete&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href=\"Prostitutes%20Guildhouse\"&gt;Prostitutes Guildhouse&lt;/a&gt;, which speaks for itself.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nordic Occupation &amp; the Kingdom of Camlorn.\nLike many other settlements, the city-state of Camlorn was founded during the Nordic Conquest of High Rock, alongside other notable villages like &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt;. Camlorn was a predominately Nordic settlement, as one could expect, but when the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; raged across the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic occupation over High Rock was dwindling. The &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; had taken this opportunity to drive them out of the province and bring about their own rule. But as the Direnni lost power as well, the Bretons expanded all over the province, taking hold of the Nordic founded settlements, including Camlorn. The city-state of Camlorn, with the longstanding title of Duchy, had become a Breton settlement through assimilation. The people of Camlorn have celebrated the city's founding, once every thousand of years, with various events such as the &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Beauty\"&gt;March of Beauty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flower%20Festival\"&gt;Flower Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Black Drake's Invasion &amp; the Daggerfall Covenant.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"2E%20542\"&gt;2E 542&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Camlorn had become a newly-independent settlement, but this grand moment did not last long as the city-state of Camlorn was sacked by &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After a failed siege at &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, the Reachman had advanced to the west into Glenumbra, where the city-state of Camlorn was sacked in a moment's notice. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Drake%27s%20Invasion\"&gt;Black Drake's Invasion&lt;/a&gt; ended with the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Battle of Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Emeric%20of%20Cumberland\"&gt;Emeric of Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; had decapitated the Reachmen Emperor and driven out the Horde. With the province freed from this threat, the Kings of High Rock banned together, where they created the early iteration of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Camlorn was among these cities that joined the alliance. As time went on, the Covenant incorporated the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaolchu the Reborn &amp; the Bloodthorn Cult.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Camlorn was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Sebastien\"&gt;Duke Sebastien&lt;/a&gt;, amidst the raging war between the &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cult\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cult&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and the Bretons of Glenumbra. During the conflict, the undead &lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faolchu\"&gt;Faolchu&lt;/a&gt; was resurrected and begun spreading his influence throughout the Cambray Hills, eventually leading to the Duke, contracting &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; and was exiled from Camlorn, taken to &lt;a href=\"Aldcroft\"&gt;Aldcroft&lt;/a&gt; with other refugees. Lycanthropy had spread across Camlorn through a Breton man named &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20Telwin\"&gt;Jonathan Telwin&lt;/a&gt;, a shifter that infected dozens of people overnight, and eventually, the Duke. With a legion of werewolves, Faolchu's forces had taken the city of Camlorn, either mauling people to death or converting them into werewolves. The City Guard, under the command of &lt;a href=\"Darien%20Gautier\"&gt;Darien Gautier&lt;/a&gt; fought the defense against the werewolves, but it failed as the city was fully taken. The &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; were dispatched from Aldcroft, to take back the city.\nThe Battle of Camlorn &amp; the Fall of Faolchu.\nThe Lion Guard established a siege camp on the outskirts of Camlorn, attempting to break the city gates and route them out completely. However, the Lion Guard were unable to enter Camlorn, and their camp was overrun. But with the help of an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Covenant, the Lion Guard were able to retake the camp and enter the city walls, facing off the werewolves throughout the streets. The Agent had rendezvous with Darien Gautier, who was held up in a local inn, along with survivors and remnants of the City Guard. The local alchemist, &lt;a href=\"Alinon%20the%20Alchemist\"&gt;Alinon the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt; had created a substance that cured people of Lycanthropy, and so the Agent unleashed it into the streets, healing people of the disease. Eventually, the battle had reached the ruined Castle Camlorn, where the Agent and Faolchu dueled. In the end, the undead werewolf was killed in a fire, and &lt;a href=\"General%20Gautier\"&gt;General Gautier&lt;/a&gt; of the Lion Guard had officially retook the city. The Breton General would travel to Wayrest, to seek an audience with High King Emeric over repairing the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nPelagius Septim II &amp; Quintilla of Camlorn.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%2063\"&gt;3E 63&lt;/a&gt;, the Crown Prince of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Pelagius Septim II&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the city-state of Camlorn, where he courted the daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Vulstaed\"&gt;King Vulstaed&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Camlorn. &lt;a href=\"Quintilla\"&gt;Quintilla&lt;/a&gt;, was considered the most beautiful princess in all of the Empire, skillful in the arcane arts. At the same time, Camlorn was terrorized by a demonic werewolf, to which the young couple had slain. And with the power of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, Quintilla of Camlorn had sealed the werewolf inside a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;, which was fashioned into a ring that Pelagius II used to propose to her. And so, Pelagius Septim II became the Emperor of Tamriel, fathering three children, &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20I\"&gt;Cephorus I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Potema\"&gt;Potema&lt;/a&gt;. These three became exponential leaders in the Empire, but conflict would come between each other, exclusively from their only sister, Potema Septim, the Wolf-Queen of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The same ring given to Quintilla, was in turn, given to Potema Septim when it was refashioned into a necklace. It was said to be a source of her power. It was then given to her nephew, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Staff of Chaos &amp; the Crypt of Hearts.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Camlorn in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion reached the city of Camlorn on their quest to find the sixth piece of the Staff. Through the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; and rumors from the people, the Champion had traveled to the western hills, to the city of Camlorn in the province of High Rock. There the traveler ventured to the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Seth\"&gt;Brotherhood of Seth&lt;/a&gt; where they met &lt;a href=\"Halfas%20Varn\"&gt;Halfas Varn&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Brotherhood. A rogue member of the Brotherhood, &lt;a href=\"Barnabas%20of%20Tethis\"&gt;Barnabas of Tethis&lt;/a&gt;, had taken it upon himself to gather the pieces of the staff, taking a map to the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Hearts\"&gt;Crypt of Hearts&lt;/a&gt; to the distant &lt;a href=\"Mines%20of%20Khuras\"&gt;Mines of Khuras&lt;/a&gt;, with knowledge of Jagar Tharn's plot and part in the Brotherhood. If the Champion retrieved the map, the Brotherhood could decipher it and find the crypt. After venturing to the Mine, Champion had set forth for the Crypt of Hearts. It was there that the Eternal Champion had obtained the sixth piece of the staff. The Champion had moved on to find the seventh piece of the staff somewhere in Tamriel.\nThe United Kingdom of Daggerfall &amp; Camlorn.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the city-state of Camlorn was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Senhyn\"&gt;Duke Senhyn&lt;/a&gt;. Camlorn had warred against the other Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Northpoint\"&gt;Northpoint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, it did not evolve into full-scale war, but it was merely local skirmishes throughout the borders. But Camlorn would move away from conflict as the Duke's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Kelmena\"&gt;Lady Kelmena&lt;/a&gt; married the Crown Prince of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camaron%20II\"&gt;Camaron II&lt;/a&gt;. This brought about peace between along the western coast, consisting of an alliance between Daggerfall, Camlorn, and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in the southern Iliac Bay. But with this alliance, it is likely that the eastern kingdoms of High Rock, were enemies of the western united kingdom. Peace was established, all the way into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "976847", "revid": "30169600", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=976847", "title": "Camonna Tong", "text": "The Camonna Tong is an illegal\u00a0criminal organization which operates out of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nThe Camonna Tong is the native crime syndicate in the province of Morrowind. They are very similar to the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, however they tend to lack the loose code of values their &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; twin possesses, and often are involved in more ambitious projects, such as influencing or outright controlling politics. In this way, the Camonna Tong functions similarly to a Mafia, especially compared to the Thieves Guild, who are for the most part a simple black market-like organization of thieves and other assorted criminals who look out for and trade privately with one another. In a small way, the Camonna Tong of Morrowind share a similar relationship to the Thieves Guild as the Thieves Guild does to another group called the \"Wharf Rats\" who are a rather smaller, rather simpler group of less ambitious, less competent petty-crooks and vandals. As stated above, the Camonna Tong lacks the Thieves Guild's loose code of morality, involving themselves significantly in drugs, &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;, prostitution, extortion and many varieties of gruesome murder. The Thieves have no part in such things \u2014 indeed, they punish those among their ranks found guilty of them.\nRelations with other groups.\nThe Camonna Tong is extremely xenophobic, and thus are opposed to all Imperial\u00a0people and institutions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and hold a strong dislike for non-&lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and Dunmer outlanders. Due to this, the Camonna Tong has declared war on the Imperial Thieves Guild, for the twofold offences of being outlanders and intruding on their turf. They are so intent on destroying the Thieves Guild that they have taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; through Sjoring Hard-heart, their leader. The Camonna Tong are very nationalistic, though, and so supports, or at least doesn't actively oppose, native Morrowind organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The Camonna Tong's relationships with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses%20of%20Morrowind\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; are varied: &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; is at least partially controlled by them, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; is opposed to them, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; treats them with the disdain and detachment they exhibit in all of their dealings. As for the assassins' guild, the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, both are opposed to each other on practical grounds but for the most part do not make aggression. Since the Morag Tong will not accept work from the criminals of the Camonna Tong, they are much more inclined to turn to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; for \"professional-grade\" assassination when their own manpower will not suffice, while certainly enjoying the added benefit of the Brotherhood's infamous and terror-inspiring ways. Despite this, the Camonna Tong does not trust the Brotherhood on the grounds that it regularly associates with outlanders, and the Morag Tong occasionally uses Camonna Tong members as informants and agents in their endless attempts to wipe the Brotherhood out of Morrowind.\nThe Camonna Tong across Tamriel.\nIn , players will often come across Camonna Tong operations: several of their operatives work in various caves scattered across &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and they are an obstacle to certain objectives players must achieve. Players cannot join the faction: even Dunmer characters are outlanders (player-character Dunmer are not native to Morrowind) and therefore opponents of the Camonna Tong. Their effects are felt nevertheless, though: later Thieves Guild and Fighters Guild missions involve the war between the crime factions, and on occasion Camonna Tong members will give players missions to accomplish, though completing these does not affect one's influence on the syndicate. Additionally, at one point in the game, players who ask around for rumors may be told that an old general is looking to meet them. Speaking with him provides players with a mission to kill several Camonna Tong members in the &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; council club. There is also a small camp on the eastern end of Cyrodiil in (&lt;a href=\"Walker%20Camp\"&gt;Walker Camp&lt;/a&gt;) that has two Camonna Tong operatives occupying it, despite the fact that they operate almost entirely in Morrowind. These operatives are in fact part of a skooma smuggling operation, and do not attack, unless aggravated, otherwise being friendly, and can be considered an &lt;a href=\"Easter%20Eggs%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Easter Egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrvas Dren.\nThe head of the Camonna Tong during the time in which takes place is &lt;a href=\"Orvas%20Dren\"&gt;Orvas Dren&lt;/a&gt;, who is the brother of the Duke of Vvardenfell, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt;. Through the Camonna Tong he controls part of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, including two councillors, and some magistrates in Balmora, House Hlaalu's capital on Vvardenfell. In a note to some of his lackeys, Orvas Dren reveals that his brother is getting in the way of some of the Camonna Tong\u2019s operations and that he wishes him to be assassinated. Orvas Dren ultimately becomes an obstacle in \"Morrowind\", as his influence of House Hlaalu prevents the Nerevarine from being declared Hortator of Hlaalu and he must be killed, bribed, or blackmailed to neutralize this problem. This leads to a &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in some versions of the game, as non-Hlaalu players may use a dialogue about Orvas Dren to join House Hlaalu and elevate themselves directly to the highest rank-even if the player had already joined House Redoran or Telvanni. This allows one to hold the highest rank in two Great Houses, and possibly build both strongholds."}

Anaxemes was one of the heirs to vie for the throne in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;. He had won it when he formed an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, the province of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;.

Citing stewardship made thousands of years prior, the High Elves established a Provisional Government in Valenwood, known as the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, by the request of their claimant to the Falinesti throne, Camoran Anaxemes. Anaxemes had sworn allegiance to the then High King of Alinor for fifty years, and so the combined force drove out the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt;s and so the Second Aldmeri Dominion was formed. While High King Camoran Anaxemes ruled from Falinesti, the Dominion capital was moved to &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, since it had rooted long before Falinesti, which continued its seasonal shift across the province."}

The prophet began to question the validity of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; rule and taught that to resist the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; was to resist the Gods, only recently after the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s had fled to Valenwood from the Alessian rebellion.\nBattles continued to be waged along the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and Valenwood border lands until &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, when relenting warfare and a devastating plague from the island of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; caused Valenwood to fall to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire granted independence to each treethane of the Dynasty, ensuring that its power was diminished and that the Bosmer would not unite against their invaders.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the fall of the Cyrodilic Empire in &lt;a href=\"2E%20430\"&gt;2E 430&lt;/a&gt;, the Camorans attempted to reinstate their authority, and began to war against one another, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;ns to the north, and the coastal encroachments of the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pyandonea\"&gt;Pyandonea&lt;/a&gt; were offered no resistance. It took the force of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; to reunify Valenwood. Seeking an ally to help repulse the Colovians, King &lt;a href=\"Aeradan\"&gt;Camoran Aeradan&lt;/a&gt; turned to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, which had restored order to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; following the chaos of the devastating &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Valenwood fell to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim's&lt;/a&gt; armies at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor allowed a figurehead Camoran king to exist, although the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; used the province as it saw fit, and neglected it otherwise. The Bosmer began to grow resentful of an alien authority, and in &lt;a href=\"3E%20249\"&gt;3E 249&lt;/a&gt;, a pretender to the Camoran throne appeared with &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; freed Valenwood of the Empire, while destroying all who opposed him. The Bosmer were slow to unite against the Usurper, but were able to overthrow his power in nearly two decades, leaving behind a broken land without any political purpose."}

Most likely, Kaltos was the leader of Valenwood's military forces, or a special branch thereof. Haymon, later known as the \"Camoran Usurper,\" served as sorcerer and advisor to Lord Kaltos.\nUsurpation and Takeover.\nIn 3E 249 Camoran Kaltos, along with the aid of his chief scout &lt;a href=\"Orben%20Elmlock\"&gt;Orben Elmlock&lt;/a&gt;, and sorcerer Haymon began a takeover of the Camoran Throne. \u00a0They were soon able to conquer the city tree &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; and assume control of the Throne. \u00a0During the takeover, Kaltos was adamant that no one be harmed if they did not pose a threat. It was for this reason that the relationship between Kaltos and Haymon began to breakdown.\nFall of Kvatch and Betrayal.\nDuring subsequent conquest, Haymon was not satisfied with control of just Valenwood and began to conquer the surrounding regions. One of the first outside cities to be conquered was the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiilic&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;. Haymon began an attack on the city of Kvatch and ended up decimating the population, laying waste to the city. \u00a0Kaltos, though a usurper himself could not believe the horrors which Haymon was causing.\u00a0\nIn the words of Kaltos' Chief Scout, Orben Elmlock, as told in the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Refugees\"&gt;The Refugees&lt;/a&gt;\":\n\"That was horrible, the worst thing I have ever seen... Kaltos wept when he saw what Haymon had done. My master did everything he could to stop it, begging the Hart-King to return to Valenwood. But he turned on Kaltos, and we fled. We are not your enemy, and we have never been. Kaltos could do nothing to prevent the horror that the Usurper has brought to the Colovian West and Hammerfell, and he has fought for fifteen years to prevent more.\"\nThe Hart-King. That was what Haymon called himself when he betrayed Kaltos. Kaltos did his best to convince Haymon to return and stop the madness he was pursuing, but Haymon betrayed him, and along with Elmlock was forced to flee.\nFall of the Usurper.\nKaltos is said to have spent the next 15 years of his life working in opposition to the so-called \"Hart-King.\" While not talked of himself, it is known that Kaltos Chief Scout, Orben Elmlock was in &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; when Haymon Camoran was finally killed."}

Haymon Camoran, as he was originally known (although also later known by such names as Hart-King, and Camoran Hart-King), served as Sorcerer and Advisor to &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Kaltos\"&gt;Camoran Kaltos&lt;/a&gt;, a military leader and tactician of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Haymon, in league with Kaltos and Kaltos' Chief Scout, Orben Elmlock, began their usurpation in &lt;a href=\"3E%20249\"&gt;3E 249&lt;/a&gt;. He quickly and violently freed the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; from the Empire, taking two years to do so, and then proceeded northward. After the destruction of one of the first conquered cities, Kvatch, Kaltos plead with Haymon to end the madness and return to Valenwood. Haymon turned on Kaltos, forcing Kaltos to flee for his life. Haymon continued his conquest northward, only stopping after being defeated by Baron &lt;a href=\"Othrok\"&gt;Othrok&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;. During this period, the enemies of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; are believed to have worked together for their own safety. Before his defeat, he managed to conquer all of Valenwood, large sections of the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt;, and significant sections of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and was working his way through &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; when he was finally defeated.\nResponse from the Empire.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; at the time had a weak emperor who was not able to quickly respond to the threat that it faced from the Camoran Usurper, as &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt; had been weakened by an inheritance dispute with &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;'s legitimate son. As Eraintine wrote, however, the Usurper arose \"out of a cimmerian nightmare.\" Cephorus responded by sending large numbers of mercenaries to Hammerfell to try and stop his northward march, but the Usurper either bribed these mercenaries, or slaughtered them and raised them as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, thereby increasing his numbers.\nThe March Northwards.\nThe Camoran Usurper went on a relentless crusade northwards. It is known that in &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt; at the earliest, &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by a &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, and his armies of \"zombies, ghosts, vampires, and skeletons.\"\nIt is known that the Camoran Usurper conquered Hammerfell and Valenwood by means of a large army, and that his legend insists was made up largely of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, however in all likelihood, he used these forces when he began his march in &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt; and slowly replaced the summoned creatures with the armies of his conquered territories, as traditionally, the armies of Valenwood are mercenary.\nIn Hammerfell.\nIt is known that the Camoran Usurper managed to eventually conquer the majority of Hammerfell during his northward push. Specifics about his attacks on Hammerfell are not widely known, except to mention that the towns of &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed. Both townships requested help in &lt;a href=\"3E%20253\"&gt;3E 253&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Elinhir\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt;, and both requests for help were ignored. The reason for this is largely due to residual dislike between the rival factions of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn High Rock.\nKnowledge of the Usurper's relentless march northwards had reached &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; as early as &lt;a href=\"3E%20266\"&gt;3E 266&lt;/a&gt;, however, preparations to repel the invasion did not begin until early the following year. First of all, \"two of the major cities of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, both had kings who were in their minority\" (i.e. children), and &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; lacked leadership due to a political power struggle between Helena and her cousin Jilathe. The lord of &lt;a href=\"Reich%20Gradkeep\"&gt;Reich Gradkeep&lt;/a&gt; (later renamed &lt;a href=\"Anticlere\"&gt;Anticlere&lt;/a&gt;), was deathly throughout the whole of 266 before he finally died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;. In short, there were no &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; leaders from its traditional sources able to unite the provinces against the Camoran Usurper. Of the other leaders who had any influence, even minor influence, at least eight (the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Traitors\"&gt;Eight Traitors&lt;/a&gt; of legend) made secret allegiances with the Usurper in order to have their lands protected.\nThe second reason why there was a lack of urgency about meeting the threat faced was a breakdown in relations between the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the High Rock province. The reason for this was that the emperor &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, with sympathies towards &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and for the first time in the Septim Empire, the ruler did not overly favor the Bretons, nor had spent their childhood there, and for this reason, they supported the Usurper, being as he was, the archfoe of the hated Emperor.\nBattle of Firewaves.\nIt is known that at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Firewaves\"&gt;Battle of Firewaves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, the Camoran Usurper finally reached his end. It is also known that today the Barony is much larger than it was in &lt;a href=\"3E%20267\"&gt;3E 267&lt;/a&gt;, when the battle occurred, and at that at the time, it did not even possess a major sea port, although it did have a tiny dock, which caught on fire, and probably gave the battle its name. During the battle, Othrok's forces managed to prevent him from entering the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, so instead he went through the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually reached the township.\nDuring the battle, the Baron Othrok had allies in the rulers of &lt;a href=\"Ykalon%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Ykalon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phrygias%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Phrygias&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kambria%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Kambria&lt;/a&gt;. It was these allies that changed a popular misconception about the Usurper, which was that he wished to free the people from the Empire, who resented that the Emperor at the time was a Nord and once he had, he was soon able to assemble the second largest navy that &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; had ever seen, which is comparable only with that of the ill-fated Navy of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20V\"&gt;Uriel Septim V&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nThe pirate &lt;a href=\"Torradan%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Captain Dugal&lt;/a&gt; notes with regret in &lt;a href=\"3E%20286\"&gt;3E 286&lt;/a&gt;, after the defeat of the Usurper, Imperial naval commodores were able to focus once more on pirate threats such as the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. It also saw an increase in hostility towards the seemingly ineffective empire, from the regions of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. It had a major impact on the history of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, however, even making its way into the fictional story of \"&lt;a href=\"Hallgerd%27s%20Tale\"&gt;Hallgerd's Tale&lt;/a&gt;\". The Camoran Usurper also supposedly left behind a son, &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, who would later play a significant role in . Also, in &lt;a href=\"Dwynnen\"&gt;Dwynnen&lt;/a&gt;, the Barony where the defeat of the Usurper occurred, a Holiday is held ever year called &lt;a href=\"Othroktide\"&gt;Othroktide&lt;/a&gt;, paying homage to the famous first Baron of the town."}

Once Marlene sees it, through the keyhole, she says \"Ew. That's gross.\" She will then let the Vestige in reluctantly.\nEscort Marlene back to her her brother, who is grateful she is safe. They need to get back to Camlorn quickly, and will give the Vestige 84 as a token of gratitude before leaving."}

In , a canon may contain a set of games, texts, and other publications that developers and/or fans consider to be inherently more important, valuable, or authoritative than works outside the canon. Works in a canon are called canonical in the context of that canon, and works outside it are non-canonical. Informally, a canonical work may simply be called a \"canon\" work.\nCanonicity does not correlate 1:1 with the idea of objective \u2014two works may both be canonical under a particular definition of canon while also contradicting each other. However, the truth value of \"non-canonical\" ideas within a specific canon, sometimes referred to as \"fanon,\" is often considered NULL by default\u2014as opposed to TRUE or FALSE\u2014unless a canonical work says the same thing.\nAlthough the \"canonical authors\" of the series are generally accepted to be any &lt;a href=\"ZeniMax%20Media\"&gt;ZeniMax Media&lt;/a&gt; company, including &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt;, the term is intentionally ambiguously defined by the game developers and has been a source of contention among the wider community for this reason. In February 2014, &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt; released \"&lt;a href=\"C0DA\"&gt;C0DA&lt;/a&gt;\", an influential but controversial text rejecting the concept as a whole.\nThe Elder Scrolls Wiki does not endorse the use of the term \"canon\" in an unqualified form, instead opting to classify documents based on their licensing status.\nUnreliable narrator.\nTo understand and , the overall \"Elder Scrolls\" series should be looked at as a set of stories written by many different people which \"document\" historical \"events.\" Although some stories are more reliable than others, they all are looked upon as part of the overall \"history.\" It should also be remembered that all of these stories are simply that\u2014stories. There are numerous errors that inevitably arise between the stories simply because different authors have their own ways of telling the story and may not have the time and resources to perfectly align the details.\nThe situation can be compared to and , or the stories of . The various \"Elder Scrolls\" tales are a group of separate but linked stories, and are told by many different authors over a period of time.\nExample canons.\nBecause the term \"canon\" is not clearly defined in \"The Elder Scrolls\", confusion may arise from conflicting uses of the term. Some common definitions used to group documents within the series are as follows, broadly listed in order from more narrow to more open.\nThe above list is not complete; the number of canons that can be constructed from a body of works is mathematically finite, but too large to document.\nDeveloper comments on canon.\nThe following archive attempts to document various developer quotes on the subject of canonicity and, by extension, the nature of the lore as a whole. While discussing the topic, developers have in different moments completely contradicted each other and even themselves. Bethesda's ultimate position on canonicity in \"The Elder Scrolls\" is subsequently dubious. Comments not directly commenting on canonicity but which bear relevance to discussions of it are also included here, such as fan input on game development.\nGavin Carter.\nWas there any player input from the last games that you directly used for Oblivion?\n\"The fans and their opinions play a large part in our decision making process. I try to read and interact with fans on our own forums and some others whenever I get the chance. Probably the three biggest areas the fans complained about in Morrowind were the lack of NPC schedules, the combat, and the tedium of traveling back and forth across the world for quests. We\u2019ve gone to great lengths to address all three areas for Morrowind. We made mounts a priority from the start primarily based on fan input. We take in all the fan input we can get \u2013 all the forums posts, the letters, the reviews, the fan sites, talking to people in stores. Ultimately, it\u2019s them who we make these games for, and they\u2019re the ones out there on the front lines, evangelizing us to the unwashed masses that don\u2019t have the first clue what the letters R, P, or G stand for, but who would probably love our games if they knew about them. The best thanks I can think to give them is to keep on listening and keep on trying to make the game as good as we can make it.\"\nCartogriffi.\nIs the Creation Club canon? (10/03/17) (UESP Discord server, #skyrim)\n\"I am not an official arbiter of Bethesda lore, but I hope you don\u2019t mind if I chime in. Creations are official releases, but it\u2019s also understandable that a site like UESP or the Imperial Library would take CC with a grain of salt. We do consider lore implications when reviewing proposals, particularly something trying to heavily enmesh itself into the world. Connections to the world are great, but we also want to avoid anything being too impactful. That is, we want things to fit into the game world, but we\u2019re also not looking to greatly expand the lore of the game. With historic items, like artifacts, simply existing can have implications for the lore. Although artifacts in Tamriel do have a habit of disappearing and re-materializing in other places. I believe this was even noted in the description of Chrysamere in Daggerfall.\"\nWhat's Bethesda's relationship to lore and canon? (10/26/17) (UESP Discord server, #lore)\n\"\u200bWe try not to make proclamations about the lore. So much of its richness comes from the fact that it's almost entirely encountered first-hand, and through texts written by in-world authors with their own biases, opinions, experience, and misconceptions.\"\nWhat about items from other games? Are those canon, too? (10/26/17) (UESP Discord server, #lore)\n\"Promotional items are sort of a category of their own.\"\nTori Dougherty.\nDo you think MKB's lore should be considered canon?\n\"\"TES lore is so big and so mysterious, and up for interpretations of all kinds. So I don't really know if anything in the game can really be called \"canon\" unless the player sees it happen!\"\"\nDouglas Goodall.\nTalking about the Lessons of Vivec, why did you write Sermon Zero? Should it be interpreted as being official lore?\n\"\"I wrote it is as a kind of \"me, too!\" after reading the 36 Sermons. It was a tribute and a refutation. I don't have any say anymore about whether it is official lore. I probably didn't leave extensive enough notes for them to make it official... I figured that, regardless of whether the 36 Sermons were true or not (something that was not decided at Bethesda when I worked there), the author (whether it was really Vivec or not) would have competition. An opposing faction. An alternate take. Note that Sermon Zero isn't actually present in Morrowind, as far as I remember. Books that are actually published in one of the Elder Scrolls games have precedence over ramblings on the forums.\"\"\nMatt Firor.\n\"So I don't have to tell you guys this, but the lore \u2013 maybe some of your readers will know this \u2013 but the lore in Elder Scrolls is never definitive, it's always told through the eyes of people that live in the world, which gives developers \u2013 not just us, but everyone that works on Elder Scrolls \u2013 certain leeway to kind of find what that person meant when they were telling the story.\"\nOne of the most common questions I get about \"The Elder Scrolls Online\" is whether its lore is considered canon in [the] broader \"Elder Scrolls\" [universe]. [Is it?]\n\"Yes, it absolutely is. We have one full-time loremaster that does nothing but work with Bethesda Game Studios to make sure that there's a consistent timeline, characters are consistent, naming is consistent. The timeline is [a] super important force to any lore. This is why we picked the time that we did for Elder Scrolls Online all those years ago when we started the project, was we wanted to pick a time where there wasn't a whole lot known about it, so we could at least tell our own stories with our own characters, and we do that. But yeah, when you start to bring in things like the Psijic Order and the history of the Altmer, yes, we're very much tied into the main lore. [...] [We work with Bethesda Game Studios] every day, yeah.\"\nPete Hines.\nHow will the books and texts released after Morrowind (e.g. Vehk's Teachings) and the teasers and reports before Oblivion (e.g. Nu-Mantia Intercept, Love Letter from the Fifth Era, etc.) be folded into the official lore and will this lore appear in-game? Was the 'Trial of Vivec' RP (which culminated in the banishing of Azura from Mundus) a semi-official conclusion of the Morrowind storyline, or can we expect to learn more of its connection to recent events, along with the true fate of Vivec/Vehk?\n\"Remember that only things that have been published in Elder Scrolls games should be considered official lore.\"\n[In reference to a fan question about and .]\n\"Yes, we consider the Elder Scrolls novels canon to TES lore.\"\nDoes Bethesda consider Obscure Texts and developer comments as \"actual lore\" or \"canon\"?(24/11/11)\n\"It depends.\"\nWhich is the canon ending to the Civil War in Skyrim? The Imperials or the Stormcloaks?\n\"As with other Elder Scrolls games(like the multiple endings to Daggerfall) the studio doesn\u2019t really force one outcome as canon. That\u2019d sort of diminish each player\u2019s choice.\"\nTodd Howard.\nAnd lastly, considering that every piece of new information is being scrutinized heavily by the TES fan base, how much weight does the online community have with the decision making process?\n\"\"The people who've bought and played our past games have a huge amount of weight, because ultimately, that's who we're making the game for. But keep in mind, we've sold millions of Elder Scrolls games, and 99% of the people who've bought our games are not online talking about them. We get phone calls, we get letters, we do our own surveys to see what they like and don't like. So we're at no loss for fan feedback. And believe it or not, we read it all. We read the forums all the time, we read all the letters, all the reviews and all the surveys. We also spend a great deal of time looking at other games, and other fan communities to see how those games are received.\"\n\"\"I can honestly say our fans are the best I've seen. I've come to realize that our games have become as much a part of our fan's lives, as it is of our lives, and that does create a bond and a responsibility to do something we are all excited about. There are obviously some issues that fans discuss where they simply don't have all the necessary info for us to really do exactly what they want. This goes for many things regarding Oblivion, because it's still in development, and people are forced to discuss things they haven't seen.\"\n\"But with regard to our past games, where the experience is there for you to play and see and comment on, feedback on that really drives us to create the next game and make it even better more than anything else.\"\nI think we had an email conversation a couple months back; you were talking about how you relate lore to real-world history. Can you talk about how you look at the lore with \"The Elder Scrolls\"?\n\"\"Yeah, I think it's important that when you look at any\u2014I think people want the answers, always, like, 'What is Truth?'\u2014but what is Truth in the history of Earth? Truth is often written by the winners, and that there are always different perspectives on what happened in history, and so we do take that approach with the lore in Elder Scrolls, where all perspectives can be correct. But which one is more correct? That's why we get in these debates over, 'Hey, what is Truth?' And so, for us, it's sort of a priority. The truth in Elder Scrolls, primarily, is what you saw on the screen.\"\n\"Like, you can read a thousand books and say, 'There are no dragons,' and if a dragon comes up on the screen, well, you saw it happen in a game. But it's not just the current games; we've got to go back to Arena, and then what was on the screen in Arena? What was on the screen in Daggerfall? What was in the manual? You know, there's things where, in the manual of Arena\u2014I think that's where they mentioned Sithis and the Dark Brotherhood\u2014so that, for us, kind of trumps, well, these other references to what the Dark Brotherhood worships. And it is hard to keep track of all of that, but that's what gives it that kind of realistic for what it is flavor.\"\nWhat are some of your opinions on fan theories out there?\n\"\"I think that they're all good. Like I said there, people want to know truth, but even my perspective is one version of truth of what happened in the history of Elder Scrolls and so forth. I would tamper their desire to have all mysteries revealed, because mysteries are good for a fantasy world to have. [...] It's kind of what I said in the panel. \"What's the order of priority?\" If you saw it on the screen that's number one, that's the most truth. If you read it in the game, that's second truth. If you read it in an official thing outside the game, in the manual, that's the third. If you read it from a fan on the Internet that's way down there, that's like not on the list, right! But that's the main three. On the screen, something you see happen, regardless of what game it is or when it came out, that for us is the primary. A book in the game is second, and then a book that's official outside the game is third.\"\"\nSo does that mean the flavor text in the new cookbook is canon? The author said she wasn't sure.\n\"Well I don't know how official that book is. It would be on the list, it would be down there. I don't know. I haven't read it. I know of its existence. But it would be on the list, but low, is what I would say. Why, what does it say?\"\nMichael Kirkbride.\n[In reference to an interview with Kirkbride that he wished to see removed from The Imperial Library.]\n\"[...] Remove the interview *in its entirety*. All of it. Gone. Or remove anything submitted by me that hasn't been published by Bethsoft. It's actually quite a lot. Go check. It's mine, it's copyrighted to me, and it's only allowed on your site through my permission.\"\n[In reference to fan contributions to the series.]\n\"\"Tamriel never belonged to Bethesda. It was the other way around. As for canon, it's really all interactive fiction, and that should mean something to everyone. That said, I appreciate and understand the stamp of \"official\", but I think it will hurt more that it will help in the long run. TES should be Open Source. It is for me.\"\"\n\"official canon\"\n\"This concept doesn't exist. [\u2026] Yup. Contributions here have already (or will) make it into games already.\"\n[In regards to a fan's D&amp;D campaign in the \"TES\" world]\n\"That\u2019s very nice to hear. And I guess that\u2019s partly what I mean\u2014 the stories you and your friends are telling around the table are just as valid as any other journey in Tamriel. To think otherwise, to think they\u2019re lesser because of terrible ideas like canon, is doing all that imagination a disservice it doesn\u2019t deserve.\"\nRich Lambert.\nWhat is it that makes The Elder Scrolls so unique and appealing to you? I.E. lore wise, gameplay wise, open-ended nature, etc.\n\"One of the things I love the most about Elder Scrolls is the lore is told from multiple perspectives... there isn't a single source of truth. That makes it feel much more believable and authentic.\"\nMark Nelson.\n\"\"As for developers taking suggestions:\"\n\"\"We read the forums. Sometimes there are good ideas; sometimes there are god-awful ideas. (Hmmm...kind of like our design meetings.) Some of the good ideas are already planned for inclusion, and have been for a long time. Some of the bad ideas have already been sufficiently mocked, and there's no reason to comment on them here.\"\n\"\"It is, of course, impossible to implement every suggestion we see on these forums. However, if we see something that makes sense, and wouldn't screw up our schedule/budget/sanity, we might include it. And there's always the possibility of things being included in the future.\"\n\"Short version: suggest away.\"\nTed Peterson.\n\"I'm merely challenging your assumption that Pete's words can only mean that Oblivion's lore is fact and unambiguous. The only thing Pete said is that the postings in this forum should not be taken as official lore. The stuff in Arena, Daggerfall, Battlespire, Redguard, Morrowind, Tribunal, Bloodmoon, and Oblivion are official lore ... and not unambiguous.\"\n\"\"I have never said [the Trial of Vivec is canon]. It might turn out to be, but I actually subscribe to the spirit of the much maligned phrase of Pete's that it's not canon unless it's in the games. The trial and the RP that sprung from it, which continues on in the \"From The Ashes\" thread, have definitely influenced some lore that subsequently appeared in Oblivion and in the PGE.\"\"\n\"I would like to propose that instead of there being a black-and-white distinction between canon and non-canon, loreists refer to Primary and Secondary Sources. A Secondary Source, such as a comment from MK or a reference in the Trial or RP, may be 100% accurate and become a Primary Source when it is later published in a game; it may remain a useful reference, such as a scholar's commentary on Shakespeare, which is informed and likely true, though not actually part of a play or sonnet; or, it may be disproved on later Primary Source evidence.\"\n\"If there are so many radically different accounts of certain historical events, how can any researcher possibly tell which accounts are true and which are not? Furthermore, does this not mean that there is no unanimously accepted history of Tamriel?\"\n\"Are there events, personalities, and histories that are in contention? Certainly. Does that mean that there are no facts that are generally accepted amongst the people of the Empire? Not at all. [...] I don't see history in Tamriel as a completely formless mass with no tentpoles or points of reference. It may be impossible for a historian to be conclusive, but that does not mean that history as a whole is a lie. The truths are there, if you look.\"\n[In reference to the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.dfworkshop.net/\"&gt;Daggerfall Unity&lt;/a&gt; project, a fan-made recreation of \"Daggerfall\" in the Unity engine.]\n\"Obviously since Daggerfall Unity isn't an official product, what I write won't be canon, but I would like it to have some value both to the developers and to the players of the game now perhaps being introduced for the first time to TES 2. [...] Any thoughts, directions, or ideas would be appreciated (with the usual caveat that even if your idea is brilliant, I might go in a different direction).\"\n\"Great questions all around, and again, to be clear, since I'm not a Bethesda employee anymore and DF:U (which I encourage everyone to check out) is not an official Bethesda game, whatever I write is not going to be canon. But if it makes sense and is perhaps surprising too, then I feel my job is done.\"\nKen Rolston.\n[In reference to a supposed database used by Mark Nelson and others to keep track of the \"canonical\" lore internally.]\n\"I know of no secret database held by Mark. I consider the Imperial library and Unofficial Elder Scrolls Page as authoritative. We had a lot of crackpot 'Franchise Mysteries', but I don't recall ever formally documenting them. That was their great charm... we never really wanted to record a singe Real Truth, and preferred to maintain the crackpot ideass as a sort of communal collective unconscious.\"\nLawrence Schick.\n[During an episode of &lt;a href=\"ESO%20Live\"&gt;ESO Live&lt;/a&gt;.]\n\"\"Elder Scrolls is different from most fantasy campaign worlds, right? I mean, the typical paradigm, you know - George RR Martin with Westeros, Tolkien with Middle Earth, the familiar D&amp;D worlds of The Forgotten Realms or the world of Greyhawk - those all have histories and backgrounds that are all laid out and they've all got some lore-daddy who decided everything and everything is 'this is how it is', so everything works within the envelope of things that are already decided.\"\n\"\"Elder Scrolls - Tamriel - does not follow that paradigm. In Elder Scrolls, all lore is delivered not from on high by revelation, but from people who live their lives in the game, in the world of the game, and based on their beliefs. So that does two things for us: It means the lore always carries not just information about what the person is talking about, but also information about the person and their culture. Because the way the lore is delivered tells you how they believe things actually work in the world.\"\n\"\"What this means, of course, is that people have different viewpoints - these viewpoints sometimes contradict each other, and so sometimes we have players saying \"alright, this person believes that, and that person believes this other thing, but which one's the real thing?\" Well\u2026 it's not a world like ours. In a world like ours, where you can sort of trust in science and say \"well yes, people have different beliefs but I know there is an objective reality.\" This is a world of myth. This is a world where reality is actually changeable, where the Divines can change not only what happens going forward, but what has happened in the past. So, you know, the idea there is an objective reality behind all these different people's opinions is not necessarily the case in the world of Tamriel. So listen to what all these different people have to say, make up your own mind, make up your own beliefs about what happened and you're as liable - since you're playing in their world and you're playing a character in their world - what you think happened is as legitimate as what that NPC thinks.\"\"\n[How should marketing materials be treated in the lore?]\n\"\"Unless it's credited to a Tamrielic source, e.g., \"According to Beredalmo the Signifier...\", marketing copy should not be considered to represent in-world lore. Safety first!\"\"\n[In a message to the community as he stepped down from his position as \"ESO\"'s loremaster.]\n\"\"Tamriel is a world where all history, past and future, is described in the ever-shifting texts of the mysterious Elder Scrolls, which tell always of what might be rather than of what is. And this is a uniquely suitable setting for a multiplayer online game that hosts players of many cultures and backgrounds. What could be better for characters in a role-playing game than an expansive world of many different cultures, each with its own history and myths, so you can be whoever you want to be? That sounds great\u2014but what should your character believe is really true? Since all the stories of this world come from characters in the setting itself, and you can listen to them and read their books, you can decide that for yourself. And whatever that is, it's as right as any other character's beliefs, player or non-player, because your character lives in the same world they do.\"\n\"\"And what your character does, and says, and believes, becomes part of that world. For you, and whoever else shares the experience, what happened is now part of the lore. The non-player characters are all there, ready to share their stories with you, but it's you who makes those stories live, because your character has agency and meaningful choices where the NPCs do not. Moreover, what your character does persists for you, and the stories you\u2019ve told and the experiences you've shared with your friends live on in your own memories. You just added to the history of Tamriel.\"\n\"And not just in your memories, because Tamriel is a world that continues in constant development, and where that world goes next depends upon what you did and how you reacted to it! The game devs pay close attention to what you liked and what you didn't. Recurring characters like Razum-dar and Naryu Virian don\u2019t come back because the game devs think they should, they recur because YOU told the game devs that your experiences with those characters were significant and memorable. What you do in Tamriel, and how you feel about what you did, steers the direction of future development.\"\n[In an interview given to the Illustrated Compendium of Aldmeri Mythogony Team, a fan project to explore the nature of Aldmeris, after he stepped down from his position as ESO loremaster]\n\"The most important thing I want to say is that you and your design group don\u2019t need the endorsement or validation from a loremaster, current or emeritus, to add to the lore of the Elder Scrolls. As long as you do your homework (and you do), and follow the rule of subjectivity, anything you decide to articulate is legitimate and within the Elder Scrolls approach to mythohistory, which embraces contributions from all different points of view. Canon is a figment; in the Elder Scrolls, if it seems right, it is right.\"\nBill Slavicsek.\n\"We follow the philosophy of the unreliable narrator throughout the game, so we make a real effort to make sure that books are written in somebody's voice. It's their opinion, and if we have an opportunity, we'll provide the opposing opinion or even a third view, because nothing is true in \"Elder Scrolls\" except your experience.\"\nLeamon Tuttle.\nKind of an interesting question, that also got posted on the forums\u2026 I guess from a lore perspective, would we ever consider community written, or community inspired, lore. Like having them be part of the process in a way, or do we strictly keep it pretty in house.\n\"\"We keep it in house, for the most part, because we don't want to, you know, step on anybody's toes. We don't want to steal things from people. And I think we've got a lot of really great ideas now. That said, one of the cool things is that when we create something, there's a response to that. And that response is almost never what we expect. Which is really neat. When I did Truth in Sequence, which is the Sotha Sil sermons or whatever, I had a very clear idea of what I was getting across. \"This is obvious,\" whatever. And then it made it out into the world, and all the folks out there in the lore community were picking it to pieces and saying \"it could mean this, or it could mean this,\" and I was just blown away. I was like, \"oh my god, it totally could mean that!\" [...]\"\n\"\"It's amazing. It's this weird, kind of miraculous thing that happens, where you create something, and you send it off into the world, and it lives its own life, and people look at it and they interpret it one way or they interpret it another. [...] As writers, it's our job to create things that people can debate. If we create something, and we say, you know, \"this is absolutely how it is,\" and we write this solid, irrefutable thing, then we failed. Because then people say, \"that's clearly the truth,\" and the debate is over. [...]\"\n\"It's a fine line. You want to provide lore that's interesting and that people can really think about, but you also want to use a light touch and let people come to their own conclusions. When somebody sees something in a way that's fundamentally different from a way that I see it, but I wrote it, that's really encouraging. That means that we've done something right.\"\nWhat advice did outgoing Loremaster Lawrence Schick give you before he left? Did he pass on his hat, literally?\n\"Lawrence also told me \u2014 told all of us, really \u2014 to use a light touch. I think all of us have an inherent desire to kind of set things in stone. We want a firm foundation to build on. But part of the genius of Elder Scrolls is its ambiguity. As the Loremaster, he had ample opportunity to force his authorial will on the material, but he didn't. He urged us all to give the lore some breathing room \u2014 to keep things open to interpretation. It's very good advice, and I plan on following it!\"\nYou've mentioned that you read fan theories and works frequently - has one ever inspired you to add something based on it, or made you change something you were working on?\n\"\"Not consciously, no. I've had my head in TES lore for a long time, and my theories are pretty much locked down at this point. But this kind of leads into the points Lawrence made in his farewell address. Even as the Loremaster, my personal theories and perspectives on the lore are not authoritative. Good lore should allow ample room for interpretation and debate. If I write something that brooks no opposition and comes off as totally irrefutable, I think I've failed as a writer.\"\n\"What I find really miraculous is how people can take a piece of text that I've written and find something in it that I never even considered. I'm a firm believer in the idea that art exists on its own, separate from the artist. The intentions of the writer \u2014 while potentially interesting \u2014 are ultimately kind of irrelevant. What matters is the text itself. So, when I see a fan lay out a compelling argument that is A) totally consistent with existing lore and the text itself, and B) completely at odds with my own thoughts of the subject, it's an amazing feeling. Every answer we provide should prompt more questions. Questions lead to contemplation and debate. Keeping that excitement and exploration going is basically the whole reason we do this stuff!\"\nHow much is your work influenced by the community?\n\"I think it's always wise to keep the community's desires in mind. [...] While we don't make a practice of including community-generated content in the game, we certainly enjoy some of it, and might provide space in official lore to keep the accuracy of the community member's work an open question.\"\nIn his farewell letter, Lawrence Schick mentioned how \"the lore is yours.\" Do you have anything you'd like to add or amend to that sentiment?\n\"\"I think it's spot-on. Even as the Loremaster, my personal interpretations of the lore are not authoritative. It's our job to provide multiple, conflicting perspectives and encourage people in the community to draw their own conclusions. How you choose to connect those dots (or not connect them) is entirely up to you.\"\n\"All creative enterprises\u2014books, movies, games, etc\u2014should ideally serve as jumping off points for the next great idea. When you lock an idea in amber and insist that it remain exactly the same, and that it conform to your personal preferences, you're basically strangling it to death. The Elder Scrolls belong to everyone, and as long as we provide inspiration for your creative expression and fan-debates, I'd say we're doing the job well.\"\n[Posted from his personal Twitter account.]\n\"I've been receiving a lot of lore questions from the community on Twitter recently. It's really great to see your theories and ruminations! Unfortunately, I can't provide answers personally via social media. The Elder Scrolls is a unique franchise in that the lore is always delivered through a figure in the universe itself. By answering questions personally, I would be enforcing a top-down authoritative answer. This runs counter to the subjective, unreliable nature of our lore.\"\nWould there be any way to reach you outside of social media to ask you a question regarding ESO lore more privately?\n\"Elder Scrolls lore only reveals itself in character dialogue, writing, etc. But I guarantee people on the Teslore reddit or other TES social groups would love to help you out/give your theories a hearing.\"\n[In reference to questions about intentionally ambiguous aspects of the lore]\n\"Haha! These are spectacular (and very specific) questions, that I can't answer without upending the relationship between you and the unreliable narrator. I'm sure you'll find a million theories on the teslore reddit and elsewhere.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on the more obscure aspects of lore, like Michael Kirkbride's writings and forum roleplays?\n\"Are you kidding? I love obscure lore! I'm a big fan of the 36 Lessons, and I love reading reddit apocrypha, etc. TES is an amazing franchise, and it's always exciting to see enthusiastic fans participating in its continued growth.\"\nWhat is lore to you in the games? You are now the master of the lore, so what is your kingdom?\n\"Oh, geez. For one thing it's not my kingdom! The kingdom belongs to many, many people. But, uh, yeah, it's the really, really important stuff that kind of happens underneath, the basic activities. So it's kind of the context in which everything happens. I think it's cool to really dig into that stuff. Because if you\u2019re creating a living world, a world that people actually inhabit, they have to have stuff to talk about, they have to have shared cultural narratives and things that they can all be able to speak intelligently [about] to each other.\"\nIt sounds like you're saying it's the way the characters experience the things in the game world, right?\n\"Yeah, I think so. [...] everything that the player gets is through the lens of one of those characters, right? There's nobody outside of the game saying, 'it's XYZ, and that's just how it is,' or whatever. So you have to have a really solid understanding of how people in that universe think because that's how you're getting the information.\"\n\"I'm a very big proponent in real life of [...] truth, right? [...] You can pile stuff on top of it, but at the end of the day, there's this hard nugget of actual stuff that we're all trying to get to. And it's a little bit more loosey-goosey in Elder Scrolls because it is a fictional universe. So I think it's tough to say where there's a specific, discrete, truthful event that happened. And we're all kind of getting at it, because it didn't actually happen, it's a fictional event.\"\nMiscellaneous.\nThe following quotations, while from official sources, have unknown authorship.\n\"We are working closely with the Bethesda Softworks team to ensure all #ESO lore is historically accurate and canon-appropriate.\"\n\"The events in #ESO are canon, but the game is a new MMOG (not ES6).

She requests that they retrieve it for her and bring the culprit to justice.\nWalkthrough.\nOn approaching the widowed Countess Valga, the Hero will see that the death of her husband was quite recent and compounded by the loss of his portrait, which she said to be her last reminder of him. She wants the painting recovered and the thief brought to justice, but warns that accusing the wrong person will bring her wrath down on the accuser. After that, she hands over the key and tells the Hero to start searching the restricted areas of the castle and question all possible witnesses.\nQuestion the Witnesses.\nFirst, the Hero must question the suspects. Some suspects roam the city and can be difficult to find at times; refer to the map locators to find them. The suspect are listed below:\nEither persuade or bribe the witnesses until their &lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt; is high enough that they feel comfortable talking about the item in question. One can also use &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, such as the Imperial's &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Emperor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Voice of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt;, to temporarily raise their disposition while talking with them.\nGather the Evidence.\nAfter each suspect has been questioned, the Hero must search the castle for clues to the painting's whereabouts and will more than likely be led to believe that one piece or another is located in a different part of Cyrodiil and start chasing ghosts all over the province, but all the evidence is in Castle Chorrol. There are three pieces of evidence:\nEven if one is able to detect the thief through the interviews alone (two witnesses gives clues on the weather that makes the suspect's alibi an obvious lie), an accusation too early in the investigation will get one nowhere. All three pieces of physical evidence must be gathered before confronting the thief and advancing the quest.\nConfront the Thief.\nWhen all three pieces of evidence are collected, confront and accuse Chanel.\nAt this point, one must have a high disposition with Chanel (70+) in order to find out her true intentions. Once her disposition is high enough, Chanel will reveal that she deeply loved the Count and was the portrait's original painter. After the Count's death, the Countess spent so much time with the painting it began to make Chanel jealous; however, she feels ashamed for what she has done and gives the painting back to the Hero.\nReport back to the Countess who will ask who was accused. At this point, the Hero can either truthfully declare that Chanel was the thief or lie and state that neither suspect was guilty and that the painting must be in the possession of someone outside the Castle."}

Words ain't never earned me no gold, so theys worthless to me - that's why ye have quartermasters and first mates. But I'm gonna be settin' my last thoughts down here on paper, cause I ain't got much time left here and it's ev'ry old man\u2019s right to have his words heard.\nNow, me business was fightin', sailin', and lootin'. I became a leader of sailin' men, the most feared in hist'ry, or so they tells me. Now, b'fore ye be gettin ahead o' yerself, let me be warnin ye that me tale does not end well as I\u2019m sure ya can see from wherever ye found me rotten bones in this gods cursed cavern.\nI was born in a little town on the north coast o' Skyrim called &lt;a href=\"Dunbarrow\"&gt;Dunbarrow&lt;/a&gt;.

Fell in with a few crews here an' there, an' after a time got myself hired on as midshipman on Cap'n &lt;a href=\"Kaladas\"&gt;Kaladas&lt;/a&gt;'s rig. A' course, Kaladas was a drunkard and the damn fool ran his own ship a'ground in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; a'fore we could any real piratin' done. So embarrassed were he that he drank hisself to death in one of the pisshole taverns in this flat little seawater town.\nSo there I were, in a backwater port when the war against the Usurper broke out. I were out on hire with a rickety tub and her worthless rot of a cap'n when The Imperial Navy stole ev'ry private ship in port to go an' fight their war. We was comin' back in to dock when we heard about it. Now, only a fool doesn't bite when he smells blood in the water and that cap'n o' ours was gonna hand his rudder over to the Navy. The rest of us, well, we didn't so much like that.\nWe cut his throat and tossed his worthless carcass to the depths for &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herm'us Mora&lt;/a&gt; to feast on. The rest of us put keel to this mudhole and broke for the nearest cove to lay low for a while.\nNow, the thing that I learned about war is that it's profit'ble for just about everyone except for the poor bastards that actually have to go an' fight it. While the Navy were busy puttin' down the rev'lution, they were too busy to worry about a bunch o' pirates runnin' up and down the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. And even better for us, the Navy was needin' a stream of supplies up in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to fight and dinna have the ships to escort 'em..\nIn case you don't be knowin', cargo vessels without escort is a pirate's best friend.\nIn just a couple of years, I had ev'ry buccaneer from here to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; flyin' under me flag. We had dozens of ships and crew and more men joined on e'ry day. Soldiers and sailors, castoffs from the war, escaped prisoners -- they were the best cutthroats and sons o' whores that a pirate cap'n could ever wish for. It brings a tear to me eye to think of 'em all.\nBut even better than the men were the ships: Captured navy cutters. Refitted priv'teer Galleons. Even had a few of them &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bosmer&lt;/a&gt; ships with the funny living sails in my fleet. The finest ship I saved for meself. \"The Black Flag\". Ye'll find her rotting hull around here. She don't look like much now, but I can tell ye that in her day, there weren't no vessel she couldn't out run.\nAll these men and ships, we called ourselves the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. The merchant ships called us death on the seas.\nWe gots to be so feared that most crews jus' abandoned ship when they seen our flag on the horizon. With no Navy to stop us, Captain Torradan ap Dugal and the Red Sabre was known all over the east.\nNow, I ain't one to brag, but the empire had a bounty on me of forty thousand coins. Now that's somthin' to be proud of. A' course, the poor bastards couldn't never collect on it. Anvil being the wretched den that it is - an mos' sailors there worked for me anyhow -- the Legion couldn\u2019t never get no one to give me up.\nI wish those days coulda lasted fore'er, but you know how it is, friend. Ain't nothing good can ever last."}

Sure, we had plenty of food down here. It lasted for years, but all this time in the wet and the dark, I got somethin' nasty growin' in me. What a terrible way to die\u2014not on the end of an enemy's cutless, but because of some damned sickness. No seafarin' man should die like this. At least I can still hear the water.\nBut I was tellin' the story of how I got mine, weren\u2019t I?\nI curse the day that the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Cameron Usurper&lt;/a&gt; died at that war ended, 'cause it was that day that Commodore &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; turned 'is attention to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sabre\"&gt;Red Sabre&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of months after the war, that fat pompuss bastard decided to come down here to &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and take up port in my town, lookin' to break up the Red Sabre. The Emperor gave him whatev'r he asked for to campaign again' us, despite the coffers bein' empty from the war in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Umbranox couldn't get what he needed from my men in Anvil, he set out lookin' all over the Abecean Sea for the Black Flag. There are hundreds of islands In the Abecean, and he landed a crew on each one. He rooted out my men when he could find them, hung those who weren't willin' to go peacefully and jailed those who laid down arms.\nNo matter for many ships and men it cost him, he kept comin' with more and more. We couldn't never get ahead of him and we couldn't never mount a counterattack. It took him four years and a hell of a lot of ships, but that sea rat finally tracked me down.\nIt were me own fault, anyway. If I never made the mistake I made, he'dve died before he found me. But a man has to stand up for his mistakes, no matter if it cost him. Besides, ain't like I\u2019ll be foolin' ye, since yer likely starin' at me bones as yer readin' this.\nUmbranox had his main force out of port followin' a lead that I planted. I set sail back to Anvil, hopin' to catch him off guard, capture the boats he left behind, and fight him with his own ships in Anvil Bay. Ha! Can you imagine the look on his pig's face if it'dve worked? I thought I'd finally get the whoreson to show his face in a proper fight. I shoulda known, but he had men waitin' there for me.\nWe fought like hell, but we were trapped in the bay. The Navy men set the town on fire to keep us from fleeing onto land. I\u2019m sure that the fine citizens of Cyrodiil dinna weep for the torching of a town of thieves.\nThe main force of Imperial dogs held us until Umbranox showed up in his flagship. Umbranox fought me to the last ship and in the end, the Bay was filled with sunken and burning boats. If I weren't fightin' for me life, I'dve probably thought it were beautiful. So, the Black Flag and Umbranox\u2019s rickety tub were the only ones that were still floatin' and fightin' when dawn come. So, I did what any pirate with sense would do - I tried to run.\nNow understand, I'm a right bastard in me own way. I'm a pirate, a murderer, a thief, and I certainly ain\u2019t never believed in a fair fight. But there's a line and an unspoken code between sailin' men and Umbranox went too far. He had mages on his ship. Mages ain't never been allowed on my boats. They're no good, bad luck, an' I don\u2019t trust 'em. Turns out, I was right.\nI cut across the south side of the bay, along the huge cliff wall that used to be there. I had me helmsman stay as close as he could to the cursed cliff. I could hear those mages from the deck of Umbranox's ship, yellin' some nonsense into the wind. A few rocks fell onto my deck, a few more, and then the whole bloody cliff came crashin\u2019 down on top o' me.\nNow, don't you worry, I didn't die just then. The cliff collapsed around the ship, makin' this damned cavern. Better the it just fell on us, but no. It sealed the Black Flag, her crew, and me under tons of rock.\nWe were buggered."}

I guess I should be gettin' to the last bit o' me story.\nMe and me crew were trapped down here, never to see the light again or some rot. We tried diggin' out. We tried blastin' out. We tried callin' to the nines and the &lt;a href=\"daedric%20princes\"&gt;daedric princes&lt;/a&gt; for help. Nothin' worked. Some o' the men went crazy when we figured out that there were no gettin' out, but most of us just accepted what fate had dealt us. We made the hulk o' the Black Flag into the best home that we could and tried makin' a life of it down here.\nWe had plenty of stores with us and since most of the crew were killed in the fight, it was more than enough to go around. I will tell you though, that you ain't known suffering until you ate nothin' but hard rations for twenty-some years. All the pain I ever caused anyone has been paid back to me tenfold in havin' to eat the same filth every day for the whole time I been down here.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Grim\"&gt;Grim&lt;/a&gt; died off.\nGrim was the first and one by one, the boys had been droppin' off. They all got the same sickness I ended up with. We buried 'em when we could, threw 'em in the water when we didn't have strength to bury 'em. Finally, we jus' made 'em walk to the far side of the cavern a couple of days before the sickness ran its course.\nI'm the last, an' I suppose that makes sense. The great cap'n Dugal, defeated by &lt;a href=\"Fasil%20Umbranox\"&gt;Fasil Umbranox&lt;/a&gt; and buried alive forever. I wonder what became of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. Prob'lly let it burn and swept the ashes into the sea. Umbranox prob'lly went back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to pat himself on the back and be rewarded with lands an' titles.\nLike I said way back in the beginnin', I don't expect nobody to ever read this but if by chance someone does find my carcass down here in this pit, do an old seaman a favor. Track down whatever descendents that fat old sack Umbranox may have and tell 'em that Torradan ap Dugal says hello."}

It is a somewhat general term for someone in authority, and may be used to describe a commander within an army, the lead officer on board a ship, or the head of a City Watch.\nMilitary use.\nA captain in an army is usually a rank below a commander. In the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a captain commands a smaller unit of soldiers, usually for missions that require a smaller force. While the title is common in the Imperial army, it also applies to the leaders of a City Watch. Captain of the Guard is a title accorded to the head of a city's regiment who oversees all guard activities within the area. The position often holds a level of importance in terms of running a city or state's affairs, as well. For example, &lt;a href=\"Burd\"&gt;Burd&lt;/a&gt;, the respected Guard Captain of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, is known to be an advisor of sorts to the countess of that time, &lt;a href=\"Narina%20Carvain\"&gt;Narina Carvain&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to being a term for ground troops, the title of captain is also given to the commander of a ship in the Imperial Navy.\nNautical use.\nThe term captain also applies to the person in command of a non-military ship. Merchant ships, travel ships, and pirate ships all were commanded by a captain. For a pirate ship, captain was also a term of respect. The captain was considered the most seasoned of all on the crew, and deserved the greatest reverence. Pirate captains were often cruel and merciless, but also held a great love for their ship and its crew."}

Yet &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; saw fit to throw us off course, and now we find ourselves stranded in a fog, with no sun or stars to guide us. The crew is blaming the young navigator, K'avir, for steering us into it. In truth, I only brought him on board because the Captain took ill, and we were desperately short on men.\n4th of Hearthfire, 3E 39\nOne of the members, Asif, says he was once a Priest of Arkay, and used to perform the rites. He believes the former Captain was murdered. I'll keep this between him and I until I know more.\n22nd of Hearthfire, 3E 39\nI've kept the date by marking back of this journal. But there are times I forget, and in truth I don't know if it's the 22nd of Hearthfire or the 1st of the New Year.\nBut the cold is enough to tell us that winter is on its way. We'll need to find land soon, as the men are getting desperate. There's been three fights over rations in the past week. Worse yet, I'm starting to lose my head. There are times I look west and see the golden sands of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt; on the curve of the horizon. I have to force myself to look away, knowing there's nothing there.\n2nd of Frostfall, 3E 39\nWe finally managed to find land in this barren frost. The men are joyous. Based on the markings in the grotto, it looks like we've reached &lt;a href=\"Blackbone%20Isle\"&gt;Blackbone Isle&lt;/a&gt;, an old pirate den of all things. Many of us were corsairs before we pledged ourselves to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps coming here was more than luck. Either way, we can't be far from the mainland now. We'll head south for Skyrim in the morning.\n3rd of Frostfall, 3E 39\nWe are a crew of dead men, and this ship is our tomb.\nThe entrance collapsed in the middle of the night, sealing us inside. Still, we might've found a way back to shore, had the &lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;Forebear&lt;/a&gt;, K'avir, not sabotaged the skiffs. It's my crime as much as his, for I'm the one who brought him on board.\nFor his part, the Forebear made no attempt to resist or escape. In fact, he readily admitted to the deed, as well as the death of our former Captain. He wanted us to know exactly who he served, so that every Crown that nowhere in Tamriel was safe.\nWe put him in the brig and left him to rot. Some of the men wanted a more creative punishment, but the reality is there's no worse fate than the one he doomed us to.\n5th of Frostfall, 3E 39\nThe situation is dire. The food stocks are depleted, and half the men are crippled with fever. The crew have no delusions about what comes next. But we can still die with purpose.\nBefore the old Captain died, he told me that the sabre on his wall belonged to &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus&lt;/a&gt; himself, and that it was worth more than a thousand ships full of plunder.\nI never asked how he knew Cyrus, or how he came upon his sword. But I know that protecting the hero's legacy was important to him, and now that honor falls to us.\nI gave each man a choice. Some opted for the drink, others chose a more dramatic exit. As we depart, we will pray to Arkay to bind our souls to the ship, just as &lt;a href=\"Prince%20A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt; was bound &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;to a soul gem&lt;/a&gt; many years ago.\nWe will protect the relics of Cyrus, and honor the Crown. We will do in death what we could not do in life."}

Instead of &lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;arriving&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; as an invading force to be reckoned with, we wound up scattered to the four winds. I am now a captain without a command. The others that appeared with me\u2014we've been fighting or running since we got here. We finally found a relatively safe spot on the edge of a dark forest and decided to set up camp. This is the first time since we arrived that I've felt safe enough to just sit down and record my thoughts.\nTime seems to flow differently in this realm. Sometimes it feel like we've only been here for a few hours and other times I could swear we've been here for days. This mission has turned into a colossal failure. Instead of stepping through the portal together, we were thrown in all directions, strewn about like so many dry leaves in a bitter wind. Luck was with me, though. I landed in the company of &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Kamu\"&gt;Kamu&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. If only the rest of my luck had turned out as well.\nWe found ourselves in a &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Dusk\"&gt;strange ruin&lt;/a&gt; east of this camp. There were &lt;a href=\"Cold-Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;cold flame atronachs&lt;/a&gt; everywhere, intent on roasting us to a very fine blue crisp. We dispatched a couple of the creatures before we were forced to turn tail and run. For some reason, however, as we got close to the forest, the atronachs stopped chasing us. They suddenly seemed to lose interest in us and returned to the ruin.\nWell, I guess I should stop writing now and help finish setting up our camp. I'll write more after we get some sleep, provided nothing terrible happens to us in the interim.\nWe were awakened after a few hours (minutes? days?) of sleep by voices. There seem to be &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Walkers\"&gt;people in the shadows&lt;/a&gt; of the woods, talking, whispering. We can hear them, but the voices aren't distinct enough to make out any actual words. Or maybe it's just a language that none of us have ever heard before. I'm not sure. Every so often, though, we clearly hear something that sounds like a cry for help.\nEvery time we hear that desperate cry, we think of our missing allies. It could be some of them, lost out in those dark woods. They might be hurt, or in danger, or\u2014well, anything could be happening in there! Kamu and I have decided to head into the forest and find the source of those pitiful cries.\nI'm going to leave my journal here, in case any other members of our expedition come across this camp. We'll try to leave a trail so that you can follow our path. We're going to head west and then southwest, so follow after us if you can.\nHere's something else you need to know. Kamu discovered that if you touch one of the &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wisps&lt;/a&gt; that float among the trees, you glow and get a temporary source of light\u2014perfect for finding your way through these shadowy woods. I suggest you make liberal use of the wisps if you're going to try to meet up with us.\nWell, it's time to go. I hope to see you soon. And may &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;the eight&lt;/a&gt; watch over us all."}

It's all her fault my ship wrecked on this &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;-cursed shore! But I'm getting ahead of myself. I ought to record what happened from the beginning.\nIt started when I received word that &lt;a href=\"Governor%20Fortunata\"&gt;Governor Fortunata&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; was in the market for &lt;a href=\"Wamasu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wamasu&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the more ornery the better! She was supplying various clients throughout the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, including her own &lt;a href=\"Red%20Sails\"&gt;Red Sails Pirates&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. As luck would have it, I had recently heard about a hunter who had captured a wamasu matron and was looking to unload it for a relative pittance. The path to my disastrous destination started when I took possession of that malignant creature.\nMy crew hauled the crate, wamasu and all, into the hold. I could tell even then that the creature was cruel and calculating. It stared right into my eyes with its cold, angry orbs. I knew right then that it would be nothing but trouble as we sailed toward Anvil, but I ignored my better senses for the promise of a chest full of tainted gold. Curse my avaricious eyes!\nWe were off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; when a whale of a storm blew in. As my ship and crew were tossed about like so many dice in a cup, the wamasu decided she no longer cared for our generous hospitality. The damned creature shattered her crate like so much drift wood. Then she crashed through the hold and woe be to any of my sailors who happened to be in the way. But it didn't stop there! The hateful beast ate my ship! Beams splintered and planks snapped in the wake of her unbridled fury. I meant to go down with my doomed vessel, but fate had another idea in mind.\nI awoke floating just off shore on a chunk of debris. The wreckage of my ship was all around me, but I didn't see another living soul. No one, that is, except for the damned wamasu. It made its way to shore and immediately set about making a nest and laying eggs. Well, I'm never going to see Fortunata's gold and the wamasu is never going to see the Gold Coast. But I'll be damned if I let it raise its young on this forlorn beach! I'll kill the creature for what it did\u2014or die trying!"}

I began to depend on my apprentices for many of my daily needs, more useless than a babe clinging to his mother's skirts. Even the simple task of feeding myself began to turn into a sloppy affair. I was ever aware of these constant tremors, of this pathetically human imperfection that was forced upon me. But the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt; is the hub of innovation, of the defective turned useful once more.\nModifications are made when a mechanism is in need of a new function. Time had sundered my once steady hands with my still working mind. I did it not for vanity, but to cleanse myself of my putrid separation. To weld my broken parts together. The procedure was as painless and efficient as I had been promised, and for the price that was asked I expected no less. I slept on and off for hours afterward, my mind filled with steam. And then I awoke. Truly awoke.\nI caught sight of my gleaming palms, and I suddenly felt at peace. Calm, tranquil, I was once more a cog upon which made up the great winding. Part of the reciprocating motion, the Sublime Piston. This metal extension was a truth of my soul. Brass fingers curved in perfect synchrony, smooth and elegant. I was not simply made whole again, no. I was made far greater than I had ever been.\nI had found a truth, a singularity. I transcended mere flesh and blood.

These people see thievery as a lucrative opportunity.\nNotably, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; is the patron of thieves. She has been known to grant (or withhold) luck to or from thieves at her discretion. With her influence, a novice could suddenly be able to &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking\"&gt;pick&lt;/a&gt; an impossible lock, or a master &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;'s target could turn around at the worst possible time.\nEventually over the course of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s history, thievery became such a widespread profession that &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves guilds&lt;/a&gt; have spread throughout Tamriel's provinces, including &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. These guilds usually consist of &lt;a href=\"fence\"&gt;fence&lt;/a&gt;s, guild contacts, and several thieves serving under a &lt;a href=\"Guildmaster\"&gt;Guildmaster&lt;/a&gt;. The members are usually given jobs to do by senior members of the guild, or, at times, by the Guildmaster themselves. Though the guild and its members often have a somewhat negative reputation among other citizens, particularly guards and nobility, the guild members often greatly respect each other, usually &lt;a href=\"Trainer\"&gt;teaching&lt;/a&gt; each other the various skills they have acquired over their thieving careers.\nPerformance.\nA person's effectiveness in stealing is generally governed by their &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"sneak\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt;ing, and, in and , their &lt;a href=\"Agility\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt; skill as well. Depending on the job that is to be done, additional skills may be required, such as &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Pickpocketing\"&gt;Pickpocketing&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, &lt;a href=\"The%20Burglary%20Job\"&gt;burglary jobs&lt;/a&gt; require the thief to be skilled enough in lockpicking to pick the lock of the target's home, while &lt;a href=\"The%20Fishing%20Job\"&gt;fishing jobs&lt;/a&gt; require the thief to be skilled in pickpocketing in order to remain undetected.\nIf someone is witnessed stealing an item or pickpocketing another person, a bounty may be placed on them and all armed witnesses will become hostile. Otherwise, the victim may just comment on the theft, usually confronting the thief and asking for or taking the item back, or possibly notifying the local guard. If there are any &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s present, they may try to apprehend the thief. If the thief does not contest the arrest, either choosing to pay off their bounty or serve an appropriate &lt;a href=\"jail\"&gt;jail&lt;/a&gt; sentence, the guard will confiscate all stolen items that the thief is carrying, regardless if the items were involved in the crime in question or not.\nAll stolen items are marked with a red hand icon . In , it is marked with \"Stolen,\" in the items menu and its name is in red text when withdrawn from a &lt;a href=\"container\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;. Most &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s do not buy stolen goods, but fences and certain merchants (such as &lt;a href=\"Manheim%20Maulhand\"&gt;Manheim Maulhand&lt;/a&gt;) will, as well as merchants invested in by using the &lt;a href=\"investor\"&gt;investor&lt;/a&gt; and fence perks.\nMixing stolen and normal items.\nIf an item is in inventory that was not stolen (such as &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"potions\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) and one of the same items is stolen, it appears that all of the items in inventory of that type are stolen. This occurs because stolen and normal items are generally stacked together, and stolen items are listed first. This prevents any of those items from being sold to a merchant, even though there are one or more that were not stolen.\nThis can be resolved by selling all the stolen items to a fence. Since the stolen items will be sold first, once they are all sold, then the \"Stolen\" flag will disappear. Also, each of the stolen items can be stored in a container\u2015as soon as the stolen flag disappears, the rest can be sold anywhere.\nRemoving the stolen item flag.\nPermanently removing the stolen flag can be done several ways:\nThese methods have been patched, and no longer work:"}

{"id": "17302", "revid": "32821740", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17302", "title": "Stealth (Oblivion)", "text": "Stealth in , like in most games, can be used to sneak past enemies undetected, steal objects of value or murder either enemies or innocent without ever being caught. There is also a &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; for those who would like to put their skills in sneaking to a good, personal use. One should also keep in mind that to complete missions for these Guilds, they may need to keep raising their sneak level. Having it above Journeyman is recommended.\nUses.\nThere are several uses for stealth:\nPickpocketing.\nWhen in stealth mode it is possible steal goods from a character by selecting them. However, the player needs to note that this doesn't mean nobody can see them. It should be also noted that the heavier and more numerous (especially in the case of ) the item is, the higher the chance that the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; will be detected and a small &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; will be placed on their head. Stealing will also lower the victim's disposition towards the Hero.\nWeightless items can be placed in the inventory of characters via \"reverse-pickpocketing.\"\nWhen pickpocketing from someone who is already hostile towards the Hero, the items they steal do not seem to be categorized as stolen.\nA good tactic is to wait until the pickpocket target is asleep, which makes it possible to pickpocket items without worrying about the target moving.\nSneaking.\nMoving undetected while trespassing, staying in the shadows - these things are affected by sneak skill. However, hiding behind various pieces of furniture works just as well as previously mentioned methods along with moving behind someone, however one should take care they don't turn around and spot the Hero. A combination of these three methods is even better. One should be aware that until they reach a certain level, the weight of boots they wear will affect their sneaking ability. This can easily be avoided by simply taking off boots to sneak. Jumping can also draw unwanted attention. It is advisable to make sure that location of the person the player aims to sneak by is known so that they don't have to deal with various surprises.\nStealing.\nAny item that belongs to another character that cannot be taken without being recognized as crime will have a red hand icon (). If taken, such items can only be sold to fences of the Thieves Guild. Also, if a guard or character sees the Hero stealing something, they will have officially committed a &lt;a href=\"crime\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; and will have to flee, be imprisoned or pay a &lt;a href=\"fine\"&gt;fine&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of the latter two, all stolen possessions (except gold and quest items) will be taken from the Hero's inventory. Thus, one should avoid getting caught \"red-handed.\" Some items (usually unimportant ones, such as silverware) will lose their \"stolen\" status over time. This is represented by a partially-faded red hand icon on the item's icon in the inventory menu.\nLockpicking.\nAlthough stealth itself is not required to pick a lock, if the player is being watched while lock picking a chest marked as someone else's property or a door to a forbidden area, they may be reported to a guard and receive a small bounty. It is only necessary to be unseen \"at the exact time\" that the lockpicking is began; time stops when the mini-game begins.\nQuiet killing.\nThere are various tactics for a person looking into a stealth player.\nSneak, shoot and shank.\nThe one most preferred is the sneak, shoot, and shank. The object of this tactic is to sneak around until the enemy is found. Then, making sure the Hero is not seen, sneaking as far away as possible while still being able to get an accurate shot. Then, letting arrow fly and hoping it hits. It should be noted that, if it misses, the enemy could be alerted of the player's presence. As the enemy runs towards the Hero, they should send some more arrows at him until he reaches them. By now, at least half his health should be gone. Now, only to finish the work with blade. This is the tactic of a well balanced character using most of the stealth battle abilities.\nPoisoned dart.\nAnother tactic is the poisoned dart. In this strategy, a person will use poisoned arrows and a bow. Normally, the person doing this should sneak slowly, making sure that they will have the maximum distance possible before they have to confront their enemies. Once an enemy is spotted, they should normally look for a platform, or some cover to hide from the enemy. Then they are to launch the poisoned arrow into their enemy. If the poison doesn't kill the enemy on the spot, maybe another poisoned arrow will. The player should keep this up until the enemy is dead. This is best used in large corridors or huge chambers when there is a lot of cover. The upside is that not much health or arrows is lost and that this is the perfect way to pick off an enemy quietly. The downside is that one needs to make or buy the poison. Some useful attributes are alchemy so that the Hero can make their own poisons, marksman and sneak so that the player's enemies won't see them before they strike. In case the enemy has spotted the Hero, they should have a decent weapon and armor skill to hold on their own.\nShadow step.\nThe hardest tactic is the shadow step. The player that uses this should have a very high sneak skill and may or may not have chameleon on their armor. This person will stay in sneak almost always. If they are not in a shadow, they are either moving to another or about to ambush the enemy in front of them. Now, they can either; move and try not to be seen at all, or sneak and try to kill the enemy. The first is extremely hard, while the latter is a bit easier, but having a good weapon is advisable. If this form is chosen, night eye and detect life can be quite helpful. That way, is possible to see people coming and hide before they detect the player. This is best used in cramped corridors, or shadowy caves. A poisoned blade could also be helpful. Getting weapon and sneak level up are advisable if one is want to play like this. One will also need to be able to deal with these enemies quickly and without a sound. Alchemy and light armor can be used for making poisons and protection respectively."}
