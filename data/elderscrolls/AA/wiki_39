It was not without some regret that I bade farewell to the fleshpots of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, but I knew that the wonders I had brought back from &lt;a href=\"Raled-Makai\"&gt;Raled-Makai&lt;/a&gt; had only scratched the surface of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; ruins in Morrowind. Even more spectacular treasures were out there, I felt, just waiting to be found, and I was eager to be off. I also had before me the salutary example of poor Bannerman, who was still dining out on his single expedition to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; twenty years ago. That would never be me, I vowed.\nWith my letter from the Empress in hand, this time I would have the full cooperation of the Imperial authorities. No more need to worry about attacks from superstitious locals. But where should I look next? The ruins at Kemel-Ze were the obvious choice. Unlike Raled-Makai, getting to the ruins would not be a problem. Also known as the \"Cliff City\", &lt;a href=\"Kemel-Ze\"&gt;Kemel-Ze&lt;/a&gt; lies on the mainland side of the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfel\"&gt;Vvardenfel&lt;/a&gt; Rift, sprawling down the sheer coastal cliff. Travelers from the east coast of Vvardenfel often visit the site by boat, and it can also be reached overland from the nearby villages without undue hardship.\nOnce my expedition had assembled in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, with the usual tedious complications involved in operating in this half-civilized land, we set out for the village of Marog near the ruins, where we hoped to hire a party of diggers. My interpreter, Tuen Panai, an unusually jolly fellow for a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elf\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; who I had hired in Seyda Neen at the recommendation of the local garrison commander, assured me that the local villagers would be very familiar with Kemel-Ze, having looted the site for generations. Incidentally, Ten Penny (as we soon came to call him, to his constant amusement) proved invaluable and I would recommend him without hesitation to any of my colleagues who were planning similar expeditions to the wilds of Morrowind.\nAt Marog, we ran into our first trouble. The hetman of the village, a reserved, elegant old fellow, seemed willing to cooperate, but the local priest (a representative of the absurd religion they have here, worshipping something called the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; who they claim actually live in palaces in Morrowind) was fervently against us excavating the ruins. He looked likely to sway the villagers to his side with his talk of \"religious taboos\", but I waved the Empress's letter under his nose and mentioned something about my friend the garrison commander at Seyda Neen and he quieted right down. No doubt this was just a standard negotiating tactic arranged among the villagers to increase their pay. In any event, once the priest had stalked off muttering to himself, no doubt calling down curses upon the heads of the foreign devils, we soon had a line of villagers eager to sign on to the expedition.\nWhile my assistant was working out the mundane details of contracts, supplies, etc., Master Arum and I rode on to the ruins. By land, they can only be reached using narrow paths that wind down the face of the cliff from above, where any misstep threatens to send one tumbling into the sea foaming about the jagged rocks below. The city's original entrance to the surface must have been in the part of the city to the northeast - the part that fell into the sea long ago when the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; created this mind-bogglingly vast crater. After successfully navigating the treacherous path, we found ourselves in a large chamber, open to the sky on one side, disappearing into the darkness on the other. As we stepped forward, our boots crunched on piles of broken metal, as common in &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20ruins\"&gt;Dwarven ruins&lt;/a&gt; as potsherds in other ancient sites. This was obviously where the looters brought their finds from deeper levels, stripping off the valuable outer casings of the Dwarven mechanisms and leaving their innards here - easier than lugging the intact mechanisms back up to the top of the cliff. I laughed to myself, thinking of the many warriors unwittingly walking around Tamriel with pieces of Dwarven mechanisms on their backs. For that, of course, is what most \"&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Armor\"&gt;Dwarven armor&lt;/a&gt;\" really is - just the armored shells of ancient mechanical men. I sobered when I thought of how exceedingly valuable an intact mechanism would be. This place was obviously full of Dwarven devices, judging from the litter covering the floor of this vast chamber - or had been, I reminded myself. Looters had been working over this site for centuries. Just the casing alone would be worth a small fortune, sold as armor. Most Dwarven armor is made of mismatched pieces from various devices, hence its reputation for being bulky and unwieldy. But a matched set from an intact mechanism is worth more than its weight in gold, for the pieces all fit together smoothly and the wearer hardly notices the bulk. Of course, I had no intention of destroying my finds for armor, no matter how valuable. I would bring it back to the Society for scientific study. I imagined the astonished cries of my colleagues as I unveiled it at my next lecture, and smiled again.\nI picked up a discarded gear from the piles at my feet. It still gleamed brightly, as if new-made, the Dwarven alloys resisting the corrosion of time. I wondered what secrets remained hidden in the maze of chambers that lay before me, defying the efforts of looters, waiting to gleam again in the light they had not seen in long eons. Waiting for me. It remained only to find them! With an impatient gesture to Master Arum to follow, I strode forward into the gloom.\nMaster Arum, Ten Penny and I spent several days exploring the ruins while my assistants set up camp at the top of the cliff and hauled supplies and equipment from the village. I was looking for a promising area to begin excavation -- a blocked passage or corridor untouched by looters that might lead to completely untouched areas of the ruins.\nWe found two such areas early on, but soon discovered that the many winding passages bypassed the blockage and gave access to the rooms behind. Nevertheless, even these outer areas, for the most part stripped clean of artifacts by generations of looters, were full of interest to the professional archaeologist. Behind a massive bronze door, burst from its hinges by some ancient turmoil of the earth, we discovered a large chamber filled with exquisite wall-carvings, which impressed even the jaded Ten Penny, who claimed to have explored every Dwarven ruin in Morrowind. They seemed to depict an ancient ritual of some kind, with a long line of classically-bearded Dwarven elders processing down the side walls, all seemingly bowing to the giant form of a god carved into the front wall of the chamber, which was caught in the act of stepping forth from the crater of a mountain in a cloud of smoke or steam. According to Master Arum, there are no known depictions of Dwarven religious rituals, so this was an exciting find indeed. I set a team to work prying the carved panels from the wall, but they were unable to even crack the surface. On closer examination the chamber appeared to be faced with a metallic substance with the texture and feel of stone, impervious to any of our tools. I considered having Master Arum try his blasting magic on the walls, but decided that the risk of destroying the carvings was too great. Much as I would have preferred to bring them back to the Imperial City, I had to settle for taking rubbings of the carvings. If my colleagues in the Society showed enough interest, I was sure a specialist could be found, perhaps a master alchemist, who could find a way to safely remove the panels.\nI found another curious room at the top of a long winding stair, barely passable due to the fall of rubble from the roof. At the top of the stair was a domed chamber with a large ruined mechanism at its center. Painted constellations were still visible in some places on the surface of the dome. Master Arum and I agreed that this must have been some kind of observatory, and the mechanism was therefore the remains of a Dwarven telescope. To remove it from ruins down the narrow stairway would require its complete disassembly (which fact no doubt had preserved it from the attention of looters), so I decided to leave it in place for the time being. The existence of this observatory suggested, however, that this room had once been above the surface. Closer examination of the structure revealed that this was indeed a building, not an excavated chamber. The only other doorways from the room were completely blocked, and careful measurements from the top of the cliff to the entry room and then to the observatory revealed that we were still more than 250 feet below the present ground level. A sobering reminder of the forgotten fury of Red Mountain.\nThis discovery led us to focus our attentions downward. Since we now knew approximately where the ancient surface lay, we could rule out many of the higher blocked passages. One wide passage, impressively flanked with carven pillars, particularly drew my interest. It ended in a massive rockfall, but we could see where looters had begun and then abandoned a tunnel through this debris. With my team of diggers and Master Arum's magery to assist, I believed we could succeed where our predecessors had failed. I therefore set my team of Dark Elves to work on clearing the passage, relieved finally to be beginning the real exploration of Kemel-Ze. Soon, I hoped, my boots would be stirring up dust that had lain undisturbed since the dawn of time.\nWith this exciting prospect before me, I may have driven my diggers a bit too hard. Ten Penny reported that they were beginning to grumble about the long days, and that some were talking of quitting. Knowing from experience that nothing puts heart back into these Dark Elves like a taste of the lash, I had the ringleaders whipped and the rest confined to the ruins until they had finished clearing the passageway. Thank Stendarr for my foresight in requisitioning a few legionnaires from Seyda Neen! They were sullen at first, but with the promise of an extra day's wages when they broke through, they soon set to work with a will. While these measures may sound harsh to my readers back in the comforts of civilization, let me assure you that there is no other way to get these people to stick to a task.\nThe blockage was much worse than I had first thought, and in the end it took almost two weeks to clear the passage. The diggers were as excited as I was when their picks finally broke through the far end into emptiness, and we shared a round of the local liquor together (a foul concoction, in truth) to show that all was forgiven. I could hardly restrain my eagerness as they enlarged the hole to allow entry into the chamber beyond. Would the passage lead to entire new levels of the ancient city, filled with artifacts left by the vanished Dwarves? Or would it be only a dead end, some side passage leading nowhere? My excitement grew as I slid through the hole and crouched for a moment in the darkness beyond. From the echoing sounds of the stones rattling beneath my feet, I was in a large room. Perhaps very large. I stood up carefully, and unhooded my lantern. As the light flooded the chamber, I looked around in astonishment. Here were wonders beyond even my wildest dreams!\nAs the light from my lamp filled the chamber beyond the rock fall, I looked around in astonishment. Everywhere was the warm glitter of Dwarven alloys. I had found an untouched section of the ancient city! My heart pounding with excitement, I looked around me. The room was vast, the roof soaring up into darkness beyond the reach of my lamp, the far end lost in shadows with only a tantalizing glimmer hinting at treasures not yet revealed. Along each wall stood rows of mechanical men, intact except for one oddity: their heads had been ritually removed and placed on the floor at their feet. This could mean only one thing -- I had discovered the tomb of a great Dwarven noble, maybe even a king! Burials of this type had been discovered before, most famously by Ransom's expedition to Hammerfell, but no completely intact tomb had ever been found. Until now.\nBut if this was truly a royal burial, where was the tomb? I stepped forward gingerly, the rows of headless bodies standing silently as they had for eons, their disembodied eyes seeming to watch me as I passed. I had heard wild tales of the Curse of the Dwarves, but had always laughed it off as superstition. But now, breathing the same air as the mysterious builders of this city, which had lain undisturbed since the cataclysm that spelled their doom, I felt a twinge of fear. There was some power here, I felt, something malevolent that resented my presence. I stopped for a moment and listened. All was silent.\nExcept... it seemed I heard a faint hiss, regular as breathing. I fought down a sudden surge of panic. I was unarmed, not thinking of danger in my haste to explore past the blocked passage. Sweat dripped down my face as I scanned the gloom for any movement. The room was warm, I suddenly noticed, much warmer than the rest of the labyrinth thus far. My excitement returned. Could I have found a section of the city still connected to a functioning steam grid? Pipes ran along the walls, as in all sections of the city. I walked over and placed my hand on one. It was hot, almost too hot to touch! Now I saw that in places where the ancient piping had corroded, small jets of steam were escaping -- the sound I had heard. I laughed at my own credulity.\nI now advanced quickly to the far end of the room, giving a cheerful salute to the ranks of mechanical soldiers who had appeared so menacing only moments before. I smiled with triumph as the light swept back the darkness of centuries to reveal the giant effigy of a Dwarven king standing on a raised dais, his metal hand clutching his rod of office. This was the prize indeed! I circled the dais slowly, admiring the craftsmanship of the ancient Dwarves. The golden king stood twenty feet tall under a freestanding domed cupola, his long upswept beard jutting forward proudly as his glittering metal eyes seemed to follow me. But my superstitious mood had passed, and I gazed benevolently on the old Dwarven king. My king, as I had already begun to think of him. I stepped onto the dais to get a better look at the sculpted armor. Suddenly the eyes of the figure opened and it raised a mailed fist to strike!\nI leaped to one side as the golden arm came crashing down, striking sparks from the steps where I had stood a moment before. With a hiss of steam and the whir of gears, the giant figure stepped ponderously out from under its canopy and strode towards me with frightening speed, its eyes tracking me as I scrambled backwards. I dodged behind a pillar as the fist whistled down again. I had dropped my lantern in the confusion, and now I crept into the darkness outside the pool of light, hoping to slip between the headless mechanisms and thus escape back to the safety of the passageway. Where had the monster gone? You would think that a twenty-foot golden kind would be hard to miss, but he was nowhere to be seen. The guttering lamp only illuminated a small part of the room. He could be hiding anywhere in the gloom. I crawled faster. Without warning, the dim ranks of Dwarven soldiers in front of me went flying as the monstrous guardian loomed before me. He had cut off my escape! As I dodged backwards, blow after blow whistled down as the implacable machine followed me relentlessly, driving me into the far corner of the room. At last there was nowhere left for me to go. My back was to the wall. I glared up at my foe, determined to die on my feet. The huge fists lifted for one final blow.\nThe room blazed with sudden light. Bolts of purple energy crackled across the metal carapace of the Dwarven monster, and it halted, half-turning to meet this new threat. Master Arum had come! I was about to raise a cheer when the giant figure turned back to me, unharmed by the lightning bolt hurled by Master Arum, determined to destroy this first intruder. I shouted out \"Steam! Steam!\" as the giant raised his fist to crush me into the floor. There was a hiss and a gust of bitter cold and I looked up. The monster was now covered with a shell of ice, frozen in the very moment of dispatching me. Master Arum had understood. I leaned against the wall with relief.\nThe ice cracked above me. The giant golden king stood before me, the shell of ice falling away, his head swiveling towards me in triumph. Was there no stopping this Dwarven monstrosity?! But then the light faded from his eyes, and his arms dropped to his sides. The magical frost had worked, cooling its steam-driven energy.\nAs Master Arum and the diggers crowded around me, congratulating me on my narrow escape, my thoughts drifted. I imagined my return to the Imperial City, and I knew that this would be my greatest triumph yet. How could I possibly top this find? Perhaps it was time to move on. Recovering the fabled &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Argonia\"&gt;Eye of Argonia&lt;/a&gt;... now that would be a coup! I smiled to myself, reveling in the glory of the moment but already planning my next adventure.\nTrivia.\nFor some unknown reason, the last 3 paragraphs of \"Part 3\" are also the first 3 paragraphs of \"Part 4\" in edition."}

{"id": "27931", "revid": "26459635", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27931", "title": "Exploits (Oblivion)", "text": "Exploits are unintended, emergent mechanics of a game that players can make use of to acquire resources, speed up leveling, make use of flaws in the world design or engine, or otherwise break the game to benefit their character or have fun.\nThe exploits listed here fall into three basic categories: exploiting known bugs, using internal &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;, and means to abuse the game engine without actually \"breaking\" any rules.\nConsole commands.\nThe PC version of the game gives players access to the debugging console, which is typically used by employees when play testing the game. As such, the console allows the player to directly manipulate the game world in ways not normally intended. To access the console, press the tilde key, '~' (usually, next to the 1 key). This will pause the game and display the console cursor, and any recent commands that may have been run.\nSome users may have trouble bringing up the console. It is said that in such cases the ' or @ key may work, or the key directly left of the 1 (assuming that's not the ~ key.) Also, there is a known issue with Windows Media Center edition, when the infrared unit is connected to the USB port when you boot your system, you cannot access the console (or, apparently, use the ~ key at all) until you unplug the unit and reboot.\nGold and items.\nThe AddItem console command allows the player to add any number of any item in the game directly to the inventory. The command looks like this:\n \"actor\".AddItem \"itemid\" \"amount\"\nThe term actor here just means an object that represents some character in the game. The word also appears in many of the commands that affect NPCs, but for these purposes, the global actor name player always refers to the player's character. The ItemID for gold is . The leading 0's to the ItemID are not necessary, so all that would have to be entered is the letter F. Item IDs for most other items can be found in the list mentioned above. So, to endow the player with an additional 1000 gold, the command to enter is:\n player.additem 0000000F 1000\nOr, alternately without the leading 0's, the command would be:\n player.additem F 1000\nNote that calling AddItem with no parameters will make a complete copy of the player character itself. Do not attack this clone, as it belongs to all of that already joined guilds and there will be the usual repercussions.\nThere is a way to get unlimited money on consoles. Find a person named &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dorian&lt;/a&gt; in Imperial City (Talos Plaza district). Make sure some money is possessed, persuade him but drop his approval, then bribe him. The more money he is bribed by, the faster the rate the player's money goes up. Then kill him and loot his corpse, but don't take it all as the game may freeze. His money won't run out until his corpse disappears. This is a good way to get into the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, as Dorian is useless.\nSkills and attributes.\nSeveral commands exists that let you alter the skills and &lt;a href=\"Attributes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; of your character. The ModPCAttribute and MODPCSkill command (abbreviated modpca and modpcs) allow you to increase an attribute or skill on the player character. Set SetActorValue function (abbreviated setav), when called on the player object, allows you to directly set the value of an attribute or skill. (Note that SetActorValue can also edit other information about your player, such as your bounty, chameleon level, magic resistances, etc.)\nThe difference between the two methods for changing your skills involves the levelling process. When you use ModPCSkill to raise a skill, it doesn't actually advance your \"usage count\" to the minimum needed for that level. This technically gives you \"negative\" progress towards your next skill increase. Using completely made-up numbers, if you needed to cast 50 spells to raise Destruction, and you had already cast 25 of them, using ModPCSkill to raise Destruction would mean you had -25 uses. This means you'd need to cast 25 more spells just to get your progress meter back to 0. Using SetActorValue in this same case would leave you with 25 uses out of whatever the new total needed was. On the other hand, ModPCSkill increases count towards your character level, while SetActorValue increases do not.\nA word of warning: Trying to set values over 255 will roll them back to zero. Negative numbers also work, though they may cause unstable behavior (especially if you lower a skill or attribute below the minimum requirements for your current skill level, class, etc.).\nThese commands are used like so:\n ModPCAttribute \"attribute\" \"increase\"\n ModPCSkill \"skill\" \"increase\"\n \"actor\".SetActorValue \"valuename\" \"newvalue\"\nFor example, to raise your Strength by 15, your Marksman by 25, make yourself a master in security, and give yourself a permanent 200 foot Detect Life condition:\n modpca Strength 15\n modpcs Marksman 25\n player.setav Security 100\n player.setav DetectLifeRange 200\nTargeted commands.\nIn some cases, you can execute commands on other objects in the world. The easiest way to do this is to enter the console while the object (item, corpse, NPC, etc.) is on screen, and while the game is paused, click on them. The item's name and ID will appear across the top of the screen. Certain commands will automatically affect the targeted item, such as:\nMiscellaneous commands.\nA number of other console commands can be used to alter the basic game behavior. The most frequently used commands are:\nFinish the main quest in 20 minutes.\nTo finish the main quest in twenty minutes, several paintbrushes will be required.\nAfter this, the main quest has been completed and the ending of the game will be shown.\nKnown bugs.\nSome bugs commonly used to exploit the game are:\nNote that bugs are constantly being fixed by Bethesda, so these exploits may not always work on the latest patch. See the bugs article for more details.\nExploits.\nExploits are degenerate strategies that tend to emerge from complex systems. Whether or not a strategy can be considered an exploit can be a bit of a judgment call, since exploits are not, strictly speaking, cheats: they are part and parcel of the rules of the game.\nSome strategies will seem \"unrealistic\" when compared to the theme of the game, but still be balanced within the abstract scope of the game mechanics. Other exploits will make total perceivable sense, but undermine the balance of the game.\nArena.\nTo gain an unfair advantage against an opponent in an &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Arena match&lt;/a&gt;, simply jump and toggle sneak mode while turning backwards toward the right wall, near the entrance.\nIf this is performed before or during the countdown, it will be possible to glitch through the wall and fall out of the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20District%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;; then try to move forward while falling and it will spawn the player in the middle of the ring a few seconds ahead of the opponent, allowing extra time to prepare and hide.\nLeveling.\nThere are a number of techniques for leveling specific skills without using them in any productive manner. Some of these techniques are obviously against the \"spirit\" of the game, while others may be completely reasonable for your character. One word of warning: some of these exploits can allow you to level your skills unattended. If you raise a skill too many levels at once, you will effectively be wasting attribute bonus points on your next character level, since those max out at +5.\nYou can also go to Tove The Unrestful's house in Bliss. Go upstairs to Tove's \"skyboat.\" It will have a \"roof\" of sorts over the boat. Stand just under the edge of the \"roof\" and jump repeatedly while pushing forward toward the boat slightly. This will allow you to raise your acrobatics fifty to sixty levels within as little as half an hour.\nYou can also go to the Bruma Mages guild, go to the left of the main room and up the stairs. Repeatedly jump on the banister whilst pushing forwards.\nIn the Imperial City Waterfront, Go on to the Pirate ship. Where all of the Pirates attack you the first time you arrive. Go into the Captain's room, and stand on his bed. Look towards the wall painting, if done correctly, you'll jump and land in a very short amount of time, increasing your Acrobatics quickly.\n&lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;: Burden, Feather, Water Breathing, Water Walking, Shield, or variant shield spells\n&lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;: Bound Items or Turn Undead (if it can be cast on self)\n&lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;: Damage Health or Corrode Armor or Weapons (if you want to get Armorer up as well)\n&lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;: Chameleon, Invisibility or Charm\n&lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;: Soul Trap or Dispel\n&lt;a href=\"Restoration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Restoration&lt;/a&gt;: Most anything, really. Heal, Absorb, Restore, etc.\nThe following techniques can also be used to rapidly raise skill levels, but arguably fall within the realm of expected behavior for a player character. As such, they are not always considered exploits:\nKilling by blocking.\nThe intended feature:\nIf you have a high disposition with someone, you can &lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;yield&lt;/a&gt; to them immediately after attacking them (hold \"Block,\" and press (A) or \"Activate\" while facing the character). The character will say something like \"I accept your yield\" and go back to passive behavior. The yield was introduced so that accidental attacks on friends could be \"un-done,\" rather than having to reload due to a simple mistake.\nThe exploit:\nYou can keep attacking and then yielding to a friendly/neutral NPC until they are dead! Both their health \"and\" disposition are lowered by attacks; if they are attacked at low disposition, they will refuse to yield, persuasion or bribes will raise it again. Couple this with sneak attacks to drain their health faster.\nNote that if you do this in cities, the city guard will inevitably try to find you as it counts as an assault. You should have enough time to kill most people within their houses with this method, though.\nKilling by summoning.\nIf you need to kill an NPC, especially guards, without getting a penalty, a quick way is to summon a high level Daedra and make it go rogue. Dremora work especially well, as they are strong, use both melee and magical attacks, and are universally considered 'evil' by NPCs. Simply summon the Dremora near a guard and punch it three times. It will go rogue, and the guard will run in to help. You can then step back and let the Dremora wear the guard down, and repeat as needed. Beware! It is unknown in other versions of the game, but, on the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, if you force a summoned creature to go rouge, and it kills someone, the guards will see that you caused the creature to go on a rampage, and, because its your creature, you are liable for its actions, and you will get a 1000 gold blood price for murder, and since you didn't actually attack the person, you save 40 gold from assault charges, but you still have to pay the price for murder if someone was killed. Note that not all creatures are considered evil by all NPCs.\nKilling by raging.\nCreate or buy a Frenzy Spell of fairly high level (Touch of Rage is a good one) and cast it on someone you want to kill. Casting the spell on the person is not considered a crime, and it will cause them to attack you, so fighting back and killing them won't be considered a crime either. This is good for Dark Brotherhood Quests, as it will allow you to do them without upping your infamy. Does not work on guards.\nFree Daedric equipment.\nThere are at least three known methods for getting \"free\" high-level Daedric equipment. Two methods involve tricking the game into allowing you to drop a bound item. Under normal circumstances, the game will not allow you to drop conjured equipment, or even unequip it. Attempting to drop the item fails with a message that it cannot be dropped; even simply sheathing the weapon causes it to vanish. However, using one of the following techniques, you will be allowed to drop the item onto the ground. When the spell ends, the game attempts to remove the item from your inventory, but it is no longer where it should be, and so it is never removed from the game.\nThe first method requires access to an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;, such as the one at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;. This technique only works for creating permanent weapons, as follows:\nThe second technique works for both weapons or armor, you can do it at any &lt;a href=\"Armorer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt; skill. The process is as follows:\nDamaging the equipment may be a bit tricky, as you are presumably not creating these items in the middle of combat. Since you are already a Conjurer, one easy solution is to use a summoned creature. If you can create spells, a custom Disintegrate Weapon/Armor On Self spell also works well.\nBoth techniques have the added benefit of increasing your Conjuration skill in the process. Also, if you are an expert in armorer and want to easily increase this skill, repairing these permanent items from 100% to 125% will help significantly. Repairing Daedric equipment has a larger effect than 'normal' equipment, because they have more health points than any other.\nThese items are not only very powerful weapons or armor, but unlike physical Daedric equipment, the bound items have no weight. The summoned versions of Daedric equipment still adversely affect your spellcasting effectiveness, and are somewhat more fragile than their real counterparts. The Cuirass and Greaves count as &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Heavy&lt;/a&gt;, the rest &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;; they can be repaired at any Armorer skill level, and sell for zero Septims.\nAnother way is to summon a dremora and kill it while tapping A. If done right you will search the summoned dremora and can take it's armor.\n100% Chameleon.\nJoin the Arcane University. Enchant 5 clothing/armor items with 20% &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt;. Wear them all at once. The effects will stack giving you 100% Chameleon. Now you can attack monsters all day and they will never see you or counterattack. You can also steal anything you want. If you are caught pickpocketing, you can just resist arrest and walk away from the guards. An easy way to obtain the grand souls needed is to steal a grand soul gem from the Arcane University and change it into a black, then duplicate it. Go to bandit camps and soul trap the bandits. This should give you a grand soul.\nAnother way of doing this is to enter a Plane of Oblivion, get to the Sigil Stone, save, then grab the stone. If you get the silence for x secs on target/Chameleon 30% on self stone, then all you have to do is use the item duping cheat. If you do not, reload your save and grab the stone again. Use the duped sigil stones on four un-enchanted items that are wearable, and you will have a 120% Chameleon effect. You can also achieve this with the silence for x sec/chameleon 15% sigil stone obtainable at level 8 with 7 pieces of un-enchanted armor. Then the world is your playground.\nCheap, instant kills.\nIt is necessary to have access to the Arcane University for this, but it will work for either an &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted weapon&lt;/a&gt; or a created spell.\nEnter the University, and find the Altar of Spellmaking or Enchanting and create a spell with the effect Drain 100 Health for 1 second. A Destruction skill of 25 is all that is necessary for this to work.\nUnder level 30, this will kill anything. After this level, it is likely that targets will not be instantly killed anymore. This can be worked around by adding some more damaging effects (Damage health, fatigue, etc.).\nIf this is made as an enchantment rather than a spell, the same Destruction and magicka requirement applies, and the final weapon won't require much magic to recharge.\nTo kill stronger enemies, try creating a spell with the same effect as above, though with Drain 80\u201390 Health for 2\u20133 seconds. This will be more costly, but you will be able to kill much stronger creatures.\nTry adding a weakness to magicka 100% for 1 second, as this will double the spells effects.\nPermanent boosts.\nTo gain several permanent stat/skill boosts, gain any quest item that has a constant boosting effect on it and cannot be removed (e.g. the Boots of Springheel Jak). Equip this item and either get yourself arrested or do a quest in which all your items are removed. When you get out of jail (or get your items back), you will see that the boost is still in effect but you are not wearing the quest item. You can now equip any other item in place of the quest one, but you will not be able to wear the quest item again (though the boost will remain permanently).\nThis can be done with the latest patch using scrolls:\nYou can no longer wear the item, but the effect remains on you permanently. This has not been verified on the PC version of the game.\nBe careful what you do this with, you might get permanent weight added on too!\nNear-invincible stats.\nYour character should preferably be beyond level 25 to do this!\nOne method to become nearly invincible is as follows:\nCollect the following items:\nFinal stats (plus any racial modifiers).\nAnother method is as follows:\nWith a high enough &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; skill you can make your own Reflect Damage and &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs always, the strength of these potions is determined by both your Alchemy level and the level of the equipment used. Add &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Oblivion%20Spell%29\"&gt;Shield&lt;/a&gt; spells and you're invincible.\nAnother way to become near invincible for Bretons.\nPick enough magical items to get damage reflection to 100% and the Mundane Ring. Stats shown for leveled items are the stats if you obtained them at their highest level.\nYou're now immune to magic with 35% spell reflection and immune to melee damage (you still take damage from arrows but they are easy enough to dodge)\nAnother method to be near invincible.\nTotals:\nAfter leaving the sewers go across the lake and kill the bandits, take their arrows and go to the Imperial marketplace. Sell the arrows and any other treasures in Three Brothers Trade goods then go to The Mystic Emporium and buy his grand soul gem and scrolls. Duplicate the gems then sell them back to the merchant then raise the barter to 49 (should be able to sell them 100 per) and sell them to him in batches of ten. You should be able to easy rack up cash by duplicating gems and selling them back.\nDuplication.\nThere is a much simpler way to duplicate items and weapons (that aren't one of a kind or quest items).\nTo do this unequip (if the weapon or item is equipped) and change the inventory screen to the page that holds scrolls and select one (there must be more than one of the same scroll for this to work and it must NOT be over 250 otherwise the game will lag and freeze eventually) you then go to the item you want to duplicate and drop it and when you come out of the inventory the item will drop but there will be how ever many scrolls of the same that were selected. It is a good idea to buy two of the same scroll and duplicate another which will be easier than hunting them out. Note that some items cannot be duplicated or need full health or enchantment (if enchanted) or both to be duplicated.\nAlternately, if you haven't started the Mages Guild Quest line yet, you can get 4 Beguile scrolls from Kud-Ei, I started out with 4 (providing you're in the thieves guild, Varon Vamori's disposition is either 100 or close to it) and I made it up to 1,000+ scrolls, not of the same kind, just 200 scrolls here and there. Also if you have some money (preferably 200+) or you just bribe the wife for the staff's location))."}

I've studied the letter they both began to write, reviewed the damning journal with its tales of murder-for-hire and dark rituals conducted on the dead of night.\nI've read it all, and there's only one conclusion I can come to.

The owner however is not willing to part with it.\nBackground.\n\"A shady character named Naril Heleran contacted me at Davon's Watch. He said we could both profit if I \"procured\" a rare and expensive bottle of wine for him.\"\nWalkthrough.\nSpeak to &lt;a href=\"Naril%20Heleran\"&gt;Naril Heleran&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Rededication%20Shrine%20%28Deshaan%29\"&gt;Rededication Shrine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;. He will have the following dialogue:\n\"Honor to you, traveler. Name's Naril. I'm guessing you're new in town and need some work? It's a bit of luck we met, because I need some help in a business deal.\"\nAsking you to steal a bottle of Tears of Amaya, head to &lt;a href=\"The%20Fish%20Stink\"&gt;The Fish Stink&lt;/a&gt; bar. The wine is sitting directly in front of &lt;a href=\"Hectur%20the%20Fish\"&gt;Hectur the Fish&lt;/a&gt;, the bar's owner. He never leaves his spot and speaking to him will not provide a solution. Talk to the patrons sitting around for hints on how to distract Hetur. Speaking to &lt;a href=\"Hannir\"&gt;Hannir&lt;/a&gt; will reveal that releasing a rat in the shop will have him chasing it out.\n\"Why don't you grab a drink and join us?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Buram%20Savani\"&gt;Buram Savani&lt;/a&gt; will mention that &lt;a href=\"Valen%20Andrethi\"&gt;Valen Andrethi&lt;/a&gt; will start to sing if he is given a drink, but Hectur hates it and will attempt to fight him if that happens.\n\"Poor Valen! All that drinking has really taken its toll.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hrantin%20%28Davon%27s%20Watch%29\"&gt;Hrantin&lt;/a&gt; will also talk about Hectur's dislike for wharf rats and Valen's singing.\n\"Hello, stranger. Just talking about the giant rats around here. Hectur, the owner, goes after them like he's a great hero. He thinks it makes him look brave.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ramu%20Falvel\"&gt;Ramu Falvel&lt;/a&gt; will also say the following:\n\"What brings you to this stinkhole?\"\nAt this point, there are two options you can take. You can either catch a wharf rat, or head to the dockyards and pick up a bottle of alto wine from a container. Letting the mouse free inside the shop can be done a multiple amount of times, in case one fails the first attempt. They can easily be found in the grassy area just outside the shop. After catching one, walk inside the bar and the option to release it will show up, immediately sending Hectur after it. In the short time frame that he tries to chase it out, you can steal the bottle from his counter.\nOtherwise, you can choose to give the alto wine found in the dockyards to Valen. After doing so, he will start singing a song about &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer\"&gt;Cliff Racer&lt;/a&gt;s. Hectur will run up to him in order to punch him, leaving enough time for you to swap the bottles.\nAfter retrieving the bottle of Tears of Amaya, head to Naril, who will have additional dialogue:\n\"Do I detect the bouquet of Tears of Amaya?\""}

It is the prologue for the chapter.\nBackground.\n\"I received a letter from Leramil the Wise. She asked me to meet her in Stormhaven.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon accepting the quest from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt;, you will find &lt;a href=\"Letter%20from%20Leramil%20the%20Wise\"&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; in your inventory from a woman called &lt;a href=\"Leramil%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Leramil the Wise&lt;/a&gt;. Said letter will ask you to come to &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; to meet with her, as her master &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; has foreseen a crisis that only you can solve. \nHead to &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. You will find Leramil on the street north of &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Crown%20Outfitters\"&gt;Lion's Crown Outfitters&lt;/a&gt;; speak with her and she will tell you that there is a threat that threatens both Hermaeus Mora's realm of &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; as well as the mortal realm. Three glyphics are required to solve the crisis, but Leramil has already acquired two of them. Your mission is to acquire something called the Emerald Glyphic, which is in a vault that can be accessed from three locations. She will give you a book that will guide you to the vault once you are in one of these locations, as well as a talisman that will bring you back to Leramil once you have the glyph. \nOnce you are done talking, Leramil will open portals to the three locations that can be used to access the vault. If you go to &lt;a href=\"Rootwater%20Grove\"&gt;Rootwater Grove&lt;/a&gt;, . If you go to the &lt;a href=\"Hoarvor%20Pit\"&gt;Hoarvor Pit&lt;/a&gt;, . If you go to the &lt;a href=\"Ondil\"&gt;Ondil Outskirts&lt;/a&gt;, you will find yourself in southern &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. Use the Book of Forbidden Secrets, and a trail of runes will appear. Follow it until you find a portal just northwest of Ondil itself. This portal will bring you to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Glyphic%20Vault\"&gt;Emerald Glyphic Vault&lt;/a&gt;. \nProceed through the hallway to the big room; you will see the Emerald Glyph on the balcony above you. You cannot reach it from here though, so you will have to take the path to your left. You will find that these ruins are infested with enemies called &lt;a href=\"Dusksaber\"&gt;Dusksaber&lt;/a&gt;s; you will have to fight your way through hordes of these guys. Also take care to avoid stepping on the glyphs that will appear on the ground; these will hurt you. After making your way through the twisting passageways and libraries, you will reach the glyphic. A man named &lt;a href=\"Dralys%20Athren\"&gt;Dralys Athren&lt;/a&gt; will recognise you as fate's chosen; speak with him and he will tell you that his order, the &lt;a href=\"Sodality%20of%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Sodality of the Eye&lt;/a&gt;, foresaw that they would have to protect the Glyphic until Hermaeus Mora's chosen arrived on the scene. He will also tell you that they found a letter on the body of one of these Dusksaber mercenaries, but it is written in some sort of code. \nTake the glyphic and use the talisman you got to return to Leramil. It will open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;; Leramil will be in the building in front of you. She will tell you what the next step should be: you need to find the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Golden%20Eye\"&gt;Shrine of the Golden Eye&lt;/a&gt;, which you can only find by speaking to Hermaeus Mora's faithful. The two faithful you need to speak to are both here in Reaper's March. First, head northwest to the town of &lt;a href=\"Pa%27alat\"&gt;Pa'alat&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Mildanor\"&gt;Mildanor&lt;/a&gt; has a room in a cellar there. Leramil will appear once you approach the cellar and head in before you. Inside, you will find Mildanor dead with &lt;a href=\"Mildanor%27s%20Ripped%20Note\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; in his hand. The note will describe the glyphics being important for an assault on Apocrypha. There will also be Daedric markings on the walls. Once you have investigated both, speak with Leramil. She will suspect that Mildanor was killed by a follower of Hermaeus Mora; that a traitor was involved. \nYour other target is located south of the &lt;a href=\"Serenity%20Falls%20Estate\"&gt;Serenity Falls Estate&lt;/a&gt;, on the eastern outskirts of &lt;a href=\"S%27ren-ja\"&gt;S'ren-ja&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bassian%20Caudex\"&gt;Bassian Caudex&lt;/a&gt; will be alive and well; speak with him and he will tell you that he does not know the location of the shrine; whenever he goes there, he is blindfolded and led there by &lt;a href=\"Naraheida\"&gt;Naraheida&lt;/a&gt;. Naraheida's camp is located to the northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Sleek%20Creek%20House\"&gt;Sleek Creek House&lt;/a&gt;. When you arrive there, you will find Naraheida dead, but Dralys Athren will have arrived just before you did. Speak with him and he will give you the location of the shrine. He will also express his suspicions that Leramil is in fact the traitor. \nAfter the conversation, Leramil will arrive and have a conversation with Dralys where they both show their distrust in one another. Dralys will leave thereafter and Leramil will ask to speak to you; she has deciphered the letter. It mentions the Dusksabers being mercenaries from the &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Peninsula%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Telvanni Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;; they wanted to use the glyphs at the Shrine of the Golden Eye to assault Mora's realm. The letter also contains directions to the Shrine that differ from those that Dralys gave you. \nHead to the southwest. Both of the entrances to the shrine are located in western Reaper's March, in &lt;a href=\"Claw%27s%20Strike\"&gt;Claw's Strike&lt;/a&gt;. Dralys's entrance is directly south of the dungeon's entrance, while Leramil's entrance is in the southeastern room. Whichever entrance you choose, you will find yourself in the Shrine. If you use Dralyn's entrance, , but if you use Leramil's entrance, one of the Dusksabers inside will panic and say that you were supposed to use the other entrance, confirming Dralyn as the traitor. Either way, head through the tunnels to meet up with Leramil on the other end. As you progress, you will hear conversations between Leramil and Dralyn. By the time you arrive at their location, Dralys has taken the glyphics from Leramil; he will attack you on sight. Dralys can be quite powerful, so come prepared. Once he is dead, take the Onyx and Umber Glyphics from his pack and speak to Leramil about what happened. She will tell you that Dralys ambushed her, and she will thank you for stopping him. \nAfter your conversation with Leramil, Hermaeus Mora himself will show up on the scene, and will ask you to speak with him. He will explain that he knew of Dralys's betrayal, but does not yet know which masters Dralys now served. He will also explain that if his enemies succeed at destroying Apocrypha, it will also unravel the mortal realm. He will ask you to use the glyphs to form a contract with him that you will protect Apocrypha from these enemies. To sign this contract, use the glyphs at the shrine. They will form into a contract, which you can then sign. \nOnce the deed is done, Leramil will create a portal to the Dune outskirts; speak with her there to finish the quest. She will tell you to await her summons when she has uncovered more about the threat."}

During the excavation, they discovered the artifact, but not knowing what it was, tried to keep it buried.\nEventually the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; discovered the Eye, and coveted the power for themselves. They assaulted Saarthal, hoping to capture the Eye, but &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; rallied his forces and fought them back in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly Ysgramor and his sons survived, and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; to rally the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;. When the Elves were defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Nordic-Falmer%20War\"&gt;Nordic-Falmer War&lt;/a&gt; and Skyrim was recaptured, they hid the Eye back within Saarthal and buried it deep below the earth.\nRediscovery.\nUpon entering the room that the Eye is housed in, the Dragonborn and &lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; discover that the massive orb is guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Jyrik%20Gauldurson\"&gt;Jyrik Gauldurson&lt;/a&gt;, one of the sons of the ancient arch-mage &lt;a href=\"Gauldur\"&gt;Gauldur&lt;/a&gt;. When an attempt is made to damage Jyrik, Tolfdir states that the Eye is allowing for Gauldurson to become invulnerable to damage, and thus begins to cast lightning spells at the Eye, subsequently allowing for the Dragonborn to damage and kill Jyrik.\nAfter destroying the creature, Tolfdir sends the Dragonborn on an errand to research the Eye of Magnus during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Hitting%20the%20Books\"&gt;Hitting the Books&lt;/a&gt;.\" Finding the research material in &lt;a href=\"Fellglow%20Keep\"&gt;Fellglow Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn reads more about the object in &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterward, &lt;a href=\"Quaranir\"&gt;Quaranir&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, visits the Dragonborn, telling them the object is dangerous and to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20Dunlain\"&gt;Augur of Dunlain&lt;/a&gt;. This then leads to the search for the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncano's betrayal.\nAfter returning to the College, the Dragonborn learns that &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt; has tapped into the power of the Eye and gained tremendous power. The Dragonborn then has to travel to &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; to locate the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;. They must then use the Staff to break through a magical barrier and use it to absorb the power of the Eye and so defeat Ancano. After Ancano is defeated, &lt;a href=\"Quaranir\"&gt;Quaranir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gelebros\"&gt;Gelebros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tandil\"&gt;Tandil&lt;/a&gt; appear. Quaranir then says that the world is not ready for the Eye's unlimited power and that the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; will guard it. He, Gelebros, and Tandil then teleport the Eye away.\nOrigin.\n&lt;a href=\"Tolfdir%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tolfdir&lt;/a&gt; can be heard questioning the runic markings on the artifact.\" \"It's not &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;...not &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;...not &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;...certainly not &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt;...\"\"\nAnother possible origin that Tolfdir did not mention include the possibility of the Eye being &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; in origin. The Aedric god, known as &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, created the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, but it is currently unknown whether or not he actually created the Eye of Magnus."}

Her pain is so great it has torn a hole between Coldharbour and Laeloria, an Ayleid ruin in Grahtwood.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn the ruins of Laeloria, you will come across a statue of Azura. Interact with it, and the goddess of dusk and dawn will speak with you. She will tell you that this place serves as a portal to &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s realm of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, and that one of her priests has been held captive there for milennia. Azura has sealed the place to prevent Molag Bal's Daedra from swarming into Tamriel, but a mage named &lt;a href=\"Vastarie%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vastarie&lt;/a&gt; has figured out a way to get past the seal while leaving it intact. Azura will task you with retracing Vastarie's steps so that you may rescue her priest. \nHead into the Tower of Vastarie to your northeast. There, you will entries &lt;a href=\"Loriasel%20Tablet%2C%20Entry%201\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loriasel%20Tablet%2C%20Entry%202\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loriasel%20Tablet%2C%20Entry%204\"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; of notes written by Vastarie that indicate how she found out how to pass the seal. The notes will mention a tablet; said tablet can be found on the top floor, on a small table.\n\"&lt;The spidery script upon the tablet seems to flicker when you don't look at it directly.&gt;\"\nSpeak the name \"&lt;a href=\"Irrai\"&gt;Irrai&lt;/a&gt;\" to the tablet and a &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Winged Twilight&lt;/a&gt; by that name will appear. Talk to her and she will tell you how to get into Coldharbour. Vastarie used an artifact known as the Twilit Heart for this purpose, which still stands before the gates here, bereft of its magicka. You will need to feed it souls, for which you will need to grab a sigil geode from Vastarie's tower. \nYou can find one in the reliquary on Vastarie's desk. Take it, then head outside and use the geode to absorb the souls of some of the Daedra there. You will have to rough them up a bit before you can use the geode on them, but take care not to kill them. Once you have absorbed three Daedric souls, head to the Twilit Heart in the northwest of the area and use it to restore Irrai to her true power, so that she can open the way into the ruins. \nOnce inside, start looking for the priest &lt;a href=\"Culanwe\"&gt;Culanwe&lt;/a&gt;. In the first room, you will encounter Vastarie, alive and well. In a confrontation between Vastarie and Irrai, you will discover that Irrai is in fact a servant of Molag Bal; help Vastarie defeat Irrai, and Irrai will attempt to flee, but Vastarie will trap her. You can speak with Vastarie now; if you do so, she will tell you that the only path to victory is through trapping Irrai in the Sigil Geode. Do this, then talk to Vastarie again. She will tell you that at the base of these ruins, you will find the portal that Culanwe's suffering has created between the planes. \nHead through the ruins and you will find the portal. On the other side, you will find yourself in Coldharbour. You will be in a room with an altar and two blue flames on either side, known as soul prisons. Extinguish the flames, then head up the altar to retrieve Culanwe's remains. This will end her suffering and close the portal. Once this is done, speak with Vastarie and she will use Irrai's connection with the tablet to open a temporary portal and bring you both back to Tamriel. Once back, return to Azura's shrine to finish the quest."}

It was created by &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; as a sanctuary for all &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and later traded to &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; in a deal for the &lt;a href=\"Folium%20Discognitum\"&gt;Folium Discognitum&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn the early period of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, Arch-Mage Shalidor created the island of Eyevea as a location usable by all mages on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; as a sanctuary or retreat to freely practice and study the art of &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;Magic&lt;/a&gt;, among other purposes. The island's architecture was constructed using &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i designs.\nLater on, Shalidor traded Eyevea to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Madness, Sheogorath, in exchange for an artifact known as the Folium Discognitum: a tome of vast knowledge which Shalidor had been deeply interested in obtaining. From there, the island was transported to the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath's domain in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. It can be safely assumed that this resulted in &lt;a href=\"Mushroom%20Tree\"&gt;mushroom trees&lt;/a&gt; growing on the island, and that the island was also affected by the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt; during the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Shalidor began to feel disappointed in his decision and regretted making the deal with Sheogorath. He later began to believe that he had been tricked into receiving the lower end of the deal and was determined to regain the island. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Shalidor was resurrected in a manner that his spirit could interact with the physical world while not appearing as a ghost or skeleton, and sought assistance from the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; would help Arch-Mage Shalidor and &lt;a href=\"Valaste\"&gt;Valaste&lt;/a&gt; retrieve the island by completing four trials for Sheogorath. In return for completing each trial, they were given a tome which would supply info on how to summon Eyevea back into &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; from Oblivion. However, the tomes were cursed to prevent Shalidor from reading them, so Valaste took the risk of reading the books, gradually causing her to temporarily go insane.\nFollowing the acquirement and decryption of each tome, Eyevea was successfully brought back into Mundus. Sheogorath however neglected to remove the Daedric minions, resulting in the final test being to purge them. The final enemy was &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt;, who had to be defeated in combat in order to gain full access to the island. The Vestige was later congratulated by Sheogorath for their work.\nShalidor decided to grant the island's ownership to the Mages Guild, due to its assistance and his limited time left on Mundus. Portals were opened in every known guildhall across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; leading to the island. &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; installed a series of three rules in order to stop factions of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; from fighting on the island.\nGalerion's rules.\nThe following are rules instituted by Vanus Galerion that apply to the island of Eyevea:\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Eyevea. Unlike other zones, many of Eyevea's locations are city-level and are automatically discovered.\nCharacters.\nThe following characters can be found in Eyevea at various locations around the island.\nQuests.\nEyevea is only featured during one major quest and one minor quest following it, both related to the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20Quests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;quest line&lt;/a&gt;.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits.

They were in the Duke's livery. My heart pounded as I tried to remember whether I'd paid the proper tax this season, but that wasn't why they were here. They asked us to tear down our fence. I asked if they were redrawing the boundaries of my land, but they said they needed the stone. All we could gather, for the army. We're going to war with &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;the heathen Longhouse Emperor&lt;/a&gt;!\nTook my family the better part of the day to stack our cart as high as we dared. I should be able to reach &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Duke Varen's&lt;/a&gt; encampment before dusk, I think.\nMore tents than I thought. Carts, too. Some of the faces I know, others must have come from the farthest reaches of the county. Duke Varen's call to arms didn't fall on deaf ears. Has word also reached the Emperor, I wonder? \nThis army is determined to keep the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; out of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; and here's where they intend to make their stand, tirelessly toiling at fortifications. They ran through my cart of stone in nary an hour. They've asked us to collect any loose rock we can find. Back home to demolish more of my poor fence, I suppose.\nMy wife and some of our neighbors helped with the tear down. Even volunteered their carts to the cause. I'm sorry to see it go, but I'd rather see my stone put to work keeping those filthy &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; out of our land than keeping my herds from wandering into the turnips.\nIt's not pretty to look at, but the wall grows into a daunting obstacle with each passing day. More than a head tall now and no end in sight. I don't know what the Duke's planning, but I trust he knows what he's doing. Too dark to head back now, so I'll spend the night in my cart.\nThe soldiers invited us into their camp, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; thank them. I'm getting too old to go a night without a bed, or at least a pile of hay. They look exhausted from heaving bricks all day and all night. The Duke has them working in shifts. He must think the bloodshed will reach us soon to rush the work so. I don't want to be here when that time comes.\nOff again to find more loose rocks. Short of tearing down some homes and ripping up the cobble, we've claimed all we can from the obvious sources. Some of us are going to pick at a few of those &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;old ruins&lt;/a&gt;.\nDon't care for these &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;old Elf&lt;/a&gt; places. Not one bit. Just tossing what rock we can in the carts and getting on our way before something takes offense.\nThe last load delivered, and none too soon. I think the cart's liable to collapse any moment now. Soon my work here will be done. Duke Varen's work's only beginning, though. &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt; bless them in sending those &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-buggering, lice-ridden, canker-nibbling Reachmen back to their rotten carcass huts in the north!\nLegion! The Legion's been spotted on the march. Got to find my cart and get out of here. The wall sure looks sturdy, though."}

He is only called Ezhmaar Sul by his wife,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, whereas\u00a0everyone else calls him Sul.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nSul was the husband of &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, a female Dunmer who was selected by Vuhon, a friend of Sul, to power &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;. The device served to keep the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; aloft, after &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; disappeared during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and was powered by souls. Sul attempted to free his wife, but damaged it when Vuhon attempted to stop him. This caused the Ministry to resume its course and crash into &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.\nSul and Vuhon were propelled into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the realm of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. There, they encountered a being called Umbra, who was technically part of Vile, which threw the Umbra Sword into &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; through the rift the Ingenium created. Vuhon made a deal with Umbra for his life: in exchange, he would build a new Ingenium to allow Umbra to escape Vile's realm. Sul was kept prisoner and tortured for years, but was soon forgotten about. Sul escaped into &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;'s realm, who offered him to settle problems for her in exchange of letting him go. Yet, she decided to keep him, so Sul had to escape from her as he had escaped from Vile's realm.\nUmbriel Crisis.\nSul was able to escape Oblivion after decades and return to Mundus. Azura still sent him visions, though of a more helpful nature, so he could get his revenge on Vuhon. While he was sleeping in the Lank Fellow Inn in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, he received a vision of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; flying over the sea. Sul realized it had to be Vuhon, but he didn't know where to start from. He discovered a book in an otherwise empty shelf: The Most Current and High Adventures of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Attrebus\"&gt;Prince Attrebus&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sul\"&gt;Sul&lt;/a&gt; eventually found Attrebus. He was being held captive by some criminals, so he killed them and saved Attrebus. Attrebus thought he had been sent by his father, but Sul told him he had saved him because they both wanted to find the flying city. They needed to beat Umbriel to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, a sword named &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; was the only artifact capable of stopping &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey headed to &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;. On their way to Elsweyr, they came across the &lt;a href=\"F%27aashe%20clan\"&gt;F'aashe clan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lesspa\"&gt;Lesspa&lt;/a&gt;, their leader, offered to escort them to Rimmen in exchange of buying them &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar\"&gt;Moon Sugar&lt;/a&gt; in the city. Khajiits weren't allowed to buy it, and smuggling was punishable by death. They were forced to accept the deal. Once they arrived at Rimmen, they bought the Moon-Sugar. When they returned to the camp, they were followed by city guards. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Evernal\"&gt;Captain Evernal&lt;/a&gt; intended to arrest them, but Attrebus revealed his identity. Evernal recognized the prince, and he allowed them and the F'aashe clan go free. Lesspa and the rest of the Khajiits decided to further escort the them to &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttrebus and Sul couldn't beat Umbriel to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; by foot, so Sul bought some materials to open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; in Leyawiin. Sul prepared the ritual to open the door to Oblivion, and they were teleported to &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hircine's Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were accompanied by Lesspa and the most veteran warriors of the F'aashe clan. Hircine and his beasts chased them while they tried to arrive at the portal that would teleport them to Vivec City. Seeing that Hircine was about to approach them, the Khajiiits sacrificed themselves so that Attrebus and Sul could escape.\nAs Sul expected, when they entered the portal they ended up in Vivec City. They searched for Umbra, but it wasn't where it was supposed to be. Ilzheven's ghost appeared to Sul, she told him that the sword had been taken by a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; wearing a signet of a &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;. Ilzheven asked Sul to let it be, but Sul was determined to kill Vuhon and make justice. Attrebus realized that Umbriel was approaching them from the south. Zombies poured from the water. Sul and Attrebus tried to defend, but they ended up being captured.\nVuhon teleported them to Umbriel. He was surprised by Sul's determination. They had a conversation with Vuhon. He told them that to escape from Vile's realm he had had to circumscribe Umbriel against Vile. That meant they were in Oblivion, so Sul managed to free from his chains. Sul realized they couldn't win, so he teleported them to &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;'s realm.\nSul had already been in Malacath's realm while he tried to escape Oblivion. Malacath was angry with Sul, but Attrebus convinced him to teleport them to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, where Umbra was being kept. Malacath agreed to help them, after all, they could weaken Clavicus Vile.\nAttrebus and Sul arrived at a village called &lt;a href=\"Sathil\"&gt;Sathil&lt;/a&gt;. They presented themselves to the lords of castle Sathil as naturalists writing a new edition for &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Sathil couldn't receive them, but her daughter &lt;a href=\"Nirai\"&gt;Nirai&lt;/a&gt; offered them shelter and the resources required for their pretended investigation.\nAttrebus decided to investigate the castle at night on his own. As soon as he left his bedroom, he came across one of the maids, &lt;a href=\"Irinja\"&gt;Irinja&lt;/a&gt;. Irinja confessed him that she knew who he was. Sul emerged from the shadows, and he would have killed Irinja if Attrebus hadn't gestured not to do it.\nThe following days they had to act as naturalists. &lt;a href=\"Fruth\"&gt;Fruth&lt;/a&gt; took them to &lt;a href=\"Ensleth%20Valley\"&gt;Ensleth Valley&lt;/a&gt;. They were wrapped in an ice storm. Sul was pushed away by the storm. &lt;a href=\"Hleryn%20Sathil\"&gt;Hleryn Sathil&lt;/a&gt; showed up with some of his men. He knew they had come for Umbra, but he wanted to know who had sent them. Lord Sathil casted some sort of spell to detect whether Sul worked for Vile, but he didn't find anything. He allowed them to stay in his castle as long as they wished. That night Attrebus talked with Irinja, who revealed where Umbra was being held. &lt;a href=\"Elhul%20Sathil\"&gt;Elhul Sathil&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Sathil's son was locked up with Umbra in the depths of the castle.\nIrinja lead Attrebus and Sul where Elhul was being held captive. When they arrived at the door, she told them she wouldn't go any further. Sul entered the darkness to retrieve Umbra while Attrebus kept the door. Sul couldn't defeat Elhul, who severely injured him. Sul shouted, and Attrebus ran to aid him. Attrebus fought against Elhul, Sul managed to cast a spell that dissolved Elhul. They carefully picked up the sword without touching the blade. When they came back to the gate, Nirai told them she couldn't risk letting them go. Sul said that he could use Umbra to be summoned to Clavicus Vile's realm.\nThey were greeted by &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; in Vile's realm. Attrebus convinced the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; to send them back to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, so that they could stop Umbriel and return Vile the power that had been stolen from him. Vile demanded a pact, he wanted Sul's soul, but Attrebus denied his demand, he needed them as much as they needed him. Vile sent the two to his shrine in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Sul hit his head and lost consciousness. Attrebus had to craft a stretcher to tow\nSul. They arrived at &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;, Attrebus took a boat and rowed to the Imperial City.\nWhen they arrived at the other shore, they were captured by undead. The zombies brought them to &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt;'s men. When they woke up, they was locked in Hierem's chambers. Hierem revealed he was in league with Vuhon. After the conversation, he teleported himself to Umbriel to finalize the preparations for the assault on the Imperial City. Hierem interrogated Attrebus to learn why Vuhon was so concerned about them. He could make Attrebus weep in ecstasy. If Attrebus answered, he rewarded him with that sensation. Attrebus had to resist not to answer, but he revealed that Vuhon was afraid of the sword. Attrebus fainted, and Sul ended up answering for him to save his life. Hierem told him that he would allow them to take the sword and go to Umbriel if thing didn't turn out as he expected.\n&lt;a href=\"Colin\"&gt;Colin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arese\"&gt;Arese&lt;/a&gt; had discovered that Prince Attrebus was being held captive in Hierem's chambers, so they headed to save him. Colin opened the cells where Sul and the prince were captured. They designed a plan, Attrebus and Sul took Umbra and located near the sigil where Hierem teleported to Umbriel in order to teleport when he came back. Colin and Arese would wait for him to kill him.\nWhen Hierem finally came back, they were teleported just in front of Vuhon. Sul wielded Umbra, but he couldn't damage Vuhon. Attrebus managed to make a cut in Vuhon's artery, Anna\u00efg had synthesized a venom that killed the trees from Umbriel and weakened Vuhon. Everything around him seemed to shatter and Attrebus and him started falling. They fell in the skraw caves, Attrebus called Anna\u00efg through Coo, who told them to wait for her there. Glim found them and brought them to Anna\u00efg's presence. Vuhon had discovered that Anna\u00efg was the responsible for poisoning him, so he went to her for the antidote. When Attrebus, Sul and Glim arrived, Vuhon was already there. Anna\u00efg revealed them that they could damage Vuhon because Umbra's soul was in the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;. Glim guided them to the sump and he dived to the bottom. Sul had fainted because of the pressure, so Attrebus picked Umbra and he stabbed it into the light. They fell into the room where the Ingenium was stored, Umbra had fallen from Attrebus hand. Vuhon tried to take the sword, but Attrebus was faster and he stabbed the Ingenium.\nVuhon shaked, and Umbra took possession of his body. Umbra offered Sul immense power, but all Sul wanted was to end up with everything. Umbra tried to strangulate him, but after a moment, the sword finished destroying the ingenium and Umbra was expelled from Vuhon's body into the blade. Attrebus was possessed by Vile, who stabbed Sul. Sul grabbed the hilt of Umbra and pulled himself up the blade, and with everything left in him he struck Attrebus in the jaw. Vile was expelled from Attrebus body, but a dying Sul and Umbra melt together into a dark smoke with a heart of lightning."}

Factions include any organization of peoples' or beings with a common goal, ruleset, mission, or philosophy.\nImperial services.\nBlades.\nThe Blades are a group of spies and commandos of an elite &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; order\u00a0that are dedicated to serve and protect the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, because of his fate as a savior of the world who will stop the &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;World Eater&lt;/a&gt; from destroying it, when the time will come. They are featured in , , , and . The first Emperor Tiber Septim, as well as all his descendants, were Dragonborn, and so the Blades came under the service of the Emperors of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, until the last known Dragonborn, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, died. As the Emperor's protectors, they had secret branches all across Tamriel, which gathered intelligence on the Empire's enemies. They took orders only from the Emperor himself, and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; had no power over them.\nAfter the death of Martin Septim, the Blades no longer had reason to continue to protect the Emperor, and so they served the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; as spies instead. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, most of the Blades were slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; agents, and any further survivors were hunted and killed.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, surviving Blades &lt;a href=\"Delphine%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delphine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Esbern%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Esbern&lt;/a&gt; - with the help of the new &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; - restored the order and started to fulfill their destiny as Dragonslayers and guardians of Dovahkiin. They reside in &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt; after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\" From then on, followers can become members of the Blades.\nHowever, they discover the leader of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, who was Alduin's main ally during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. They tell the Dragonborn that Paarthurnax must pay for his crimes and be destroyed, and refuse to give any more help to the Dragonborn until Paarthurnax is dead.\nDepending on the player's choice, the relationship between the Dragonborn and the Blades will either be forever soiled or continue to be strong if the latter listens to the Blade's demands and kills Paarthurnax. Though it can be noted that by refusing to help the Dragonborn, they are breaking the sacred covenant that the Blades had made to declare undying loyalty to the Dragonborn, it can be possible that Delphine and Esbern are secretly manipulating the traditions of the Blades to their own ends.\nImperial Legion.\nThe Imperial Legion is the main military force of the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;ic Empire. Its headquarters are in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Prison District&lt;/a&gt;.\nPenitus Oculatus.\nThe Penitus Oculatus is a special operations group of bodyguards dedicated to protecting the Emperor.\nImperial Geographic Society.\nThe Imperial Geographic Society was an organization notable for authoring the &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Pocket Guide to the Empire&lt;/a&gt; series.\nImperial University.\nThe Imperial University was a university and organization. Some of their faculties included the &lt;a href=\"Office%20of%20Introductory%20Studies\"&gt;Office of Introductory Studies&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Healers\"&gt;Council of Healers&lt;/a&gt;.\nCensus and Excise.\nThe Census and Excise was an organization operated by the Empire in an attempt to manage census counting and for tax/excise purposes. Imperial taxes are based on headcounts of citizens; Census and Excise is responsible for both headcounts and tax assessment and collection. Census and Excise officers also administer many Imperial licenses, e.g. importation, mercenary company incorporation. They are typically found in many major ports across Tamriel, such as &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; in Vvardenfell.\nGuilds.\nFighters Guild.\nThe Fighters Guild is a guild dedicated to the various combat arts and to the mercenary business, offering its services for a payment. It is sanctioned by the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; and has multiple chapters throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Skyrim has no Fighters Guild, but &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; are similar.\nMages Guild.\nThe Mages Guild was a guild dedicated to the study of magic, &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, and often other sciences and their links to magic. It was spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and was chartered by the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; section was headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the Mages guild's headquarters is the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. By the Fourth Era, the Mages Guild had been disbanded, and was split into two new factions, the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Companions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt; are similar to the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. They reside in &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, a mead hall in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. There is no official leader, just a &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20%28Rank%29\"&gt;Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; whose word is highly respected. The Companions' current Harbinger is &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Circle\"&gt;The Circle&lt;/a&gt;, the leading members of the Companions, are &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolves&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0While\u00a0Aela and Skjor see\u00a0lycanthropy as a gift,\u00a0the other members of The Circle, notably Kodlak, desperately search for a cure.\u00a0The questline is centered around Kodlak's desire to go to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s realm. &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the Hunt and Father of the Manbeasts. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may become the Harbinger at the end of the Companions' questline.\nCollege of Winterhold.\nThe College of Winterhold resembles the Cyrodilic Mages Guild, but due to the lack of the Guild's presence in Skyrim, the College acts as the center for mages in Skyrim. Located on a rocky cliff, joined to the town of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; by a run-down bridge, the Nords of Skyrim are suspicious towards the members of the college following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Collapse\"&gt;Great Collapse&lt;/a&gt;. The college contains mages of all specialties, and the Dragonborn can rise to become &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; by completing all the quests.\nReligious organizations.\nImperial Cult.\nThe Imperial Cult is a religious organization devoted to worshipping the Eight &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; and the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;). As the Imperials of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and their architecture are based on the Roman Empire, the Imperial Cult bears many similarities to Roman Catholicism, particularly in the architecture of their temples and their order of clergy includes titles such as Priest, Bishop, Primate, Cardinal, etc., and the Emperor of Tamriel or the Dragonborn could be considered similar to the Roman Catholic pope.\nMythic Dawn.\nThe Mythic Dawn is a daedra worshiping cult that features prominently in . Led by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, these cultists attempt to destroy &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and allow &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, the daedric prince of destruction, to rule it. Until the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; Members would identify themselves to one another by code-phrases. One would say \"Dawn is breaking.\" If the one addressed was a fellow cultist, he would respond \"Greet the new day.\" Agents of the Septims eventually learned this code-phrase and used it to infiltrate the cult.\nTribunal Temple.\nThe Tribunal Temple is dedicated to the worship of the three god-kings of Morrowind, the goddess &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, the god-poet &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; The Tinkerer. It is the dominant religion in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrdinators.\nThe Ordinators are a highly trained group of soldier guardsmen who work for the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. They feature prominently in .\nBuoyant Armigers.\nThe Buoyant Armigers, unlike their counterparts the Ordinators, do not serve the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, but answer only to Vivec himself. Unlike the Ordinators, who are uniformly grave and serious, Buoyant Armigers are typically lighthearted and jovial.\nNine Divines.\nThe Nine Divines faction is composed of the most fervent worshipers of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. The faction includes all &lt;a href=\"chapels\"&gt;chapels&lt;/a&gt; and their staff.\nThe Greybeards.\nThe Greybeards is an ancient monastic order dedicated to the attuning of \"The Voice,\" or the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. The Greybeards live in their ancient fortress, known as &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, which is located near the top of the Throat of the World. The Greybeards was started by &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Greybeards use the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt; to attain enlightenment, and worship and honor the gods, as decreed by the Way of the Voice. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; joins the Greybeards in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganized crime.\nThieves Guild.\nThe Thieves Guild is an association of thieves and criminals. It has spread across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and established branches in most of the provinces. By its very nature, it is illicit and could be considered organized crime, however, its brand of crime is less extensive than that of their counterparts in the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , the guild's primary center is in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, with separate branches in various cities such as &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, and is much more publicly talked about.\nIn , the organization is much more secretive, and one either has to have been thrown in prison or persuade beggars to give information and find the meeting point and then be invited to a contest to join as a member. Although there is no official guildmaster, a man known as the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Fox\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; is the primary leader of the organization, and a myth who has lived through many centuries, through a mask taken from &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric deities&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; has fallen on hard times. Based out of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt; and led by &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt;, the Thieves Guild of the Fourth Era is a shadow of what it once was. It falls on the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to bring them back to their former glories. They can be found by entering the Ratways or joined by talking to &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; in the market. During the Thieves Guild questline, the Dragonborn can become a &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;, a member of a secretive cult that serves Nocturnal and guards the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;.\nCamonna Tong.\nThe Camonna Tong is the native crime syndicate in the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. They play a major role in .\nDark Brotherhood.\nThe Dark Brotherhood is an assassins guild that split off from the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. They do not follow the customs of the Morag Tong and are illegal throughout the entire empire. They worship the Death star sign: Sithis. They feature prominently in and . They perform assassinations all over Tamriel, most famously killing &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s last surviving heir, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%2041\"&gt;3E 41&lt;/a&gt; and Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"Skyrim\".\nMorag Tong.\nThe Morag Tong is a secretive group that carries out legally sanctioned assassinations called \"Writs\" within the province of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnightly Orders.\nThe Order of the Dragon.\nThe Order of the Dragon is a knightly order originally founded by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, which is mentioned and joinable in . The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; is inducted into the order at the second-highest rank possible, Champion of Cyrodiil (the highest being the Emperor himself), at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Knights of the White Stallion.\nThe Knights of the White Stallion are based in and around &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, the southernmost city of Cyrodiil, and were chartered by &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marius%20Caro\"&gt;Marius Caro&lt;/a&gt; of Leyawiin. The organization was founded to help protect the city and its residents from the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bow%20Bandit\"&gt;Black Bow Bandit&lt;/a&gt;s. The Count handpicks the members of the order and grants 100 gold for every &lt;a href=\"Black%20Bow\"&gt;Black Bow&lt;/a&gt; brought in as a proof of Black Bow members killed.\nThe player character and an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Mazoga%20the%20Orc%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Mazoga&lt;/a&gt; kill &lt;a href=\"Black%20Brugo\"&gt;Black Brugo&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Black Bow Bandits, during the course of the game. Both are made Knight-Errants of the Order and granted access to the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stallion%20Lodge\"&gt;White Stallion Lodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Order of the Virtuous Blood.\nThe Order of the Virtuous Blood is dedicated to ridding &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s, and compensates or hires people to hunt them. Their headquarters is in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Temple%20District\"&gt;Imperial City, Temple District&lt;/a&gt;. The organization was founded by the vampire &lt;a href=\"Seridur\"&gt;Seridur&lt;/a&gt; as a ploy to misdirect vampire hunters and to use the group as a weapon against those who might discover his true identity.\nOrder of Diagna.\nThe Order of Diagna's major achievement was leading the siege of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. In fact their initiation ceremony is reenacting that siege. The most famous member of the Order of Diagna was also the founder of the Imperial City's &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; who died in the siege of Orsinium.\nThe Knights of the Thorn.\nThe Knights of the Thorn are a group of knights that supposedly serve the needs of Cheydinhal County in Cyrodiil. In reality, this Order has a reputation for doing little more than sitting in taverns and hassling the Cheydinhal Guard. During the Oblivion crisis, Farwil Indarys led the Order on an expedition into an Oblivion gate, however, most of them were killed during this mission.\nKnights of the Nine.\nThe Knights of the Nine are a group of nine knights in Cyrodiil introduced with who have dedicated their lives to retrieve and protect the \"&lt;a href=\"Relics%20of%20the%20Crusader%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Relics of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;\" powerful armor and weapons wielded by the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated the evil &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt;, who was the last Ayleid king to survive the human revolt instigated by &lt;a href=\"St.%20Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt; in 1E 242.\nKnights of Stendarr.\nThe Knights of Stendarr are, as the name implies, an order of knights who serve in the name of Stendarr. They are often referred to as Paladins of Stendarr. They have many bases, most in temples, in the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell. In , they are referred to as Vigilants of Stendarr; They are committed to the elimination of Daedra from the mortal realms, and are primarily located in the Hall of the Vigilant or at &lt;a href=\"Stendarr%27s%20Beacon\"&gt;Stendarr's Beacon&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouses of Morrowind.\nHouse Dagoth.\nHouse Dagoth, also known as the Sixth House, was one of the six Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Dres.\nHouse Dres is one of the Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The house concentrates on agriculture and the &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slave trade&lt;/a&gt; and is located in the south-eastern part of Morrowind. Its influence on Morrowind politics has weakened considerably since Morrowind's surrender to the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic Empire. As it uses slave labor to keep its farms going and is particularly opposed to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; power and other races of Tamriel, it is greatly at odds with the values of the Empire (which forbids slave trade).\nHouse Dres is the most conservative of Morrowind\u2019s Great Houses, to the extent that the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; is still commonly practiced by its members. During the war in which Morrowind became a province of the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, it was one of the Houses, along with &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, to resist Imperial forces.\nMore recently, after the events of , House Dres has apparently undergone some significant changes. Since then, King Hlaalu Helseth has outlawed slavery in Morrowind, but Dres has allied with Helseth and is apparently finally accepting Imperial rule. Currently, the reasons and motivations for this change, as well as the effect of the outlaw of slavery on House Dres, are unknown.\nHouse Dres holds no territory on the island &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Its territory is all located on the mainland of Morrowind, along the southern border with &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of House Dres is Tear.\nHouse Hlaalu.\nHouse Hlaalu is one of the six Great Houses and a joinable faction in the game .\nHouse Indoril.\nHouse Indoril is one of the Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. The great &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; was the head of this House during the early First Era. House Indoril is a staunch supporter of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, many of the Temple &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; and other Temple heroes are members of this House. This connection has given it a big influence on all political decisions in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to Imperial conquest, House Indoril had been the dominant Great House throughout Morrowind's history. During the war with &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s Empire, House Indoril was strongly against Imperial occupation. When Septim incorporated Morrowind into his Empire, Indoril refused to submit to Imperial rule. At the time the Lord High Councilor of the Grand Council, a council comprised of the heads of the Great Houses, was an Indoril and would not accept the treaty or step down, so he was assassinated and replaced with a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. More power struggles went on between the two Great Houses, with House Hlaalu, in support of Imperial accommodation, coming out the victor. Still unwilling to accept membership within the Empire, many Indoril nobles committed suicide, weakening the House.\nIn the game , citizens of Cyrodiil speak of House Indoril being in ruins as the result of machinations of the new king, Hlaalu Helseth, and his House Hlaalu and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, House Indoril had no territorial holdings on the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, all of its territory being located on mainland Morrowind. Its capital is &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, also the capital of Morrowind itself. The city of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;, in eastern Morrowind, is one of their major cities.\nHouse Redoran.\nHouse Redoran, is one of the six Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. It is a joinable faction in the game .\nHouse Sotha.\nHouse Sotha was one of the minor Houses of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; until its destruction by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; in the times of &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Sotha supposedly had ties to the Great House of Indoril since their main stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Sotha%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald Sotha&lt;/a&gt;, was located not far from &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the largest holding of Indoril. The only one who survived the destruction of the House by Dagon was &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, who was rescued by Indoril Nerevar and later became one of his most trusted advisors.\nHouse Telvanni.\nHouse Telvanni is one of the six Great Houses of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind Province&lt;/a&gt;. It is a joinable faction in and .\nOther.\nCourt of Madness.\nThe Court of Madness consists of the nobility and servants of &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. It is featured in , where the player joins and works his way up through the court, to becoming Sheogorath. Its ranks are: Tourist, Aspirant, Citizen, Madman/Madwoman, Honored Madman/Madwoman, Duke/Duchess of Mania/Dementia, Regent, Defender of the Realm, Madgod.\nBlackwood Company.\nThe Blackwood Company is a mercenary organization featured in . It was founded by &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; who were sent back to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; on an Imperial contract. After unsuccessfully ending the contract, they decided to set up shop in the City of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Their headquarters in Leyawiin is located on Guild Plaza, directly opposite of the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; chapter, further annoying the heads of this ancient Imperial organization. The Company has established itself as the primary competitor to the Fighters Guild regarding mercenary services, as they are known to take on any contract, even those that the Fighters Guild refuses.\nTwin Lamps.\nThe Twin Lamps are an abolitionist group in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The terms of the treaty by which Morrowind was annexed into the Tamrielic empire allowed Morrowind to maintain its laws and culture which includes the legality of slavery. While the Imperials frown upon slavery, they are forced by the terms of the treaty to tolerate it within Morrowind. The Twin Lamps, which existed before the Imperials' rule of Morrowind, found aid in the form of the Imperial Thieves Guild and specifically their leader, &lt;a href=\"Gentleman%20Jim%20Stacey\"&gt;Gentleman Jim Stacey&lt;/a&gt;.\nEast Empire Company.\nThe East Empire Company, abbreviated as the EEC, is a massive monopolistic mercantilist trading company with holdings in many eastern territories of the Cyrodilic Empire, such as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. It has a monopoly over trade in the Eastern Provinces. The company is chartered (and probably funded) by the Emperor of Tamriel.\nMany senior ranking officers in the company are seen as corrupt and resented by some people in the provinces who see the businessmen as Imperial fatcats who rob the local natural resources. Otherwise, the East Empire Company does what it can to provide employment and financial stability for the Empire. &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; has ties with the Caldera Mining Company (an offshoot of the East Empire Company) in the ebony mining town of &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; due to Hlaalu's acceptance of the Empire.\nThe East Empire Company has offices in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, Caldera, Fort Frostmoth and the new ebony mining colony on Solstheim, &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. It is headquartered in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and has large warehouses in the Waterfront District of the city. The East Empire Company may also control the trade of kwama, Telvanni bug musk, mazte, sujamma and other local products of Morrowind as well as imports like flin and Cyrodilic Brandy. The high price of imports like flin may be attributed to the East Empire Company's complete control on price, due to lack of major competition.\nEvery company chapter is headed by a Factor who directs and controls the affairs of the company in his area of influence. As a high-ranking official of the company, he has the right to construct an estate on the company premises. For instance, there is a large Factor Estate adjacent to the company's ebony mine in Raven Rock, Solstheim.\nSummerset Shadows.\nThe Summerset Shadows are a group of &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; thieves, led by &lt;a href=\"Linwe\"&gt;Linwe&lt;/a&gt;, that cannot be joined by the player. They are involved in the Thieves Guild &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Shadows%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Summerset Shadows&lt;/a&gt;\" in , a city influence job in Windhelm for &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt;. The rival thieves guild is making a name for itself, however, it is rumored that the group is murdering their contacts after doing business. Delvin sends the Dragonborn to Windhelm to find out more about the rival thieves gang and ultimately, through the help of &lt;a href=\"Niranye\"&gt;Niranye&lt;/a&gt;, finds and purges their camp, wiping out the rival guild.\nBards College.\nThe Bards College is a group of &lt;a href=\"bards\"&gt;bards&lt;/a&gt;, poets, and public speakers. The college is located in &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, just South of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The college was founded during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; and exists until at least the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nPsijic Order.\nThe Psijic Order was an ancient, monastic order of mages based on the island of Artaeum. It was initially founded by Aldmer who considered themselves keepers of the Old Ways, and didn't wish to worship the gods the Altmer chose when they settled in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormcloaks.\nThe Stormcloaks is a collective of Nords from Eastern Skyrim, lead by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to rid Skyrim of all Imperials and Thalmor. The uprising began when the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; was signed, and the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; was outlawed. The Jarls of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt; believe their Nord lifestyle is in threat, and unite to form a militaristic force to fight the Empire. This opposition results in the Skyrim &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDawnguard.\nThe Dawnguard is a group of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Hunters\"&gt;Vampire Hunters&lt;/a&gt; lead &lt;a href=\"Isran\"&gt;Isran&lt;/a&gt; revived in 4E 201. The ancient order now operates for the complete eradication of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim. Their stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Dawnguard\"&gt;Fort Dawnguard&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and dates back to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nVolkihar Clan.\nThe Volkihar Clan is a faction of Vampires led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harkon\"&gt;Lord Harkon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0found in\u00a0. The headquarters, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;Castle Volkihar&lt;/a&gt;, is situated on an island in the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can become a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Little is known about the history of the Clan itself.\nTribal Orcs.\nThe Tribal Orcs of Skyrim are groups of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Strongholds\"&gt;strongholds&lt;/a&gt;. The four strongholds, &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Khazgur\"&gt;Mor Khazgur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dushnikh%20Yal\"&gt;Dushnikh Yal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Narzulbur\"&gt;Narzulbur&lt;/a&gt;, each have a chief, and all but Largashbur have a mine.\nBlackblood Marauders.\nThe Blackblood Marauders are a group of bandits that work mainly around &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and its docks.\nBlack Bow Bandits.\nThe Black Bow Bandits are a group of bandits that work mainly around &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are known to organize and govern any who wish to 'work' in a particular city. Those who pay their monthly tithe find certain perks when faced with the authorities. Those who do not find that the Thieves Guild can be a dangerous adversary.\nMages Guild.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; is the center of &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; study for all those of spell casting potential. They perform many services to those who have the money to pay including, selling &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;, selling &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Item\"&gt;magical items&lt;/a&gt;, helping mages create &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;, and selling spells for spellbooks. They are a powerful force in the world of Tamriel, often searching for lost artifacts or treasures. It is said by some that the Mages Guilds have many secrets, including the location of some legendary places.\nThe Dark Brotherhood.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; are loyal followers of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, God of Death. They are sworn to uphold the tenements of Chaos. They are vicious foes to those who would follow the roads of Law, often patrolling outer paths and byways for unwary travelers. It is said that the Brotherhood does not associate with any other group, contesting that even the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s are not true to word of the Dark God. They instead work towards what they call a pure form of Chaos. Few have faced them and escaped with their souls intact.\nThe Blades.\nA secret society comprised of the best warriors of the Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; approach whomever they wish for membership. None know exactly what their ultimate goals are, for they have been seen on both sides of the law, sometimes helping those in need, other times attacking caravans or wealthy merchants. All that is known is that they are deadly in combat, trained by special swordmasters to a point where their thought and reaction are one.\nThe Necromancers.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Necromancers%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;The Necromancers&lt;/a&gt; are a guild that works in the shadows of life, stealing bodies for purposes known only to them. They deal and consort with the undead regularly, and are staunch foes of the Mages Guild. They are accomplished spellcasters, often questing for magical artifacts and other sources of knowledge. It is said that when facing the Necromancers, one need fear what comes after death more than death itself.\nThe Wharf Rats.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wharf%20Rats\"&gt;Wharf Rats&lt;/a&gt; are a loosely organized group of cutthroats, thieves, and ruffians. Although they do not represent the best of what is out there, their sheer numbers make up for any deficiency in skill. The Thieves Guild will attack any members of the Wharf Rats it finds, considering them an infringement upon their turf. They prey upon the weak, elderly, or rich traveler, stealing from them anything of value.\nThe Underking.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; is a mysterious figure, walking through myth and legend. Some say he is actually a very old and powerful &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;, others that he is an &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; whose very being has been somehow transformed by his use of magic. It is agreed however that he is a force to be reckoned with in the world of Tamriel, sending his undead soldiers on errands whose goals only he knows is privy to. It seems his forces often find themselves opposed to The Necromancers, a fact that reassures many, for if they were to unite all of Tamriel would suffer."}

While the religious orders dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; are featured in the game, this time the player cannot join any of them, the only exception being the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, introduced with the DLC of the same name. There are a number of chivalric military orders that the player is able to join, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20Orders\"&gt;Knight Orders&lt;/a&gt; of . The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; was introduced as a joinable faction, replacing in function the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; from .\n\"Oblivion\" is the last game in the series to feature the same core factions, as of the three only the Thieves Guild makes an appearance in . While the player is not able to join the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the faction is joinable in both the preceding and the succeeding title. The &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; are one of the few factions present in all of the games.\nPerks of joining factions.\nSome factions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; grant a special uniform upon joining which can be worn optionally either to reap the bonuses of the armor or for &lt;a href=\"Role-Playing%20Game\"&gt;role-playing aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;. More extreme benefits, such as becoming a &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Pilgrim's Grace&lt;/a&gt; can only be achieved by joining factions.\nOther factions may provide amenities to the Hero of Kvatch, such as &lt;a href=\"Beds%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sleeping quarters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; that never reset for safe item storage, and &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;. Once a member attains a certain rank, they can freely take any items from the guild hall.\nCertain guild-mates cannot be unlocked as &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; unless a given faction is joined. For example, the Mages Guild has two possible followers that can be unlocked. These are &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Apprentice\"&gt;Mage Apprentice&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBecause guild members can come and go at any hour of the day, joining a faction is wise for &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, since there will be an abundance of &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt; guild-mates that can be accessed without &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;breaking and entering&lt;/a&gt;, trespassing, or &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, they provide safe havens that can be quickly entered to avoid sustaining &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sun Damage&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpulsion and availability.\nFactions possess some integral rules. Members cannot &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt;, murder, or attack other members of the guild without risking expulsion, arrest, or the faction's members becoming relentlessly hostile toward the Hero of Kvatch. Some will desist if the &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; is cleared.\nWhile most factions can be joined at any time throughout the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main storyline&lt;/a&gt;, some factions can only be joined for a limited amount of time or are entirely unavailable upon joining another faction. In the former example, the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; can be temporarily aligned during the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fighters guild&lt;/a&gt; questline, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; joining the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; to temporarily advance the questline."}

Due to the Mages Guild splitting into the &lt;a href=\"Synod\"&gt;Synod&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Whispers\"&gt;College of Whispers&lt;/a&gt;, the guild could not logically appear in titles set after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, making its debut in , appeared as a joinable faction. &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt; is substituted for the Fighters Guild, &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;ically aligning with &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; lore prevalent long before \"Skyrim\"'s inception.\nThe vampire clans from and were omitted as well, with a newer adaption surfacing in \"Skyrim\"'s first &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt;, .\nUnlike in \"Oblivion\", where each faction had a clear hierarchy of &lt;a href=\"ranks\"&gt;ranks&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; could rise through by successfully completing missions, most factions in \"Skyrim\" make no such distinctions. For example, the only rank attainable in the College of Winterhold, aside from being a basic student, is that of Arch-Mage. The Stormcloaks and the Imperial legion, however, do employ specific ranks. All of these factions can give you a place to stay, like the other games, more or less, and perks to upgrade.\u00a0\nPerks of joining factions.\nMost factions grant a special uniform or a set of armor when joined. These items are usually competitive with the types of items found early in the game, and can be worn optionally either to reap the bonuses of the items or for &lt;a href=\"Role-Playing%20Game\"&gt;role-playing aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;. Unique benefits, such as becoming a &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, can only be achieved by joining the right faction.\nMost factions provide amenities to the Dragonborn, such as &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sleeping quarters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; that never reset for safe item storage, and free access to &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; stations such as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;s. The Thieves Guild in particular is significant in that it gives the Dragonborn access to &lt;a href=\"Fence%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fences&lt;/a&gt; who will buy stolen goods. Once a member reaches a certain point in the faction's quest line, they can freely take any items from the guild hall.\nCertain guild-mates cannot be unlocked as &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potential spouses&lt;/a&gt; unless a given faction is joined. For example, the College of Winterhold has three possible followers and two possible spouses. &lt;a href=\"J%27zargo%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;J'zargo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Onmund\"&gt;Onmund&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brelyna%20Maryon\"&gt;Brelyna Maryon&lt;/a&gt; are all potential college followers, with only Onmund and Brelyna Maryon being eligible for marriage. The Thieves Guild is one of the factions without any members eligible for marriage or as followers. The Dark Brotherhood has followers, but no marriage candidates. The Stormcloaks, Imperial Legion, Blades, Greybeards, and the Bards College also do not have marriage candidates or possible followers.\nBecause guild members can come and go at any hour of the day, joining a faction is wise for &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, since there will be an abundance of &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt; guild-mates that can be accessed without &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;breaking and entering&lt;/a&gt;, trespassing, or &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpulsion and availability.\nFactions possess some integral rules. Members cannot &lt;a href=\"steal\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; from, murder, or attack other members of the guild without risking expulsion, arrest, or the faction's members becoming relentlessly hostile toward the Dragonborn. Some will desist if the &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; is cleared.\nWhile most factions can be joined at any time throughout the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main storyline&lt;/a&gt;, some factions can only be joined for a limited amount of time or are entirely unavailable upon joining another faction. In the former example, the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; can be temporarily aligned with while &lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;fleeing Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; joining the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; to temporarily advance the questline. In the latter example, the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; has two clear sides: the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;. At a certain point within the Civil War questline, one side must be selected to the exclusion of the others; if the Stormcloaks are joined, you can join the Imperial Legion if you give them the Jagged Crown. On the other hand, if you join the\u00a0's &lt;a href=\"Dawnguard%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;vampire hunters&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0you cannot switch to the other."}

I have now been tasked to only identify groups of units that perform similar functions. I have to admit, this only further shows a sad misunderstanding of the unique personality each unit so clearly expresses. Still, I must abide by the ruling of the council. And so here I shall list the name and brief description of each factotum subgroup for future reference.\n&lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Registrar\"&gt;Clockwork Registrar&lt;/a&gt;: This singular unit is able to access all residential records within Clockwork City. It also maintains all documentation within the Brass Fortress archives, the extent of which none but Lord &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; knows. I find this unit to be direct and to the point, making it very efficient to work with.\n&lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Clinician\"&gt;Clockwork Clinician&lt;/a&gt;: Though few in number, these clinicians have been purposed for a variety of post-mortem tasks. Their most prominent ability allows them their cognitive archival process and data retention of the recently deceased. This has been used for a variety of occasions, most notably with questioning Proctor Nevyn on several incomplete thermodynamic equations. I find this unit to be a more comforting presence, but often impatient when delayed.\n&lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Facilitator\"&gt;Clockwork Facilitator&lt;/a&gt;: A newer, singular unit introduced to the Brass Fortress, it has nonetheless proved to be a liaison to Lord Seht's own experiments. Currently its only function is to recruit combatants to battle a creation known as the Imperfect, said to be one of Clockwork's most dangerous creations. From what I can gather, this unit will continue to create tasks based on the \"greater good\" of Clockwork City. I find this unit to be more boisterous than its counterparts.\n&lt;a href=\"Commerce%20Delegate\"&gt;Commerce Delegate&lt;/a&gt;: These units have multiple functions to aid residents with purchases. Though the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt; do not regulate commerce, my suggestion to lease these units to local guilds has been met with approval and is currently undergoing negotiations. I find these units to be friendly and lighthearted compared to many other factotums.\n&lt;a href=\"Currency%20Steward\"&gt;Currency Steward&lt;/a&gt;: Continuing with the need for help with the residential currency system, these units have access to all banking records and regulations. They have helped decrease the \"errors\" often found in their less reliable, and often merely greedy, organic counterparts. I find these units to be serious, grim, and very reliable.\n&lt;a href=\"Cuisine%20Administrator\"&gt;Cuisine Administrator&lt;/a&gt;: Though any resident can work a nutrient dispenser, these units have several functions related to cooking. The consensus of their successful meals has been noted to perhaps be biased by the local population, given the bland daily diet of most Brass Fortress residents. Nonetheless, all meals generated have been deemed perfectly safe for consumption by the Clockwork Apostles. I find these units to be almost coddling in their affections.\nI will continue these rudimentary and functional classifications for factotums within the Brass Fortress. Further preparation is needed before I can begin my research on the more combat focused units, as our means to place them in standby has been unsuccessful for several generations. May the gears align in my favor."}

Fadomai suggested to Ahnurr that they make children to share their happiness. This first litter consisted of &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt; and either &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Akha\"&gt;Akha&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which stories you believe. After this initial litter, Ahnurr came to Fadomai and said that they should make more children to spread their happiness. Fadomai agreed, and so &lt;a href=\"Hermorah\"&gt;Hermorah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Merrunz\"&gt;Merrunz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mafala\"&gt;Mafala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sangiin\"&gt;Sangiin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheggorath\"&gt;Sheggorath&lt;/a&gt; and many others were born.\nAt this point, Ahnurr thought that they had made enough children, for more would steal away their happiness. However, Khenarthi came to Fadomai because she was lonely, being so high in the sky where not even her brother Alkosh could reach her. and so she convinced Fadomai to trick Ahnurr into getting her pregnant with a third litter. \nFadomai gave birth to the &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Twin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Moons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;Their Motions&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nirni\"&gt;Nirni&lt;/a&gt;. However, as this point, Ahnurr discovered her giving birth and struck at her, forcing her to flee into the Great Darkness. It is here that she gave birth to her final child, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. Lorkhaj's heart was filled with the Great Darkness, and when he was born, the darkness knew its name and was &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;.\nFadomai knew her time was almost done, so she gave Ja-Kha'jay the Lunar Lattice, so that Ahnurr would not be able to penetrate it. She then gave Nirni the ability to give birth as she had done. After this, all of her children left, except for Azurah. Azurah was Fadomai's favored daughter, so she gave her her most valued gift: her secrets. Fadomai told Azurah to change one of the peoples inhabiting Nirni into the Khajiit. She also told her daughter the names of all the spirits and of all Khajiit who would ever live. At this point, Fadomai passed away, leaving Azurah to mourn her in the Great Darkness.\nRelationship with her children.\nAzurah was Fadomai's favored daughter. She was born of Fadomai's third litter, and was given Fadomai's secrets on how to make the Khajiit, as well as the names of all the Spirits and all the Khajiit who would ever live. After Fadomai's passing, Azurah would cry until she was no longer in the darkness, but rather in a place of &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow\"&gt;Moonlight and Shadow&lt;/a&gt;.\nLorkhaj was Fadomai's favored son. He was born in the darkness, and carried it with him. He was the first spirit to make his own path with purpose, as he had always had conflict within himself.\nNirni was also of Fadomai's third litter. She was always competing with Azurah for their mother's attention. On her deathbed, Fadomai bestowed on Nirni the greatest gift of all: the ability to bear many children. Nirni was happy with this, and was also happy that her rival Azurah got nothing, for she did not know that after she left, Fadomai would gift her secrets to her favored daughter.\nAt some point, Fadomai had another child named &lt;a href=\"Varmiina\"&gt;Varmiina&lt;/a&gt;. This spirit was not of any of her litters, but was born out of Fadomai's fear of losing her children. Azurah killed this spirit in the underworld, so now it can only haunt the Khajiit's dreams. "}

It is possible to bribe him with skooma (he even refers the Hero to a dealer) to earn his trust. Persuading Atraena will give them the location of Lorkmir's house, where it is evident he retreats to use skooma.

He will offer this service even if the Dragonborn favors &lt;a href=\"Sven\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt; instead of him in the quest \"A Lovely Letter.\"\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Lovely%20Letter\"&gt;A Lovely Letter&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is a potential &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; after this quest's completion if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; sides with him by either showing &lt;a href=\"Camilla%20Valerius\"&gt;Camilla&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Faendal%27s%20Fake%20Letter%20from%20Sven\"&gt;Faendal's fake letter&lt;/a&gt; or by exposing &lt;a href=\"Deliver%20Sven%27s%20Letter%20to%20Camilla\"&gt;Sven's letter&lt;/a&gt; to her. Either gains the gratitude of Camilla as well as Faendal. After completing this quest, Faendal can be asked to follow the Dragonborn, and he will readily oblige.\n&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Blades\"&gt;Rebuilding the Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaendal is one of the followers that can become a member of &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Steward&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the addition of , Faendal is one of the followers that can become a &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; for one of the Dragonborn's homes.\n&lt;a href=\"Faendal%27s%20House\"&gt;Faendal's House&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaendal's House is located in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes Faendal will not leave his house, leaving the door in an unlocked state. To fix this, re-enter and try again. It is possible to pickpocket Faendal's key, or if he is a follower, it may be taken from his inventory.\nExploits.\nArchery.\nAfter taking Faendal on as a Follower, it is possible to receive free Archery training. Purchase the next training level up from Faendal, then speak with him to open the trade option. Take back the gold paid for training. This can be repeated up to five times per level, up to level 50 in Archery.\nPickpocket.\nAs with any trainer, money given to him can be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed back. The total value of gold affects the success rate, as does the Cutpurse perk. This is another way to train both Archery and Pickpocket, but can only be used when he is not a follower, as the Pickpocket option is not available for followers.\nAnother way to steal from him safely is to reverse-pickpocket a &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralyze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; into his inventory (which requires the Pickpocket perk, Poisoned). Wait in Sneak mode while he is paralyzed, then once the effect runs out and he starts standing up, pickpocket him, and he will not notice anything being taken from him.\nLockpicking.\nFaendal's house has an Apprentice level &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lock&lt;/a&gt;. To raise lockpicking, the key to his house will need to be returned, if it was taken. With Faendal following, pick the lock to his house, then go back outside. He will lock it again, resetting it so it may be picked again.\nFollower.\nFaendal seems to have a lawful disposition; when trespassing in residences, he will occasionally say, \"You're not supposed to be in here\" and he will refuse to enter dialogue and take orders until leaving the area. If ordered to attack a civilian or hold guard, he will say, \"No. Not for you. Not for anyone.\" Also, if the Dragonborn enters combat with &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Hold Guard&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Soldier%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, he will join them in attacking the Dragonborn. This does not occur if he is hit by the Imperial Soldiers, as this will turn him hostile towards them.\nFaendal will not search through a dead body, even if the body is from a bandit, dragon or other creatures. He will reply with \"Can't do that. Sorry.\"\nFaendal is competent with bows but often prefers to use daggers and swords if he has them. He will use the most damaging bow in his inventory at long range, the most damaging blade available at close range, and while at a mid-range (provided no obstacles) he tends to use any weapon with the highest damage.\nQuotes.\nFollower quotes.\nIf the Dragonborn reads a Black Book when he is a follower:"}

It is one of three Dwemer ruins located on the island.\nWalkthrough.\nFollowing the path will lead to a room with a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Sphere&lt;/a&gt;. Ten buttons in two rows of five can be found there, with the following effects labeled from one to ten:\nContinuing the path leads to a platform entrance to a huge cavern with giant Dwemer gears spinning over a floor of water and high dwarven towers up ahead. Upon walking to the end of the right side of the platform, one can jump onto the gears. Some gears will have pipes in the center, where Dwarven Spiders will emerge. Continuing south leads the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to the Corridor Room.\nRoom of gears.\nGoing to the left will bring\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0to a small room, with two doors and\u00a0multiple buttons. Behind the first door is a chest on the wall, and some scrap metal. To open the other door, press the second button from the right on the bottom row. Go through the gate and down a corridor with a chest in a room to the left.\nFahlbtharz Forge.\nThe door on the left is the entrance the Fahlbtharz Forge Room. Upon entering, &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Kenro%20Hlan\"&gt;Hand Kenro Hlan&lt;/a&gt; will be hostile and instantly start attacking the Dragonborn. After defeating him, pick up the &lt;a href=\"Fahlbtharz%20Forge%20Gem\"&gt;Fahlbtharz Forge Gem&lt;/a&gt;, Unenchanted Weapon, &lt;a href=\"Pyroil%20Tar%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Pyroil Tar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hand%20Kenro%27s%20Note\"&gt;Hand Kenro's Note&lt;/a&gt; from his corpse. Picking up the first Fahlbtharz Forge Gem from Hand Kenro Hlan's corpse or &lt;a href=\"Fahlbtharz%20Forge%20Gem\"&gt;other locations&lt;/a&gt; throughout &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; will start the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Trueflame%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;.\" Reading Hand Kenro's note will explain that four Fahlbtharz Forge Gems, the Unenchanted Weapon, and Pyroil Tar are required to activate the forge and craft &lt;a href=\"Trueflame%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Trueflame&lt;/a&gt;.\nFahlbtharz boilery puzzle.\nContinue until reaching a &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Resonator\"&gt;Tonal Resonator&lt;/a&gt;. Hitting the resonator will open the gate to the left. Proceed though the webbed corridors and defeat several &lt;a href=\"Oil%20Spider\"&gt;Oil Spider&lt;/a&gt;s. Eventually, the Dragonborn will end up in a room with a gate. Looking a bit left and back down the corridor is another resonator hidden behind some webbing. Hitting that resonator will open this gate.\nContinuing down the passage and through a door leads to a room with a planter filled with assorted fungi. Kill the several &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt; here and pass through another door to the room of gears.\nWhen going straight and staying on the gears,\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0may get to the other side of the room.\nPassing through the gear mechanisms and\u00a0going up the stairs leads to the body of a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; adventurer named &lt;a href=\"Eydis%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Eydis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Eydis%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Her journal&lt;/a&gt; explains she and her &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; companion,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ulyn\"&gt;Ulyn&lt;/a&gt;, are searching for the &lt;a href=\"Visage%20of%20Mzund\"&gt;Visage of Mzund&lt;/a&gt;. To find Ulyn's body, one must enter the Fahlbtharz boilery and go to the top floor of that room; his journal explains the boiler mechanism. There are\u00a0six valves that must be shot, and each fills a different amount of lights in the center.\u00a0One must shoot the correct valves to equal\u00a0twenty lights. If\u00a0more are triggered, the lights on the boiler mechanism turn orange and Dwemer automatons will appear to attack.\u00a0\nThe valves hit will light the following number of lights:\nUse a bow and arrow and shoot the valves. The only solution to the puzzle is to shoot the far left, middle on the left, and middle on the right valves. One may also use a &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spell such as &lt;a href=\"Incinerate\"&gt;Incinerate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Spear\"&gt;Icy Spear&lt;/a&gt; to shoot the valves. If the resonators are hit incorrectly, the boiler will be overcharged, venting out steam and spawning hostile Dwarven automatons. Failing more than twice will result in three moving\u00a0spinning blades\u00a0being activated instead.\nAfter going through the door that opens,\u00a0one will\u00a0find themselves\u00a0back in the main cavern with the gears over water. There will be two leveled &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Ballista%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Dwarven Ballistas&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate. The second is over the bridge, and behind it is a chest with leveled loot. After defeating it, directly behind that across the bridge is a skeleton and a leveled bow. There is also another valve. To gain access to the Grand Hall, one must not hit it while standing on the same platform. Instead, one must go back to the rotating bridge and hit it with an arrow or magic. The bridge will then spin again, bringing\u00a0the Dragonborn\u00a0to the door to the Grand Hall.\nTo the left of the bridge, before entering the Grand Hall, below, there\u00a0is a small rock outcrop. On it, there\u00a0is a skeleton and an Expert level chest. It contains leveled loot. It should be noted that if one chooses to jump down to retrieve the chest contents, they will have to go back through the halls to reach the Grand Hall Door again.\nIt is possible to skip this whole process and go straight to the Grand Hall by using the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; shout and hopping along the edges of the bridges.\nThe Grand Hall.\nOnce entering the Grand Hall, there are a couple albino spiders, an oil spider, and two more Ballistas. After clearing those,\u00a0there are two\u00a0leveled &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurions&lt;/a&gt; (up to &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20Master\"&gt;Masters&lt;/a&gt;) Killing them allows the retrieval of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dynamo%20Core\"&gt;Dynamo Core&lt;/a&gt;s\u00a0to open the last door.\nTo finish, one may simply grab the helm and the piles of gold around it. There is also one of the\u00a0five &lt;a href=\"Kagrumez%20Resonance%20Gem\"&gt;Kagrumez Resonance Gem&lt;/a&gt;s on a plate. To exit, the lever must be pulled. Interestingly, the exit tower is not marked on the World Map, though other lifts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift%20at%20Raldbthar\"&gt;Great Lift at Raldbthar&lt;/a&gt; in Skyrim, are. It is, however, marked on the Local Map as \"Fahlbtharz Grand Hall.\" The closest location to it that the Dragonborn is able to fast travel to, without going through the underground location of Fahlbtharz, is the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Lodge\"&gt;Abandoned Lodge&lt;/a&gt; south of the Fahlbtharz Grand Hall exit lift.\nAlternatively, the Dragonborn can go back and grab all three Dynamo Cores, and retreat the way they came in, as the path is certainly easier going backwards than forwards and the cores are very valuable for crafting &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; items at the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf timed correctly, it is also possible to obtain two of the cores by taking the core from the pedestal which\u00a0controls the stairs and then taking the one that controls the spike gate. Then, the Dragonborn must quickly use Whirlwind Sprint and they will be in the treasure room with both and the spike gate blocking the path back."}

All of these people were thought to be \"possessed\" by the spirit of the warlord, but had critical flaws that made them destined to fail the fulfillment of the prophecy, and as such were revealed to be false Nerevarines. Many failed incarnates have come and gone since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, but came to an end when the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;true Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; fulfilled the Prophecy in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe first known intended Nerevarine was &lt;a href=\"Ane%20Teria\"&gt;Ane Teria&lt;/a&gt;, who was a holy crusader of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;'s golden age in the early First Era, some time after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;. She wrote writings, later known as &lt;a href=\"Apographa\"&gt;Apographa&lt;/a&gt;, that were suppressed by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. She followed the false gods unquestionably, and only began to believe the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; when it was too late.\nIn the late years of the Tribunate, &lt;a href=\"Idrenie%20Nerothan\"&gt;Idrenie Nerothan&lt;/a&gt; was an incarnate who demoralized and repelled the Akaviri invaders during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;First Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;. She knew nothing of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; and the Nerevarine Prophecy until she took refuge with the Ashlanders. She died trying to loot &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt;, the Sixth House capital in the northern &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;, considering her actions foolish.\n&lt;a href=\"Erur-Dan\"&gt;Erur-Dan&lt;/a&gt;, another incarnate, saw Morrowind make a treaty with either the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Humiliated by the surrender, he swore vengeance against the Empire and Tribunal alike. In later years, he despaired, and died fighting the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; creatures at Red Mountain.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasions\"&gt;Akaviri Invasions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, an incarnate named &lt;a href=\"Conoon%20Chodala\"&gt;Conoon Chodala&lt;/a&gt; led fellow &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s against the eastern invaders as the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; fled. He quested deep into House Dagoth's strongholds and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, killing evil creatures where they stood, becoming gulakhan of his people. Chodala went on to become the &lt;a href=\"ashkhan\"&gt;ashkhan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and began his quest to unite the tribes after being named Nerevarine. He made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; for the powerful staff &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt;, and allied himself with the violent &lt;a href=\"Red%20Exiles\"&gt;Red Exiles&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala used the staff to channel the god &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s divine energy for himself, making him increasingly reckless and overly confident, and each use weakening the god to the point where it almost killed him. He attempted to topple both the Tribunal and the Great Houses, seeking to go to war with them rather than earn their recognition as Hortator. His sister &lt;a href=\"Seryn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt; challenged his claim, causing them each to plea their cases to &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Woman%20Dovrosi\"&gt;Wise Woman Dovrosi&lt;/a&gt; on whether Chodala was a true Nerevarine. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and the statements of previous failed incarnate, Chodala was indeed found to be a failed incarnate, turning on his tribe and fleeing to &lt;a href=\"Kaushtarari\"&gt;Kaushtarari&lt;/a&gt; for the favor of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;. His use of the staff was disabled using a Tonal Inverter, and Chodala perished fighting the Vestige and Seryn at the shrine, with the staff later being used by &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; for the tasks of Clavicus Vile. Chodala's downfall came from craving glory, failing to see his real enemies.\nIn the waning years of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hort%20Ledd\"&gt;Hort Ledd&lt;/a&gt; was the intended incarnate. He was a thinker and not a doer, and though chosen by the prophecy, he was not a hero and did not fulfill the prophecy. He died around &lt;a href=\"3E%2027\"&gt;3E 27&lt;/a&gt;, in the last days of turmoil and unrest under the Septim Empire's rule over Morrowind.\n&lt;a href=\"Peakstar\"&gt;Peakstar&lt;/a&gt; was an incarnate who survived the Blight, but fell in battle with an &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Vampire\"&gt;Ash Vampire&lt;/a&gt;. She did not master the arts of war, and did not learn the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, so she could not be named &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, her spirit guided the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;true Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, helping them fulfill the prophecy."}

There are only two short levels separated by an incredibly deep pit.\nOverview.\nOn entering, it appears to be one smallish square chamber with a pavilion-like structure in the center. To the right on entering the main chamber, there are bedrolls, alchemical equipment, and a half-finished letter to a friend. On the eastern side of the pavilion, there is a small pillar with a button and to its left, a glass display case with a scroll inside, which proves to be an account of the procedure for human sacrifice to a deity named \"Gyub.\"\nIf the button is pressed, the floor of the pavilion retracts in four parts and the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; is dropped into a pit and falls to the second level, damaging but quite survivable since the drop was into water.\nRather than making the long drop from the false floor in the first level, they will find the second level is best accessed through an entrance hidden east of the main entrance, at the bottom of the hill. On the second level, at the base of the pit is a large pool, three &lt;a href=\"Scalon\"&gt;Scalon&lt;/a&gt;s and a Dead 'Volunteer'. The tunnels leading off will also be inhabited by Scalons or &lt;a href=\"Baliwog%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Baliwog&lt;/a&gt;, and will contain deposits of &lt;a href=\"Amber%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Amber&lt;/a&gt;, as well as stumps full of loot.\nA scroll in the pit describes an entity or deity named \"Gyub,\" and this area was used to make sacrifices to it. A glass cage holds the instructions on how to perform the ceremony. Although this entity does not exist, human sacrifices have been made to it.\nThe deity named Gyub may be a reference to Cthulu Deity Nub, and Nyarlathotep. The Tentacles also back up this theory, as well as the tomes found inside."}

They are often hunted for their &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax\"&gt;wax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Armor\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce common throughout &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, and the surrounding waters, they have been driven into isolated pockets in more recent times. There is some doubt on whether they shouldn't be classified along with &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;, for their semi-aquatic nature and \"troglophiliac\" &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;oid form.\nAccording to legend, the Dreugh devolved from a much more intelligent and civilized race due to conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (who used their hides and wax), and powerful, tyrannic Dreugh kingdoms are reported by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries&lt;/a&gt;, even going as far as to state they once ruled the world. That notion is explored in &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;'s lessons, where it is stated that, \"when the dreughs ruled the world, the &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; Prince &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; had been their chief.\" The sermon gives details of the form Bal took at the time, describing it as \"spiny and armored and made for the sea.\"\nAdditionally, tales of civilized Land Dreugh colonies (purported to have built stone cairn houses and structures) exist, which affirm that the species raised &lt;a href=\"mudcrab\"&gt;mudcrab&lt;/a&gt;s for sustenance, but no evidence of such behavior exists today.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Nix-Hound\"&gt;Nix-Hound&lt;/a&gt;s were used to hunt the Dreugh.\nBiology.\nDreugh are a race of creatures with claw-like limbs, pincers and scuttling feet \"protruding from a human-torso-sized skeletal frame,\" who secrete a particularly valuable shell wax from their bodies. The Land Dreugh's naturally sturdy carapace is known to deflect most attacks from common weapons.\n&lt;a href=\"Fronto%20Maecilius\"&gt;Fronto Maecilius&lt;/a&gt; states that the race migrates from the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt; into the Iliac Bay, and notes a particularity known as the \"Karvinasim\", a period of transformation in which the Dreugh walk on land, \"favoring shoreline marshes and rivers close to the open water.\" He also suggests that the Karvinasim heightens the individual's martial instincts, especially speed and hostility (which led to the evisceration of the writer's lead geographer, Pulcherius Pomptinus, by a territorial broodmother).\nAt the end of the Karvinasim (after about a year of land walking), the Dreugh return to their underwater environment, undergoing a final transformation called \"Meff\" or \"Meffing\" (noting that \"to meff\" is considered a verb). During Meff, the Dreugh submerge, devouring their land skin and air organs in a self-cannibalistic manner, as those become unneeded. After eating, they vomit the congealed remains as small fibrous balls known as Grom, that are approximately a foot in diameter. The spheres are described as foul-smelling, are found in clusters around lakes, and have no known \"virtues.\"\nAn unknown researcher, albeit based on his own observations, reports in his findings that Land and Water Dreugh could belong to two distinct species, as opposed to life cycles. The same source also refers to some accounts that seem to explain a difference between two types of Land Dreugh as sexual dimorphism. Dreugh appear to have an omnivorous diet, and have even been observed consuming &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; flesh. They can channel a form of &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage\"&gt;shock&lt;/a&gt; energy through their bodies as a natural adaptation (instead of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al ability), the way most scholars see it.\nBehavior and cultural importance.\nDreugh have no known language nor advanced communicative capabilities, and lay their egg broods in muddy areas. The eggs are often stolen by fisherfolk, to which the broodmothers who guard them react extremely violently. The dreugh were also said to worship a creature known as the &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Father of Dreugh,\" which is believed to be either a manifestation of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of Domination, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, or one of the monsters born from the union of Vivec and Bal (in this case described as \"a dead carapace of memory,\" that wouldn't have been a monster if a Velothi child hadn't worn it). A legend involving &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and the Ruddy Man explains the pact between the two. Within this myth, Vivec defeats the Father of Dreugh, sparing his life with the condition that his descendants gave the Dunmer their hides for making armor.\nA certain bloodstained recipe found in lists \"1 dozen dreugh eggs\" and \"2 unbroken dreugh legs\" as ingredients for a dish. &lt;a href=\"Dreughside\"&gt;Dreughside&lt;/a&gt; is likely named after its proximity to Dreugh nests, and was taken over by the creatures at least once due to &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sorick\"&gt;Baron Sorick&lt;/a&gt;'s actions, who had ordered Dreugh eggs to be harvested and spread around the settlement. &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Wax\"&gt;Dreugh Wax&lt;/a&gt; is used in and as an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt;. In , however, it is sought after by &lt;a href=\"clothier\"&gt;clothier&lt;/a&gt;s, who use it to improve &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;. The hide's only known use is the making of &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20Armor\"&gt;Dreugh Armor&lt;/a&gt;, while the eggs, as well as legs, have (rarely encountered) culinary uses."}

Drevis sends the Dragonborn to collect four ancient &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; containing advanced Illusion &lt;a href=\"spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20Mission\"&gt;Rescue Mission&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrevis Neloren has been kidnapped and taken to &lt;a href=\"Tolvald%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Tolvald's Cave&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;The Companions&lt;/a&gt; asks the Dragonborn to rescue him and escort him back to &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nDialogue.\n\"You... You can see me?\"\nIs there any College business I can assist with? \"There may be a matter in which your... skills... could be useful. The various points of focus for magic energies around the College have become polluted, and need cleansing. The magical energies underneath the College still require purification. Your assistance would be most useful.\"\nAfter cleansing the focal points:\nYour focal points have been, uh, cleansed. \"Yes, they have. I can feel the difference already. But of course, I'm far more in tune with these sorts of things than most. Thank you. I appreciate your assistance.\"\nWhat else is there to be learned about Illusion Magic? \"You have gone beyond my teachings, which is quite a feat. I did not think it possible. But there is always more to learn. I believe you are ready for the next step.\"\nAfter finding the texts:\nHere are the texts you requested. \"Yes, very good. Here, then, is the first of the Illusion spells you sought.\"\nLecture.\nDrevis Neloren delivers a lecture on &lt;a href=\"Doomstones\"&gt;Doomstones&lt;/a&gt; in the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;; most of the members of the College gather around him to listen to his lecture. After he finishes, everyone goes back to their usual schedule.\n\"\"The existence of so-called \"Doomstones\" throughout Skyrim has been repeatedly verified. The meaning of these stones has not. The prevailing opinion of Skyrim natives is that the stones are indeed magical in nature. While there is no direct evidence of this, it does seem likely.\"\n\"\"References to similar stones appear in lore throughout the various Tamrielic cultures. None, however, exactly match the markings or distribution of Skyrim's stones. At present, there is no confirmation of any of the various theories surrounding the nature of these stones. Their relative positions do not indicate that any individual stone is part of a larger, unobserved pattern. Also, their placement throughout Skyrim does not correspond to any known magical phenomenon.\"\n\"The age of the stones themselves has yet to be officially determined. It has been widely assumed that they were placed during the Merethic Era. Writings from that period, including those of Ysgramor himself, do not mention the stones and thus this idea cannot be verified. Nonetheless, many are drawn to these stones based on the local stories describing them as a source of significant power. The College will continue to research these intriguing objects, and of course any findings will be relayed with all possible haste.\""}

Very well, tie me to your belt and we can get started. No time to lose!\"\"\nAfter finding all his bones:\n\"You have no idea how good this feels! To be whole again, and walk with my own two legs.

Rather embarrassing, that.\"\nAfter defeating the worm cult, if &lt;a href=\"Olphras\"&gt;Olphras&lt;/a&gt; was persuaded:\n\"Quite the brawl, eh? If that doesn't strike terror into the heart of the Wormies, I don't know what will!\"\nAfter completing the quest, if Olphras was persuaded:\n\"Suppose you'll be moving on, then. You should come visit, tell us tales of your travels. We're a lot alike, you and I!\"\nConversations.\nAt the dig site:\nDringoth: \"\"Goradir!

Listen, we have a problem.\"\nAt &lt;a href=\"Spinner%20Amariel\"&gt;Spinner Amariel&lt;/a&gt;'s residence:\nDringoth: \"Spinner Amariel! We need your help. It's an emergency!\"\nSpinner Amariel: \"Dringoth! Who put you back together? Are you to blame for these Worm Cultists?\"\nDringoth: \"Not at all! Well, not exactly.

If we all use them together, we can drive out the invader!\"\nOlphras: \"Together? Since when have you done anything that wasn't for yourself?

Much of &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; is unsuited for the vineyards, &lt;a href=\"barley\"&gt;barley&lt;/a&gt; fields, or domesticated beehives needed to produce the sort of potables that other lands turn out in such great quantities, but lots of Reachfolk have a liking for strong drink. It's one of the few commodities the Reach is willing to trade for when they can't steal it.\nWhile most of the more open-minded Reachmen get their drink in trade, others who don't have much contact with the merchants of the outside world have to make do with what they have on hand. If you travel deep into the Reach, you'll come across Reach-made drink soon enough, generally in the form of hard ciders or a vile fermented &lt;a href=\"Sheep%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;'s milk called \"&lt;a href=\"klef\"&gt;klef&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nReach ciders run the gamut from dark, musty, and sweet\u2014a decent if heavy press\u2014to a clear, sour brew that's more of an acquired taste. It depends on the variety of &lt;a href=\"apples\"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt; used and the time of year they're pressed. Apple orchards are few and far between in the Reach, but plenty of wild apples grow in the forests and river valleys. The clans that live in those regions each have their own preferred method for brewing up their favorite cider. Some turn out good, and some are &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt; swill.\nKlef. Well, klef is what you make when all you have are sheep. I've never known an outlander who could stomach the stuff. In fact, I think the Reachfolk who claim to like klef drink it just to prove how much discomfort they can endure. It's a test of courage, I suppose. But most Reachfolk don't even pretend to like klef. They just drink it to get drunk.\nAnd that's why Reachmen are some of my best customers."}

According to legend, when the Great Cat God of Time &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; called his \"pride\" to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, The Last Litter Born in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Darkness\"&gt;Great Darkness&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; gave his \"&lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;roar&lt;/a&gt;\" to the immortal &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; to spite the Khajiit warriors. Rather then slaying them, Wulfharth used his &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;voice&lt;/a&gt; to move the moons &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;, turning the Khajiit into &lt;a href=\"Senche-Cat\"&gt;senche&lt;/a&gt;. While fierce and powerful they had lost all ability to reason except for Dro'Zira. The others\u2014Rhojiit\u2014presumably became the &lt;a href=\"Sabre%20cat\"&gt;Sabre cats&lt;/a&gt; which now inhabit &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nWulfharth then mounted upon Dro-Zira and rode up the slopes of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkan&lt;/a&gt;, where they together confronted &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarf-Orc\"&gt;King Dumac Dwarf-Orc&lt;/a&gt; in its chamber along with presumably his royal guard, &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. When Dumac raised his &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; to Wulfharth's throat, preventing him from &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20shout\"&gt;speaking&lt;/a&gt;, it was Dro'Zira who saved the Ash King by pouncing upon the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; lord. Sometime after these events, Dro'Zira was confined to the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sheggorath\"&gt;Sheggorath&lt;/a&gt; from which he was rescued from by Wulfharth in turn. There exists some degree of bitterness amongst Khajiit against the Nord &lt;a href=\"bards\"&gt;bards&lt;/a&gt; who do not recount this version of events.\nThe prophecies of a \"Dro'Jizad\" are comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20prophecies\"&gt;Nerevarine prophecies&lt;/a&gt; and may be tangentially connected."}

None of them lived to spend their money however; those that journeyed into Varsa Baalim with Frathen were slaughtered by the vampires trapped in the ruins since ancient times while those that remained outside were killed by the Hero."}

He said that Isabelle ran off with a thief named Vex, who lives in Riften.

Isabelle refused to be turned away, however, so Vex sent her to Hob's Fall Cave. Despite her misgivings, Vex seems to have expected her to make it back to Ranmir safely.\nUpon traveling to Hob's Fall, the Dragonborn discovers her corpse, along with a letter written for Ranmir explaining her intentions. The letter appears to have been written as if it was meant to be sent before she set off for Hob's Fall.\nTaking the letter and giving it to Ranmir gives him closure on his lover's death. After receiving this news, Ranmir states that he needs to think about things; afterwards, he ceases drinking excessively.\nThe quest has no reward, other than any experience gained through combat while completing it, but does count towards helping the people of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; in the process of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;becoming Thane&lt;/a&gt;."}

One of them was Pahzbar, who snuck candy for this one from the market and said her fur was very nice. Shazah didn't know what to say so she ran away. She has one piece of candy left and wants to put it in his paw for the burial, but Father won't let her near the cart.\nThis one is sorry she never got to say thank you, and she is very sad this sickness is here, but Father and his friends are working hard on it. Shazah will help, though she is still just learning.\n23rd of Sun's Dusk\nFather says not to be afraid, but &lt;a href=\"Nien\"&gt;Nien&lt;/a&gt; stewed vegetables for everyone without anyone even asking. She even told Shazah a story last night before bedtime and was kind to her. They all think Shazah can't understand, that she is just a kitten, but she does. When they do odd things, it means things are bad.\nThe fires burning in the market smell like the time this one cast fire and burned herself. And these fires have not gone out in days.\n24th of Sun's Dusk\nFather talked to one of the rich nobles this morning. They thought Shazah was asleep, but she wasn't and has very keen ears. The rich noble wants the district sealed off but Father says there are still sick people that need help. They argued for a long time.\n25th of Sun's Dusk\nFather has moved our camp to down near the gate. The rich nobles won't let us back in. The market is all burned down and people are just wandering the streets. So many are sick. Earlier, one woman was screaming outside of a house, pounding on the door, but they wouldn't let her in. The sun is almost down, but this one can see her lying next to the steps. &lt;a href=\"Edhelruin\"&gt;Edhelruin&lt;/a&gt; went to help her but came back looking very upset.\n&lt;a href=\"Lanelor\"&gt;Lanelor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thorelir\"&gt;Thorelir&lt;/a&gt; don't look so good, either. Father has given them tomorrow off.\n26th of Sun's Dusk\nFather has a cough but won't let Shazah get him any water. Edhelruin gave me a few new books to study instead, but it is hard to concentrate. The air smells very bad and the smoke makes this one gag.\nThere is talk about an army coming. Shazah hopes it will help Father distribute the medicine.\nLanelor left this afternoon after speaking with Father. He still hasn't come back and it is very late. There is a lot of screaming farther up by the rich noble's gate. Shazah is getting very scared.\n27th of Sun's Dusk\nFather and Nien wrapped Thorelir in a sheet this morning. There were sores and blisters all over her skin. Father's cough is worse, too. Just after midday he argued with Edhelruin. Shazah heard her name mentioned.\nThere are a lot of dead people in the street now. &lt;a href=\"Glothor\"&gt;Glothor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rallion\"&gt;Rallion&lt;/a&gt; used to collect them but they have stopped. Instead, they went to ask for help from the rich nobles.\nNien didn't even try to find food for us today. All we had was some boiled broth and this one is now very hungry, but she secretly gave what she had left to Father. He looks very tired.\n28th of Sun's Dusk\nNien is gone. She left sometime last night and this one misses her. She would sing at night when she thought no one heard, but this one always heard. Now it is just Edhelruin and Father. Shazah suddenly misses her &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;sister&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Namu\"&gt;Mother&lt;/a&gt; very much. It is very lonely here. Everyone is sick and angry. Someone came to the camp this afternoon and tried to steal things from Father. Edhelruin had to chase them away with a knife.\nFather won't let this one see him anymore. Edhelruin says we must leave and find Mother. How can Shazah leave Father like this? He is not well!\nEdhelruin is coming now. This one will demand to stay and help, even if Father says her destiny is elsewhere.\nThis one loves her Father more than any stupid destiny."}

Even though nobody ever attempts to take over, no one really sees him as the mayor, either.\nHe is one of the first people the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; meets in Passwall; he is seen heading up to the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Felas%20Sarandas\"&gt;Felas Sarandas&lt;/a&gt; to watch a group of adventurers attempt to fight him. Besides some small tidbits of advice, he has very little to provide the Hero.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Retaking%20the%20Fringe\"&gt;Retaking the Fringe&lt;/a&gt; he will be seen again inside &lt;a href=\"Xeddefen\"&gt;Xeddefen&lt;/a&gt; hiding from the &lt;a href=\"Forces%20of%20Order\"&gt;Forces of Order&lt;/a&gt;. If he is allowed to follow the Hero, he will be of some use until they get split up. If he is told he needs to leave on his own, he will probably be killed by one of the &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Order%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Knights of Order&lt;/a&gt; or die during the collapse of the ruins.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Fringe%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Through the Fringe of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt;, when first entering the portal on the island in the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt; after being briefed by &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt; at the end of &lt;a href=\"A%20Strange%20Door\"&gt;A Strange Door&lt;/a&gt;, will come to the town of Passwall.

Sheogorath is delighted, as this is a new turn of events, and sends the Hero to investigate. They will eventually go to the ruin Xeddefen.\nXeddefen is a fairly large ruin. Look for buttons in walls, traps, and watch the map for the beginnings of hallways behind secret doors. Proceed to the Great Chamber where they will discover Shelden, the self-appointed mayor of Passwall, sneaking through the halls.\nDialogue.\n\"Hello, I'm Shelden. I've been here the longest. That's why I'm mayor of Passwall. That, and because I'm the best at being in charge.

Felas and I slipped down here thinking that we'd be safe. But, no! We landed right in the middle of them! Felas ran off with them and left me to die! Me! That ingrate! Disloyal cur!

Well look at this, I found the easy road. How are things going over there?\"\nAfter getting out of Xeddefen:\n\"I'm going to stay here and help rebuild the place.

Afterwords, they will be directed to meet Walks-Softly in the Upper District of Abah's Landing. He can be found outside of Velmont Mansion, the family mansion of his old friend, &lt;a href=\"Anais%20Velmont\"&gt;Anais Velmont&lt;/a&gt;. Once spoken to, he will ask the Vestige if they are ready to assist him.\nIf he is asked about Anais, he will explain that he was taken in by her and the Velmont family when he had first arrived in Abah's Landing at a young age. He will then say that the family had eventually traveled to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; for business interests. Although Anais tried to persuade him to join, he refused, and instead left the mansion during the night. After the Velmont family left, he stayed within the mansion and wandered the streets of Abah's Landing until he was eventually taken in by the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnais has since returned and taken over the mansion, asking for Walks-Softly's whereabouts. Walks-Softly will explain that he wants Anais to put the past behind her, and asks the Vestige to take his belongings from the house in order to let her forget about him. He will then say that he will begin searching for the items within the family suites, and suggests for the Vestige look within the mansion's kitchen and courtyards. Afterwords, he will ask for them to meet him in the family suites.\nWalks-Softly's &lt;a href=\"Velmont%20Devotion%20Ring\"&gt;Velmont Devotion Ring&lt;/a&gt;, one of the childhood items, can be found in a Jewelry Box on the upper floor of the Velmont Kitchen. Another item, his &lt;a href=\"Hatchling%20Shell%20Bracelet\"&gt;Hatchling Shell Bracelet&lt;/a&gt;, can be found within the Disturbed Ground of one of the gardens in the Velmont Courtyard.\nAfterwords, go to the second floor of the Velmont Foyer to reach the family quarters. Walks-Softly can be found standing in front of one of the rooms. He will say that his &lt;a href=\"Moulted-Scale%20Amulet\"&gt;Moulted-Scale Amulet&lt;/a&gt; is within the bedroom, but he is disturbed by the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; in it, and requests for the Vestige to retrieve it for him. The Argonian, a slave washing the floor, will not detect the Vestige even while out of sneak mode. Once the amulet is taken from the Jewelry Coffer, Walks-Slowly will ask to go to the balcony, so that he may enjoy looking from it before he leaves.\nOnce on the balcony, Anais will appear and accuse Walks-Softly of betraying her and stealing her possessions. After confronting her, she will tell the Vestige that Walks-Slowly is nothing more than a \"lizard\" and a \"pet\" to her, given to her by her father at a young age. Anais will explain that the reason she was asking for his whereabouts is because he is her property, and that she has already called the guards as a result of them stealing.\nWalks-Softly will be in disbelief, and will attempt to say goodbye to her. However, Anais will respond that even if he escapes the mansion, her agents will find and bring him back. She will then run out, calling for the guards. The Vestige must escape the building with Walks-Softly. Afterwords, he will tell them to meet him back at the Thieves Den. The Vestige will need to sneak through Abah's Landing undetected, otherwise they will be confronted or attacked by guards.\nOnce in the Thieves Den, speak to Walks-Softly. When asked about what had happened, he will say that he is surprised at how much Anais has changed, and hopes to change her into the person he knew from their childhood, unless she finds him first. He will then thank and reward the Vestige, completing the quest."}

His realm in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; is known as the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as the Madhouse or \"The Asylums\" . It is separated into two distinct communities: &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;, the fantastic, colorful side, where art enthusiasts and insane revelers reside, and &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the horrific, dark and ominous side, inhabited by those with the darker side of Sheogorath's blessings. Sheogorath is attended by his Chamberlain &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt; and the Nobles of his realm, the Duke and Duchess of Mania and Dementia. He is also the main antagonist in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; questline in .\nBiography.\nEarliest mentions.\nSheogorath is one of the few Daedric Princes whose creation may be linked to the change or destruction of an &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;; others include &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i creation stories attribute his creation to the removal of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s \"divine spark.\" In one of these myths, he is described as the \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;-shaped hole\" of the world. However, in an interview conducted by the Imperial Library, Haskill states this interpretation of the creation of Sheogorath may not be the case.\nAssisting the Hero of Daggerfall.\nIn search of the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; realm known as the &lt;a href=\"Mantellan%20Crux\"&gt;Mantellan Crux&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath appeared and helped the hero in accomplishing their goal.\nShivering Isles.\nQuick Summary.\nThe Shivering Isles is explained by Haskill to be whatever Lord Sheogorath wills it to be; inside the gates of the exotic and twisted land boasts striking new wildlife (unseen on Nirn) and the oddest oddities of creatures, including &lt;a href=\"Baliwog%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Baliwogs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grummite\"&gt;Grummite&lt;/a&gt;s and the deadly &lt;a href=\"Scalon\"&gt;Scalon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe government is split into three factions: &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Mania\"&gt;Duke of Mania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duchess%20of%20Dementia\"&gt;Duchess of Dementia&lt;/a&gt; and Sheogorath himself. The names are self-evident when looking at Dementia's &lt;a href=\"Crucible\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; and Mania's &lt;a href=\"Bliss\"&gt;Bliss&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the Third Era, Sheogorath sent an invitation to Tamriel by way of a strange door in Niben Bay. The Madgod demanded a mortal Champion to face his foes. Throughout the course of the expansion, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; learns that Sheogorath is in fact &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of Order. He tells the Hero that at the end of every era he becomes Jyggalag again, and lays waste to his own Realm. After the Champion eventually defeats Jyggalag, he explains that in ancient times he was one of the more powerful Daedra Lords. The influence of his sphere was so great that the other Daedric Princes grew jealous and feared him. They cursed him to live as Sheogorath, the incarnation of the thing he hated most.\nAt the end of every Era, Jyggalag is allowed to take on his true form once again, and bring order to his realm, an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;. After the Greymarch, however, he is transformed back into Sheogorath, who spreads madness upon the realm once more. The Champion can end this cycle by defeating Jyggalag during the Greymarch occurring at the end of the Third Era. This releases him from his curse, allowing him to remain in his true form instead of transforming back into Sheogorath. After defeating Jyggalag at the end of the expansion, the Champion is named the new Sheogorath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath is \"on vacation\" in the mind of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; and his absence from the Shivering Isles is felt by his servant &lt;a href=\"Dervenin\"&gt;Dervenin&lt;/a&gt; who asks the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to convince the Mad God to return to the Isles. The Dragonborn finds themselves in Pelagius's mind and dressed in a &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Hat\"&gt;Fine Hat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fine%20Clothes\"&gt;and clothes&lt;/a&gt;. After introductions, and delivering Dervenian's request, Sheogorath explains to the Dragonborn that the only way to leave is to \"cure\" Pelagius's brain and tasks the Dragonborn to do so, and gives the hero the &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt; to help. After completing Sheogorath's tasks, Sheogorath agrees to leave and allowed the Dragonborn to keep the Wabbajack and clothes. He even asks that the Dragonborn \"look him up\" if they ever find themselves in the Shivering Isles. He even takes Dervenin with him back to Oblivion.\nPhysical appearance.\nSheogorath often appears on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; as a well-dressed elderly gentleman, which many mortals do not expect.\nReverence and worship.\nThe Dunmer.\nOriginally, Sheogorath was one of the Daedric Princes whom the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, now &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, revered in their ancient ancestral worship. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; became the dominating religion in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath\u2014along with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, Malacath, and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;\u2014became known as one of the \"Four Corners of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;.\" He was said to rebel against the Tribunal, and thus worship of Sheogorath became punishable by death. His role in &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; culture is to test them for any psychological weakness, and is associated with the fear other races have of the Dunmer.\nWhen he rebelled against the Tribunal, Sheogorath tricked the moon Baar Dau, inspiring it to hurl itself at the city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Sheogorath justified his actions by claiming Vivec was built in mockery of the heavens. Vivec is then said to have frozen Baar Dau in its descent, and the moon swore itself to the Tribunal's service forever. Today, the Tribunal Temple requires a pilgrimage to this moon, called the Shrine of Daring.\nThe Khajiit.\nSheogorath is one of the many prominent Daedric Princes in the culture of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; people. In the Khajiit myth of creation, Sheogorath is called \"Sheggorath.\" He is known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Skooma%20Cat\"&gt;Skooma Cat&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheoggorath was believed to have been born from the union of Ahnurr and Fadomai. He is an adversarial spirit that tests Khajiit on the Path by making them doubt the truth of their own thoughts, beliefs, and actions. He must be faced along the Path and be overcome before a Khajiit can visit &lt;a href=\"Hermorah\"&gt;Hermorah&lt;/a&gt;'s library. Some Khajiit tribes believe Sheggorath is dead and has been replaced by something Other.\nThe Empire.\nSheogorath's status as a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; and as a member of the \"Four Corners of the House of Troubles\" has made his mainstream worship largely taboo. Throughout Tamriel, however, there are small shrines where the devoted worship the madgod in secret. However, there is one holiday that is at least loosely related to Sheogorath. The second of Sun's Dawn is when Mad Pelagius day is celebrated. According to &lt;a href=\"Gwinas\"&gt;Gwinas&lt;/a&gt;, on this day there are great festivals and invocations at the shrines of Sheogorath.\nArtifacts.\nThere are six artifacts made by Sheogorath which are known on the mortal plane. The best-known of these is the staff known as &lt;a href=\"Wabbajack\"&gt;Wabbajack&lt;/a&gt;. It can transform a creature into something else, turn them into piles of cheese, or instant death, though it is impossible to predict the result, much like Sheogorath himself. This artifact can be found in the games \"Daggerfall\", \"Oblivion\", \"Skyrim\" and \"Online\", after doing tasks for Sheogorath, as part of certain quests. Another artifact is the &lt;a href=\"Gambolpuddy\"&gt;Gambolpuddy&lt;/a&gt; glove, which fortifies half of the user's attributes while draining the other half. Gambolpuddy is seen in \"Morrowind\", where it was found under a pillow in &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Daedroth\"&gt;Ald Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;. His third artifact is the &lt;a href=\"Fork%20of%20Horripilation\"&gt;Fork of Horripilation&lt;/a&gt;, a fork which drains the user's magicka. It was given by the &lt;a href=\"Statue%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Statue of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ihinipalit\"&gt;Ihinipalit&lt;/a&gt;, in St. Delyn's Canton's Waterworks in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth artifact worth noting is the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Everscamp\"&gt;Staff of the Everscamp&lt;/a&gt;. This unique artifact in \"Oblivion\" summoned four &lt;a href=\"Everscamp\"&gt;Everscamp&lt;/a&gt;s who could be neither banished nor killed. The fifth artifact of Sheogorath is the &lt;a href=\"Spear%20of%20Bitter%20Mercy\"&gt;Spear of Bitter Mercy&lt;/a&gt; which can summon a Frost Atronach wherever the holder of the staff points the staff. The last artifact and Sheogorath's main symbol of rulership is the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Sheogorath\"&gt;Staff of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, which freezes all foes in place. A lesser-known artifact of Sheogorath is the &lt;a href=\"Folium%20Discognitum\"&gt;Folium Discognitum&lt;/a&gt;, a book that contains the collected insights of madmen; capable of giving the reader immense power and knowledge.\nInvocation.\nSheogorath is one of the easiest Daedric Princes to summon. Although his official summoning date is the second of Sun's Dawn, Sheogorath can be summoned any time there is a storm occurring, or through an offering of a wolf or bear pelt. Another method of invocation is to leave an offering of yarn, lettuce and soul gems at his shrines in the mortal world.\nPersonality and traits.\nSheogorath savors the act of driving mortals insane and/or making them perform actions which can be seen as trivial or silly. He is completely unpredictable, and often comments in nonsensical or otherwise socially unacceptable statements. He often refers to the removal of entrails and has a curious obsession with cheese, which is taken to near hysterical levels in \"Oblivion\". Despite being completely mad, Sheogorath displays incredible intelligence and insight. He is invested in the affairs of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, as seen in being part of the &lt;a href=\"2920%2C%20vol%2004%20-%20Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;compact&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; in 2920 and his mention of attending the \"parties\" of the other &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Princes&lt;/a&gt;. He has also shown to be capable of not only manipulating mortals, but other Daedra Lords as well. Some famous cases include when he manipulated &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Sixteen%20Accords%20of%20Madness%2C%20Book%20XII\"&gt;killing his own son&lt;/a&gt;, defeated &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"Sixteen%20Accords%20of%20Madness%2C%20Book%20VI\"&gt;battle of beasts&lt;/a&gt;, and beat &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; at her own &lt;a href=\"Sixteen%20Accords%20of%20Madness%2C%20Book%20IX\"&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheogorath's attitude reflects the madness over which he rules. He spreads the madness of the Shivering Isles in &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and beyond. As one of the \"Four Corners of the House of Troubles,\" he is known for a rebellious streak. He speaks with an exaggerated mix of Irish and Scottish accents, which is likely to be a stretch from his usual voice for when he is angry. This may be a legacy trait from his appearance as an Irishman/Scotsman in an earlier \"Elder Scrolls\" game. As the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt; progressed, Sheogorath's accent became less and less flamboyant as he began to have \"moments of clarity\" the closer he came to becoming &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;The Prince of Order&lt;/a&gt;. A region in Morrowind, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorad\"&gt;Sheogorad&lt;/a&gt;, is named in his honor."}

A priestess of Azura named &lt;a href=\"Rayna%20Drolan\"&gt;Rayna Drolan&lt;/a&gt; has been living alone on an island north of &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt; to test which Prince is correct.

Legends fail to pinpoint whether he is an obstacle or a useful ally to those who call upon him. He enjoys inflicting madness or giving mortals a taste of it, as he does not view madness as a curse.\nHe is believed to harbor hatred toward the Tribunal, like with the other members of the House of Troubles. This has led Temple doctrine to accuse Sheogorath of being the one to hurl Baar Dau at Vivec City. While such a cruel act has never been verifiably attributed to him, Sheogorath is willing to cheat to get what he wants, as shown in his bet with Azura. \nUnlike his later characterization as a hammy or mood-swinging Madgod, Sheogorath appears quite calm and collected and even very formal in his conversation with the Nerevarine. This does not negate his utter willingness to bring harm upon mortals and his apparent disregard for his worshipers, who often suffer at the hands of Ordinators or that some enjoy killing each other as part of a \"dance.\""}

If a mortal displeases or angers him, Sheogorath has been shown to lash out violently and punish the offending mortal severely, even for the act of growing a beard or for excessive pride. Sheogorath is not above condemning loyal followers, such as the Duke and Duchess of his realm, if he feels it necessary.\nSheogorath's mood tends to change very suddenly; he can be pleasant one minute and threatening the next. His threats usually make a reference to body parts which he may take from the mortal he's speaking to. Sheogorath also has a habit of talking about random subjects and not sticking to the matter at hand.\nFor all of his excessive cruelty and unpredictability, Sheogorath heavily promotes the concept of free will and change, and he has shown repeatedly to care for the subjects of his realm and the realm itself, desperately relying on the Hero to protect the realm from destruction. Sheogorath also has a fondness for his chamberlain, &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt;, and praises him on occasion.\nLike most residents of his realm, Sheogorath does not see madness as an issue. He casually drives people insane and never bothers to cure anyone. He also claims to love eating, with a special fondness for \"brain pie.\"\nConversations.\nSyl: \"Wait! I must speak! The Ritual must not be completed!\"\nSheogorath: \"Syl! You dare interrupt Me? Only I interrupt Me. Like just then. I'm speaking with someone. We'll talk later. Or not. When is later, exactly? Not now, I'm sure of that. Guards, I think Syl forgot how to use the door. Kindly show her out. Before I forget myself.\"\nSyl: \"Thadon... dead? You've done this. It was you all along!\"\nSheogorath: \"Hold your tongue, little Duchess, or I'll tear it from your mouth.\"\nSyl: \"Replacing Thadon with this... outsider? This is how it ends. I should have seen this coming.\"\nSheogorath: \"Calm yourself, Syl. You're making my teeth itch. You still hold your office. I suggest you see to your duties.\"\nSyl: \"No! I see what's going on. I should have seen it before. You conspire to destroy us all! You're a fool if you think I'll allow this to happen.\"\nSheogorath: \"Fool? Visionary! Change is in the air, Syl. Breathe it deep! Bathe in its scent! Bottle it up. Save some for later.\"\nSyl: \"\"Order stands at our door. They've taken the Fringe! Did you even know? Do you care?

There has to be a way out. A way to escape.\"\nSheogorath: \"Then go, Syl. Return to your quarters. Before I send you back in pieces.\"\nSyl: \"Yes! That's what I'll do. I'll go. The enemy of my enemy. Order is the key. I'll keep them close.\"\nSheogorath: \"No! Let her go!\"\nSyl: \"This is not over, Madgod. I give myself to Jyggalag. As a Priest of Order, I'll be safe. Your empire will crumble before the armies of Order.\"\nThadon: \"Wait! I must speak! Halt! Cease! Desist!\"\nSheogorath: \"Thadon, how dare you interrupt me! Only I interrupt me.

Someone new? From somewhere else? Not here. I'm sure of that. I don't understand. Or I can't.\"\nSheogorath: \"Hold your tongue, little Duke, or I'll tear it from your mouth.\"\nThadon: \"Ridiculous! You can't do this! Although... you're omnipotent. Or just tall. It's one of the two, I'm sure. And a fool!\"\nSheogorath: \"Calm yourself, Thadon. You're making my teeth itch. You still hold your office. I suggest you see to your duties.\"\nThadon: \"\"Order approaches! It's taken the Fringe already! With Order clothes and Order hats!

This isn't good. I'm sure it's bad. I can't do this anymore. No more.\"\nSheogorath: \"Then go, Thadon. Have your Greenmote. Take a bath. But leave. Before I decorate my throne with your insides.\"\nThadon: \"Yes. That's it. I'll go. Away. Far away. Working for them is like working for us, but without all the dying.\"\nSheogorath: \"No! let him go!\"\nThadon: \"Enough! I go to Jyggalag. I give myself to him, as a Priest of Order! This isn't done, Madgod. I think it's just started.\"\nDark Seducer: \"Lord Sheogorath! I apologize for the intrusion, but you must help us!

Sheogorath is largely involved with the plot in the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; questline. He can later be encountered in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; in the form of an &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20Cat\"&gt;Skooma Cat&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nSheogorath once made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;; in exchange for the \"&lt;a href=\"Folium%20Discognitum\"&gt;Folium Discognitum&lt;/a&gt;\", Sheogorath would receive the &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime after the exchange was made, Shalidor came to regret this deal and blamed the Mad God for tricking the Arch-Mage into it. \nDuring the Mages Guild questline, Sheogorath agrees to let Shalidor reclaim four tomes needed to reclaim Eyevea, but the Vestige must perform several tasks in order to receive each tome. Due to an enchantment placed upon the tomes, Shalidor cannot read the tomes himself and must rely on his assistant, Valaste, to translate the books for him at a slower pace. \nUnknown to the Vestige or Shalidor, Sheogorath had cursed the tomes to slowly drive Valaste insane. Sheogorath intends to offer a second deal - reminiscent of the first one he made with Shalidor - by taking Valaste back with him to the Shivering Isles in exchange for the \"Folium Discognitum\", or cure Valaste of her madness and not give the \"Folium\". The decision is up to the Vestige. \nPersonality.\nSheogorath is a sadistic Daedric Prince who finds entertainment by inflicting madness on helpless individuals and driving people to commit murder. He has little remorse for mortals, whom he calls \"playthings,\" and will freely renegade on a deal with them if he finds an alternative to be more beneficial to him. He will also discard a loyal follower should they fail to meet his expectations, usually by getting someone to kill them.\nAs with mortals, Sheogorath has little regard for his fellow Princes and will happily steal from them to \"keep them on their feet.\" The death of his personal underlings, such as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;, is fair game if watching them fight someone is entertaining.\nInteractions.\nMages Guild.\n&lt;a href=\"Long%20Lost%20Lore\"&gt;Long Lost Lore&lt;/a&gt;.\nA high-ranking member of the Mages Guild, &lt;a href=\"Valaste\"&gt;Valaste&lt;/a&gt;, wants the Vestige to perform a task for her.

She lets the Vestige try to read the book, and they are transported to the &lt;a href=\"Circus%20of%20Cheerful%20Slaughter%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Circus of Cheerful Slaughter&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Chateau%20of%20the%20Ravenous%20Rodent%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Chateau of the Ravenous Rodent&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the final test, Sheogorath wants the Vestige to take a vacation in his &lt;a href=\"Chateau%20of%20the%20Ravenous%20Rodent%20%28Location%29\"&gt;family's chateau&lt;/a&gt;. However, all the three guest rooms are occupied, and two guests are cannibals. The correct guest is the one that isn't playing his role right and wants to get out. Next, the Vestige must find their way through a dark maze. Finally, they must fight their way through &lt;a href=\"Madman%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Madmen&lt;/a&gt; and Madwomen to a boss fight with &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Leo%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Uncle Leo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;flesh atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mad%20God%27s%20Bargain\"&gt;The Mad God's Bargain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige and Shalidor journey to Eyevea, but Sheogorath left portals to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; open and the island is covered in daedra. The Vestige fights Haskill. Sheogorath, who has been making Valaste slowly insane with his cursed books, offers to take her to the Shivering Isles. They can decide whether or not to save her.\nSide quests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Grip%20of%20Madness\"&gt;The Grip of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige must find the source of the madness inflicting the townsfolk of &lt;a href=\"Southpoint\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;.

We will now face each other in honorable combat. On your guard.\"\nArch-Mage Shalidor: \"Enough with the games, Sheogorath.

Dearie, why don't you come over here?\"\nValaste: \"Uncle Sheo? Are we going somewhere?\"\nSheogorath: \"Yes, little one. You're coming with me. Home to the Shivering Isles!

She's crazy, mad, a lunatic. All that time with Uncle Sheo's stories and she's got the urge to visit the Isles. My Shivering Isles.\"\nValaste: \"I do! I want to go with Uncle Sheo! He's got the butterflies! I love butterflies!\"\nSheogorath: \"Hmm, this is a conundrum. A riddle, a ... choice. I tell you what, mortal. Why don't we let you decide? Should Valaste stay? Or come with me to the dear old Isles?\"\n\"In fact, let's sweeten the deal. You decide she stays, I'll cure her! That's right! Uncle Sheo will make her sane again. Boring old Valaste, whose only friends are books!\"\nArch-Mage Shalidor: \"And if the adept decides she goes with you?\"\nSheogorath: \"Well, as it happens I have one more book here. I'd give it to you in exchange for Valaste. It's called ... the Folium Discognitum.\"\nArch-Mage Shalidor: \"Sheogorath, you bastard! You'd throw the Folium back in my face, after all these years?\"\nSheogorath: \"Wrote it myself, it's a delightful little artifact. It imbues the reader with the knowledge of madmen! It's very powerful ... worth oh, four or five of those Skyshard things you adventurers are always looking for.\"\n\"So! Valaste stays and I cure her. Or ... she goes with me and you, my little mortal, become much more powerful. Your choice!\"\nSheogorath: \"The mortal's decided to let Valaste stay! So, this is where I say my goodbyes. Mortal, nice working with you! Shalidor ... never change.\"\n\"Valaste ... sorry dear. Say goodbye to your little dreamlings.\"\n\"The Prince of Madness doesn't stay where he's not wanted ... heh, except when he does. But in this case, he doesn't! Until next time, Magelings!\"\nValaste: \"It's like ... it's like a fog has lifted from inside my mind. Adept, I don't know what to say. You've saved me from a fate worse than death.\"\nArch-Mage Shalidor: \"Valaste ... are you?\"\nValaste: \"Yes, I'm ... all right, Shalidor.

Thank the Divines. Sheogorath did this, all of it. He used me!\"\nDaraneth: \"And how exactly did he use you?\"\nMayor Aulus: \"He promised me power, the respect I deserve \u2026 but then he cursed my tongue with madness and let me make a mess of this town!\"\nDaraneth: \"You're so pitiful, even for a mortal.\"\nMayor Aulus: \"What?\"\n&lt;Sheogorath emerges from Daraneth's body&gt;\nSheogorath: \"\"You heard me! I've always wanted to meet a person within a person! Tell me, what's it like?\nMayor Aulus: \"I'm \u2026 I'm so sorry, Sheogorath!

Think of all I've built here, the wonderful screams I've created, all in your name. Doesn't that make me your favorite?\"\nSheogorath: \"Oh, very well. Sorry, my second favorite mortal friend! We had a good run, but it's time for your curtain call.\"\nIn the dungeons:\nSheogorath: \"And make it entertaining, would you? After spending so much time in this town, I finally know where the Colovians keep their fur hats.\"\nDaraneth: \"\"This is your chance to fix this mess. Go, deal with the \"mayor.\" If Southpoint bores him, Sheogorath will leave.\"\"\nBack in the cathedral:\nMayor Aulus: \"What do you mean, coming to kill me?\"\nSheogorath: \"It's a gift! A chance to shine, to prove you have some backbone that won't snap at the lightest touch! Really, Aulie, I'm quite fond of you. Mmm. Fondue. What was I saying?\"\nMayor Aulus: \"That you're fond of me. That you don't want to watch me die!\"\nSheogorath: \"Watch you die horribly, all alone, and laughing my head off when it happens? That doesn't sound like me. Does it? But I'm sure you can work the matter out for yourself.\"\nMayor Aulus: \"Please, don't do this! Maybe we can work something out?\"\nIf the Vestige chose to spare Mayor Aulus:\nMayor Aulus: \"Sheogorath, I've been thinking. Southpoint can't truly appreciate your gift.

I mean, think of how I could use your gift in a place that truly understood me.\"\nSheogorath: \"Well, I suppose you'd make a fine addition to the garden. Very well! The killing's off. Couldn't bring you to my home with more holes in you than when we first met. Just not proper.\"\nMayor Aulus: \"Thank you, Sheogorath! Thank you so much.

If the quest line is finished, Haskill will talk to them instead. If Shivering Isles has not been started, it is as if Shivering Isles is not installed and the quest proceeds normally.\nBorder Watch.\nSheogorath or &lt;a href=\"Haskill%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt; sends the Hero to a settlement called Border Watch. Follow the map marker and then talk to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; with a black hood named &lt;a href=\"Ri%27Bassa\"&gt;Ri'Bassa&lt;/a&gt;.

There are three ways to get the cheese. Either lockpick the display case and steal the cheese, pickpocket the key from her or kill her and loot the key from her body.\nAfter getting the cheese, go outside and put the cheese in the cooking pot in front of the inn. Wait until the rats appear.\nWhen it is over, look for the two piles of rat poison that Ri'Bassa put down in the center of town. One will be near the cooking pot and one farther down the stairs. But be quick, as the rats will eat it and the quest will fail. Take the poison and go to the sheep corral near the inn. Put the rat poison in the sheep's feed trough. One can also just kill the six sheep, but be cautious to not do this in front of the villagers.\nWait until Sheogorath congratulates the Hero and tells them to wait in the center of town and watch the sky.

Dervenin retrieved &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%27%20Hip%20Bone\"&gt;Pelagius' Hip Bone&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of changing Sheogorath's mind, but he once again refused. One follower of Sheogorath, a &lt;a href=\"madwoman\"&gt;madwoman&lt;/a&gt;, thinks it unwise to disrupt Sheogorath's vacation.\nBy &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath had been absent from the Shivering Isles for many years. Dervenin walks around Solitude in search of someone to help return him.\nPersonality.\nSheogorath has chosen to neglect his followers and his realm in favor of a vacation. He spends many years chatting with Pelagius III in the latter's own mind, repeatedly telling the same story about the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, which he claims he was a part of. He refuses to let anyone disturb him, much to Dervenin's distress.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; appears, Sheogorath is keen to remind them that he is an immortal and \"the\" Madgod and that they should tread carefully when addressing him. At the same time, he often gets sidetracked during conversation and even forgets at times what the Dragonborn is actually doing. Sheogorath describes his youth as involving narwhales, honey combs and babies' tears.\nUnlike previous appearances, Sheogorath wants someone cured of mental illness and instructs the Dragonborn to do just that for Pelagius III. He also makes a point of telling them they \"treated\" Pelagius and not simply \"fixed\" him. Sheogorath then expresses pride in Pelagius for finally being free of his illness, having believed that the late Emperor \"always had it in him.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Mind%20of%20Madness\"&gt;The Mind of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\nSheogorath has abandoned his people to go on vacation. Dervenin beseeches the Dragonborn to retrieve his master and gives them Pelagius' Hip Bone to accomplish this task. Once inside the mind of Pelagius III, the Dragonborn must cure his madness in order to convince Sheogorath to return to the Shivering Isles.\nConversations.\nSheogorath: \"More tea, Pelly my dear?\"\nPelagius: \"Oh, I couldn't. It goes right through me. Besides, I have so many things to do. So many detractors and undesirables, naysayers, buffoons. My...My headsman hasn't slept in three days.\"\nSheogorath: \"You are far too hard on yourself, my dear, sweet, homicidally insane Pelagius. What would the people do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? [laughter] Grow old? You are the best Septim that has ever ruled. Well, except for that Martin fellow, but he turned into a Dragon god, and that's hardly sporting. You know, I was there for that whole sordid affair. Marvelous time! Butterflies, blood, a Fox, a severed head... Oh, and the cheese! To die for.\"\nPelagius: \"Yes, yes, as you've said countless times before.\"\nSheogorath: \"Harumph! Well, if you're going to be like that, I think its best I take my leave. A good day to you, sir. I said good day!\"\nPelagius: \"Yes. Leave me to my ceaseless responsibilities and burdens.\"\nDervenin: \"Master! You've taken me back! Does this mean we're going home? Oh, happy times! I can't wait to...\"\nSheogorath: \"Yes, yes, that's quite enough celebration. Let's send you ahead, shall we?\""}

He is connected with the &lt;a href=\"Shezarrine\"&gt;Shezarrine&lt;/a&gt;, a strong figure who may have been &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; believed that \"freedom\" was just another name for Shezarr.\nHistory.\nShezarr convinced the other &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; to create &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and become mothers and fathers. When the gods created the world, some were angry and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Elven gods&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; felt tricked by Shezarr while the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Gods of Men and Beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (Shezarr) were pleased and relished in their sacrifices which brought the beauty of Mundus. Shezarr is seen as a father deity of Mankind, since he created Humans from &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Ehlnofey\"&gt;Wandering Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Manifest%20Metaphors\"&gt;War of Manifest Metaphors&lt;/a&gt; began.

He, and a thousand other deities, have sizeable cults in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Shezarr is especially venerated in the &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;n West, though he is called &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; there, as the West Kings are resolutely, and religiously, Nordic.\nThe haziness of Shezarr\u2019s relationship to the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; (he is often called their \u2018Missing Sibling\u2019) begins with &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, the so-called \u2018Slave Queen of Cyrodiil\u2019, the founder figure of the modern Empire. In the earliest Cyro-Nordic stories of the Heartland, Shezarr fought against the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s (the \u2018Heartland Highelves\u2019) on mankind\u2019s behalf. Then, for some unknown reason, he vanishes from the stage (presumably to help other humans elsewhere), and, without his leadership, the Ayleids conquer the humans and enslave them.\nThis slavery lasts for generations. The isolated humans eventually begin to venerate the pantheon of their masters, or at least assimilate so much of High Elven religious practices into their native traditions that the two become indistinguishable.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E242&lt;/a&gt;, the Cyrodilic humans, under the leadership of Alessia and her demigod lover, &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, revolt. When &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; lends its armies to the Slave-Queen of the South, the revolution succeeds. The Ayleid Hegemonies are quickly overthrown. Shortly thereafter, is captured by Alessia\u2019s forces, and she promptly declares herself the first Empress of Cyrodiil. Part of the package meant that she had to become the High Priestess of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, as well.\nAkatosh was an &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i god, and Alessia\u2019s subjects were as-yet unwilling to renounce their worship of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Elven pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. She found herself in a very sensitive political situation. She needed to keep the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; as her allies, but they were (at that time) fiercely opposed to any adoration of Elven deities. On the other hand, she could not force her subjects to revert to the Nordic pantheon, for fear of another revolution. Therefore, concessions were made and Empress Alessia instituted a new religion: the Eight Divines, an elegant, well-researched synthesis of both pantheons, Nordic and Aldmeri.\nShezarr, as a result, had to change. He could no longer be the bloodthirsty anti-Aldmer warlord of old. He could not disappear altogether either, or the Nords would have withdrawn their support of her rule. In the end, he had become \u201cthe spirit behind all human undertaking.\u201d Even though this was merely a thinly-disguised, water-downed version of Shor, it was good enough for the Nords.\nAs for why &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; did not somehow \u2018revitalize\u2019 Shezarr during his wars against the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, we can only speculate that, by his time, memories of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s follies (the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, the defeat at &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Event%29\"&gt;Battle&lt;/a&gt; of ) would have only damaged his campaign for the Imperial Crown.\nMichael Kirkbride,Officer of Paleonumerology,&lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;\nNotes.\nThis document was posted on the official Elder Scrolls forum by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Kirkbride\"&gt;Michael Kirkbride&lt;/a&gt; as an answer to why &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt; (Shor, Lorkhan) is not officially worshiped in the Empire, as a part of &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; pantheon.

The term \"Shezarrine\" itself is derived from \"&lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;,\" the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;ic understanding of what is essentially the Missing God, and was first used in reference to &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Pelinal\"&gt;Song of Pelinal&lt;/a&gt;\". If Pelinal was the Shezarrine, the figure is believed to have taken the role of many of humanity's greatest champions, often appearing to defend their people against rising &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; aggression, in a similar light to how many old myths portray the roles of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; and Shezarr.\nCreation.\nThe Shezarrine is believed to have found its origins after the defeat of Lorkhan, at the ending of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, who, according to Elven legend, were unable to destroy &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, instead decided to hide it where they thought it could never be found. The Heart was launched to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;, and where it landed &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; was formed. Though Lorkhan's body was all but destroyed, his soul could not be extinguished due to his living, yet sundered, divine center, and so was doomed to wander the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason, it is believed that whenever the Shezarrine appears, Lorkhan is in some sense physically walking Nirn. This is indicated through various &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i and &lt;a href=\"Redguard\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; myths regarding Lorkhan's demise stating \"\"We curse you, noisy &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;, to walk Nirni for many phases,\"\" and \"\"&lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; could only slink around in a dead skin, or swim about in the sky.\"\" A possible explanation for the existence of these avatars may have be found in Lorkhan's supposed failure of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Aurbis%29\"&gt;the Tower&lt;/a&gt; is the conduit through which gods can revert themselves into mortal forms.\nElven chronicles of the late Merethic Era and onward record varying accounts of a legendary and immortal human personage wandering Tamriel, gathering armies, conquering kingdoms, ruling them, then leaving to wander again. This seemingly cyclical role is seen repeated in old Cyro-Nordic myths, where Shezarr is said to defend the ancient &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s from the Ayleids before mysteriously vanishing, presumably to help humans elsewhere. Then, without his leadership, the Nedes are conquered and enslaved. This strange occurrence may find some clarity in Elven myth, where Lorkhan is stated to be \"more of a limit than a nature, so he could never last long anywhere\". These champions have been understood to reincarnate back into the mortal realm on various occasions. &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was prophesied by &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; to return to Nirn as either a \"fox animal or light.\"\nShezarrine.\nPelinal Whitestrake.\nPelinal Whitestrake was the great hero of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Revolt\"&gt;Alessian Slave Revolt&lt;/a&gt; that occurred during the early years of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and may have been the Shezarrine.\nPelinal's own likeness to the Missing God seem quite apparent, indicated through lines found in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Song%20of%20Pelinal\"&gt;The Song of Pelinal&lt;/a&gt;\" regarding Pelinal as having \"\"emerged into the world like a &lt;a href=\"Padomaic\"&gt;Padomaic&lt;/a&gt;, that is, borne by &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; and all the forces of change therein\"\" and likewise lacked a heart, possessing \"only a red rage shaped diamond-fashion\". Both factors are common motifs reflected in various legends of Lorkhan. It was even mentioned that the Men-of-&lt;a href=\"Kreath\"&gt;Kreath&lt;/a&gt; on having gazed upon Pelinal at the bridge of Heldon, had mistook him for their own god Shor, the Nord's interpretation of the Missing God, returned from the dead. Despite these possible connections to Lorkhan, Pelinal was said to deny all ties to the god, and killed all those who spoke of \"god-logic\" in his presence, save for the &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;slave queen&lt;/a&gt; herself. In one case, a man who claimed Pelinal to be the Shezarrine was smothered by moths in their sleep.\nOther evidence that associates Pelinal with the divine Lorkhan, are the claims that he was either immortal or had been reincarnated many times before, as separate individuals. Pelinal, as was his incarnation during the Alessian revolt, was occasionally referred to as \"Pelinal the Third,\" with speculation reasoning that he had already been incarnated twice before. This is supported by certain texts stating that Pelinal was one of the individuals who wandered Tamriel during the late Merethic Era, supposedly having conquered the whole of Tamriel in ages long passed. It is also claimed that within the twelfth vault of the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Dusk\"&gt;Library of Dusk&lt;/a&gt; lies a rare tome, possibly aprocrphal but possibly written by Pelinal himself, known as the \"\"Conversations with the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;\"\", which elaborated on the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nZurin Arctus.\nZurin Arctus is another individual sometimes regarded as an avatar of Lorkhan. Zurin Arctus was the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; and Grand Vizier during the early years of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne indication that Zurin Arctus was the Shezarrine is a particular quote of the &lt;a href=\"King%20of%20Worms\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt; that listed Zurin Arctus, amongst other champions of man (i.e. Pelinal and Ysmir) as beings capable of recalling where they were during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. The quote also refers to Zurin as \"Arnand the Fox,\" \"the Fox\" being an epithet used amongst &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; denoting individuals of particular cleverness. The title is commonly seen referring to other like heroes, such as Hans the Fox. It was even said that Pelinal Whitestrake, upon his death, would be reborn as a \"fox animal.\" The King of Worm's quote also brings another interesting implication: that, given the Middle Dawn's occurrence preceding the Third Era by several millennia, Zurin, like Pelinal, was either immortal or has undergone previous incarnations. Possibly the most suggestive link relating Zurin to the Shezarrine is Shezarr's recognized involvement in the foundation of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s, in which Zurin is stated to have been the very first.\nOther evidence includes Zurin Arctus' claim that he removed his own heart to create the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; that would be used to power the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. The missing heart is the most prominent factor when regarding the myths of Lorkhan, whom lost his own heart creating the world. A skeptical, but noteworthy piece of evidence could be found with Zurin Arctus' creation, the \"Dragonbone Mail.\" It is said that this great armor piece Zurin enchanted was unable to stay in one place for extended periods of time. This parallels Lorkhan, who \"could never last long anywhere.\" This same connection can be found in Pelinal and other like individuals, who were known to wander Tamriel gathering armies, conquering kingdoms, then leaving to wander again; never staying in the same place for too long. Interestingly enough, the Dragonbone Mail was itself said to be crafted for a \"traveling warrior\" who \"never stays put for long.\"\nWulfharth.\nKing Wulfharth was a Nordic &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; during the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. He bears a strong connection to the Nordic aspect of the Missing God, &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, and is therefore believed to have been an avatar.\nDuring his early reign, he was named \"Shor's Tongue\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; 'Dragon of the North,'\" for his intense zealotry and the re-institution of the Nordic faith, which was then threatened by the spread of &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessianism&lt;/a&gt;. Elven chronicles attest that \"Ysmir\" was one of the individuals who, like Pelinal, Hans the Fox, and Harrald Hairy Breaks, had championed men in the later years of the Merethic Era. According to old Nordic legend, Ysmir was a great king of men and &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; who reigned for over a thousand years during the Mythic age and set the pathway to entering &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic afterlife.\nAt one point during Ysmir Wulfharth's rule, legends speak of the evil god, &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, summoning the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; back into the world to eat the lifespans of the Nords. Wulfharth pleaded to Shor to save them and so Shor's ghost answered his calls to battle Alduin, as had once occurred at the beginning of time. Observing the fight, Wulfharth learned to &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt;, with the capabilities of manipulating time itself, but in the process of using this to fix the Nordic people, Wulfharth accidentally made himself too old and died. It should be noted that other sources seem to claim that it was actually Shor that removed the curse from the Nords, which could imply a possible confusion of identity between Ysmir, Wulfharth, and Shor, much like how Pelinal was once similarly mistaken for the same god.\nCenturies after his death, Shor's ghost \"remade\" Wulfharth to be the general in his army to reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Shor&lt;/a&gt;, lost millennia ago but rediscovered at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. After Shor was defeated by Nerevar at Red Mountain, the Ash-King Wulfharth was said to have had trouble keeping his own form without the presence of his god. Many years passed and Wulfharth was adopted into Nordic worship as \"Ysmir the Grey Wind,\" but his own personal identity was supposedly lost through his profound connection to Lorkhan. Like many other avatars, Wulfharth was said to have lost his heart, being placed within the Mantella and used to power Tiber Septim's Numidium. Not only does Wulfharth's loss of his heart reflect Lorkhan's own tragic fate, but the fact that the Numidium was specifically crafted to harness power from the Heart of Lorkhan seems to provide an unquestionable link between Wulfharth and the Missing God, Lorkhan.\nOther related evidence that Wulfharth was an avatar of Lorkhan comes from a quote attributed to him stating \"Don't you see where you really are? Don't you know who Shor really is? Don't you know what this war is?\" This quote has been understood to refer to the fact that the War at Red Mountain was taking place during the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; of the Red Moment. This is likened to the King of Worms quote, who places Ysmir as one of the beings capable of comprehending the Dragon Break.\nOversouls.\nThe Oversouls are believed to possibly be mixtures of souls created from the &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;Enantiomorph&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiber Septim.\nTiber Septim is confirmed to be the oversoul mixture of Talos Stormcrown and &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, which was most likely formed after Zurin Arctus crowned Talos as the Emperor \"Tiber Septim.\" Arctus and Talos supposedly joined together as one in order to fortify the throne and protect both Cyrodiil and its people. The oversoul created from Talos and Arctus was collectively referred to as \"The &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;Enantiomorph&lt;/a&gt;\" by some. Tiber's moniker as the \"Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings\" can be seen as a reference to this union. The Seat of Sundered Kings is a term sometimes used to refer to Cyrodiil in reference to the cultural and often national split between the Kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;. This merging between Talos and Arctus symbolically represents the consolidation of those realms into the greater Cyrodiil, in which is represented by Tiber Septim himself.\nTiber Septim is also alluded to being more than one person in the \"&lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;36 Lessons of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;\" where he is referred to as the \"two-headed\" king.\nThis seems to imply both Talos and Arctus being Tiber Septim. This may also have been hinted at with the &lt;a href=\"Two-Headed%20Septim\"&gt;Two-Headed Septim&lt;/a&gt; that is seen in , which depicts a seemingly normal gold piece, but with both sides depicting the head of Tiber Septim. However, this is obviously very speculative.\nThe Mortal Talos.\nThe individual known as Talos Stormcrown, or General Talos, is believed to possibly be the combined oversoul of &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;. The reasoning behind this possible Stormcrown bridging between the two is based in Wulfharth's supposed visit to Hjalti's camp at the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hroldan\"&gt;Old Hroldan&lt;/a&gt;. During his visit, Wulfharth spoke with Hjalti and helped him destroy the walls of Old Hroldan; it is also implied, though not directly stated, that Hjalti's &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; was actually the work of Wulfharth. This is seen through quotes that state that Hjalti actually lied about his throat being cut as a means to excuse his inability to use the Thu'um after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Old%20Hrol%27dan\"&gt;Battle of Old Hrol'dan&lt;/a&gt;. However, at Old Hroldan, Ysmir takes the form of a storm which guards Talos from the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; arrows, and Talos shouts down the walls himself. Seeing as Wulfharth states that Hjalti was never a &lt;a href=\"Tongue\"&gt;Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, this implies Talos, who is normally believed to be Hjalti, may have in actuality been the two acting as one individual. Likewise, Wulfharth is never actually recorded as ever being physically present during any of Talos' conquests outside of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Arcturian%20Heresy\"&gt;The Arcturian Heresy&lt;/a&gt;\". As it is stated, Wulfharth occasionally acted as a double for Tiber Septim so that he could administer his Empire while also conquering at the same time.\nTalos Stormcrown was also the entity that was given the title \"Ysmir\" by the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;, a spiritual title originally held, and almost completely associated with, Wulfharth. Strangely enough, the name \"Tiber Septim\" itself apparently translates to 'Dragon of the North,' or in other words, 'Ysmir.' Other evidence which implies a crossing between these two people is the claim that the individual \"Talos\" was born on the frozen continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that Hjalti, who is generally accepted to have been Talos, was seemingly a native of &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;. Wulfharth on the other hand is often stated to have been a native of Atmora. While it could be said that Hjalti was merely claiming to be an Atmoran to build his legend, there is a strong implication that Talos was truly a supernatural native to Atmora.\nTalos Stormcrown, like Tiber Septim, has also been said to have multiple heads. He was referred to as the \"Many-Headed Talos\" during his use of &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt; to remove the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly implying he is multiple people.\nThe Underking.\nThe identity of the Underking has been contested between the two beings &lt;a href=\"Ysmir%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Ysmir Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;. Wulfharth claims to have been the Underking since his awakening to defend &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, but Arctus claims to have become the Underking after his betrayal at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is suspected that like Tiber Septim, the Underking is the result of the souls of Arctus and Wulfharth mixing to become a single oversoul. This is supported by the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt; was believed to be made from Zurin Arctus' heart (though possibly Tiber Septim's) and used to hold Wulfharth's Heart. The existence of both Wulfharth's and Zurin's hearts being contained in the Mantella and the Underking's wish to be reunited with his Heart imply that the Underking could have been a mixture of the two. Another notable quote from \"The Arcturian Heresy\" states that, with his last breath, Ysmir Wulfharth's heart roared a hole into Arctus' chest, killing him, with the loss of both their Hearts possibly implying some unity between the two.\nHowever, this pairing is not as likely as the above two oversouls, as certain situations regarding the Underking seems to imply that both Zurin and Wulfharth were both separate individual Underkings, most notably the events after the destruction of Numidium. When Numidium was defeated by the Underking, it was said that Arctus-Underking went into a period of semi-slumber in a subterranean vault due to his loss of the Mantella, and did not wake up until the events of . However, Wulfharth-Underking claims that directly after Tiber Septim's death, he became a secret adviser for his grandson &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Also during the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Divines\"&gt;Blood of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, it was said that Zurin cursed a group of &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; Tiber Septim sent to his shrine in &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;, despite the fact that he was said to be in a comatose state during the time, and that Zurin's followers have stated that he wished no harm against any of the Blades. It has been implied before that there are multiple Underkings.\nApotheosis of Talos.\nThe God &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, along with his deification, has been speculated and challenged by many of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s inhabitants. Some claim that he was so great in life that the gods ascended him to the heavens and made him a god, while others claim he isn't a god at all. In some unlicensed material Talos, as a god, is believed to actually be Hjalti, Zurin, and Wulfharth combined into a new oversoul through a process known as the &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;Enantiomorph&lt;/a&gt;. This combined soul was so identical to Lorkhan that it was actually able to &lt;a href=\"Mantling\"&gt;mantle&lt;/a&gt; his place in the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quote states that Talos became a god by mantling through the fourth walking way. Due to Talos' already heavy connection to the god Lorkhan through his multitude of souls, and mantling requiring one to be so similar to a god that \"they must walk like you,\" it can be assumed that Talos mantled Lorkhan. Other evidence that appears to hint that Talos mantled Lorkhan is his statue appearing in which depicts him overshadowing a serpent, a symbol commonly used to represent Lorkhan. Other sources depict Talos transforming into Lorkhan. Evidence supporting Talos' use of the Enantiomorph to achieve godhood would be that Tiber Septim himself was infrequently known as \"the Enantiomorph.\""}

Multiple entities can be hit with one charge.

Shimmerene is colloquially known as the City of Lights, because it is a beacon of light and beauty amidst the plains of Summerset.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nShimmerene is situated along the eastern bay of the Summerset Isle, taking a large portion of the area and sharing it with the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Acropolis\"&gt;Direnni Acropolis&lt;/a&gt; in the northern hills. Shimmerene is built atop of cliffs overlooking the Auridon Strait, which connects Shimmerene to the island region of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. The outskirts of Shimmerene is an open field, with ruins and the plantation of &lt;a href=\"Russafeld\"&gt;Russafeld&lt;/a&gt; in the area. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Eldbur%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Eldbur Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; can be found just off the southern road towards the southern mountains. There is a riverway west of the town, that eventually leads to the Shimmerene Bay, this river originates from the southern mountains, somewhat serving as a border for the southeast area. The &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20Dockworks\"&gt;Shimmerene Dockworks&lt;/a&gt; are not built around the city-state, but rather to the north, on the other side of the river estuary, near the Acropolis. The gates of Shimmerene overlook the area and it leads to the western town square. The town square has two paths that lead to the rest of the city, one path going to the northern docks and &lt;a href=\"the%20Ruins%20Bazaar\"&gt;the Ruins Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;. Another path leads to the &lt;a href=\"Monastery%20of%20Serene%20Harmony\"&gt;Monastery of Serene Harmony&lt;/a&gt;, the local kinhouse, and the nobles district. The North Path is where local Guilds and the &lt;a href=\"Anchors%20Aweigh%20Inn\"&gt;Anchors Aweigh Inn&lt;/a&gt; are located, so most people can be found here. In between these distinct districts are homes, with paths connecting the main streets. Underneath Shimmerene is the local Waterworks, which pours sewage and freshwater into the sea.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Evermore was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Shasara\"&gt;Queen Shasara&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the waning years of the third era, the youth of the Summerset Isles banned together to disrupt the years of xenophobia and superiority that the Altmer have displayed throughout the eras. This began when the Isles were incorporated into the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i descent married King &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Karoodil\"&gt;Reman Karoodil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. Members of this nascent revolution have given a critical and rigid view of the hierarchy and xenophobia shown by their people. As time went on, the movement had taken a darker turn, where a group known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Beautiful\"&gt;the Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; had begun to appear, unleashing terrorist attacks. The first target was the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;, which proved to fail in their favor, so they decided to kill living nobility, such as the Princess of Shimmerene, whose murder was both gruesome and horrifying to the public. It was very likely that the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; had brought down groups such as the Beautiful, dissidents of the Thalmor."}

It is part of a larger cave system, like many other &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; caves. In parts of the cave, the ceiling is covered with blue and white glowing deposits.\nWalkthrough.\nThe first area has a rock bridge over a pool of water with a small waterfall. A ramp leads down into the water, but there is nothing of interest there. A leveled creature prowls the area, such as a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;. Further down the tunnel is a larger chamber with a sole Falmer as a lookout on the second level. There is a trip wire to a claw trap at the entrance to deal with.\nBelow is a small alcove with dead bandits. To the left is a chest and tent on the way up to the upper level where the Falmer is. There is a rock with Falmer weapons, helmets and &lt;a href=\"chaurus%20eggs\"&gt;chaurus eggs&lt;/a&gt; on the northern edge of the upper level. The final chamber is a Dwarven room, and has another Falmer and, depending on level, one &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven centurion&lt;/a&gt; in stasis. There is a chest just to the left of the tunnel to &lt;a href=\"Shimmermist%20Grotto\"&gt;Shimmermist Grotto&lt;/a&gt;."}

Once taken care of, there is a tent with &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20eggs\"&gt;Chaurus eggs&lt;/a&gt; and a chest to loot.\nFollowing the path to the bottom and taking the tunnel lined with egg sacs leads to a Chaurus hatchery. If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is poorly equipped, the melee and long range attacks of a Chaurus can be devastating. The room is devoid of anything of value apart from a single skeleton and the Chaurus eggs.\nThe next chamber consists of a pit with two more Chaurus with some skeletons which appears to have been a previous meal. On the right side is another chest next to the tunnel exit and more Chaurus eggs. With , higher level players may encounter &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20Fledgling\"&gt;Chaurus Hunter Fledgling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen traversing the next tunnel, expect to encounter a Falmer. The tunnel ends at a Dwemer door. Open and proceed through.\nBehind the doors, is a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion&lt;/a&gt; and a high level Falmer. One may draw the Falmer away from the Centurion by going back into the tunnel, where the Centurion is too tall to pass through. Once the area has been cleared, there are &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Artifacts\"&gt;Dwemer Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; and Falmer equipment on the altar and a chest near the tent.\nExit the chamber on the east side of the room which leads back to the first chamber in Shimmermist Cave behind the waterfall.\nNotable items.\nShortcut.\nIt is possible to rock jump and enter the final room of the Grotto directly.\nJump onto the ledge at the intersection of the walkway and the wall of the chamber on the right hand side when facing the exit from Shimmermist Grotto. Circle the room and then jump onto the ledge that goes to Shimmermist Grotto. Be aware if the Dragonborn alarms the Dwarven Centurion and Falmer, they will follow the Dragonborn even if they return to Shimmermist cave.\nIf one enters this way, it is possible to avoid the fight. Sneak as close as possible to the chest without being detected, then sprint to it, loot it and sprint out of the cave. However, the Falmer and Centurion will give chase."}

Helvi has begun dealing with a smuggler in &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; and wishes that the Nerevarine complete the transaction by taking five pieces of &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;raw ebony&lt;/a&gt; to the smuggler's house.\nEbony smuggler.\nAs ever, the Nerevarine is faced with a choice when dealing with a task granted by Helvi.

The realm consists of three parts: &lt;a href=\"Mania\"&gt;Mania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dementia\"&gt;Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Fringe\"&gt;The Fringe&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Shivering Isles were once the realm of &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyggalag&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of order. He was so powerful that the other Princes feared him. Because of it, they cursed Jyggalag to live a life of a madman, the thing that he hated most. Since then the Shivering Isles have been ruled by Sheogorath. However, at the end of every &lt;a href=\"era\"&gt;era&lt;/a&gt; Jyggalag is allowed to revert to his original form and wreak havoc in this realm of Oblivion. This event is known as the &lt;a href=\"Greymarch\"&gt;Greymarch&lt;/a&gt;, when Jyggalag destroys the Isles and turns them into the realm of perfect order. As a part of his curse after gaining control of the Shivering Isles, Jyggalag transforms back into Sheogorath who then recreates the realm back to one of madness.\n&lt;a href=\"Haskill\"&gt;Haskill&lt;/a&gt;, who would later become Sheogorath's chamberlain, was said to have &lt;a href=\"Mantling\"&gt;mantled&lt;/a&gt; Sheogorath in an event in a previous time. Sometime during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath made a deal with the famed wizard &lt;a href=\"Shalidor\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;, giving him the &lt;a href=\"Folium%20Discognitum\"&gt;Folium Discognitum&lt;/a&gt; for his work on &lt;a href=\"Glamoril\"&gt;Glamoril&lt;/a&gt;, in return for the island of &lt;a href=\"Eyevea\"&gt;Eyevea&lt;/a&gt;. Eyevea was later transported to the Shivering Isles, a decision which Shalidor would come to regret.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valaste\"&gt;Valaste&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in creating a corporeal form of Shalidor's soul. With his knowledge, Shalidor assisted the guild in surpassing Sheogorath's trials in the Shivering Isles, in the locations of &lt;a href=\"Cheesemonger%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Cheesemonger's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Glade%20of%20the%20Divines\"&gt;Glade of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Circus%20of%20Cheerful%20Slaughter%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Circus of Cheerful Slaughter&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Chateau%20of%20the%20Ravenous%20Rodent%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Chateau of Ravenous Rodent&lt;/a&gt;. After the trial, Sheogorath had Eyevea returned to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Sheogorath sent an invitation to the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a large three-headed gate to the Isles located in the Niben Bay. His purpose was to find a champion who would end the Graymarch. The person who would later become Sheogorath's champion would be none other than the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, who would kill the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, become the Duke or Duchess of either Mania or Dementia and defeat Jyggalag's Forces of Order while defeating the Daedric Prince himself in single combat, thus freeing him from his curse and allowing him to roam the plains of Oblivion in his true form. After being defeated, Jyggalag named the Hero of Kvatch the new Daedric Prince of Madness before departing to wander the voids of oblivion.\nDuring the Fourth era, Sheogorath went on a \"vacation\" to the mind of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Dervenin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dervenin&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the Isles went into a state of chaos without the Mad God's rulership, as according to Dervenin the Cold Flame of Agnon went dark and that north and south raged war, suggesting a civil war took place. This was not until the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, at the urging of Dervenin, went into the mind of Pelagius Septim III and made the Daedric Prince return to the Isles in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Flora and Fauna of the Shivering Isles are a testament to Sheogorath's madness, as the north, known as Mania, reflects the Mad God's pleasure with simple madness and calm obsession. Mania features tall mushroom-like plants and colorful trees, and its fauna reflects these traits as creatures native to Mania are known to have more colorful bodies. The south, known as Dementia, reflects the darker side of Sheogorath's personality, featuring swamps, bogs and dark forests. All of the plant life of the Shivering Isles are connected to the root system, a series of natural caverns and rock formations that is, in fact, a large living organism that is connected to all of the trees and plants in the Isles.\nThe Fauna of the Shivering Isles include many diverse creatures, including the tree-like &lt;a href=\"Gnarl\"&gt;Gnarl&lt;/a&gt;, the amphibious &lt;a href=\"Baliwog\"&gt;Baliwog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scalon\"&gt;Scalon&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin-like &lt;a href=\"Grummite\"&gt;Grummite&lt;/a&gt;, the insect-like &lt;a href=\"Elytra\"&gt;Elytra&lt;/a&gt;, the canine &lt;a href=\"Skinned%20Hound\"&gt;Skinned Hound&lt;/a&gt;, the undead &lt;a href=\"Shambles\"&gt;Shambles&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saint&lt;/a&gt; and their rivals the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hunger%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Hunger&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting to the Shivering Isles.\nArrival to the Shivering Isles is solely at the discretion of Lord Sheogorath, Prince of Madness. He permits the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; access after killing an insane dark elf that comes out of &lt;a href=\"A%20Strange%20Door\"&gt;the portal&lt;/a&gt; to the isles. Once they kill him, they can enter the portal.\nReligion.\nThe main religion in the Isles is obviously the worship of Sheogorath himself, as many, if not all, houses in the Isles include a small bust of the Mad God, as well as lettuce and string, the favorite playthings of the Mad God. There are also different opinions on Sheogorath's worship, and the role of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Arden%20Sul\"&gt;Arden Sul&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Zealot\"&gt;Zealot&lt;/a&gt; cult believes that Sheogorath is a living god, and Arden Sul was his mortal aspect. While the &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;Heretic&lt;/a&gt; cult believes that Sheogorath is in fact a powerful mortal man pretending to be a Daedric Prince who profanes the teachings of Arden Sul.\nThere is also the &lt;a href=\"Apostle\"&gt;Apostle&lt;/a&gt; cult, which believes that the Mad God is unfit to rule the Shivering Isles after their leader &lt;a href=\"Ciirta\"&gt;Ciirta&lt;/a&gt; discovered during last Greymarch that Sheogorath \"left\" the Isles (while in fact he turned into Jyggalag). &lt;a href=\"Ciirta\"&gt;Ciirta&lt;/a&gt; and her apostles launched a movement to usurp the Mad God out of &lt;a href=\"the%20Howling%20Halls\"&gt;the Howling Halls&lt;/a&gt; that once kept the mad &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20III\"&gt;Pelagius III&lt;/a&gt;. Another part of the religion of the Isles is the worship of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Arden%20Sul\"&gt;Arden Sul&lt;/a&gt;, as both Mania and Dementia have different stories of his death."}

Shock damage is also the primary component of at least six &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells in \"Skyrim\".\nEnchanting.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can learn this enchantment by disenchanting a weapon of any sort with the Shock Damage Enchantment already imbued. The enchanted weapon will glow a dark bluish-purple, and deal a certain amount of additional shock damage along with the standard weapon's damage, as well as half as much Magicka damage. The higher the Dragonborn's Enchanting skill (along with any &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Enchanting\"&gt;Fortify Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; taken), the more damage dealt on both Health and Magicka.\nUses.\nBecause of its Magicka-draining capabilities, weapons that are shock-enchanted and shock-based spells are the ideal implements for combating wizards and other beings who utilize magic-based attacks. Shock-enchanted &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt; are the most recommended, as wizards often tend to create a gap between themselves and an opponent to utilize ranged spells to attack from a distance. Also, it is incredibly important to remember that there are very few enemies in the game that bear a resistance or outright immunity to shock damage; &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Storm Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netch%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Netches&lt;/a&gt;, Shock Spiders and &lt;a href=\"Orchendor\"&gt;Orchendor&lt;/a&gt; are creatures that possess this trait.\nCombined with other effects.\nWith the use of the &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Effect\"&gt;Extra Effect&lt;/a&gt; perk, Shock damage can be mixed with &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; damage for an especially devastating effect, as health, stamina and magicka are all drained simultaneously. However, some enemies, such as &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, are mostly if not completely immune to frost damage, so it is advised to exercise caution when dealing with these enemy types.\nSpells.\nSpells that deal Shock Damage:\nUnique weapons.\nBesides the occasional staff, there is also quite an assemblage of unique weapons in the game that each bear shock-based enchantments.
