Make friends. Be a part of something.\"\n\"But who can join?\" they ask.\nWe're just like any other trade guild. We've got requirements. And if you want to advance in the ranks, we've got standards.\nYou want to be &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Agility%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;agile&lt;/a&gt;.

You want to know about &lt;a href=\"Security%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;security&lt;/a&gt; -- locks, &lt;a href=\"Trap%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt;, and how to get around them. You want to defend yourself. You travel light and fast, and want light arms like &lt;a href=\"Daggers%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;daggers&lt;/a&gt; and shortswords. You don't want to get into a slugging match, so you want the &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;marksman's&lt;/a&gt; weapons -- the bow, crossbow, throwing star, and dart. You want &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt;, so you can keep moving, and moving fast.\nWhy belong? Simple. Everybody needs friends.\nThe help of friends includes information. Your friends at the Thieves Guild know where the action is, and where the action is safe, and where it is not. The help of friends includes a place to rest, and a place to buy supplies and services -- training and tools. The help of friends includes fixing things with the &lt;a href=\"Guards%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; at a discount rate. That's where the 'honor among thieves' part comes in. Friends stick together, and help each other.\n\"But what about the competition?\" my admirers ask.\nThe competition is the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt;. And you don't want to join them, because they don't want you and they're not very nice. They have this thing about outlanders. They want them all dead. So, unless your ambition is to be dead, you don't want to join them.\nAnd the Camonna Tong are bad people. The Camonna Tong don't mind killing people. Heck, they LIKE killing people. The &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, thinks killing people is bad business. You want to be good people, right? So join the Thieves Guild, and stay far, far away from the Camonna Tong.\nSo you want to join. But where do you look?\nBeing a thief is not like being a fighter. You don't just go to the local guild Hall. The Thieves Guild doesn't have Guild Halls. But thieves like to be where their friends are. And where are their friends? At the local cornerclub or trade house. In &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, look for friends in &lt;a href=\"Balmora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Quarter\"&gt;Foreign Quarter&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are to speak with Arquen between 12 am and 3 am in &lt;a href=\"Applewatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Applewatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nReturn to talk to Arquen at the designated time between 12 am to 3 am in Applewatch and when she is finished explaining, the Hero will be teleported to the statue of the Lucky Old Lady in &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; along with the rest of the members. Arquen performs the ritual to open the door to Crypt of The Night Mother. The statue begins to move and reveals a hidden door beneath it. When she and the other &lt;a href=\"Black%20Hand\"&gt;Black Hand&lt;/a&gt; members have gone down, follow them through the door. Although it is not necessary, it might be a good idea to 'use' the statue to benefit from its buff.\nOnce they have entered the crypt, &lt;a href=\"Arquen\"&gt;Arquen&lt;/a&gt; will begin speaking to the Night Mother. After a short time they'll all discover that &lt;a href=\"Mathieu%20Bellamont\"&gt;Mathieu Bellamont&lt;/a&gt; is the traitor, who will then pull a dagger and kill two of the other &lt;a href=\"Speaker\"&gt;Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Banus%20Alor\"&gt;Banus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belisarius%20Arius\"&gt;Belisarius&lt;/a&gt; before turning on the Night Mother. Mathieu will repeatedly try to attack the Night Mother, but she's ethereal and can't be harmed. Then he attacks the Hero and they must defeat him. He carries a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20of%20Numbing\"&gt;Dagger of Numbing&lt;/a&gt; and it's not a hard battle, though a low-level Hero may find it useful to use a poison.\nOnce the traitor lies dead, the Night Mother says that she knew all along of Mathieu's plot since he was a boy. She could have stopped him anytime, but allowed him to keep pursuing, so that the Dark Brotherhood may learn a lesson from being so blind at the growing threat.\nThe Night Mother tells the Hero to help themselves to any treasure (random as well as dependant on level) in the room. She also warns them to take everything they can, as they will not be allowed back in the chamber after this event.\nThere are three small coffin shaped containers made of stone and reagents on the Night Mother's altar, as well as the weapons and robes of the traitor and the two dead Black Hand members. After collecting any desired items, tell the Night Mother they are ready to leave. She will also make the Hero the new \"&lt;a href=\"Listener\"&gt;Listener&lt;/a&gt;\" of the Dark Brotherhood and upgrade their original &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20Woe%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blade of Woe&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen talking to the Night Mother again, she will teleport the player back to the Sanctuary in &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Brotherhood questline is over and there'll be no more contracts, but the Hero will be able to speak with the Night Mother once a week to get orders of assassination for &lt;a href=\"Arquen\"&gt;Arquen&lt;/a&gt;, through the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20Death\"&gt;Whispers of Death&lt;/a&gt;,\" and they'll be given 200 gold each time."}

You wanted to know everything available about the guild and its members in order to make informed decisions concerning how to respond to current activities aimed at our Great House. The guild personifies the darker aspects of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; life, celebrating murder in the name of &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, the group was created to curb violence and prevent the always contentious House politics of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; from escalating into full-scale war. Since such a war has yet to erupt, I suppose you could say that the Morag Tong has thus far been a successful experiment.\nThe Morrowind government sanctioned the Morag Tong long ago during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, and to this day they continue to perform tacitly legal assassinations, utilizing a system of contracts known as \"honorable writs of execution.\" Under the established laws, no member of the Morag Tong can perform an execution without a writ detailing the exact target and purpose for the sanctioned murder. Maintaining an air of impartiality in regards to house politics, the Morag Tong carries itself with all the weight of a cherished and ancient institution. Members never act on their own accord and cannot take on missions of their own choosing. Instead, petitions for services are sent to the guild's Grandmaster for examination and consideration. If the petition is accepted, an honorable writ of execution is prepared and awarded to a Morag Tong member. From that point on, the contract's target is dead and just doesn't know it - before long the assassin makes contact and completes the deadly transaction.\nUnlike other killers or even those crazed fanatics that belong to the Dark Brotherhood, the Morag Tong assassins admit to their acts and proudly brandish their honorable writs of execution after each kill. These writs pardon a Tong member of any legal entanglements that may occur in the administration of the associated contract. Indeed, by law, a Tong executioner must step forward and proclaim that a kill was performed legally and to the letter of the contract, thus absolving him- or herself and averting any subsequent ramifications related to the act. The Tong claims to provide no safe harbor for criminals, so any member that does not comply comes under investigation and internal punishment.\nThe origins of the Morag Tong remain shrouded in legend and conjecture. All I have been able to ascertain for sure is that the group emerged during the bloody &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; conflicts of early Morrowind, establishing the writ system and rising to prominence by the end of the First Era. The guild reached the height of its power about two-hundred-and-fifty years ago, operating openly across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and attaining a reputation as unparalleled, reasonable, and honorable killers. The group became too sure of itself, too confident of its position. After a number of high-profile assassinations of monarchs and great lords that frightened the Tamriel nobility, the Tong retreated back to its holdings in Morrowind and vanished from the public eye for more than a century. Today, the group maintains a subdued presence in Dark Elf lands, taking select contracts as they work to reestablish their name and reputation with the Great Houses.\nThe organization of the Morag Tong hasn't changed much over the years. A Grandmaster leads the guild, who then grants power to each guild hall's master to accept and assign writs. Note that individual members cannot accept a contract without approval, however, and the guild masters have proven over the years that they take great care when deciding to accept a contract. One possible avenue to explore should the conflict between &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; and the Morag Tong escalate is the group's affiliation with Mephala, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; of lies, deception, and murder. While the organization is sanctioned and their heretical ways mostly overlooked by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; will deal with these heretics swiftly and brutally if they catch them in the act of committing murder. I leave that for you to decide.\nEnar Dren, House Redoran Master of Records"}

He will therefore ask for your help with this.\nMeet Darius at the entrance to the burial grounds. He will explain that Zariyah is here because she was framed by her brother for a theft she did not commit.

You will be able to recognize her by the wooden ring she wears. \nHead in and start examining the bodies. The body you are looking for will be in the northeast, by the Skyshard.

She will ask you not to embalm her body just yet, as she wishes to see herself exonerated before she passes on to &lt;a href=\"The%20Far%20Shores\"&gt;The Far Shores&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that her brother and his friends actually swallowed the gems that she was framed with stealing, and that their remains are also here in the Tears of the Dishonored. She will ask you to retrieve those gems. You may however persuade her into getting embalmed and moving on without being exonerated; if you do so, .\nIf you do not persuade Zariyah, pick up the Skyshard and then head out to look for the remains of the thieves. The remains of &lt;a href=\"Hillid%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Hillid the Blade&lt;/a&gt; will be directly west of you, by the pool of water.

Finally, head southeast, retrieve the gem from &lt;a href=\"Islaif%20the%20Highwayman\"&gt;Islaif the Highwayman&lt;/a&gt;'s body and slay his spirit. \nOnce you have all the gems, head back to Zariyah.

It is the second of two smaller zones that make up a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;'s story, the first being &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nBal Foyen is a volcanic landscape of towering &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt;, ash-filled winds, and many native &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20%28Online%29\"&gt;kwama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Netch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;netches&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Online%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt;. Once nothing more than a wild expanse of marshland, much of this small region of &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; was granted to freed &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; slaves upon the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. The soil has been fertilized by the ashfall carried by the winds from Stonefalls, making Bal Foyen an ideal place for farmers and herders.\nThe Argonians who now make their homes here have established small farming settlements of shabby mud huts, built up near their guar pens, and grow saltrice and other crops in the fertile soil of the former wastes. The zone is also home to Fort Zeren, a fort built by the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; to protect both Bal Foyen and &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt; from attack.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Bal Foyen and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nBal FOyen features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Ebonheart Pact's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Bal Foyen. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another. &lt;a href=\"Repeatable%20quests\"&gt;Repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nThree Skyshards can be found in Bal Foyen totaling in one &lt;a href=\"skill%20point\"&gt;skill point&lt;/a&gt;. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Now Bala wants to find his tomb, to spend the rest of her life, to raise his ghost and see him one last time. She says, \"The pain of losing him once was unbearable. I can't lose him again.\"\nIf the Vestige helps her find Eanen's grave, they will find out that Eanen was actually a cruel and sadistic master. Bored of torturing servants in horrible unthinkable ways, he seduced Bala with lies, in order to break her heart. This presents them with a hard decision, as they must decide to either tell Bala about her lover's faithlessness and dishonesty, or to say nothing at all.\nIf the Vestige tells her, Bala will say that she does not believe them, and will then run away from the graveyard. Shortly afterward, they can meet her ghost down the road. Still, after her death, she only wants to be reunited with Eanen. Her body can be found in the water on the southeastern edge of Ebonheart."}

When first encountered he will complain about bandit trouble and give the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; a note outlining his encounters with two different bandit groups. Reading the note will add two new quest markers for finding the two bandit encampments. The camps do not need to be defeated in any particular order. Each group consists of a leader and four other lower level bandits. The Saints are geared more towards heavy armor and physical fighting, while the Seducers have light armor and boast a mage among them. In both camps the \"investigate\" objective consists of looting the bandit leader's body for their journal. Both camps have a cage with a \"teleport pet\" inside, a &lt;a href=\"Manic%20Elytra%20Nymph\"&gt;Manic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demented%20Elytra%20Nymph\"&gt;Demented Elytra Nymph&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Each camp will have quite a bit of loot including the weapons and armor of Golden Saints or Dark Seducers.\nAfter looting and reading the journal the quest markers will update to guide the Dragonborn to another camp of each type, Kinthal's for the Saints and Svarig's for the Seducers where the previous process is repeated by killing the leader and other bandits present, looting the journals, and reading them. Once the journals have been read a new quest will be added for \"&lt;a href=\"Restoring%20Order%20%28Skyrim%20Creation%20Club%29\"&gt;Restoring Order&lt;/a&gt;,\" but you still have to locate Ri'saad again and inform him his bandit troubles have been dealt with to complete the quest. At some point after looting Kinthal and Svarag, a group of Saints and Seducers will track down the Dragonborn for revenge. "}

If the Dragonborn fights Balgruuf in \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Stormcloaks%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;,\" he will equip &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Plate%20Armor\"&gt;Steel Plate Armor&lt;/a&gt;, minus the helmet.\nFamily.\nHe has a brother named &lt;a href=\"Hrongar\"&gt;Hrongar&lt;/a&gt;, and three children, &lt;a href=\"Frothar\"&gt;Frothar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagny\"&gt;Dagny&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nelkir\"&gt;Nelkir&lt;/a&gt;.

If he is asked what side he is on in the War, he will say that he is \"on the side of Whiterun\". In his neutral stance, he remarks that he may well be obligated to choose a side; the Empire as a province, the Stormcloaks out of loyalty to Skyrim. Indeed, he will only express open hatred of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; chooses a side in the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, slandering them\u00a0if they seize &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; with the Stormcloak army under Ulfric and his second-in-command &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt;; according to &lt;a href=\"Gerdur\"&gt;Gerdur&lt;/a&gt;, Balgruuf and Ulfric had been at odds for years and fears Balgruuf will side with the Empire out of spite.\nAccording to his son Nelkir, he still worships &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; and hates the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; as much as &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric&lt;/a&gt; and many other &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; do, if not more. If encountered at the party at the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Embassy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor Embassy&lt;/a&gt;, he will make this view very clear and will also be more than happy to disrupt the proceedings on behalf of the Dragonborn.\nBalgruuf has strong bonds with his friend and &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Irileth\"&gt;Irileth&lt;/a&gt;, whom he fought alongside during their youth. As such, she rarely lets him out of her sight and berates him for a lack of concern for his personal safety.\nAccording to the Official Game Guide, Balgruuf is viewed by many as the embodiment of a true Nord and his allegiance with the Empire as having actually convinced many would-be Stormcloaks that the Empire may actually be the answer to Skyrim's problems.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;The Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Dragonborn appears before the Jarl to tell him of the &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; attack on &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, they learn that another dragon, &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;, is attacking the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;. Together with Irileth and several\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;Whiterun Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, the Dragonborn defeats the dragon and returns to the Jarl. Balgruuf then dubs the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun, therefore the Dragonborn receives Lydia as their housecarl. After settling a near-argument between his steward &lt;a href=\"Proventus%20Avenicci\"&gt;Proventus Avenicci&lt;/a&gt; and Hrongar regarding the Dragonborn themself, Balgruuf then advises that they visit &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; for instruction on how to learn the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Fallen\"&gt;The Fallen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn needs to trap a dragon in Dragonsreach with the Jarl's help.\n&lt;a href=\"Season%20Unending\"&gt;Season Unending&lt;/a&gt;.\nBalgruuf is present during the peace negotiations between the Imperials and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;, but only if he is still in control of Whiterun depending on if the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun%20%28Stormcloaks%29\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; from allying with the Stormcloaks is completed beforehand or not. If completed first, &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; will be in attendance in his stead representing Whiterun while on Ulfric and Galmar's side of the table. If Balgruuf is still Jarl, he will be with Elisif, General Tullius, and Legate Rikke on their side, with or without being joined by &lt;a href=\"Elenwen%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elenwen&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Message%20to%20Whiterun\"&gt;Message to Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeliver Ulfric's axe to Jarl Balgruuf or deliver Balgruuf's axe to Ulfric. (depends on whether the Dragonborn sides with the Imperials or Stormcloaks)\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Whiterun\"&gt;Battle for Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt first, Balgruuf will remain neutral in the Civil War. But once the Dragonborn chooses a side, Balgruuf will eventually decide to help the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of which side the Dragonborn chose. If the Dragonborn sided with the Legion, Balgruuf will give a speech at the end of the battle once the Stormcloaks are driven off. Alternatively, siding with the Stormcloaks means the Dragonborn must fight Balgruuf, Irileth, and several of the Whiterun Guards during the assault. If &lt;a href=\"Vignar%20Gray-Mane\"&gt;Vignar Gray-Mane&lt;/a&gt; becomes Jarl of Whiterun, Balgruuf, along with Irileth and &lt;a href=\"Proventus%20Avenicci\"&gt;Proventus&lt;/a&gt;, travel to the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, seeking refuge with Imperial sympathizer &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Glory%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Glory of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is seen at &lt;a href=\"Kodlak%20Whitemane\"&gt;Kodlak Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral if he is the Jarl of Whiterun.\nGifts.\nOnce the Dragonborn is recognized as\u00a0a &lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; of Whiterun, they are given a &lt;a href=\"housecarl\"&gt;housecarl&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Lydia%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt;, who can serve as their\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;.

He also presents the &lt;a href=\"leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Whiterun\"&gt;Axe of Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragonborn, a status symbol of the Thanes of Whiterun.

The ship I thought the storm had swallowed was at its head, dragging the clouds like a net around the slower ship. It spat lightning at galley's sails and buffeted it on wind and waves.\nI didn't dare move, watching helpless as the storm-ship overtook the galley.

Balmora is a very prosperous city that gets traction from places such as &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nBalmora is located on the northern banks of the &lt;a href=\"Odai%20River\"&gt;Odai River&lt;/a&gt; and is built on the river's east and west shores. Balmora's main feature is the large canal constructed in the middle of town; this canal is used for fishing with the city walls as well as a mode of transport throughout the Odai Riverbanks. Balmora is also built in between small mountains that give it a natural barrier to protect it from incoming weather (i.e. Ashstorms). Balmora is located on the Western Main Road that goes through the West Gash and leads to the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Vvardenfell Ashlands&lt;/a&gt;. Miners come and go from Balmora since many Mines exist in the area such as the &lt;a href=\"Vassir-Didanat\"&gt;Vassir-Didanat Ebony Mine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mine\"&gt;Caldera Ebony Mine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Crater\"&gt;Caldera Crater&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the inner walls, Balmora is divided into two, but in reality, Balmora consists of three districts. The eastern side of the river is known as &lt;a href=\"Balmora%2C%20Labor%20Town\"&gt;Labor Town&lt;/a&gt; and it is where many of the residents live. People ranging from the middle class to the lower class live in Balmora, many of Balmora's criminal aspect resides in Labor Town. The area on the western shore is known as the &lt;a href=\"Balmora%2C%20Commercial%20District\"&gt;Commercial District&lt;/a&gt;. The Commercial District is largely where all the business happens, the local &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; are found in here, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt;. The Silt Strider in Balmora can take travelers to places such as &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suran\"&gt;Suran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Balmora%2C%20High%20Town\"&gt;High Town&lt;/a&gt; is the westernmost district and is located on the hills of Caldera Crater. This is where Balmora's nobility lives as well as the Temple formerly dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;; it now worships the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Reclamations\"&gt;House of Reclamations&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, House Redoran claimed a majority of Western Vvardenfell and built the city of Balmora with the Hlaalu style in mind. Balmora became the Redoran Capital of Vvardenfell and settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Gnisis\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ald%20Velothi\"&gt;Ald Velothi&lt;/a&gt; followed suit with the Redoran Style in mind. The Counselor to rule Balmora was &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Eris\"&gt;Councilor Eris Releth&lt;/a&gt; and had connections among the higher-ups in House Redoran. However, his dedication to House Redoran made him grow distant from his children, &lt;a href=\"Veya%20Releth\"&gt;Veya Releth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ulvan%20Releth\"&gt;Ulvan Releth&lt;/a&gt;, this proved to be his downfall. The civilized Dunmeri-folk have a hatred directed to the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s that roam Morrowind's Deadlands and prevent entrance into their modern cities. Ulvan Releth was a very kind person who had respect for the Ashlanders in the West Gash, which gave Eris some concerns that Ulvan may defect from Redoran. Eris used &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Brivan\"&gt;Captain Brivan&lt;/a&gt; to order a soldier to kill an Ashlander Merchant to see whether Ulvan would intervene or not. Ulvan intercepted the Soldier and killed him in haste. This caused Ulvan to be exiled from Vvardenfell, but he would go to the local Ashlanders instead.\nKnowing this, Brivan would use &lt;a href=\"Ferhara%27s%20Warclaws%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Ferhara's Warclaws&lt;/a&gt; to kill the Ashlanders and subsequently Ulvan. Veya grew suspicious of this and ran away from home to uncover Ulvan's disappearances. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naryu%20Virian\"&gt;Mentor&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;mysterious traveler&lt;/a&gt;, she was able to uncover Ulvan's assassination and her father's role in this. She sought vengeance against Brivan and her father, and she assassinated both of them. Her fate was unknown but regardless, Veya Releth disappeared forever.\nSince the city of Balmora is under the control of House Redoran, the Balmora region is also under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance created in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. Although, the Pact did not have any notable headquarters in Vvardenfell.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Stoneforest in their quest to recover the pieces.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20426\"&gt;3E 426&lt;/a&gt;, a tax revolt enveloped the city of Balmora, and it raised concerns in the Hlaalu Council. Luckily, the revolt was quelled down without any violence needed. The Hlaalu Council sent notes to the then &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; about the situation, to give him a reason to lower taxes.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, Balmora prospered along with the other three cities in Vvardenfell. The city was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Nileno%20Dorvayn\"&gt;Nileno Dorvayn&lt;/a&gt;, the only leader to not be a Councilor of her own Great Houses. Regardless, she was able to manage Balmora for several years. In the same year, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition, and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; roamed Vvardenfell to fulfill the prophecy. The warrior traveled to Balmora and met with Dorvayn to gather the Hlaalu Councilors to become the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of Hlaalu.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the center of Vvardenfell, had erupted after centuries later. The resulting eruption caused the destruction of virtually all of Vvardenfell's Settlements including Balmora, &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. A House Redoran Councilor in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; started a relief effort to rebuild the settlements on Vvardenfell. As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown whether the effort reached Balmora and the city is rebuilt."}

As the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt; directs the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to go to Balmora right after character creation in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, it is usually the first major city that Nerevarine encounters in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the presence of many shops and guilds makes Balmora an early choice for a base of operations.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Odai%20River\"&gt;Odai River&lt;/a&gt; runs through the middle of the town, dividing it into west and east sides. The west side consists of many guilds, merchants and residences. The &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; sits at the north end of the west side. At the south end of the west side is a large merchant plaza near Balmora's southern Gate, and next to this is the town &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Silt Strider&lt;/a&gt;. East of the river is mostly residences, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Wall%20Cornerclub\"&gt;South Wall Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt;. One architectural feature that is common in Balmora and rare elsewhere is buildings having two doors, one below at street level and one above on a balcony with a stair or on the roof. For some, this is simply an extra entrance, though there are several cases where two people live together and use their respective doors as their own private entrance. Merchants also tend to live above their stores and the upper entrance is to their living quarters.\nTransportation.\nThe roads from Balmora lead south to &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;, and Vivec City; and north, to &lt;a href=\"Hla%20Oad\"&gt;Hla Oad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple acts as the local destination for &lt;a href=\"Almsivi%20Intervention\"&gt;Almsivi Intervention&lt;/a&gt; and the nearby &lt;a href=\"Moonmoth%20Legion%20Fort\"&gt;Moonmoth Legion Fort&lt;/a&gt; is the local destination for &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Intervention%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Divine Intervention&lt;/a&gt;.

Lozruth argues that it is Orcish hero Baloth Bloodtusk, while Sharela argues that it is Blademaster &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;. They cannot fully confirm their speculations, however, as the tomb doors are currently sealed. Sharela sends the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to the Honor's Rest Catacombs to obtain more information.\nOnce there, the burial chamber of one of Baloth's lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Arakaul\"&gt;Arakaul&lt;/a&gt;, is found. It contains a Memorial Pool, imbued with his memory of Baloth speaking to &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; during the First Era.

I am no knight. Call me 'savage' as you would behind our backs.\"\nCommander Reliana: \"I will not, sir. 'Treat all with honor until proven otherwise,' as my Lord Trystan teaches.\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"Does your Lord Trystan think I'm above killing the messenger\u2015especially a message such as this?\"\nCommander Reliana: \"I do not presume, sir.

Today.\"\nCommander Reliana: \"Yes. Yes, sir.\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Arakaul\"&gt;Arakaul&lt;/a&gt;, we must speak.\"\"\nAfterwords, you can speak to Shinji about his upcoming duel with Baloth Bloodtusk, and later speak to Lord Trystan about Shinji.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tamahl\"&gt;Tamahl&lt;/a&gt; and Arakaul's burial urns are collected, go back to the sealed door of Honor's Rest. There, Lozruth and Sharela will be speaking to the Orsinium Advisor &lt;a href=\"Goruz\"&gt;Goruz&lt;/a&gt; about their findings. After placing the urns inside the wall, the door displaying Shinji and Baloth facing each other will open.\nAfter going inside, statues of the Order of Diagna and the Savage Sons, Shinji and Baloth's factions respectively, will be seen side-by-side in a large hall. Through the next door is the tombs of both Shinji and Baloth, on opposite sides of the room. A stone statue memorializing Shinji and Baloth's dual is seen in the centre, with a memorial pool in the back.\nAfter drinking from the pool, you will be transported to a memory of Commander Reliana in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;First Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. There, Baloth's injured brother &lt;a href=\"Rokaug\"&gt;Rokaug&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to be alive. He says Mercedene kept him captive and that she plans to assassinate both Shinji and Baloth as part of Joile's plan.\nOnce you have exited the cave, Shinji and Baloth can be seen dueling on a ledge while having a conversation:\n&lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;: \"No duel should last longer than eight seconds.\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"What fool said that?\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"Myself! How long have we fought?\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"Eight minutes. What do you say to that?\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"I shall reconsider the proverb.\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"You'll have to defeat me to pass it on.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"True enough!

However, the creatures were not fully controllable by the Chimer, and would turn on their makers when finished with the Nedes.. Nedes and Chimer alike, the Brothers of Strife ended lives of both sides in the battle.\nAfter much loss of life, Chimer mages from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned Balreth and Sadal. &lt;a href=\"Mavos%20Siloreth\"&gt;Mavos Siloreth&lt;/a&gt; summoned two fire atronach guardians, &lt;a href=\"Blaze%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragebinder\"&gt;Ragebinder&lt;/a&gt;, to lock Balreth beneath &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Mountain\"&gt;Ash Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nSadal was imprisoned on &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Spire\"&gt;Tormented Spire&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=\"volcano\"&gt;volcano&lt;/a&gt; in Stonefalls.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Death%20of%20Balreth\"&gt;The Death of Balreth&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of , the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; launches an attack on the city of &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, located in Stonefalls. &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, the Indoril Grandmaster responsible for the town, summons Balreth to help in the protection of the city.\u00a0Balreth destroys the Covenant's armies, but he gets out of control.

Acting as a common Chimer soldier, he is ordered by Nilae to find Sorcerer Turoni, who is planning to create the Brothers of Strife with Daedric magic and, with them, finish the war.\nSorcerer Turoni requests the soldier to defeat the Fire Atronachs Hatewarden and Brimstone and collect their essences, the Essence of Fire and the Essence of Wraith. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20Vaama\"&gt;Acolyte Vaama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20Vildras\"&gt;Acolyte Vildras&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige defeats the two Daedra.\u00a0Sorcerer Turoni infuses the blood of Daedra, together with the essences, on Balreth and Sadal. Daedric magic transforms the two brothers into the Brothers of Strife.\nAfter learning the origins of the Brothers of Strife, Sorcerer Vunal thanks the Vestige for bringing light to an obscure chapter of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmeri&lt;/a&gt; history."}

The entrance to the ruin is under the statue of Almalexia and Mehrunes Dagon. There are many corridors and rooms blocked by rubble, however, the ruin is generally well-preserved for Dwemer ruin standards. The chambers are spacious, some have large fans on the ceiling. The designs on the walls and floors are different from those found in other Dwemer ruins found on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Water pipes with glass windows, where the contents can be seen as it bubbles past. The ruins have an enormous architectural and historical value: No one was able to pillage it because it was inaccessible for centuries. Even the ashen remains of the Dwemer who once called this place home are still found undisturbed throughout the chambers and corridors. The whole ruin is guarded by many hostile dwemer &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Animunculi&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorenen-dur.\nUnder these ruins, an even older structure, the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; shrine of &lt;a href=\"Norenen-dur\"&gt;Norenen-dur&lt;/a&gt;, can be found. It is a large structure dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nHearthfire Hall.\nThe first area discovered, from Plaza Brindisi Dorom, within the ruin is Hearthfire Hall. There are numerous enemies amidst the ruined columns and piles of rubble in this massive chamber. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; can easily be overwhelmed here. From here there are two doors, one, to Passage of Whispers, leading further into the ruins and the other leading to the Hall of Winds, which is a dead-end.\nHall of Winds.\nA room with four smaller rooms on the sides, and an intersection of hallways between them. Aside from the regular loot this dead-end holds one of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Satchel%20Pack\"&gt;Dwemer Satchel Pack&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPassage of Whispers.\nThis area serves as a corridor between Hearthfire Hall, Hall of Wails, and Radac's Forge. Among the more notable loot here are two &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Halberd\"&gt;Dwarven halberds&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Cuirass\"&gt;Dwemer cuirasses&lt;/a&gt;.\nHall of Wails.\nAnother dead-end set of rooms, similar to the Hall of Winds. There are beds, tables, and wardrobes. A set of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Airship%20Plans\"&gt;Dwemer Airship Plans&lt;/a&gt; can be found on a table.\nRadac's Forge.\nThe large area of the ruin where the Ghost of &lt;a href=\"Radac%20Stungnthumz\"&gt;Radac Stungnthumz&lt;/a&gt; resides in his reborn form. His workshop area has a large mechanical inanimate construct, similar to centurions, however, it is triple the size of usual centurions. Further into the halls, there is a small room with valuable loot such as &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;raw ebony&lt;/a&gt;. There are also two more Dwemer Satchel Packs.\nPassage of the Walker.\nThis area can only be reached by using a Dwemer Satchel Pack to create a passage through the rubble in Radac's Forge.

Their &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; counterparts are the &lt;a href=\"Reaver%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Reavers&lt;/a&gt;, who are always &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nBandit: \"So we're just supposed to sit here while Arvel runs off with that golden claw?\"\nBandit 2: \"\"That dark elf wants to go on ahead, let him. Better than us risking our necks.\" \nBandit: \"\"What if Arvel doesn't come back? I want my share from that claw!\" \n'Bandit 2: \"Just shut it and keep an eye out for trouble.\"\nBandit: \"I'm not sure I like these Alik'r warriors hiding out here. They seem like trouble.\"\nBandit Thug: \"Keep it to yourself. They're not paying us to talk. They'll be gone as soon as they've found whoever they're looking for. And we'll have all the more coin.\"\nBandit: \"So, you in?\"\nBandit 2: \"...Yeah. We can't have that rheumpy-eyed fool as our watchman, even if he is Hajvarr's uncle. Time we dealt with both of them.\"\nBandit: \"We strike tonight, at dusk. Be ready.\"\nBandit: \"You think it'll work?\"\nBandit 2: \"'Course not. Dogs I could train. But a half-starved wolf? Not a chance.\"\nBandit: \"Right. Lucky if it doesn't rip our throats out.\"\nBandit: \"Aren't you worried someone will wander in here? The entrance isn't exactly hidden, you know.\"\nBandit 2: \"This again? I told you we have someone standing guard out there. And, don't forget the rock trap we rigged up. So, stop your worrying and get some rest. Your shift is coming up and I don't want you dozing off again like last time.\"\nBandit: \"I knew I heard something. What's this bridge doing down?\"\nBandit 2: \"I thought we had a guard posted outside.\"\nBandit: \"We did! Keep your eyes peeled. I don't think we're alone. You check the entrance. I'm going to look over here.\"\nBandit: \"So, you're saying you brought that cat down alone?\"\nBandit 2: \"Why? You don't think I could do it?\"\nBandit: \"Wasn't our last catch a Cave Bear?\"\nBandit 2: \"Yeah, why?\"\nBandit: \"Take down that one with your bare hands too?\"\nBandit 2: \"Troll's blood was he a tough one!\"\nBandit: \"Pfft\"\nBandit 2: \"But, I've got the key to the Sabre Cage! Look!\"\nBandit: \"What's that supposed to prove? Get back on patrol!\"\nBandit: \"Looks like the boss is at it again.\"\nBandit 2: \"Why? What's he doing now?\"\nBandit: \"He's on one of his drunk rants again. Except this time he's challenging everyone to a duel over in the hole. We've got him locked in there now, but he's still challenging anyone that looks crooked at him.\"\nBandit 2: \"Someone should let that cat lose. That'd shut him up real quick.\"\nBandit: \"Don't say that loud, you don't want it getting back to him.\"\nBandit: \"I tried to tell him that he wouldn't get past the traps, but he wouldn't listen...\"\nBandit 2: \"It was a stupid plan, and now Rigel is so mad she won't even let us cut him down from there!\"\nBandit 3: \"Aye, and she's added more traps now as well... A moment of silence for our fallen friend...\"\nBandit: \"I'll do you ten gold at three to one on the white one.\"\nBandit 2: \"Sounds like easy money to me. You're on.\"\nBandit 3: \"Get him! Rip his throat out!\"\nEisa Blackthorn: \"Damn it, not now!\"\nBandit: \"There she is!\"\nBandit 2: \"Get her!\"\nBandit: \"\"But... &lt;a href=\"Eisa%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Eisa&lt;/a&gt;? She's smarter than that.\"\nBandit 2: \"&lt;a href=\"Ra%27jirr\"&gt;Ra'jirr&lt;/a&gt; was always dragging her into things.\"\"\nBandit: \"But.. stealing the boss's sword? Did he have a death wish?\"\nBandit 2: \"Who knows. The cat was crazy. She was a fool to trust him.\"\nBandit: \"What? There's a whole shift down there!\"\nBandit 2: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Kyr\"&gt;Kyr&lt;/a&gt;'s orders. Nobody goes in or out until he gets back. Or the boss will skin you soon as he's done with Ra'jirr.\"\"\nBandit: \"Gods, what a mess.\"\nBandit: \"The boss went down there? Today?\"\nBandit 2: \"Yeah, he's after Ra'jirr- never seen him so angry.\"\nBandit: \"I've got a bad feeling about this... something's just felt wrong down here lately. Eerie.\"\nBandit 2: \"\"Now you're sounding as crazy as the cat. Be going on about the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale%20Lady%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt; next.\"\"\nBandit: \"Something's wrong... Boss' been down there too long.\"\nBandit 2: \"Yeah... Let's wait a little longer. Then...\"\nBandit: \"\"The boss is going to cut those &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;creepy cave people&lt;/a&gt; to pieces!\"\"\nBandit 2: \"Yeah! It'll teach them to steal from us! One of them took my good helmet.\"\nBandit: \"I hope one comes running up here so I can stab it right in the face.\"\nBandit 2: \"I would be fine if they didn't. Have you seen their eyes? They don't have any! Gross.\""}

It was added as part of the &lt;a href=\"Season%20of%20the%20Dragon%20Celebration\"&gt;Season of the Dragon Celebration&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"The Elsweyr Dragon Defense Force is training new members in Elsweyr. I agreed to undergo their trials to join their ranks.\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest can be started by either purchasing it for free from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt;, acquiring it from reading \"&lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Defense%20Force%20Summons\"&gt;Elsweyr Defense Force Summons&lt;/a&gt;\" at an &lt;a href=\"Event%20Exchange\"&gt;Event Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, or speaking with Captain Samara outside &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Northern Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Samara will instruct you to speak with her second-in-command Apprentice Taz.\nApprentice Taz, next to Samara, will provide you with the three objectives you need to accomplish to complete the training: the trial of knowledge, the trial of endurance, and the trial of bravery. These trials can be completed in any order. He will also inform you of the optional tasks.\n\"I see you've agreed to the trials, how exiting! You will not regret you efforts, I promise you. Captain Samara has put her heart and soul into the Elsweyr Defense Force. Each trial was thought through with care.\"\nTrial of knowledge.\nYou must recover a buried &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29%23Tablet%20of%20Dragon%20Slaying\"&gt;Tablet of Dragon Slaying&lt;/a&gt; from the bottom of the northern section of the canyon in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Stitches\"&gt;Stitches&lt;/a&gt;. There are several possible locations for the tablet, but all of them are marked on the compass and are made easily visible by gold motes above it. From here, you can continue with the other trials or complete the optional objective by heading to the central area of the Stitches to speak with Apprentice Taz and answer his questions, the answers for which, in order, are 'Flying,' 'Akatosh,' and 'Atronachs.' Providing an incorrect answer will require you to restart the quiz.\n\"Oh, there you are! Lovely to see you again. Do you have a tablet for me to inspect?\"\nTrial of endurance.\nTo complete the trial of endurance, you must travel to &lt;a href=\"Orcrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcrest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20Necropolis\"&gt;Rimmen Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve an &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29%23Elsweyr%20Defense%20Conference%20Banner\"&gt;Elsweyr Defense Conference Banner&lt;/a&gt;. In Orcrest, the banner is located in the far northeast of the city before the large manor near the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Crows\"&gt;Plague of Crows&lt;/a&gt;. In Rimmen Necropolis, the banner is located in the far north at the end of the hallway leading to the northmost chamber. The trial is complete as soon as you recover the banner, and you will receive the optional objective to defeat a dungeon &lt;a href=\"Bosses%20%28Online%29\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;. Defeating any boss-level encounter in a public dungeon (not including delves or world bosses) will complete the objective, including bosses encountered during group events.\nTrial of bravery.\nTo complete the trial of bravery, you must kill any dragon in Northern Elsweyr at a &lt;a href=\"Dragonscour\"&gt;Dragonscour&lt;/a&gt;. This does not include dragons that are killed as part of a quest. After killing a dragon, you must loot a &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29%23Dragon%20Heart\"&gt;Dragon Heart&lt;/a&gt; from its corpse. To complete the optional objective, you must kill another dragon and retrieve its heart.\nConclusion.\nOnce all of the trials have been completed, you can return to Samara outside Rimmen to complete the quest and receive your reward.\n\"You've returned. This one assumes you have completed the trials and proven yourself worthy of belonging to the Elsweyr Defense Force.\"\nIf you completed all of the optional objectives for all three trials, Samara will be impressed, but no additional reward is given.\n\"Not only did you complete the trials, but you also chose to put yourself against even greater challenges and emerged victorious. Quite impressive. That kind of initiative is something the Elsweyr Defense Force can benefit from.\""}

The zone takes its name from the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt; which has defended High Rock against threats from the south and east since at least &lt;a href=\"1E%20874\"&gt;1E 874&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of Bangkorai is the port city &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; that assumes control over the region, including the lowlands in Hammerfell past the Garrison.\nBackground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20874\"&gt;1E 874&lt;/a&gt;, an army of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; was defeated by the Redguards in Hammerfell, forcing them to retreat north towards High Rock. The &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt; prevented them from accessing the province directly, causing them to instead traverse the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1E 1029&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;, after being defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, fled west from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. In their wake, they burned and pillaged any place they came upon before they were defeated at the Bangkorai Pass, notably due the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202305\"&gt;1E 2305&lt;/a&gt;, High Rock seceded from the &lt;a href=\"First%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Legions%20of%20Piety%20and%20Grace\"&gt;Legions of Piety and Grace&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Abbot-General &lt;a href=\"Priscus%20Mectator\"&gt;Priscus Mectator&lt;/a&gt; attempted to return the province to the Empire's control. Despite the vastness of the Legions, the Empire was unable to breach the Bangkorai Pass for five months and withdrew back to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, Bangkorai for the first time succumbed to an invading force when &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; attacked from the north, sacking Evermore and defeating the Bangkorai Pass Garrison in three days. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Reachmen still maintained a hostile presence in the region, although Evermore had largely recovered and the Bangkorai Pass Garrison was restored to full strength. During this time, the remnant &lt;a href=\"Seventh%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seventh Legion&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Magus-General &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt; conducted a campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; assisted &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; in defeating their forces and securing the region.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Bangkorai and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nBangkorai features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests conclude the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;'s overarching storyline and carries on from the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Bangkorai. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Bangkorai totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks include quests and finding locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige some amount of points. Points earned only apply to the character that earned the achievement. Some achievements unlock unique rewards such as trophies or dyes.\nShalidor's Library.\nTwenty-eight books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Bangkorai and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Ever have we been the shield of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the first line of defense for the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; Kingdoms against invaders from the east. Time and again the Bretons of Evermore and her surrounding regions have taken up arms to garrison &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt; and turn away those who would pillage and plunder our homeland. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20874\"&gt;874&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, when Warlord &lt;a href=\"Thulgeg\"&gt;Thulgeg&lt;/a&gt;'s army of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s was driven from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, we denied them passage through the Pass and forced them to flee northeast, trudging all the way through the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt; before they finally reached &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. Not a single Goblin made its way through our pickets into our homeland.\nThen, in &lt;a href=\"1E%201029\"&gt;1029&lt;/a&gt;, when the legions of Empress &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt; deposed King &lt;a href=\"Styriche\"&gt;Styriche&lt;/a&gt;, the Vampire of &lt;a href=\"Verkarth\"&gt;Verkarth&lt;/a&gt;, he fled west at the head of his dreaded Gray Host, burning and killing as they came. But when his army of bat-men and wolves reached the Bangkorai Garrison, they broke like a wave on a rock. Hestra's legions caught and killed the survivors, and the Empress was so impressed that she honored High Rock with admission into the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen, after almost a thousand years under the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the excesses of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; forced High Rock to secede from the First Empire, the Monks of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; decided not to let us go peaceably. In &lt;a href=\"1E%202305\"&gt;2305&lt;/a&gt;, under Abbot-General &lt;a href=\"Priscus%20Mactator\"&gt;Priscus Mactator&lt;/a&gt;, the Legions of Piety and Grace were sent to bring the Bretons back into the fold. Mactator's fanatics filled the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Wastes\"&gt;Fallen Wastes&lt;/a&gt; from end to end, but they could not pass the &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai%20Garrison\"&gt;Bangkorai Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, and after a five-month siege, with the pious turning on the graceful, the Abbot-General was forced to admit defeat and plod back to Cyrodiil in disgrace.\nOnly once has the Garrison failed to protect High Rock: when &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; Horde poured down the south shore of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt;, filtering through the &lt;a href=\"Northwest%20Spine\"&gt;Northwest Spine&lt;/a&gt; that had always protected us before. Then, &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; was sacked, and the Garrison was taken from behind. But even then, we bought High Rock enough time that the Breton Kingdoms were able to muster their troops and eventually repulse Durcorach at &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, invaders from the east threaten us once again, in the form of an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; from Cyrodiil. But these are not the legendary warriors of an Empress Hestra, or the disciplined soldiers of an Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;: these are the degraded mercenaries of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharn usurpers&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, this legion is even led by a cousin of that decadent and faithless family!\nAnd who is this Magus-General &lt;a href=\"Septima%20Tharn\"&gt;Septima Tharn&lt;/a&gt;? What battles has she won, beyond bullying freeholders for their back taxes? What barrel-scrapings are these so-called 'legionaries' she brings to pollute our homeland with their heretical, &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshiping ways?\nI say they are scum, a desecration of the once-noble name 'Imperial Legion.' I say they are a rabble. And I say that, with us manning the walls, they shall not pass the Bangkorai Garrison!\nWhat say you, &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Saint%20Pelin\"&gt;Knights of Saint Pelin&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20Guard\"&gt;Evermore Guard&lt;/a&gt;; freeborn militia of Mournoth and Ephesus\u2014soldiers of Bangkorai! Will we betray the blood of our ancestors and allow enemies through the Pass? Never, I say! Not today, not tomorrow, not ever!"}

Played by itself or with a non-Orc, it is moderately powerful, but there are other cards for the same Magicka cost with better stats. However, when the Bangkorai Butcher joins another friendly Orc, it receives 2 additional points of power and health for the same cost, making Bangkorai Butcher a serious threat with both high damage and survivability.\nIf drawn early in the game, it is best to wait until there are other Orcs summoned before playing Bangkorai Butcher. Alternately, if there are no friendly Orcs summoned but the summoner has enough Magicka, Bangkorai Butcher can be summoned immediately after a low-cost Orc card. When used in conjunction with other Orc cards, such as the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20Artisan\"&gt;Wrothgar Artisan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Militant%20Chieftain\"&gt;Militant Chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, or when buffed by &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Soul Tear&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Fury%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Warrior's Fury&lt;/a&gt;, Bangkorai Butcher can quickly become a formidable creature."}

The &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; is sent to &lt;a href=\"Banish%20Daedra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; lurking inside a nearby &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAfter completing several mundane tasks for the Mages Guild, and improved their magical skills, the Agent will be accepted as a member of the Guild. &lt;a href=\"Guildmagister\"&gt;Guildmagister&lt;/a&gt;s will therefore begin to offer the Agent more difficult tasks, rewarding them with and a boost to their reputation, meaning they can climb further through the Guild's ranks.\nWalkthrough.\nHaving gained a sizeable amount of &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Mages Guild, the Agent will be tasked with one of the most difficult challenges imaginable to any mage. A Guildmagister reveals that a Daedra that they summoned has escaped, and needs to be sent back to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; before a major incident occurs. The Agent is therefore sent to cast a standard Banish Daedra spell on the powerful foe, as destroying the Daedra would be detrimental to the Guildmagister's research.\nPrecise Orders.\nTo assist the Agent in their task, the Guildmagister hands them a scroll, containing the Daedra's name, which must be used after the Daedra has been struck once. The scroll should freeze the Daedra in place, making it easier for the Agent to cast the banishing spell, which must be done by hand. Failing to do these tasks in the correct order may cause some undesired effects, although the Guildmagister does not know what they could be.\nThe Power of a Name.\nThe Daedra itself can be found in a nearby dungeon, with numerous &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; surrounding them. Once the Daedra, a Frost Daedra, has been found, the Agent will have to follow the Guildmagister's instructions precisely. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing whether the correct Daedra (for they may be many at higher levels) has been struck, although conformation will be made after reading the scroll:\nOnce the Daedra has frozen in place the Agent must cast the Banish Daedra spell from their hands, rather than using a scroll or &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Daedra has been successfully banished, the Agent must escape the dungeon and return to the Guildmagister before the time limit expires.\nSimple Mistakes.\nIt is, however, fairly easy to make a mistake during the battle with the Daedra, any of which will cause the Agent to fail the quest. Striking the Daedra too hard, or too many times, will result in a dead Daedra, as will attempting to cast Banish Daedra before using the scroll. Furthermore, using the scroll before striking the Daedra will cause a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daedra%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Fire Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to appear, meaning both will have to be killed.\nIf the Frost Daedra is killed, by any of these methods, the quest will be failed and the Agent will forfeit their reward.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; from the Guildmagister for banishing the Daedra successfully, alongside the boost to their &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Guild. The penalties for failing the quest are relatively high by comparison, but will also see gains among some anti-Mage Guild factions:"}

Normal transactions took place: deposits were deposited, withdrawals were withdrawn, house mortgages were collected, letters of credit were golded. When a teller named &lt;a href=\"Clyton%20J.%20Wifflington\"&gt;Clyton J. Wifflington&lt;/a&gt; saw the little old lady approaching him, dragging two large sacks, each nearly as large as her, he changed his mind. It was not to be a perfectly ordinary day at the Bank of Daggerfall after all.\n\"I would like you to take the thirty million &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; pieces I have in these sacks and open me an account,\" croaked the little old biddy.\n\"Certainly, madam,\" Wifflington said, eagerly. He counted the gold in the sacks and found that it was thirty million gold exactly.\n\"One moment, sonny,\" the little old lady chirruped. \"Before I open the account, I would like to meet the man I'm trusting it to. I'd like to talk to the president of the bank.\"\nWifflington wanted the president to know that he was the teller who had taken the largest single deposit that year, so eagerly sent word to the president's secretary. As it turned out, the president was equally eager to meet such a wealthy woman, so the old lady was brought to his office that very day.\n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance, milady. I am &lt;a href=\"Gerander%20P.%20Baggledon\"&gt;Gerander P. Baggledon&lt;/a&gt;,\" said the president, Gerander P. Baggledon.\n\"My name,\" said the little old lady. \"Is &lt;a href=\"Petuva%20Smuthworthy\"&gt;Petuva Smuthworthy&lt;/a&gt;.\" That was, in fact, her real name. \"Thank you for seeing me. I like to conduct my business in a more personal way.\"\n\"I can certainly appreciate that,\" said Baggledon chucklingly. \"It is an appreciable sum of gold. Would it be rude of me to ask how you came by it?\"\n\"Not at all,\" said Mrs. Smuthworthy.\n\"How came you by it?\" asked Baggledon.\n\"I'll let you guess,\" replied Mrs. Smuthworthy, with a trace of unattractive girlish flirtation.\nBaggledon was a man of enormous imagination, for a banker. He guessed inheritance and longtime thrift, but Mrs. Smuthworthy coyly shook her head. Perhaps she had sold a large, old mansion? No. In a moment of chumminess, Baggledon asked if the gold came as a result of plunder or thievery. Mrs. Smuthworthy took no offense, but said no. Finally, he admitted defeat.\n\"I'm a gambler,\" she said.\n\"In arena fights?\" he asked, interested.\n\"No, no, dearie. Different things. For example, I'd be willing to wager twenty five thousand gold pieces that at this time tomorrow morning, your testicles will be covered with feathers.\"\nMr. Baggledon was somewhat taken aback by the old woman's words. Could she be mad? Could she be a witch? He eliminated the latter possibility, for he had a sense for such things. If she were mad, she was still a rich madwoman. And he could use twenty five thousand gold pieces. So he took her wager.\nFor the next twenty-four hours, Mr. Baggledon obsessed over his testicles. He checked his pants so often that afternoon, his subordinates feared the worse and suggested that he not touch anything and go home for the rest of the afternoon. He spent the night seated, his pants around his ankles, his beady banker's eyes focused on his scrotum. Every time he started to doze off, his vision was filled with images of Mrs. Smuthworthy plucking feathers from his balls, cackling.\nMr. Baggledon arrived at the bank late the next day -- only moments before Mrs. Smethworthy's arrival. Accompanying her was a lean, bespeckled fellow she introduced as a barrister from the court. Her son, it turned out. Young Mr. Smethworthy always accompanied his mother when there was money involved, she explained.\n\"Enough banter,\" she crowed. \"Our bet, dearie?\"\n\"My dear, dear madam, I can tell you that your gold will be quite safe at the Bank of Daggerfall. I hope it will not cause you distress to discover that your gold will be safer here than in your own hands. My family jewels are quite, shall we say, featherless. And you owe me a sum equally twenty five thousand gold.\"\nPoor Mrs. Smethworthy's face fell when she heard this. \"Are you sure?\"\n\"Quite, madam.\"\n\"Not even one feather?\" Her voice suggested doubt. Mr. Baggledon could tell she thought he might be lying.\n\"Not one, I fear, madam.\"\n\"It's not that I don't trust you, Mr. Baggledon, but it is quite a lot of gold. Might I -- would you -- could I possibly see for myself?\"\nAs he knew he was soon to be a twenty five thousand gold pieces richer, and he was still a bit punchy from lack of sleep, Mr. Baggledon merely smiled and dropped his breeches to the floor. Mrs. Smethworthy examined his testicles very carefully, under, to the left, to the right. At last, she was satisfied that there was not so much as a down feather anywhere in the region. While she was looking under them one last time, Mr. Baggledon heard a thwacking noise across the office. Young Mr. Smethworthy was banging his head against the stone wall.\n\"What in the Lady's name is wrong with your son, Mrs. Smethworthy?\" he asked.\n\"Nothing, dear,\" she said. \"I merely bet him one hundred thousand gold pieces that by this time I would have the president of the Bank of Daggerfall by the balls.\""}

Its use is to regenerate the caster's magic supply after activating the effect. One\u00a0Restore Magicka\u00a0spell exists in-game, &lt;a href=\"Equilibrium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Equilibrium&lt;/a&gt;, which converts 25 health into 25 magicka (50 health to 25 magicka on legendary difficulty).\u00a0As an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; effect, it can only be applied to a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;, because, being a positive effect, it cannot be in a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;.

The strength of the effect is determined by the &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Skill&lt;/a&gt; of the alchemist that brewed the potion."}

To begin the quest speak to &lt;a href=\"Indaenir\"&gt;Indaenir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; in the city of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;. He tasks the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; with aiding him in liberating the city from &lt;a href=\"the%20Hound\"&gt;the Hound&lt;/a&gt;'s control.\nBackground.\n\"Indaenir, the new Silvenar, traveled across Malabal Tor to marry the Green Lady and fulfill his role as the spiritual leader of the Wood Elves. But the Hound arrived first, and is trying to usurp his position.\"\nWalkthrough.\nBegin the quest by speaking to &lt;a href=\"Indaenir\"&gt;Indaenir&lt;/a&gt; who will inform you that the Hound has usurped his position as the Silvenar. He asks the Vestige to collect Silver Shards which act as keys to the city. To do so, the player must first speak to Scout Anglith.\nScout Anglith is found north-west of the northern bridge in Silvenar. She tells the Vestige that a mystic barrier is in place which prevents the Silvenar from entering the city. The player should kill Houndsmen located in the chasm directly south of Scout Anglith to gather Silver Shards. These may be looted from the bodies of Houndsmen.\nOnce the player gathers the Silver Shards they should return to Scout Anglith. Scout Anglith tells the player that they must defeat the Guardian of Silvenar who patrols the bridge above the chasm. Head back across the bridge into Silvenar to defeat the Guardian of Silvenar. The Guardian is a slow-moving yet powerful level 37.\nAfter defeating the Guardian, a Psijic projection of the Silvenar should form on the southern bridge linking the hall to the remainder of Silvenar. The Silvenar tells the Vestige to locate 3 spinners who are bound to Hircine and held within the city. To free them, the player must learn more about them. This can be done by defeating and questioning the Houndsman's witches.\nCross the southern bridge into the city. The first witch should be found on the bridge. After defeating the first witch they will tell you that Spinner Caerlln focuses on the present and is aware of events taking place across the world, including the arrival of the Vestige. The second witch is just east of the southern entrance to the Great Tree. After being defeated they will tell you of Spinner Dothriel who is the strongest spinner living in the past. Dothriel is held in her home which is linked to the Great Tree. The final witch is west of the Great Tree. They will inform you that Einrel is the youngest spinner who is being held in her home. She focuses on the future of Bosmer as she sees it.\nThe Silvenar should then appear at the centre of the Great Tree. He will tell the Vestige of his success in projecting his essence into the city. The three spinners are held by Ayleid puzzles by the Hound. Head up the Great Tree once conserving with the Silvenar.\nDothriel is in the eastern house. Head along the eastern bridge and up the stairs to find Spinner Dothriel who is bound by a puzzle. Read \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Time%20is%20Past\"&gt;The Time is Past&lt;/a&gt;\" in the east of the house to solve the puzzle\u2014the book should mention three of the four stones found around the house. Activate these stones in the correct order which they appear in the book to free Spinner Dothriel (Ritual, Apprentice and then Mage).\nRepeat this for Spinner Caerlln, who is held in the north-west house (Lady, Warrior and Lord), and Spinner Einrel in the south-west house (Lover, Shadow and Tower).\nAfter freeing the three spinners speak to the Silvenar at the base of the Great Tree who will tell you that the Hound has enthralled the Green Lady's spirit. Head up to the Audience Hall to distract the Green Lady.\nThe Green Lady must be attack so to divert her attention: she does not need to be killed. Lower-leveled players are advised to avoid any of her attacks\u2014as they are very powerful\u2014and keep her in combat until the Silvenar arrives. The player must then face the Hound. The Hound will summon other creatures to weaken the player, yet these should not be engaged with as the Silvenar will eventually remove them from combat for you.\nThe best means of defeating the Hound is by remaining nearby him and disrupting his attacks whenever the opportunity comes and knocking him out to prevent him from dealing too much damage.\nOnce the Hound is defeated, speak to the Green Lady who will tell you that the 'shadow' of &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; which plagued her has been lifted. She tells the Vestige that the Hound was in-fact her close companion &lt;a href=\"Ulthorn\"&gt;Ulthorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter this Scout Anglith will appear with the Handfast. Once this is delivered, the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Silvenar\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; are wed by &lt;a href=\"Spinner%20Dothriel\"&gt;Spinner Dothriel&lt;/a&gt;. Attend the wedding ceremony and then speak to Spinner Dothriel to complete the quest."}

Different creatures roamed the island, some fearsome, some benign. The early Aldmer, ever thorough when it came to cleansing the environment of unwanted threats, set out to completely exterminate &lt;a href=\"welwa\"&gt;welwa&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014a creature they, for some reason lost to the historical record, totally despised. In a few short years, welwas were driven to extinction and removed from the Summerset ecology.\nAccording to ancient writings, the welwas sought the demise of the newly arrived Aldmer. Along with the &lt;a href=\"gheatus\"&gt;gheatus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ilyadi\"&gt;ilyadi&lt;/a&gt;, the welwas attacked the Aldmer. Using ancestral lore and power drawn from the stars, the Aldmer used lightning, ice, and fire to utterly destroy these ravaging creatures.\nSummerset art and sculpture depicts welwas as strange, holy beasts with horns and savage teeth. In fact, due to these representations, many scholars believed that the entire species was extinct and a few considered the creatures to be nothing more than myths and legends. Imagine our surprise when entire herds were discovered roaming the &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; region of eastern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and in sufficient numbers to make a reintroduction program not only feasible but totally within the realm of distinct possibility.\nIt was with great pride that I took on the project of reintroducing welwas into the Summerset environment. We started modestly at first, gathering six mated pairs from the wilds of Craglorn. After a period of quarantine to make sure the creatures were healthy and bonded to their counterparts, my team and I released them in the northwest swamps. They immediately took to the region and, after three additional expeditions to acquire more welwas, the welwa packs appeared healthy and vibrant. I was even able to witness one of the first welwa births on Summerset in modern times. It was a glorious experience!\nOf course, not everyone agreed with the goals of this ambitious undertaking. Even some of my esteemed colleagues among the Sapiarchs protested that returning such a savage beast into an environment we tamed long ago was not only foolhardy, it was dangerous. To these critics I repeat the old adage, \"anything worth doing involves some level of risk.\" I was disheartened by the number of level-headed &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; who showed up to demonstrate their disapproval as the ship carrying the first mated pairs of welwas pulled up the dock. Luckily, the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt; and the city guards were on hand to maintain order and make sure no one tried to harm the majestic creatures.\nNow, despite some continuing protests and a few legal actions aimed at altering the plan I championed and put in place, packs of welwas once again run free in the Summerset wilderness. Thanks to the Sapiarchs, the island is one step closer to returning to its original splendor. Now if only I could figure out how to restore the gheatus and the ilyadi."}

A cutscene will play, showing Cyrus escorting Saban to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Arkay%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Temple of Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Basil%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Basil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vander%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Vander&lt;/a&gt;, Coyle and the Restless League dock their ships outside of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Hunding%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; and proceed to quietly take out the local &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the Temple, Nidal reveals the body of &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, lying in stasis. Surrounded by the loyal &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrus hands over the ring and soul gem to Saban, who proceeds to remove the field and shatter the gem with her cane. As magical energies swirl and surround the sarcophagus and then suddenly stop, Saban staggers back and falls into Coyle's arms. In ancient Yokudan, Coyle translates for her that the ritual was unsuccessful. Basil, in frustration, slams his fist down against the stone casket when suddenly a miraculous light shines forth, knocking both him and Cyrus back. When Cyrus approaches the sepulture again, the sword of A'Tor pulses with an enchanted glow. Realizing the soul has entered the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; instead of his body, Basil threatens to leave saying \"We can't follow a sword\" to which Cyrus responds with the following:\n\"Is this how you will honor your Prince then? Cautious I've thought you Basil, but never before a coward. We all have waited for the prince's return. Now that he has returned you walk away, the form is different, true, but his spirit is here, here, and isn't his spirit the truest part of him? Did it occur that maybe he chose this shape and symbol as the sign of his intentions? Aye, perhaps that soul, in hated delay, snared helpless in a jewel while his men hid and shirked their duties, his duty, perhaps that soul formed itself to this, and by no mistake comes to you now, in no more fine and final form as this. A sword. You say you cannot follow a sword? Well, I say you have strayed from your own too long! Why are you here but to fight? Your prince has shown you the manner of his purest mettle, aye, in metal itself! And this true, unerring razor's message is clear beyond words, for now is not the time for words, but for brave hands, bright swords and blood! Aye boys, it's about blood now, too long frozen in your veins, and you'd rather yourself be rigid than follow me. Well, if you won't, then shamefully know that your prince will. For his blood be solid too, but strained to steel, and tempered in death. Arise the like as he, as swords as we are crowns the like as he! The prince is dead! Long live the prince!\"\nWith this, the League cheers. Cyrus speaks to Iszara and Coyle, telling them his intentions to sneak into the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; and kill the provincial governor &lt;a href=\"Amiel%20Richton\"&gt;Lord Richton&lt;/a&gt;. He orders them to help the League with securing the harbor, providing a distraction. Iszara tells Cyrus \"They will hear of this in the rest of Hammerfell.\"\nUnsheathing his old saber and handing it to her, \"Then let's make sure it's loud\" he replies."}

The two ways of resurrection are:\nMagical method of resurrection (all platforms).\nWhile it is not possible to fully resurrect someone through magical means (meaning the resurrected NPC will not retain normal behavior (e.g. dialogue, and also follow\u00a0the summoner\u00a0around rather than go about their schedule),\u00a0one can &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;reanimate&lt;/a&gt; an NPC's dead body using either a stave or through &lt;a href=\"Reanimate%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;certain spells&lt;/a&gt; (which are only effective on NPCs under a certain level). Excepting the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Thrall\"&gt;Dead Thrall&lt;/a&gt; spell and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ritual%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Ritual Stone&lt;/a&gt;, these reanimations are not permanent and when they wear off, the body disintegrates so it cannot be reanimated again.\u00a0\nThe Dead Thrall spell is also the only spell of its kind not to be able to reanimate animals and creatures. Despite not being resurrected, the \"&lt;a href=\"Raise%20Zombie\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;\" made through magical methods can be used to fight and carry an indefinite amount of loot (though the loot must be added to the body before reanimating).\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Animunculi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven constructs&lt;/a&gt; are not effected by any variation of this effect as they are considered non-living.\nFor a list of conjuration spells, click &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For a list of staves (staffs), click &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsole commands (PC only).\nThis method of resurrection is a complete resurrection, with all behaviors being normal. To achieve this, the player\u00a0must first press the \"~\" key in-game which opens the console. To select the body to be resurrected, they\u00a0must then click on the desired body, which will then direct all following commands towards the body. Then type the command \"resurrect\" (without the \" signs). The NPC will then be living, with all normal behaviors and a reset inventory. In \"Oblivion\", but not \"Skyrim\", a character can be resurrected without their inventory resetting using the command codice_3.\nPlease note, this command is either &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;buggy&lt;/a&gt; or changed in \"Skyrim\" and may not work as documented here. One can also try the \"recycleactor\" command with the NPC selected. (Either by the Prid command or by selecting with the mouse.)\nThere are many benefits to using the codice_4 command which include:\nYou cannot use this command on bodies that are meant to be dead. For example, you cannot use the resurrect command on random person found dead on an altar, this is due to their actor value health being 0 by default, resurrect command only resets health and equipment."}

Sheogorath is delighted, as this is a new turn of events, and sends the Hero to investigate.\nNote: \"This walkthrough was written from a character who picked the path of Mania and overthrew Lord Thadon. The quest is nearly identical for those who picked the path of Dementia, except instead of fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Golden Saints&lt;/a&gt; one will be fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Seducer%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dark Seducers&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWalkthrough.\nPasswall.\nTravel to the Fringe. The giant silver crystals that usually accompany &lt;a href=\"Priest%20of%20Order\"&gt;Priests of Order&lt;/a&gt; have grown all over and the Hero will find a group of Golden saints/Dark Seducers battling a group of &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Order%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Knights of Order&lt;/a&gt;. After a brief fight &lt;a href=\"Aurig%20Desha\"&gt;Aurig Desha&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Saints, will approach them and say that the Knights are \"relentless\" and appear as fast as the Saints can kill them. She believes that destroying &lt;a href=\"Obelisk%20of%20Order\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt; will rob them of their power, and she has an idea. Before she can tell them however, another wave of Knights approach and they are forced to fight.\nAt this point, there is an option to allow Aurig to command the troops or taking charge themselves. If chosen to command the troops, they must approach each Saint and order him to flank with a sword, move to the back with a bow, or stand their ground with an axe. Distribute the troops over the field, emphasizing those areas they are weak in. If a marksman, send more in with an axe. If fighting with a sword or touch magic, order more Saints to snipe with a bow. If they tell Aurig to command the troops herself, she will set up a line of ax-wielding front line troops and at least one archer.\nOnce the battlefield is prepped, notify Aurig. Seconds later, three waves of three Knights will materialize in front of the Spire.\nAfter defeating the Knights speak to Aurig. She will tell the Hero that her scouts have noticed increased activity around the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Xeddefen\"&gt;Xeddefen&lt;/a&gt;, located in the southeast corner of the Fringe. As they make their way to Xeddefen, they may notice that the Fringe has become barren, and the giant silver crystals will grow rapidly in their path.\nXeddefen.\nXeddefen is a fairly large ruin. Look for buttons in walls, traps, and watch the map for the beginnings of hallways behind secret doors. Proceed to the Great Chamber where they will discover &lt;a href=\"Shelden\"&gt;Shelden&lt;/a&gt;, the self-appointed mayor of Passwall, sneaking through the halls. He says that he escaped into the ruins after the Knights attacked and has been lost ever since. He asks them to protect him. If they agree, he will become a standard follower.\n\"Note: If they do not take Sheldon as a follower he will subsequently be crushed by the collapse of the ruin.\"\nIn the center of the next room is a large cluster of Knights of Order and a giant silver crystal with rivulets of light flowing down. One must place three &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Order\"&gt;Hearts of Order&lt;/a&gt; into the obelisk to overload it. At least one knight will appear after each Heart.\nImmediately after overloading the obelisk, the ceiling will begin to collapse. Run north first, then back around to the southwest. Mayor Shelden is apparently incapable of jumping, and if a large section of the ceiling collapses in his way, he will be stuck. However, by just running at the rubble one can carve a path for him by pushing the rocks out of the way. Shelden is also essential, and if he gets crushed wait for a few seconds and he will stand up and follow again.\nFollow the red arrow to Felles, a mixture of ruins and caves. The ceiling will not collapse in the root-like cave section, but will continue to fall in the ruins sections. Knights and Priests are scattered throughout Felles. At the final part of the level they will find a door that blocks the passageway west to the exit. The switch is on a pedestal in a room to the south.\nAs soon as they get through that gate it slams shut, locking Shelden behind. He scolds them and says he will find another way out. The next section - all the way to the exit - is best done at an all-out sprint whilst on skooma, as this greatly increases speed.\nShelden will be waiting outside. He rewards them with absolutely nothing so find Aurig and speak to her instead. She will be in Passwall, fighting off a final wave of Knights. She sends you back to Sheogorath. Note that you cannot fast-travel from the Fringe at this point - you will have to get through the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Madness%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gates of Madness&lt;/a&gt; first.\nSheogorath's Palace.\nOnce back at &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Sheogorath's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, he will say that their next task will be to restore the &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;, who they killed in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Through%20the%20Fringe%20of%20Madness\"&gt;Through the Fringe of Madness&lt;/a&gt;.\" Restoring the Gatekeeper will keep the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt; safer from another invasion.\nThis will end the current quest and begin the next, \"&lt;a href=\"Rebuilding%20the%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Rebuilding the Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

But either way, we have to try. Whether we succeed or not, it'll stir up some of the old blood in this crowd.\"\nBujold: \"I'm not going to lead them to their deaths if they aren't ready.\"\nKuvar: \"Then train them. What are we doing here? We should either get used to staying here, or be preparing to retake the hall. You're having us do neither, and I can't stomach it.\"\nBujold: \"Your stomach isn't my problem. We'll act when I say we do and not before.\"\nKuvar: \"Well, you'd better say something. And soon.\"\nSpeaking to Bujold:\nWhat's going on here? \"What's going on here is that we've been kicked out of our home. The mead hall, up there on the hill. We were... some Rieklings have taken over.\"\nAfter the suggestion of helping retake Thrisk, talking to Bujold again will prompt her to say \"Well, look who's back. You ready to finally help us take out those rieklings?\"\nI don't think I can help you right now. \"You either need to help us or stop coming around here.\"\nContinuing conversation with Bujold:\nHow long have you been down here? \"Longer than I would have liked.\"\nAfter volunteering, Bujold will then begin a speech to the rest of the camp:\n\"Hey, you lazy milk-drinkers, get over here! I know you're all starting the setting in here, and keep up the fat lives you got used up to in the hall. But look here. This outsider has more fire than any of you. All I had to do was mention our little infestation, and he/she volunteered in a second! I don't want to have my spirit outstripped by some wanderer. So let's get up there and kill us some Rieklings!\"\nThe mission will begin and the objective is to kill a group (random number) of Rieklings, this includes the &lt;a href=\"Riekling%20Chief\"&gt;Riekling Chief&lt;/a&gt;.\nHrothmund's Barrow.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has killed the Rieklings. Speak to Bujold, for another part of the quest to begin.\n\"Ah! That was almost... exhilarating. How are you feeling?\"\nOnce near the barrow, she will ask the Dragonborn if they are ready to go inside. Once inside she can be questioned about the barrow:\nWhat is this place? \"The burial place of Hrothmund, who founded Thirsk. He brought a group of true warriors away from the soft life of the Skaal, to know the wilderness, to feel the sting of cold and steel. I know that... sounds a little silly, it's just the way it was written in the books, and that phrase has always stuck with me.\"\nA little way down after entering, the Dragonborn comes across a room mostly submerged in water. The small room before this submerged room has a secret door; the handle is in a crack to the left of the hidden door. This leads to a chest, and with leveled loot and gems around. Walking towards the water will cause it to descend showing a walkway.\nApproach Hrothmund's axe's altar. Bujold will run towards the altar, indicating that she has found the axe, \"There it is!\" There are two chests near the altar that can be looted. Hrothmund's voice will be heard asking if she seeks his blessing. She then claims that she does seek his blessing like before, and that the mead hall has been taken back. He is aware and shows disappointment in her and her people saying that they grew soft, that it should not have happened. Hrothmund denies her and her mead hall of his blessing for leadership, claiming that in the wilderness it's better to have no leader than a poor leader.\nHrothmund: \"You seek my blessing for the leadership of Thirsk Hall?\"\nBujold: \"I do. It is I, Bujold. You blessed me in the past, and now I've rid the hall of Rieklings and returned it to its rightful owners.\"\nHrothmund: \"And well it is that this has happened. But I have always watched, and know that it was your softness that to your own exile.\"\nBujold: \"No! I...\"\nHrothmund: \"You allowed your fellow warriors to grow weak while the dangers around you mounted.\"\nBujold: \"Then... the leadership is not mine?\"\nHrothmund: \"No. Nor is there any among you fit to serve. For a band in the wilderness, it is better to have no leader than a poor one.\"\nWhen asked about this, she replies: \"That was a little embarrassing.\" then follows with:\nHow are you feeling about that? \"Ashamed. But I guess that was the point.\"\nIgnoring either options will default to the result of the first option. Upon return to the hall, Thirsk Mead Hall will be restored to its original stature; opening up the smithing area and new beds at the end of the hallway.\nReturn to Thirsk.\nWhen returning to Thirsk Mead Hall, &lt;a href=\"Kuvar\"&gt;Kuvar&lt;/a&gt; will approach, asking about the events at the Barrow.\nTelling the truth to Kuvar will cause him to become upset. Regardless of whether Kuvar is angry and ashamed about his wife being exiled or angry at the Dragonborn for killing her, he will be unwilling to have a conversation. If the Dragonborn tells the truth about killing Bujold, the other occupants of Thirsk will greet the Dragonborn tersely, but unlike Kuvar, all their dialogue options will still be available.\nCompleting this quest by choosing any of the four options with Bujold and Kuvar will open up new dialogue with the occupants of Thirsk, excepting Kuvar if he is told the truth.

He will tell you that the pass is under attack by an army of undead led by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt;. The Mane is fighting the undead here, but he got cut off from the main force. Bodring will task you with making sure he is safe. \nHead north through the pass and fight your way through the undead, and you will reach the Old Merchant's Tunnel. You will need to head through here to find the Mane; on the other end, you will find a &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Colossus%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bone Colossus&lt;/a&gt; bonking on the door. Kill the thing, then head through and you will find the Mane and his companions. Speak with him and he will tell you that Prince Naemon ordered this attack, but then he just left. He will ask you to help find out why these undead are attacking in the first place. For that, he will ask you to speak with Indaenir. Indaenir is right here in the room; Akkhuz-ri will introduce you. \nIndaenir will tell you that he does not think the thing leading the undead is truly Prince Naemon. It is inhabiting Naemon's body, but it has different feelings and motivations than him. So, to determine why the undead are attacking, Indaenir will want to consult with the souls of those who cannot be raised; those who are bound to this plane in a state between life and death because they have violated the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;. \nHead outside and speak with Indaenir there. He will ask you to find the skulls of the cursed Bosmer, and he will ask one of the torchbugs here to guide you to said skulls. You do not actually need to follow the torchbug; map markers will appear on your map to help you find the skulls. The Skull of Ethril will be just to your north, in a house across the river. From here, head west to find the skull of Ollion in a burning house. Finally, even further west, you will find the Skull of Thraul lying in the field. \nOnce you have all three skulls, meet up with Indaenir at the stone tablet in the center of the pass. Place the skulls on the table and Indaenir will speak with their souls. You will learn that Naemon intends to corrupt the forest itself and create a new realm called the Shadow Wood. Speak with Indaenir again and he will tell you that the Shadow Rifts that Naemon is using must be closed for the sake of the forest, but that first, it is time to decide the fate of the souls in the skulls. Indaenir promised release to these souls if they cooperated, so you must now talk to them and determine whether they deserve to be released. Once you have decided the fate of all three, speak with Indaenir again and he will ask for your help in protecting him while he closes the Shadow Rifts. \nThere are three rifts in total. The Northern Shadow Rift will be just to your west, in a cave down the cliff. West of here will be the Western Shadow Rift, out in the open this time. Finally, head east of where you found the northern rift and into another cave to find and close the Eastern Shadow Rift. \nOnce all of the rifts have been closed, Naemon will take you into the Shadow Wood itself. Talk to Indaenir and he will suggest getting back to Tamriel throuth the Stone Table, as that is where life and death intersect. When you reach the stone table though, you will find a &lt;a href=\"Servant%20of%20Naemon\"&gt;Servant of Naemon&lt;/a&gt; there; this shade will pack quite a punch. Kill it to return to Tamriel, then speak with Indaenir. Indaenir will tell you that the corruption continues to grow, and that Naemon must be found and stopped. First though, the people in Marbruk must be informed of what has happened. \nHead back to Bodring and tell him everything to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Shades%20of%20Green\"&gt;Shades of Green&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Due to struggling to find a person willing to take the job, Kotaro pays 100 gold up front, and pays another 200 after the job is completed.\nThe Isle of N'Gasta can be found along the shores of the island. Following the road leading out of town, and over the bridge, is a dirt path. This path leads to a wooden bridge, which must be crossed in order to get to the boatsman who can bring Cyrus to the island in question. Arriving at the island, Cyrus must fight through &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;.

Here a crowbar is found, which is required to unlock the gate.\nAdvancing through the gate, Cyrus must advance in the direction to the left, where he will encounter a small building with a large eye atop of it. Turning this eye will make the head of the statue bridging the two sides of the island turn towards the wizard's tower. Crossing over the statue's head, Cyrus will encounter &lt;a href=\"N%27Gasta\"&gt;N'Gasta&lt;/a&gt;, who will provide him with dialogue and the amulet for the Governor.\nArriving back in Stros M'Kai, Cyrus must deliver the amulet to the Governor. At the door leading to the Palace is an &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Imperial Guard&lt;/a&gt; blocking the way. Upon being told that Cyrus has the amulet for the Governor, he is signalled in. Inside the Palace, Cyrus will confront the Governor with the news of his missing sister, &lt;a href=\"Iszara\"&gt;Iszara&lt;/a&gt;, and threatens him if he refuses to give up more information. As a result, Richton demands his arrest. A fight ensues between Cyrus and three of the Palace Guards.

I chose to travel by natural means, not by the wizard's will. It has been many long years since I have laid mine eyes upon the western lands of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The ever weary &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; bid me farewell after a year of service. I do admit my previous disregard and distrust to the politics and leadership of the west, but I have grown to find a care in the blood of this &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim&lt;/a&gt;. He is a good and honorable man and has shown me that the Empire is not an oppressive tool of fear and power. I do wish I could have made his under less pressing of circumstances, as this ordeal appears to have aged the already old man many years in just a blink of time.\nHis Lordship offered escort by 2 of his finest &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; to see my safe passage to the borders of east &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodil&lt;/a&gt;. Two fine, young and extremely loyal and disciplined soldiers they were. Their presence alone could send hairs on end on even the mightiest of wizards. Time spent traveling those few days with these gentlemen was satisfying. They have become good friends in those few short days and I do wish them well in their careers as Arms of the Throne.\nOnce at the border, they bid me farewell and left me with bread and dried meats. A flask of a very well aged Cyrodilic wine was presented to me as a gift from the both of them to keep me in good spirits for the remainder of my journey. Hearty handshakes were swapped and I continued on.\nThe King, not knowing very well of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; traditions and culture, offered one of his finest steeds to me when I began my service in Cyrodil. Had this grand beast been found in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfel&lt;/a&gt;, it may very well have been on a spit above a well tendered firepit. However, having been in the service and presence of the Empire these past couple of years, I have grown to appreciate and respect these beasts which are so foreign to me, other than on a plate with fine herbs. I respectfully accepted this gift and promised a good life for it. This \"horse\", which I titled Xyldan, has since become more than a tool. Xyldan and I have bonded and I am honored to have such a friend as he. I have known many Dunmer who have befriended &lt;a href=\"guar\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt;, and for this, I thought them silly. I now understand this bond and it is far from silly. I may be older than many pines of the north, but it is never too late for an old Dunmer to learn and find sense in that of which he never thought so. So then, Xyldan and I now traveled together west, home.\nWith the recent troubles sprouting about, I had to keep a watchful eye of my surroundings. It is quite hard to concentrate and keep a meditative thought of a defensive spell ready when you are taking in the beauty of the lands which you have not lain eyes upon in quite some time. As luck would have it, I was granted safe passage to the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;One True Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. Ah, I did have ... one, small encounter that you may find a pleasure in. A young masked gentleman thought it a good idea to attempt to rob a traveling old Dunmer, knowing not that the traveling old Dunmer was I. He lept from his perch in a tree, nearly impaling his own self upon his rusted dagger. Upon getting to his feet, he demanded my mount and any coinage I had on me. I admit, this was a sad sight indeed and I actually felt pity for this soul. Alas, I offered him safe passage and my fine silk cloak. He accepted the cloak but did not hold to his word. He still blocked passage and demanded more. Not wishing for bloodshed and still harboring pity for this clearly poor man, I waved my hand and watched as his ancient, rusted armor disintegrated to dust upon the ground where he stood. I then let out an unexpected roar of laughter, for the poor bandit wore not any clothing beneath. He covered himself as well he could and shivered in the chill morning air. My pity grew and I threw a small pouch of coinage to him and a pair of knickers. I do hope that fellow is well and out of the cold air by now.\nWhere was I... ah, yes... arriving at the One True Ebonheart. There is much confusion of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;\"two\" Ebonhearts&lt;/a&gt;, of which I shall explain at another time. I found stable for Xyldan and took rest in a small village outside of the great Fort. The hospitality was less than grand, but I imagine the rumour of great trouble looming caused distrust among the peoples of the village. As many of you know, I am not much of a conversationalist, unless it concerns matters of intellectual curiosities. The folk of the tavern that eve seemed quite curious of me and many thought me to be an agent or spy of sorts. A select few attempted audience with me, and I gladly accepted, even though I am not one to speak of weather, fishery, or farm. How I did enjoy \"small talk\" again. My many years of continuous work has left me a secluded old buffoon. It was wonderful having average folk, knowing not of my identity, speak with me of matters which I knew nothing of. The simplest of topics that eve taught me that there is much in the world that I know not of, yet, it is in front of me at all times. I must stop to smell more flowers and watch the patterns of the grass as the soft winds sift through it.\nThat night I slept as deep and content as a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; on a ale binge. Fully replenished and eager to move on, I chartered passage to &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt;. The waters were as calm as any sailor could wish for. The subtle breeze allowed for a smooth, steady push to the sails. I took great interest in watching the ship hands maintain and work about the vessel. Such hard working folk taking a great pride in their hard work and service. I tipped the entire crew upon arrival in Seyda Neen and bid them a farewell.\nXyldan and I paid a visit to the local outfitter and stocked up on goods for the remainder of our journey. Xyldan seemed uneasy as he glanced over this new land. I am quite sure the worry was fueled by the hungry look in the eyes of my fellow Dunmer. I am home however, and these are my peoples. They know of me and would not dare make a meal utensil visible in the sights of Xyldan, knowing full well, he is my loyal friend.\nPassage to &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt; from the western shore of Vvardenfell would be a hard and slow one indeed. I had nearly forgotten how mighty the thunderstorms and sandstorms could be. Had I passed further south, I could have avoided the pesky sandstorms. Ah yes, had I even remembered them. And to make matters worse, the cursed &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Racer\"&gt;cliffracers&lt;/a&gt; do not appear to have dwindled in their numbers with my absence. I do believe that I should find a way of making their existence all but present. Perhaps I shall bring back some mighty &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim the skies of Vvardenfell. That would surely be a treat, were that a possibility within in my power. A day of passing and I am greeted by the door of my abode. I spent my first eve at home loving my sister-wives and telling them of my journey. They, in turn, spoke to me of the many travelers whom visited the Tower in hopes of gaining audience with me. Indeed, some things never change. My friends, I am very pleased to be home and hope you found some pleasure in the story of my journey from Cyrodil. In short, and not to bring the mood to a halt, but do know that trouble is indeed coming in the very near future. I urge you to enjoy my story while you may, for the Empire may soon need your services."}

He, along with the many &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; that he resurrected, caused destruction and chaos throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, already in strife from the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. However, a mysterious individual\u2014later revealed to be the hero of legend, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014rose up and was able to defeat Alduin, as foretold by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt; of prominently features the Dragon Crisis.\nBackground.\nDuring the early age of Skyrim, the province was ruled over under the will of the Dragons, led by &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. In time, a human rebellion rose up against the dragon rulers, following increasing cruelty from the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;. The rebellion was led by the three Nordic heroes &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gormlaith%20Golden-Hilt\"&gt;Gormlaith Golden-Hilt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hakon%20One-Eye\"&gt;Hakon One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;, collectively referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the efforts of the defected dragon lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of the godess &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other dragon defectors, the rebels learned how to use the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders of the rebellion created a Shout called &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt; which they believed could help them defeat Alduin. However, during the confrontation with Alduin they realized, as Felldir suspected, that Alduin was still too strong for them to defeat. Thus, they resorted to the use an Elder Scroll to cast Alduin \"adrift on the currents of Time\" banishing him and creating a &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt;. After Alduin's banishment the Nords gained the upper hand in the war and preceded to decimate the remaining dragon population.\nBeginning of the end.\nAlduin exited the time rift in the year &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. His first known action after his return was attacking a small mountain town, &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, coincidentally interrupting the execution of several prominent figures, among them &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;unnamed prisoner&lt;/a&gt;. Alduin later escaped into the northern lands.\nAlduin subsequently began resurrecting fallen dragons across the region. Notably, the dragon &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt; came into conflict with the people of Skyrim near the major city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; reported a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; attacking the city's &lt;a href=\"Western%20Watchtower\"&gt;Western Watchtower&lt;/a&gt;. The prisoner, having arrived there themselves, was tasked alongside a contingent of guards, to meet and end the threat. After a battle, the force eventually defeated Mirmulnir. The defeat of the dragon in turn revealed that the prisoner was in fact the Dragonborn, a legendary warrior with the body of a mortal and the soul of a dragon. The mysterious order of monks known as the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; then summoned the newly minted Dragonborn to their &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;monastery&lt;/a&gt; for training.\nThe true conflict.\nThe Greybeards conducted various training exercises with the Dragonborn to train them in the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Voice\"&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually sent them on a mission to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, which was located in the ancient Nordic burial crypt of &lt;a href=\"Ustengrav\"&gt;Ustengrav&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Horn had already been taken by another party and replaced by a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Note%20%28Delphine%29\"&gt;mysterious note&lt;/a&gt;, leading the Dragonborn back to the town of &lt;a href=\"Riverwood\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the two finally came into contact in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt;, the thief was revealed to be the innkeeper, Delphine. She explained to the Dragonborn that she had knowledge of several &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Burial%20Mounds\"&gt;dragon burial sites&lt;/a&gt; located across Skyrim, some of which had been found empty. She believed that the dragons were being resurrected and that the next resurrection would happen at the small settlement of &lt;a href=\"Kynesgrove\"&gt;Kynesgrove&lt;/a&gt;, and thus requested that the Dragonborn follow her there to gain further information and avert any attack.\nAfter arriving at Kynesgrove, Alduin was observed hovering over the burial site, speaking in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon Language&lt;/a&gt;, as another dragon, &lt;a href=\"Sahloknir\"&gt;Sahloknir&lt;/a&gt;, rose out of the earth. He openly mocked the Dragonborn, calling them arrogant in taking the name of \"Dovah\" (dragons). Alduin then ordered Sahloknir to \"slay the mortals\" and flew away. Sahloknir began to attack Delphine and the Dragonborn, and a battle ensued. Eventually, however, the Dragonborn and Delphine were able to overcome and slay the dragon, after which Delphine revealed that she was one of the last members of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and her suspicions that the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; were responsible for the recent dragon uprising. The Dragonborn's investigation revealed the opposite; the Thalmor were seeking answers just the same, namely by tracking down another Blade, the archivist Esbern. The Dragonborn reached him first, and led him back to Delphine. Esbern explained his knowledge on the dragons' return and new information on ways to fight them. Delphine, Esbern, and the Dragonborn then traveled to an ancient Blades stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered &lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Through the wall, they deciphered that the Ancient Nord warriors used, in conjunction with an Elder Scroll, a Shout to defeat Alduin.\nPower play.\nAfter returning to the Greybeards, the Dragonborn was permitted to meet with their leader, Paarthurnax, who was revealed to himself be a dragon. After discussing philosophy and history, Paarthurnax sent the Dragonborn to find the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, used by the Tongues, in the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruin\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter retrieving the Elder Scroll, the Dragonborn read it atop the summit of the mountain. Alduin, sensing the power of the Scroll, appeared in the skies above. With the help of Paarthurnax, the Dragonborn nearly defeated Alduin during their \"&lt;a href=\"Alduin%27s%20Bane\"&gt;duel atop the world&lt;/a&gt;\" by using &lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the very shout used by the Tongues to defeat Alduin long ago. Despite their best efforts, however, Alduin managed to escape to the realm of the Nordic afterlife, &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nConclusion.\nA prophecy fulfilled.\nThe Dragonborn later convinced the Jarl of Whiterun to allow them to use &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; as a prison for &lt;a href=\"Odahviing\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt;, Alduin's second-in-command, in the hopes to learn where Alduin escaped to. After the dragon's capture, Odahviing struck a deal with the Dragonborn. The terms of this deal were that Odahviing would be freed; in exchange he would carry the Dragonborn to the gate of Sovngarde, located at the Nordic ruin &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;. After reaching Skuldafn, the Dragonborn defeated Alduin's remaining forces who were guarding the portal, then was teleported to Sovngarde.

They were last known to be heading towards Mzulft; they may know more about where to find the staff.\"\nWalkthrough.\nMirabelle may be found wandering the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Hall of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, in the exterior courtyard within &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the College&lt;/a&gt;, or occasionally sitting in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Countenance\"&gt;Hall of Countenance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt;. Ask her about the staff, and after a few roundabout conversations, Mirabelle recalls that some &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; from the Synod were interested in it and came to the College to question them. Leaving empty-handed, it appears they had a secondary plan: to head toward the sprawling Dwemer ruins of Mzulft, which apparently has a derelict observatory that would somehow help locate the staff.\nIn the foothills by the edge of the mountains that curve through &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, south and a little east of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, Mzulft still stands. There are ancient carved stone columns, archway entrances, and a spectacular stone-and-pipework facade with steam still hissing from the hillside. It is possible to open the huge golden door and step inside.\nMzulft.\nSlumped to the right of the first interior door is an Imperial named &lt;a href=\"Gavros%20Plinius\"&gt;Gavros Plinius&lt;/a&gt;. He was ambushed while attempting to reach the Oculory, where another member of the Synod, Paratus, is holed up.\nBefore dying, he murmurs something about a crystal being stolen. His corpse can be looted for a couple of important items: a key that will aid in the entrance to Mzulft and a research log. Reading the log reveals who exactly was here (an attendant on behalf of the First Adjunct Oronrel) and what he was doing (delivering a new Focusing Crystal to the Oculory). Now the key may be used to open the second door.\nContinuing east, the path turns left (north), where a trap trigger drops spikes from the ceiling. A dead &lt;a href=\"Synod%20Researcher\"&gt;Synod Researcher&lt;/a&gt; has some random loot. The path turns right (east), then left (north) again, where two &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven spiders&lt;/a&gt; are found. The path continues winding east and north with more spiders, until two huge gold doors are encountered. The doors on the left are visibly booby trapped, so it is best to stand to the right of them when opening them, or else to undo the trap trigger on the bottom right of the door. The room is a dead end, but inside it is another spider, then a vein of &lt;a href=\"Moonstone%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;moonstone ore&lt;/a&gt; and a chest.\nThe other doors can be entered and a ramp climbed to the east. Another door to the left (north) leads to a more natural cavern with elements of Dwemer architecture still visible. Inside there is more moonstone ore that can be mined, up a wooden ramp to the right (east) before having to engage with the first &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt;. Two more dead Synod researchers are found here, at the foot and the top of the ramped scaffold. There is also more ore that can be mined, plus a knapsack near the ore vein and an &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;apothecary's satchel&lt;/a&gt;.\nUp a sloping passage to the north is a trip wire that releases a pile of rocks. Beyond that is a second, much taller cavern that contains a mammoth skeleton, more chaurus, and an arched entrance to another finished portion of the cavern. A doorway leads north, then turns right (east) up another ramped corridor, where &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven spheres&lt;/a&gt; will attack at the top. An adept-level gate there can be unlocked for some nice loot.\nContinuing to the left (north), then up a ramp to the right (east), there is a door. Beyond it is a mechanical corridor with several more &lt;a href=\"Animunculi\"&gt;Dwarven automatons&lt;/a&gt; near the far end. At the end of the corridor is a T intersection. To the right is a dead end. To the left (north) is a room with another Dwarven spider. A walkway leads straight, then right (east) to another T intersection. To the right (south) is a stairway that leads down to the right (west). At the bottom of those steps is an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;. To the left (south) is an expert-level gate protecting a single chest containing meager loot.\nBack at the last T intersection, to the north is another door. Beyond it is a large room with a walkway around the left (west) wall, plus a stairway against the right wall that goes down to the lower part of the room. There is nothing of interest in the lower part except for two Dwarven automatons. The upper walkway is trapped - a trigger halfway through causes the pipes to extend from the wall, knocking an unsuspecting Dragonborn to the lover level. Another Dwarven sphere is along the walkway on the other (northern) side of the room.\nA passage north from the upper part of the room leads to a chest, corpses of dead &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, and wrecked Dwarven spiders. To the right (east), a ramp leads upward. At the top, just before the doors, to the left is a chest hidden behind some rocks containing minor loot. Going through the golden doors leads into the Mzulft Boilery.\nMzulft Boilery.\nJust beyond the doors are the remains of several more Dwarven automatons. From the doors, a ramp leads up to the east. Just to the left (north) from the top of the ramp is a large area that allows proceeding right then left, or straight then right. There is a Falmer patrolling the northern side of the room. From the northeastern corner, a ramp leads further up to the east, where another Falmer lurks at the top.\nThe path turns left (north) and leads to a hub room with cage doors and two more Falmer. Against the left (west) wall is an expert leveled locked gate with the corpses of several Dwemer automatons. In the northern wall is an unlocked gate with nothing behind it.\nThrough the open doors to the east is a gap in the wall that appears to be caused by Falmer tunneling. This path continues to the left (north) with more chaurus and Falmer encounters. A small room on the right contains a Falmer chest, several sacs of &lt;a href=\"chaurus%20eggs\"&gt;chaurus eggs&lt;/a&gt;, and a moonstone ore vein.\nThe path continues generally northward past a small Falmer camp that also has several chaurus. There is a tripwire in the passage beyond the first camp. The passage leads generally northwest, then takes a sharp turn to the right (east). At the end, it turns left (north) and opens into a large room with another Falmer camp with another dead Synod researcher. Beyond, the path leads north and up through another narrow passage to another large room with a chaurus and a Falmer chest somewhat hidden in the southwest corner.\nContinuing on to the north, the path returns to Dwarven-built chambers, with another Falmer patrolling the area. Ahead is a master-locked room with a skeleton and a chest visible through the barred opening. Next to the chest is a Mzulft room key. Beside the skeleton is the Alteration skillbook, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Lunar%20Lorkhan\"&gt;The Lunar Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe path turns west. On the right (north) side is an expert-locked door with a chaurus behind it. The room beyond contains an apprentice-locked chest with minor loot and many Dwemer artifacts.\nBack on the main path, to the west, the ceilings are higher and the chambers more impressive as a huge gallery with a flooded sunken central area is reached. Falmer are swarming about in this location. To the right (north), on the right side is an alcove with a novice-locked chest. On the opposite (west) side, at the south end, a trapped door leads to a room with a chaurus reaper and some nice loot. Back in the main room, at the northern end of the west wall is one last corridor. The doors at this corridor's end lead to the Mzulft Aedrome.\nMzulft Aedrome.\nThe path starts out heading east up a ramp. At the top are a chaurus and a Falmer. Turning left (north), the path comes to a short wall with a room behind. The room contains several more Falmer. This room is the central of three giant chambers connected by corridors of ornate pillars and snaking pipes.\nThe central chamber has numerous Falmer, but one is especially important: a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20Master\"&gt;Dwarven Centurion Master&lt;/a&gt; boss, or a &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Shadowmaster\"&gt;Falmer Shadowmaster&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Gloomlurker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer Gloomlurker&lt;/a&gt; (this is level dependent) that carries a &lt;a href=\"focusing%20crystal\"&gt;focusing crystal&lt;/a&gt;. This will be needed soon, so it is important to kill and loot every enemy in this room. If has been installed, this enemy might be a &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20Warmonger\"&gt;Falmer Warmonger&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore proceeding west, though, note that a corridor leads down to the east to a smaller room with many Dwemer artifacts, including multiple pieces of solid Dwemer metal. There are two more doors leading further to the east into similar rooms, but the last has a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven centurion&lt;/a&gt;, Dwarven Spider Guardian or Falmer Gloomlurker (level dependent). Behind it is a chest containing valuable loot and the Mzulft Observatory key, which is necessary to open the doors to the west. There are some nice potions, ingots, and arrows on the wall shelves as well.\nBack in the central room, a master-locked door to the north dead ends with a Falmer chest and a moonstone ore vein. Just to the left of the corridor leading west (to the central chamber) is a wall chest containing minor loot. Down the corridor is a door that requires the Observatory key to unlock. Beyond that door is a ramp leading up to another locked door that requires a key. However...\nOculory.\nParatus Decimius is behind this door, and unlocks it when he hears it being tried. He has been expecting Gavros Plinius (the Synod researcher that was found dead at the entrance) and is displeased by the arrival of someone else. Once he is informed that the crystal has been brought along, and that the Dragonborn is from the College of Winterhold, he grudgingly accepts the help. He strolls along the corridor leading to a giant Dwarven .\nDecimius is not sure what the Dwemer called this huge focusing globe, but from the Synod's research, the machinery appears to have been made to collect starlight for an as yet unknown purpose. Decimius thought to replace one of the elements with his crystal, after months of perfecting it. Using the focusing crystal will allow the Synod's research to continue. It will be necessary to activate the giant, tumbling machinery.\nAfter following Decimius into the armillary chamber and up the ramp surrounding the sphere (and optionally speaking to him about related matters), he requests that the Oculory be approached, with the giant series of lenses atop the armillary, and the Dwarven armillary be activated.\nUpon gazing around the curved observatory chamber, a series of circular blue focusing mirrors can be noticed on the ceiling panels around the chamber. Directly above the center of the Oculory are three focusing lenses.\nDuring the daytime, a stream of bright light bounces off them, onto the ceiling. Some of the blue focusing mirrors are lit with starlight, as is the main circular mirror in the center of the ceiling. After heading up either ramp and looking to the stone table, a number of valuable items can be found:\nPuzzle Solution.\nIf the frostbite spell is not already known, the spell tome \"Frostbite\" sitting on the desk behind the control panel up the stairs needs to be read. Move around on top of the curved upper surface of the sphere, casting &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt; (use only these novice spells, apprentice or higher leveled spells will move the mirrors differently) at the blue circles on the center of the ceiling and also cast them at the center of the ring where the crystal is until each beam of light above is focused on a separate rotating ring around the ceiling.\nEach of the Dwemer pedestals atop the ramp will rotate one of the three ceiling panels. Press the button on each pedestal until the blue mirrors each line up with their respective light beam and all beams are reflected back into the center. Once all three beams/mirrors are aligned go and speak to Decimius again.\nThe Map Revealed.\nAs a map of the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; is projected onto the wall underneath the buttons, Decimius is initially excited to watch the results of his months of work. However, this is tempered slightly as the results come in: Something is creating a huge amount of interference, something at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak to Decimius (and be as honest or as cagey as desired), but he is highly suspicious of the mages. He angrily wants to know what has been done at the College or what the College has to cause such an interference. Whether or not he is told about the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the conversation needs to be turned to the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;'s location. Decimius finally reveals its location: &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile leaving the Oculory room, &lt;a href=\"Nerien\"&gt;Nerien&lt;/a&gt;, another representative from the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;, magically appears from a side corridor to say that trying times are ahead. It is imperative that a return be made to the College immediately. Swift action must be taken, and capabilities must be proven. He believes the Dragonborn will prevail.\nBeyond the doors where Nerien was standing, another set of doors can be opened with the Observatory key. Once open, it is possible to fast travel back to the College.\nBack at the College.\nAfter arriving at the College, Savos Aren can be found in the Hall of the Elements. He refuses to talk about the Staff of Magnus because the Eye of Magnus has been taken over by &lt;a href=\"Ancano%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ancano&lt;/a&gt;, who has barricaded himself inside the room. Savos and Mirabelle hit the barrier with sparks and frost, respectively, and though fire does not need to be used to destroy the barrier, one might as well complete the trio. Note that, if Mirabelle is hit, she will not speak to Ancano, and the quest cannot continue. Once in the room with Ancano, a short cutscene unfolds where Savos attempts to speak to and stop Ancano, resulting in the screen going white. This ends this quest and begins the quest, \"&lt;a href=\"Containment\"&gt;Containment&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

The thread of honor that binds the Redguard from before birth to beyond death is strong. The soaring and massive mausoleums are purest representations of undiluted &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n architecture, built to propel spirits to a meeting with their purative gods.\nPerhaps the finest example of this type of burial site is Tu'whacca's Throne, set atop a vast plateau in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.

After passing the Throne Keepers, who are ever vigilant and maintain Tu'whacca's Throne, the eyes meet the true majesty of this sacred place.\nThis necropolis is both a sprawling burial ground and a sacred ruin. Aside from Tu'whacca's presence watching from dark corners of this sanctuary, the temple also serves as a monument to the untold number of Yokudans who perished when the continent sank beneath the waves. Pilgrims travel across the stinging sands to pay their respects to these victims and to the historical Redguard kings who are also interred in the labyrinthine necropolis."}

Should the Dragonborn simply hand the ring to Viola and tell her where it came from, she rewards the Dragonborn with leveled gold and also informs the &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of the situation. This action results in Revyn's shop having an increased tax, thus causing his wares to be more expensive.

As the &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Dusk Lady&lt;/a&gt; often says, insight requires sacrifice\nI took care to write down all the details of my visions. I pray this note will lead you to the other oracles. And to me.\nIn my first vision, I saw wide stone halls, hewn by Elden hands and lit by blue stones. &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Storm-beasts&lt;/a&gt; prowl these halls. There were witches also\u2014wide-eyed and cackling.

A prison, patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;necromancers&lt;/a&gt; and their abominations. They toil in profane silence, excavating something.

Outlander.\"\nVivec: \"Oh hush, Archcanon Tarvus. Outlanders have their usefulness and this one intrigues me.\"\nTarvus: \"As you say, I'll be in my office if you need me.\"\nVivec: \"Step forward, friend of Llevule, and let us speak.\"\nUpon speaking to Vivec, he says he will need the Vestige's assistance to perform a divination ritual, and speak to &lt;a href=\"Archcanon%20Tarvus\"&gt;Archcanon Tarvus&lt;/a&gt; about it. Upon obtaining the Blessing Stone and going to the palace, Tarvus and Vivec will initiate the ritual, only for it to end on an abrupt note. After speaking to Vivec, he will reveal that his divine essence is draining away, and he needs their assistance to discover the cause.\n&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Inquiries\"&gt;Divine Inquiries&lt;/a&gt;.\nVivec will request that the Vestige speak to Archcanon Tarvus about leads to investigate regarding the loss of his power.\nLater, after speaking to the Archcanon, Vivec can be found inside his palace. He will be sitting down in a weakened state, leaning against his spear, and speaks to Llevule:\nCanon Llevule: \"My lord! Please! Let me send for aid. Perhaps one of the healers can help you.\"\nVivec: \"\"\"Pain is best tolerated in private,\" as I have written in the .\"\"\nLlevule: \"There must be something I can do.\"\nVivec: \"You can call the Archcanon. He should hear the news our friend brings us.\"\nThe Vestige is to speak with him about the recent events that have transpired. Once he is informed about &lt;a href=\"Chodala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chodala&lt;/a&gt;'s actions, he asks them to speak with Archcanon Tarvus."}

The city of Vivec is one of three settlements created in honor of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, namely &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the Warrior-Poet.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city of Vivec is located on the southern side of the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, a large body of water that separates the mainland of Morrowind from the Isle of Vvardenfell. Vivec is situated on the open bay of the &lt;a href=\"Ascadian%20Isles\"&gt;Ascadian Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the inner grazelands of Vvardenfell that consist of several different islands and lakes such as &lt;a href=\"Elmas%20Island\"&gt;Elmas Island&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Amaya\"&gt;Lake Amaya&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec consists of several mer-made islands called Cantons, which were built by &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; of the Second Era. The Cantons are made of several levels that are populated by local traders and artisans; they can be compared to towns, especially since the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Mar\"&gt;Molag Mar&lt;/a&gt; is a canton in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;. Cantons serve different purposes and are occupied by some of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of Morrowind. The &lt;a href=\"Foreign%20Quarter\"&gt;Foreign Quarter&lt;/a&gt; of Vivec is where many foreign interests are located in the city, the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; have halls in the canton. Originally, foreigners were not able to enter the city and so, the Foreign Quarter was made for foreigners. Nowadays, anyone can arrive into Vivec and bask in its glory.\nThree of the cantons are occupied by Houses Hlaalu, Redoran, and Telvanni from west to east respectively. The Hlaalu Canton was one of the first out of the three to be built during the Second Era, it leads into the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Coast\"&gt;Bitter Coast&lt;/a&gt; and the fortress city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;. The Telvanni Canton in the east was the last one, by &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the Telvanni canton was merely a large square hole in the Ascadian Bay. The Redoran Canton is located inward from the city, much closer to the city center. Further downward, the St. Delyn and St. Olms cantons are closer to the Palace of Vivec and is where the nobility live in. The Temple Canton is more south and is where the Hall of Justice and the Library of Vivec, the Ordinators are headquartered here. The &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; is located on the southernmost end of the city and is a large building resembling a &lt;a href=\"Xanmeer\"&gt;Xanmeer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. This is where Vivec the Warrior-Poet lives and is where he governs the city.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Foundation of Vivec City &amp; the Buoyant Armigers.\nThe city of Vivec was founded by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; himself, Vivec watched over &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Mountain\"&gt;Horde Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed its hulking figure and the clouds sprouting out the summit. Vivec planned to attack the large structure but before he could do anything, a trio of lower house &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Velothi&lt;/a&gt; trapped the monster with a net of doubtful doctrine. Vivec praised these brave souls and celebrated their victory. It was a display of love and triumph around the captured beast, Vivec was in the middle, with a headdress made of mating bones. It was there, Vivec named these three warriors the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec grabbed &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;, a spear of mystical origins that represents Vivec's love, coincidentally, and stabs it into the massive monster, creating a big bag of bones in the process, this became the foundation of Vivec City. The net fell over the bones and became the city's bridge, segmenting the city and making the perfect streets in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; came to the city and gave it their blessing. Vivec City was officially created.\nThe Star of the Mad God; The Baar Dau.\nThe city of Vivec thrived in the province of Resdaynia and is beautiful amidst the realms of Ascadia. On one fateful day, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of Madness decided he would take revenge on the Dunmer who ceased worship of the Daedra in favor of Vivec, Almalexia and Sotha Sil. Sheogorath would pull a meteor from the depths of the Void and fling it into &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, seeking revenge on his former worshipers. This meteor was &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; otherwise known as Lie Rock or the Ministry of Truth. Baar Dau traveled across the planet and was landing onto Vivec City. The &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s prayed to Azura for safety while the denizens of Vvardenfell were wailing and shrieking, fearful for their lives. The Dunmer prayed to &lt;a href=\"the%20Three\"&gt;the Three&lt;/a&gt;, and Vivec heard their prayers, with his benevolent powers, Vivec was able to hold the meteor and left it suspended far in the air. The city was saved, for now. The Baar Dau meteor would be repurposed into the Ministry of Truth, the maximum prison of Vivec City. The large rock would become a reminder of the Tribunal's power and their importance because without Vivec, Vvardenfell would be destroyed.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jewel of Vvardenfell; Construction on Vivec.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Vivec was halfway through completion, with only the Hlaalu and Redoran cantons halfway done, the Telvanni Canton's formation was not complete, only a large hole in the middle of the bay was there. The foreign Canton was not created, it was likely in planning at this time. The city of Vivec, along with the other Tribunal cities and Western Vvardenfell, Vivec was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, although they did not have headquarters there. Vivec ruled the city along with &lt;a href=\"Archcanon%20Tarvus\"&gt;Archcanon Tarvus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Canon%20Llevule\"&gt;Canon Llevule&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec soon became ill, and his powers were draining from him. Vivec sent an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to find the source of this disturbance before he loses his powers and the Baar Dau continues to fall.\nThe Vile Hound's Plot; Enter Chodala the Nerevarine.\nThe source was from an &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Conoon%20Chodala\"&gt;Conoon Chodala&lt;/a&gt; who came into possession of a powerful staff called the &lt;a href=\"Sunna%27rah\"&gt;Sunna'rah&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala was the Ashkhan of the &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku Tribe&lt;/a&gt; and believed he was, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. Chodala would be defeated in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kaushtarari\"&gt;Kaushtarari&lt;/a&gt; by both the Vestige and his sister, &lt;a href=\"Seryn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Seryn&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige took Sunna'rah and traveled back to Vivec City, to reverse the effect by giving Vivec his powers. The Tarvus' experiment backfired, resulting in Vivec losing his power quickly, to the point where his spirit had left his body. It was revealed the Archcanon Tarvus was actually &lt;a href=\"Barbas\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Hound of &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt; and was planning on using Vivec's power to open the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. The Baar Dau started to fall again from the air, causing pandemonium in Vivec City, people began to lose faith in Vivec. &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;'s former apprentice traveled to the Clockwork City along with the Vestige, and defeated Barbas within &lt;a href=\"Seht%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Seht's Vault&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec's powers were restored but this would not be the last we see of the Daedric Princes as a Great War would come.\nThe Talosian Conquest into Resdaynia.\nIn the waning years of the Second Era, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; launched a campaign all across the continent of Tamriel in the efforts to unite the provinces under a single banner. After the &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Hammerfell Civil War&lt;/a&gt; and the signing of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;First Treaty of Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, the Septim Army moved pass the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valus%20Mountains\"&gt;Valus Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to take control of the province of Morrowind. The defense against the Septim Armada consisted of soldiers from the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; was neutral in the conflict while &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; proposed some sort of accommodation for the Empire. The Septim-Morrowind War ravaged western Morrowind by hitting several locations including the city of &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; and the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt;. Both Indoril and Dres dropped out of the conflict, seeing no apparent victory, leaving the War House of Redoran to fend for themselves. Things would come to an end when Vivec himself appeared before his people in Vivec City and proclaimed a negotiation of a treaty. The result of this would be the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt; which was held by &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; and with opposition from some of the Houses. Indoril resisted the treaty till their demise alongside Dres. Redoran and Hlaalu wanted this conflict to end so they gracefully accepted the Armistice. Telvanni, indifferent to the situation, went along with the treaty, and so the Imperial Province of Morrowind was created.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Flourishing Age of Vvardenfell and Vivec.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20414\"&gt;3E 414&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;High King Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt; revoked the orders, the Armistice had set up, to open trade within the Vvardenfel District. With this news, a new influx of foreigners began to enter the District and new settlements sprung up in the span of several years. In cooperation with the city of Vivec, the fortress city of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; administrated the entire province and proclaimed it a Duchy in the Empire. The leader of Ebonheart was a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i Noble name &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt;, who was a member of the Great House Hlaalu. The Vivecian foreign quarter was no longer the only place for visitors to travel to; Eventually, the entire city was accessible for foreigners.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;, the city of Vivec prospered along with the other three cities in Vvardenfell. The city was under the administration of &lt;a href=\"Archcanon%20Tholer%20Saryoni\"&gt;Archcanon Tholer Saryoni&lt;/a&gt;, but of course, the city is watched over by the Great Vivec, from his Palace. Saryoni was the patriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; and was able to keep the city together during the third era. It was at this time; the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; began to roam the land, to fulfill the long-awaited prophecy. Throughout the year, the Nerevarine managed to unite the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribes as well as becoming the &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of the Great Houses inhabiting the region. With the completion of the Fourth and Fifth trials of the Prophecy, the Nerevarine traveled to Vivec City, to seek an audience with Vivec himself. The two discussed a plan to defeat &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, the one responsible for unleashing the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; onto the denizens of Vvardenfell. Vivec and the Nerevarine devised the &lt;a href=\"Plan%20to%20Defeat%20Dagoth%20Ur\"&gt;Plan to Defeat Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, where they would raid his territory within the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt; and defeat him within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine traveled north to find Dagoth-Ur.\nThe Fall of the Tribunal and the Morrowind Reform.\nThe Nerevarine Prophecy would not end with the death of Dagoth-Ur. The original purpose of the Prophecy was to set an end of the Tribunal Era with Morrowind, by having each member of the Tribunal perish by the Nerevarine. Way back in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the great warrior known as &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; would be slain by Vivec and lost his chance at godhood when the Tribunal used the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; to given them divinity. &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; would change the Chimer's skin into an ashen gray, resulting in the modern-day Dunmer. The Nerevarine's real purpose was the avenge their past life by slaying the three that took it from them. The Nerevarine traveled to the city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, deep within the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20Plains\"&gt;Deshaan Plains&lt;/a&gt; where they met &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. The warrior became Almalexia's Champion until she realized how this person actually was. In an attempt to keep sovereignty, she killed &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and unleashed his &lt;a href=\"Fabricant\"&gt;Fabricant&lt;/a&gt;s onto the people of Mournhold. The Nerevarine would be sent by Almalexia to defeat Sotha Sil until they discovered his dead body. Almalexia planned to frame the warrior, to have them executed for treason against the Tribunal. But this proved to fail, as the Nerevarine battled Almalexia with the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, killing her in a battle of destruction. And so ended the Nerevarine Prophecy, the following years would shape the province of Morrowind in a way that would last for a very long time.\nWith his divinity stripped away, Vivec became mortal and disappeared from his domain. He, however, did continue to watch over and protect Vivec City until he had vanished, sometime around the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;. With the Tribunal religion gone, a new religion was implemented in Morrowind called the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, which worships the original Dunmeri gods which consists of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine vanished as well, rumors during the waning years of the third era revealed that they have traveled to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, located in the far east, across the &lt;a href=\"Padomaic%20Ocean\"&gt;Padomaic Ocean&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec's disappearance would not take toll until several years later, into the Fourth Era of Tamriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Red Year and the Crash of Baar Dau.\nVivec disappeared sometime around the Oblivion Crisis, which was &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;. With the disappearance of Vivec came one of Tamriel's most tragic events. Several years after the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; atop of the Vivec City slowly resumed its fall down onto the city. The Dunmer of Morrowind needed an alternate solution to keep the Baar Dau suspended in the sky. &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; to creat the &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful machine that requires souls to be fueled. This device would hold the meteor for five years and proved to be effective, at the horrible cost of innocent souls. Ezhmaar Sul's wife, &lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, was chosen to be one of the sacrificed because she had the right sort of soul. Ezhmaar Sul attempted her escape, but all in vain; his fight against Vuhon inadvertently destroyed the Ingenium, and when the Ingenium exploded, it caused the death of Ilzheven. Without anything to keep it in the sky, the Ministry of Truth crashed into Vivec City. The Baar Dau maintained all the kinetic energy of its former fall and when it finally struck, it obliterated Vivec, leaving a crater that encompasses the majority of the Ascadian Bay; the &lt;a href=\"Scathing%20Bay\"&gt;Scathing Bay&lt;/a&gt;, as it came to be called, was a desolate area of bones and ash. A tragic display of two star-crossed lovers and their inseparable love destroyed both Vivec City and devastated the entire Morrowind province, and this year would be dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nEzhmaar Sul and Vuhon were banished to Clavicus Vile's Realm of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, where Vuhon again made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt; and created a second Ingenium, which ripped a portion of land from Oblivion to float towards &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and over the Scathing Bay, where those on the land, now dubbed Umbriel, witnessed the unnatural boiling of the Bay's waters and a horde of undead rising from them."}

To the west, on the other side of the creek, the town of &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nHistory.\nThe city is also home to the God, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; during the events of .\nVivec city also houses three of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the fall of the Tribunal, Vivec was not considered a god by his people anymore. The &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt;, a floating meteor that was kept suspended in the air by Vivec himself, completed its fall and destroyed Vivec City, creating a large, flooded crater. Saldus Llervu, who witnessed the event on the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;mainland&lt;/a&gt;, said to have seen the cantons fall apart before being knocked off his feet by the impact's power.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; performed a strange ritual on the crater itself, turning it into what they called the \"Scathing Bay.\" The waters in the newly formed crater are constantly boiling. When &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; flew over it in &lt;a href=\"4E%2040\"&gt;4E 40&lt;/a&gt;, legions of dead were said to have rose out of the boiling waters.\nLocations.\nThe city itself is an artificial archipelago made of a large palace and eight large, multileveled buildings called cantons. Most cantons are divided into four levels. From the bottom up: the Underworks, the Canalworks, the Waistworks, and Plaza. In the foreign quarter, the Waistworks is divided into Upper and Lower sections. There is also the moonlet of Bar Dau, known as the Ministry of Truth.\nThe Cantons.\nThe Underworks are the lowest level of each canton, and provide a sewer system.\nThe Canalworks are used for storage, and there are religious areas, traders, shrines, temples, and tombs.\nThe Waistworks house residential quarters, pubs, clubs, traders, along with many denizens populating the Waistworks. Stalls can be found, as well as corridors going through the area, often ending or branching in shops or pubs. St. Olms and St. Delyn have living quarters accessible from outside.\nThe top level of the canton is called the plaza. The plaza contains houses, temples, treasuries, Estates, as well as shops and cornerclubs.\nSt. Olms and St. Delyn cantons are home to the guilds; the potters and the glassworkers reside in St. Delyn. In St. Olms, the brewers and fishmongers guilds can be found.\nThe Arena.\nThe Arena Canton is best known for containing an arena and the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. The main section of the building is an arena with its fighting pit and hundreds of seats for spectators; it is used for various fighting matches, honorable duels. Feuds and matters of succession are settled here. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; has to fight in a duel in the arena during the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;main quest&lt;/a&gt;. The Waistworks house the fighter living and training areas, and shop stalls.\nThe Temple.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vivec%2C%20Temple%20Canton\"&gt;Temple of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; serves as the seat of the Dunmer religion on the island of Vvardenfell.\nIn the southernmost section of Vivec city, the temple spans two unique cantons. The main temple contains the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Hall of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Justice%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hall of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"High%20Fane\"&gt;High Fane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hall of Wisdom is home to the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Temple Library&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest libraries in Vvardenfell. Many rare books are stored here.\nNext to the Hall of Wisdom lies the Hall of Justice, which serves as headquarters and barracks to the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbove them, the High Fane can be found. It serves as headquarters for the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and houses many of its members, of which the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouth of the Temple canton, lies the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, connected to the Temple by bridge. Isolated in deep water, the Palace of Vivec is a stepped pyramid featuring cascading waterfalls and spires. It is home to the god Lord &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, one of the pillars of the Tribunal.\nThe Ministry of Truth.\nAbove the Temple, one of the most striking features of Vivec City can be seen, The Ministry of Truth, also known as Baar Dau, it is a large floating satellite hanging above the Temple, suspended only by the power of the god Vivec, and later the Ingenium. The Ministry of Truth is used as an inescapable prison where prisoners that are dangerous to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; are kept."}

Vivec is represented in &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; literature and liturgy as one of the divine kings of Morrowind. He guards the sacred &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;i subcontinent of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and stands guard over &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the gate to hell. He is part of the holy Tribunal, a god of the New Temple, and an aspect of the blessed and righteous ALMSIVI.\nThis explicit presentation of Vivec the Guardian God-King and Warrior-Poet is the one most accessible and familiar to Westerners. However, it is important to remember that Vivec is also known to the Dunmer as the transcendent evolution of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; that anticipated him, Black Hands &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, a foundation figure of the earliest &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. This darker side of Vivec does not appear in the popular literature and liturgy, but is instinctively understood and accepted by the Dunmer as an integral part of Vivec's divine aspect. A more complete appreciation of the complex nature of Vivec requires an understanding of the nature of Vivec's Anticipation, Mephala, and the darker themes represented by this Daedra Lord's modes and motivations.\nWho is Mephala?\nEach of the three Tribunes of the Temple were represented in the dawn of &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i culture by their Anticipations. These Anticipations are known to the West as the sinister Daedra Lords &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. In Temple theology, however, Azura is the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, the Mage-Lord of Almsivi. Boethiah is the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, Almsivi's Mother and Lady. Mephala is the Anticipation of Vivec. According to legend, under the guidance of these three Daedra Lords, a discontented throng of &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; transformed themselves into a new people and founded a new land. And while Boethiah, the so-called Prince of Plots, provided the revolutionary methods needed to bring about this transformation, Mephala was the shadowy implementer of those methods.\nAs known in the West, Mephala is the demon of murder, sex, and secrets. All of these themes contain subtle aspects and violent ones (assassination/genocide, courtship/orgy, tact/poetic truths); Mephala is understood paradoxically to contain and integrate these contradictory themes. And all these subtle undercurrents and contradictions are present in the Dunmer concepts of Vivec, even if they are not explicitly described and explained in Temple doctrine.\nThe Dunmer do not envision Lord Vivec as a creature of murder, sex, and secrets. Rather, they conceive of Lord Vivec as benevolent king, guardian warrior, poet-artist. But, at the same time, unconsciously, they accept the notion of darker, hidden currents beneath Vivec's benevolent aspects.\nFor example, one of the most striking persistent myths associated with Vivec is the story that Vivec conspired with his co-rulers Almalexia and Sotha Sil in the murder of Lord &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest of Dunmer heroes and generals. The story is derived from &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; oral tradition, and is flatly contradicted by all Temple traditions. Nonetheless, the tale is firmly established in the Dunmer imagination, as if to say, \"Of course Vivec would never have conspired to murder Lord Nerevar, but it happened so long ago... who can know the truth?\"\nThe public face of Vivec is benign, sensitive, compassionate, and protective of his followers. At the same time, the Dunmer seem irrationally comfortable with the hidden aspects of Vivec, the darker components of violence, lust, and conspiracy associated the more primitive and ruthless impulses of the Anticipations."}

It is the domain of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, and is the place from which the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; of the realms of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; spawn. &lt;a href=\"The%20Land%20Between\"&gt;The Land Between&lt;/a&gt; separates &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; from the Void.\nHistory.\nBefore all, before the creation of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aedra%20and%20Daedra\"&gt;Aedra and Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, of the vast &lt;a href=\"planes%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;planes of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, there was the Void. The Void is space filled with everything but nothing. An eternal heaven, filled with darkness. Originally before anything, there were two divine beings: &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;, both brothers but representing complete opposites. When Padomay confronted Anu in combat and both their blood spilt, it gave birth to the modern gods. When their spilled blood mixed, it gave birth to the Aedra, but Padomay's lone blood ended up giving birth to the Daedra. This leads some to refer to Padomay as \"The True God\"; the one who existed before everything else and whose chaotic nature caused the reaction that gave life to the current gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart\"&gt;Dark Heart&lt;/a&gt; below &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; was a piece of the Void used by the &lt;a href=\"Nighthollow%20Clan\"&gt;Nighthollow Clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;s to empower themselves and stave off the need for blood. The voidstuff released from the heart could twist ordinary mortals into &lt;a href=\"Shade\"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt;s, and empower &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt; witches by turning them into &lt;a href=\"Voidmother\"&gt;Voidmother&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPopular opinion.\nThe most common view of the Void and its ruler Sithis by mainstream religion is the next thing to hell. Its rejected worship by the followers of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; causes the public opinion of the area to be often turned down, however that does not mean it is forgotten in the wind. There are many people across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; who worship Sithis and plan on going to the Void when they die. Some major organizations are the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, a cult of assassins who serve Sithis through killing, and the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Scars\"&gt;Crimson Scars&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; assassins guild. Aside from larger cults, there are few others who worship the Dread Father in their own way. Many vampires worship Sithis, and some of the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; culture revolves around Sithis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and Reachmen believe the Void to be associated with &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; by way of his Dark Heart."}

Surely, I can discover the secret for myself.\nDespite Lady Belain's guarded secrecy concerning the dark relic, I have made a breakthrough. Upon examining the concentrated energy in the ruins, I discovered small pieces of a shardlike material that seems to originate inside the darkness.\nEach shard had a heaviness to it, almost as if a force was pulling outside objects into itself. If I concentrate, I can feel the same pull in the surrounding energy pockets. Each shard seeks to return to the energy it surely emerged from. I wonder what will happen if I approach one of the energy pockets with it?\nAnother discovery! I approached an energy pocket with a shard and the secret became apparent. As I got closer, the pull became stronger. Suddenly I felt what can only be described as a slipping. As if I tripped and fell, not down, but sideways. Looking around, I realized I was somewhere new. I had been pulled with the shard through the energy to this new location.\nHarnessing the energy has opened the long sealed doors of this ruin to me. Perhaps we will not need the Arkthzand Keystone to enter the library, after all. At least not to get inside the structure. Knowing Lady Belain, the keystone has another function that she has yet to share with the Ashen Lord.\nPentarch Cievernes"}

The hammer landed in the province of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; (hence the name).\nTrue to his word, the leader of the Rourken raised the city of &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the western Dwemer, at the location.\nAcquisition.\nIt is received from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; as a reward for completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Cursed%20Tribe\"&gt;The Cursed Tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSmithing.\nVolendrung can be upgraded with an &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony ingot&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Arcane Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; perk, though it does not benefit from any &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Smithing perks&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the weapon cannot be improved past &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Improvement\"&gt;flawless&lt;/a&gt; quality without boosting the Smithing skill over 100. This can be achieved by using enchanted items, blacksmithing potions of &lt;a href=\"fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt;, and/or &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsefulness.\nVolendrung's enchantment merges very well with its weapon class. Power attacking with two-handed weapons naturally drains &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; very quickly. The powerful enchantment can offset this somewhat by &lt;a href=\"Absorb%20Stamina\"&gt;absorbing stamina&lt;/a&gt; from the opponent to allow additional power attacks.\nWhile useful at lower &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;s, Volendrung can become obsolete at higher levels as it does not benefit from any Smithing perks, thus, other warhammers can quickly outclass it for maximum damage output. However, although Volendrung is a warhammer, it swings as fast as a &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, effectively giving it more damage per second than any other warhammers except possibly &lt;a href=\"The%20Longhammer\"&gt;The Longhammer&lt;/a&gt;. It has the same base damage as the &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Warhammer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony warhammer&lt;/a&gt;."}

Like the other Dwarven settlements, it was abandoned. Volenfell's name was lent to the province, where it would eventually alternate to Hammerfell.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nVolenfell's location was unknown for a long time, being speculated to be near the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Gilane\"&gt;Gilane&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was discovered to be built within the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, near the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Satakalaam\"&gt;Satakalaam&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of Volenfell have been eaten by the sands of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, scattered about and being inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Duneripper\"&gt;Duneripper&lt;/a&gt;s of the land. Endless hills of sand dot the remains, with Dwarven pillars and remote rooms found throughout the site. Advancing northeast will lead into more ruins, where artifacts such as the Guardian's Eye are located. The waters of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; had spewed into the ruins, leaving small areas of water.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; had left their ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; when their leader, &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt; had created the &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. The Rourken opposed this, and so they took to the west, where they established cities in modern-day Hammerfell. King Rourken had decided Hammerfell when he threw his mighty hammer, &lt;a href=\"Volendrung\"&gt;Volendrung&lt;/a&gt;, in that direction. King Rourken's seat of power became the city-state of Volenfell, which had lent its name to the province. Eventually, the Rourken Clan had expanded their territory, to the islands of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Clans such as the &lt;a href=\"Kragen%20Clan\"&gt;Kragen Clan&lt;/a&gt; followed the Rourken to the west, settling in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. But like many other Dwarven settlements, the city-state of Volenfell was abandoned, and the harsh desert subsequently swallowed it. Volenfell's legacy lived on, with the province having remnants of the name. Volenfell faded into obscurity and legend among the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; that had begun to populate the land.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the archaeologist couple, &lt;a href=\"Tharayya\"&gt;Tharayya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quintus%20Verres\"&gt;Quintus Verres&lt;/a&gt; sought the location of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Eye\"&gt;Guardian's Eye&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact that was carried by the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt; for many years. The couple traveled all throughout the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;, beginning with the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Santaki\"&gt;Santaki&lt;/a&gt; and eventually ending up in &lt;a href=\"Yldzuun\"&gt;Yldzuun&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Tharayya learned that the final resting place for the eye was in the ruins of Volenfell, but it was lost to time. The couple had founded the Volenfell remains, but Quintus betrayed his wife, using raiders to attack their camp and to advance forward into the valley. Tharayya utilized the help of the &lt;a href=\"Undaunted\"&gt;Undaunted&lt;/a&gt; to delve into Volenfell, bypassing the Imperial Raiders and the &lt;a href=\"Duneripper\"&gt;Duneripper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tremorscale\"&gt;Tremorscale&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the group was able to enter the inner sanctum, with the Guardian's Eye in sight, but the three Guardians of the Eye attacked, though they were fortunately defeated. But when Tharayya escaped with the Guardian's Eye, it vanished, with the dead being resurrected with its disappearance. From then on, Volenfell would be visited by scholars and treasure-hunters."}

Like the rest of the vigilants at Ruunvald, he is under the influence of the warlock &lt;a href=\"Minorne%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Minorne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Ruunvald\"&gt;Staff of Ruunvald&lt;/a&gt;, which forces him to attack the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; on sight.\nBackground.\nVolk was a member of the Vigilants of Stendarr stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall of the Vigilant&lt;/a&gt; prior to its destruction by the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;. For months while he was at the Hall of the Vigilant, &lt;a href=\"Moric%20Sidrey\"&gt;Moric Sidrey&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow Vigilant, had been trying to convince the rest of the order to help him excavate the ancient Nordic ruin Ruunvald.\nVolk initially dismissed Moric's claims about the ruin, as he had never heard of it and doubted there could be anything of value to be had there. Most of the Vigilants shares Volk's views on the matter, but Moric was able to secure a small team to begin his excavation.\nSoon, Moric was sending word back to the Hall of the Vigilant of ancient treasures he was uncovering there, drawing more attention from the order and bring more workers and even a handful of &lt;a href=\"Husky\"&gt;huskies&lt;/a&gt; to Ruunvald. Eventually, after Moric had broken into the main chamber, Volk finally relented and joined the expedition. Due to his late-coming, however, he was placed of guard duty outside of the excavation site, along with the priest of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Florentius%20Baenius\"&gt;Florentius Baenius&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter two weeks of completely uneventful lookout duty, Volk began keeping &lt;a href=\"Volk%27s%20Journal\"&gt;a journal&lt;/a&gt; in which he described the events leading up to his guard duty. The only notable thing to happen was when the workers came back up to the surface for supplies. This would become increasingly infrequent, raising Volk's suspicions about the Ruunvald excavation. Two days later, a Vigilant named Apa came up with an emotionless expression to tell Volk and Florentius that they should come down to the site, and Apa was the last Vigilant Volk saw.\nAfter three more days, Volk recorded the final entry in his journal, and he and Florentius went down into the excavation site, where they discovered that the excavation was really being led by the warlock &lt;a href=\"Minorne%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Minorne&lt;/a&gt;, who had been using the Staff of Ruunvald to subjugate the wills of the Vigilants there. She then charmed Volk and imprisoned Florentius, who was likely resistant to the staff's effects.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolstering%20the%20Ranks\"&gt;Bolstering the Ranks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Dragonborn arrives at Ruunvald looking for Florentius, Volk is charmed like the rest of the Vigilants and will attack the Dragonborn on sight. While it is possible to sneak or run past him without killing him, Volk will ultimately die when Minorne dies, as will Moric, Apa, and the other twelve &lt;a href=\"Charmed%20Vigilant\"&gt;charmed vigilants&lt;/a&gt; in Ruunvald. Since Minorne must be killed to free Florentius, as the key will not appear until she is dead, it is impossible to spare Volk without modding the game."}

For months, &lt;a href=\"Moric%20Sidrey\"&gt;Moric&lt;/a&gt; had been going on to the Vigilants about detecting mystical energies deep in the east mountains. Said he'd found some old tomes about the ruins of \"&lt;a href=\"Ruunvald\"&gt;Ruunvald&lt;/a&gt;\" or something the like, a Nordic chamber thousands of years old. I remember thinking \"Yeah, if it's so old, how come no one's found it yet? There's plenty of adventurers wandering around these parts.\"\nSeemed like most of the other &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigilants&lt;/a&gt; agreed, we had more important things to do. But Moric took a team and went digging, and when he started turning up a long buried temple, well, didn't I feel like a troll in a dung heap.\nSoon enough, he was sending back letters to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Vigilant\"&gt;Hall&lt;/a&gt;, begging for as many men as we could send. I didn't volunteer at first, still seemed like a myth to me. But when word came back that they'd hit the main chamber, I packed up and headed this way to help. Always did want to be a part of history, and better late than never, they say.\nWell, \"they\" didn't mention that the late comers would be stuck with guard duty. I just sit up here all day, watching for bandits and wolves, neither of which I've seen. Mostly I just see diggers coming up for supplies. Gotta say, I been seeing them a lot less regular, now that I think about it...\nDay 19.\nAll right, it's been 3 days since anyone's come up. The last one to emerge was Apa, and he just walked around a bit with a weird vacant look in his eyes. Told &lt;a href=\"Florentius%20Baenius\"&gt;Florentius&lt;/a&gt; and me to come down as soon as we had the chance, then trudged back in.\nSomething ain't right, and I aims to find out what...\nVolk"}

They are distinctly separate from the living quarters of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;the castle&lt;/a&gt; and is host to several hostile occupants. The Volkihar Dungeons include Volkihar Undercroft, Volkihar East Tower, Volkihar North Tower, and Volkihar Ruins.\nSublocations.\nVolkihar Undercroft.\nThe undercroft was originally an old escape tunnel out of the castle. It contains the old water cistern in which Serana comments it had an unpleasant odor back then. It is also used as a dump for disposing unwanted human corpses through the trapdoor from the thrall cells above. When entering the Undercroft, there are a few coins on the ground alongside &lt;a href=\"clam%20meat\"&gt;clam meat&lt;/a&gt;. There are numerous &lt;a href=\"Death%20Hound%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;death hounds&lt;/a&gt; and an encounter with a &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Vampire\"&gt;Feral Vampire&lt;/a&gt;. A giant frostbite spider guards the lever used to lower the drawbridge to the courtyard. The undercroft leads to the Volkihar Ruins.\nVolkihar Courtyard.\nWhen the courtyard is first entered, it is in a neglected state with a few old graves and headstones. According to &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harkon\"&gt;Harkon&lt;/a&gt; hated the courtyard as it was \"too peaceful.\" Scattered around are various &lt;a href=\"Fungi%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathbell%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deathbell&lt;/a&gt; plants.\nThere are three parts that need to be collected to operate the giant moondial: the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Moon%20Crest\"&gt;Crescent Moon Crest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Full%20Moon%20Crest\"&gt;Full Moon Crest&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Half%20Moon%20Crest\"&gt;Half Moon Crest&lt;/a&gt;. After completion of the &lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt; on the side of &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;the vampires&lt;/a&gt;, the option to clear the pathway to the courtyard becomes available. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Valerica\"&gt;Valerica&lt;/a&gt; can be convinced to return to the castle, where she will replant many of the plants in the courtyard.\nVolkihar East Tower.\nA small tower with a few &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; inside. Single coins and jewels are scattered around the floor.\nVolkihar North Tower.\nAnother small tower with a few Skeletons inside, and occasionally a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;. This tower also features a crushed humanoid skeleton, with a &lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt; head, carrying a silver necklace and some gold bars. There are two chests located here, one next to the gargoyle and the other above the stairs.\nVolkihar Ruins.\nThe ruins are nearly as big as the keep itself. It contains dining room tables, bedrooms, and a spacious chapel with a broken statue of Mara. The size of the ruins indicate that the castle had larger numbers but they fell short over a period of time, leaving the ruins abandoned. There are plenty of enemies in this location, mostly skeletons, death hounds, and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20Brute\"&gt;Gargoyle Brute&lt;/a&gt;s. They can be ruthless and will hunt in packs; sometimes even pretending to be stone statues. A &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Royal%20Armor\"&gt;Vampire Royal Armor&lt;/a&gt; and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Boots\"&gt;Vampire Boots&lt;/a&gt; are on a shelf next to a bookcase near the end of the dungeon.\nValerica's Study.\nThis location contains the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cairn%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Soul Cairn&lt;/a&gt; portal as well as a plethora of &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; and other useful items. The room itself is very large, adorning two floors. The first floor contains an area with many bookshelves, almost as a small library.\nOne notable item found next to the table of bones is the book, \"&lt;a href=\"Valerica%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Valerica's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\". Near this alcove, is an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"finely%20ground%20bone%20meal\"&gt;finely ground bone meal&lt;/a&gt; on it.\nThere is a door leading to the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar%23Castle%20Volkihar%20Balcony\"&gt;Castle Volkihar Balcony&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to fast travel to and from the study."}

They are extremely deadly, casting &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells and &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt;, which can sap large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.

He is a highly difficult opponent and can leech life in large amounts. One tactic is to lure him to the bridge outside his cave and use &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; to blow him down. He will still not die, but his health will be reduced considerably.\nA Volkihar Master Vampire can also be found at &lt;a href=\"Shriekwind%20Bastion\"&gt;Shriekwind Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Another method is to use the pull-chain right outside of his cave to &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt; him inside, enabling the Dragonborn to slowly get his health down with the option to withdraw and heal.\nWith high enough (80+) &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skills&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt;, the Shriekwind Bastion's master vampire can easily be killed by first &lt;a href=\"muffling\"&gt;muffling&lt;/a&gt;, opening the door to its cave (the one after the flame traps). It will be directly to the front, but if the Dragonborn is crouching, it will not react at first, and can quickly be dispatched with &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; (high level Archery recommended, high damage &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; Legendary), &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Archery\"&gt;Fortify Archery&lt;/a&gt; items and &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; a big help). Because of sneaking, it will have a hard time detecting the Dragonborn, even after the first arrow, giving the Dragonborn enough time to kill it before located."}

Reaching the peak there will be a boss battle with the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Volsung\"&gt;Volsung&lt;/a&gt;. He will drop his\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon priest mask&lt;/a&gt;, which is also called &lt;a href=\"Volsung%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Volsung&lt;/a&gt;. One of the words of the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; is also located here.\nExterior.\nJust before the dungeon's main entrance, there's a stairway down to some sort of excavation. To the left, there's an entrance to a small tomb aside from the main dungeon. Care should be exercised when entering this, as there's a swing trap mounted in the ceiling. Inside are some loot, and two coffins. The right one has already been opened and there's a dead\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; on the floor. The left one is closed, but can be forced to opened in several ways, most easily by placing a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Rune%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire rune&lt;/a&gt;. This will release a leveled draugr.\nFrom here, a stairway goes up again, to the dungeon courtyard. A bandit camp can be found here; kill or sneak past them to reach the entrance to the tomb proper.\nVolskygge.\nThis section is fairly straightforward. In the first large room with a throne and a poison dart trap in front of it, plus several &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. From there, the path leads west, then turns north. In the next room, a swinging spiked gate trap can be avoided by passing to its right. The path continues to the west down some stairs to an apprentice-locked chest with random loot and another bandit. The path turns north, then splits at a T intersection. To the left (west) is a room with two bandits, a bookshelf with a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Surfeit%20of%20Thieves\"&gt;Surfeit of Thieves&lt;/a&gt;\", and an adept-locked gate with a lever behind it. Pulling the lever reveals a secret door to the west, which leads to several potions and a chest with random loot.\nTo the east from the T intersection is a large dining hall with two doorways to the left (north) and an iron door to the east. The north doorways lead to different ends of the same hallway, which in turn leads to several other dining rooms that have no notable loot. The iron door has a swinging log trap in the doorway that is difficult to avoid, though sneaking up to the trap's activation plate and standing on while the trap comes down, then moving forward and to the side while the trap is receding back into the ceiling will avoid it. Beyond it, the path turns to the left (north) and leads to a room with a puzzle to solve. There are four insignia (bear, wolf, fox, snake) near the floor, and each has a pedestal behind it with a handle that can be activated. To solve the puzzle, it is necessary to activate the handles in the correct order. The riddle of the puzzle is described in the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Four%20Totems%20of%20Volskygge\"&gt;The Four Totems of Volskygge&lt;/a&gt;\", which is on a pedestal near the north end of the room. The riddle goes as follows:\n\"The first fears all,\" the second fears none.\n\"The third eats what it can,\"\npreferably number one.\n\"The fourth fears the second,\"\nbut only when alone.\n\"All must be activated in order,\"\nif you wish to go home\".\"\nSolution\nSnake, Bear, Fox, Wolf.\nThe Snake fears all, \nThe Bear fears none.\nThe Fox eats what it can, \nPreferably the Snake.\nThe Wolf fears the Bear, \nBut only when it's separated from its pack.\nContinuing through the newly opened door, there is a spiral staircase down, a chest, and a lever on the left-side wall of the northern-most alcove that opens a secret passage to a room with minor loot that is protected by a poison dart trap. Proceeding down the wooden spiral stairs and through the short passage leads to a door to the next area.\nVolskygge Passages.\nThe corridor beyond the door leads down stairs and into a room with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, and urns containing random loot. The lever next to the soul gem stand just opens a set of iron bars to a small alcove. Behind the iron door to the north is a room with a draugr. There is a chest to the right in the back - it is booby trapped, but can be disarmed. On the altar, there are two soul gems and a &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20Tail\"&gt;skeever tail&lt;/a&gt;. The iron bars to the west are opened by activating the lever on the wall to the right. The room beyond has a grate over a pit, and just beyond, a pressure plate that activates a pendulum axe.\nIn the next room is a trap door that opens on a pit with spikes, but which has wooden platforms that can be jumped between to get to the bottom safely. At the bottom, there is a lone draugr to fight. Proceeding to the south, the passage turns to the west, then proceeds up stairs to a room where there are three draugr and several side alcoves with crypts. To the north from there is a passage that leads back to the room with the trap door.\nIn the room with the trap door, there is a dead bandit. On the wall hidden behind her, there is a lever that opens to a room with another lever that will close the first wall and open a second. In this room, there is an adept locked chest and a healing potion on a pedestal. Once the potion is removed, spikes will come up from the floor, so it is best to approach the pedestal with the potion from behind.\nBack in the room with the three draugr, to the south is a spiked gate trap, behind which is an apprentice-locked chest. The path turns to the right (west), where two more draugr are found. The path turns north, then opens up into a large square room with a large column in the center and crypts all around. There are multiple draugr here.\nUp the stairs is another powerful draugr, and a third burial chamber. There is a live draugr in a crypt on the right which can be attacked before it awakens. Through the open iron doors straight ahead, there is another &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Scourge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr scourge&lt;/a&gt;. On the altar, there are three health related potions.\nBack through the iron doors, to the right (west), there is a staircase leading up. In the middle of the staircase, there is a pressure plate that releases a battering ram. In some cases, it will take out the draugr on top of the stairs. The path continues up to the west, then becomes a cave that winds around, with eleven &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; along the way before reaching their nest. Once in their nest, the path continues through a narrow corridor. After cutting one spider web that blocks the path, there are four more frostbite spiders. The path continues up, requiring cutting through several more spider webs. Eventually, the rough cave reverts to a regular dungeon again.\nAt the top of the stairs is a booby trapped chest that can be disarmed, or else it's best to be on its left side to avoid the battering ram. The path turns right (south) and proceeds down a ramp. In the room straight ahead, there is a room with two arched bridges across a stream, plus three draugr.\nThe river flows out through a passage to the right. At the end of the passage is an orichalcum ore vein and a chest.\nBack in the room with the stream, there are stairs leading up to the south, and then another set up to the left (east). At the top of those stairs is a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Death%20Overlord\"&gt;draugr death overlord&lt;/a&gt; sitting on a throne. After having dealt with him, the room should be looted. The path continues up the stairs behind the throne to a door to Volskygge Peak.\nVolskygge Peak.\nVolskygge Peak is, as its name states, the peak of the &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. At Volskygge Peak, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will encounter the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Volsung\"&gt;Volsung&lt;/a&gt;. Volsung will drop\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Volsung%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;Volsung's Mask&lt;/a&gt;, one of the eight dragon priest\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;masks&lt;/a&gt;. The only other notable sight at Volskygge Peak is the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt;, player can also find two Emeralds located straight in front of the word wall, next to the eagle scultpture.\nIt is possible to bypass the entire dungeon (except Volsung) to get straight to the Whirlwind Sprint word wall by climbing the mountain which works best with a horse.\nOut of the door and immediately to the left is a large set of stairs leading to a word of power for the Whirlwind Sprint &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; and the dragon priest Volsung. Once Volsung is dead, his mask should be taken to complete Volskygge."}

If the book was missed, the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Silenced%20Tongues\"&gt;Silenced Tongues&lt;/a&gt;\" can be started by simply toggling the inactivated door.\nInside the Cairn, down the path is a Draugr archer on the platform above. After he is dispatched quickly, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will have to fight 3\u20134 leveled Draugr and &lt;a href=\"Kvenel%20the%20Tongue\"&gt;Kvenel the Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, a particularly tough enemy who can summon &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost atronachs&lt;/a&gt; and wields two unique weapons; &lt;a href=\"Eduj\"&gt;Eduj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Okin\"&gt;Okin&lt;/a&gt;, both of which can be looted off of his corpse when defeated.\nAfter the fight there is a chest with random leveled loot and a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; containing one of the words for the &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt;. To the right (north) of the wall is a path leading up over a bridge towards a small room with a few urns. On the left of the bridge there is another chest on a ledge to be looted. It can be reached by walking carefully around the small ledge jutting out from the rock pillar, or by using the shout &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; from the bridge. Once finished, the Volunruud main room can be used to exit."}

The only serious reply came from &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Oitos\"&gt;Magister Oitos&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"School%20of%20Julianos\"&gt;School of Julianos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith help of the Magister, Vondham managed to locate a Nymph grotto somewhere at &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;.

At first, it was a whisper, but has become a roar inside my skull. The seeds of strife and violence plague this land, the soil enriched by the blood of battle. \"Tamriel will soon be ripe again for the taking, for my vengeance is at hand\", the voice says to me.\nI must heed his voice. What must I do, my Lord?\n12th Mid Year, 4E 200\nI have spent countless hours, countless days in prayer to Dagon and have heard nothing. I finally took rest, and had another dream. Dreams of fire and smoke. Heat upon heat. I was descending into a cavern, further and further down. The heat began to cook and blister my skin.\nBut I kept moving, ever downward. Fire and smoke, heat and rock. And then I saw it. The very mouth of Dagon. An &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gates\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith a blinding flash I then began to have visions of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, visions of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. What could be the meaning of this?\nI awoke, covered in sweat, and with a deep sense of purpose. I feel drawn eastward. I must heed the call.\n15th Sun's Height, 4E 200\nDagon has me to a cavern, deep within the &lt;a href=\"Velothi%20Mountains\"&gt;Velothi Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. His worshippers used to gather there. I feel their presence. I feel his power.\nAn Oblivion Gate is buried here. I can feel it.\nIt is my destiny to reach it. I will spend night and day with pickaxe in hand until it is freed from this prison of stone.\n6th Hearthfire 4E 200\nFor nearly two months I have toiled, digging deeper and deeper, stopping only to rest. Stone by stone, inching ever closer to my destiny. Ever closer to the fires of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOthers have begun to heed Dagon's call, and have found their way here, to me, to our Lord. We are the high priests of the new order, the chosen few who are attuned to his will.\nAs we traverse deeper, the remnants of an ancient &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; temple are revealed like diamond from the rock.\nPriest Vitus was the first to discover the gate's stone. My ecstasy was short lived, however, when I found like every other gate, it had been destroyed. Still, I could feel its power like heat against my skin. Many other pieces like this are scattered throughout the lands of Skyrim. Buried deep. Lost to time. We shall find them. We shall open the jaws of Oblivion once again.\n4th Morning Star 4E 201\nVisions of Dragons cloud my dreams once more. Images of &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; and Akatosh that make my blood burn with anger and vengeance. Black wings unfurling against a red sky.\nI do not yet understand the meaning of these visions, but Dagon's hatred has become a burning coal in the pit of my stomach, driving me ever forward.\n21st Second Seed 4E 201\nOver the last several months, we have searched the deepest reaches of Skyrim, and have retrieved enough remnants of the various shattered Oblivion Gates to make one whole again. It's very presence inspires power, awe, and reverence.\nA pact must now be made. Dagon requires that each of us offer a personal sacrifice, a blood offering to prove our dedication. With each soul cast into Oblivion, his power grows.\nThe Liminal Barrier is weak here, and the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;turmoil and conflict&lt;/a&gt; boiling in the lands only weakens it further. I must now summon a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Lord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora Lord&lt;/a&gt; to acquire a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, and find a way to open the gate.\n10th Sun's Height 4E 201\nI have performed the rites as dictated in &lt;a href=\"Liminal%20Bridges\"&gt;Liminal Bridges&lt;/a&gt;, and successfully penetrated the barrier into the realm of Oblivion, but my attempts to use the gate as a vessel of trans-liminal attunement have failed. The portal to Oblivion is thin and temporary, as one might expect. I have smelled the sweet sulfur of the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, but only for fleeting moments of time.\nI have studied all there is to know about the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;. I have been to &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; on countless occasions to observe its last remaining page. Yet the necessary piece has remained a mystery.\nAs I pray for Dagon for guidance and confer with his &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, I understand now that a Sigil Stone is simply not powerful enough on its own. Something stronger may be required to open the gate. But what kind of artifact could hold such power?\nI have dispatched the most loyal of my disciples to all corners of Tamriel to search for any artifact or source of power worthy of becoming the key to Oblivion. I must remain patient and trust Dagon's will.\n20th Sun's Height, 4E 201\nI have received word from my scouts that a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt; may be hidden within Rielle, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt;. Could this be the source of power needed to open the gate? It very well may be. How delicious the irony - an object once &lt;a href=\"Miscarcand%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;used against Dagon&lt;/a&gt; becoming the very thing that unleashes his power back into the mortal realm.\nMy scouts are working diligently to uncover any further information they can. And as I continue to pray to Dagon for guidance, his voice says to me \"Patience, all shall be revealed in time.\"\n2nd Last Seed, 4E 201\nCurse the &lt;a href=\"Vigilants%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Vigil of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. They have blocked the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, making access to Rielle an impossibility. We cannot risk exposing our plans. We must find another way.\nIf we cannot make our way to Cyrodiil by road, we will do so by force directly through the mountains. We have done it once to get to this sacred place, and we shall do it again. I have dispatched a team to begin excavation immediately.\n14th Last Seed, 4E 201\nFevered visions haunt my dreams once more, and as the time draws near I now understand what must be done.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; Prophecy foretells a chosen one will come forth, their blood and soul blessed by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; himself. The &lt;a href=\"Dovahkiin\"&gt;Dovahkiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Time%20Wound\"&gt;Time Wound&lt;/a&gt; will open and &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin the World Eater&lt;/a&gt; shall also return.\nThough both are fragments of Akatosh's soul, these two will &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;wage war against one another&lt;/a&gt;. And as children of Akatosh they will reap the vengeance of Mehrunes Dagon.\nBut pain and suffering nor death will satisfy. Only the ultimate betrayal will suffice...\nTo open the Oblivion Gate, a ritual of the highest order must be designed. An artifact of untold power must be corrupted, a great sacrifice made, and above all the Dragonborn must become the unwitting instrument of Dagon's will.\nI will become the sacrifice, the final step. And as the Dragonborn takes my life with blade in one hand and Great Welkynd Stone in the other, they will complete the ritual and become the very key to opening the gate.\nThis ultimate betrayal will shatter the Liminal Barrier, opening the Oblivion Gate and giving Dagon a foothold into the mortal realm while he rebuilds his armies.\nIt is a divine plan beyond anything I could have comprehended. The world will be bathed in the fires of Oblivion, and the blood of mortals will be on the hands of Akatosh.\nNone can be made aware of this plan. It is too fragile, too perfect.\n17th Last Seed, 4E 201\nIt has begun. &lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Alduin has returned&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkorvild has been missing for several days. After witnessing his brother being sacrificed, his spirit broke and he deserted the order, just as I planned.\nHe will &lt;a href=\"Stranger%27s%20Plea\"&gt;seek out the Dragonborn for help&lt;/a&gt;. And once his role has been fulfilled, he will be slaughtered.\nThe Dragonborn in their arrogance will continue to be the embodiment of ambition, much to Dagon's pleasure. They will no doubt seek to obtain the Great Welkynd Stone. They will then return to me. And when they do, the final act of the ritual will begin.\nPriestess Enakain has been taken captive by the Vigil of Stendarr, but she too serves a greater purpose. Her spirit will not break, but she will lead the Vigil where they need to be to aid the Dragonborn. Where they will utterly fall, the Dovahkiin will succeed.\nTheir success will be short lived. The Sigil Stone has been destroyed, ensuring the gate will remain open. Moreover, two of Dagon's &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Valkynaz%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora Valkynaz&lt;/a&gt;, Gatanas and Methas, are waiting in the Deadlands to lead to assault. They are the heralds of the coming siege, and through their works we will unleash a scourge of torment upon our Lord's enemies.\nThe dawn is breaking."}

We're here today because some of you ugly runts have been complaining about a lack of \"honor\" in the arena, or some ox-piss like that. Look at you\u2014a bunch of tuskless whelps with your heads up your arses! It's probably a waste of time, but I'm going to try to pound some hard-earned knowledge into your thick skulls.\nHonor. Bah! Let me tell you something about honor. Honor is the excuse that little orphans use to explain why their dear-old pa got sloppy and allowed some Wood Elf to kill him with a stone knife! Honor is the shield that covers your ego and leaves your arse hanging out in the wind to get pierced by an arrow! Honor is a brave Orc's worst enemy. The sooner you shake those chains off, the better chance you'll have in a fight.\nCombat is about one thing and one thing only\u2014killing that other dumb bastard before he kills you. That means using your head, looking for weaknesses, finding gaps in the armor. Trust me when I tell you, honor is a big damn gap in the armor.\nFirst thing's first\u2014if I ever see any of you whelps bow to an opponent, I'll beat you senseless. I say let that other bastard bow. The second your opponent looks down, you knock his teeth out with a knee to the jaw.\nNever let your opponent see. Dirt, snow, a flick of blood\u2014just as useful as any axe and usually readily available. If you haven't flung something into your opponent's face before your second weapon swing, you're doing it wrong.\nAlways, always, always go for the crotch. Two or three times. A good kick in the nethers can make an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; weep like a &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; girl who lost her favorite dolly.\nNever stop talking\u2014and I don't mean pleasant conversation over tea and crumpets! You should be jawing about their ugly mothers, and their sister's creaky bed, and their father's yellow belly. It's best if you know these folks by name. It also helps a lot if what you're saying contains a ring of truth. And it's not enough to just say it\u2014you've got to mean it! Angry fighters make mistakes, and mistakes will make it easier for you to kill them.\nIf you can't chop, kick. If you can't kick, punch. If you can't punch, bite. If you can't bite\u2014well, if you can't bite, you probably did something stupid.\nAll right, that's enough for now. By &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;, I don't know why I even bother sometimes. Just adjust your nethers and get back to work!"}

Even when the Dragonborn gives him better light armor boots, he refuses to wear them. However, he wears any &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy armor boots&lt;/a&gt; deposited in his inventory. &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;Boots of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; are an exception to this, as he will wear them. If given the Boots of the Old Gods and heavy armor boots, he equips the Boots of the Old Gods. This is common with some other followers. After the Dragonborn has given Vorstag a better bow, sometimes he still chooses to use his default Hunting Bow.\nMarriage.\nAfter hiring Vorstag, one can wear an Amulet of Mara and speak to him to bring up the courtship dialogue:\n\"Is that an Amulet of Mara? I'm surprised that someone like you isn't spoken for.\"\nInterested in me, are you? \"Well, yes. I mean, why wouldn't I be? Are you... interested in me?\"\nIf the Dragonborn marries Vorstag, he suggests they move into his house (the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt;) after the ceremony. If the Dragonborn agrees to move in with him, they have to rent a room to receive the &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Skyrim%29%23Blessings\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lover%27s%20Comfort\"&gt;Lover's Comfort&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nVorstag \"The Jarl is refusing to dispatch men to the front lines.

Dratha soon fell ill and had &lt;a href=\"Savarak%20Fels\"&gt;Master Savarak Fels&lt;/a&gt; continue leading Vos in her place. Savarak imposed heavy taxes on the people of Vos and ruled with an iron fist. The people of Vos were oppressed, and Dratha's Mouth, &lt;a href=\"Llayne%20Sadri\"&gt;Llayne Sadri&lt;/a&gt; was investigating the situation. Llayne Sadri asked an Outlander called the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to help her and learn about Savarak's suspiciously sudden wealth. The Vestige learned that Savarak was tasked by &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; to poison Dratha and have Vos and Tel Mora become Hlaalu Territory. Savarak poisoned the roots of Tel Mora to hurt Dratha and planned to escape Vos from &lt;a href=\"Selvil%20Island\"&gt;Selvil Island&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige rescued Tel Mora and defeated Savarak. Bringing Dratha back to power in the process.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nVos was a well-established settlement in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; came to fruition. Not much can be said about Vos, but due to Vos' insignificance to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, it is not focused on in &lt;a href=\"Almsivi%20Intervention\"&gt;Almsivi Intervention&lt;/a&gt;. The leader of Vos was &lt;a href=\"Master%20Aryon\"&gt;Master Aryon&lt;/a&gt;, and he ruled from &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;, located in the west of Vos.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of Vvardenfell erupts, and the resulting lava flows destroyed all of Vvardenfell's life and cities. Many settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;, and Vos were destroyed in the midst of the eruption. A &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; councilman from &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt; decided to start a relief effort to rebuild the settlements on Vvardenfell including Vos. As of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown whether this relief effort was completed or not."}

But before Malacath, at least according to certain traditions and a few noted scholars, there was &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;, a newly emerged movement that seems to be gaining in numbers and popularity, promises to take Orcs back to the roots of who and what they are as a people. To reclaim the glory of the warrior god Trinimac and restore the Orcs to their proper position in the world.\nIs it any wonder that this new religion has found adherents among those who have accepted the idea of a reborn &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;? For its beliefs and tenets seem tailor-made for the vision of a united &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. The Vosh Rakh claim they want to \"civilize\" the wild and riotous nature of the Orcs. They want to elevate the Orcs, to place them on the same level as the other races\u2014or perhaps even to set them higher. And they want to rebuild the ancient city of Orsinium, setting it as the jewel in the crown of a new and powerful Orc nation. That said, although &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt; has provided support for the new faith in Trinimac, going so far as to establish a temple in Orsinium, he appears to have no connection to the more-extremist followers of the Vosh Rakh.\nWho are the Vosh Rakh? That's not an easy question to answer. For every member of the movement keeps his or her identity secret, and when they come together to celebrate or pray, they wear golden masks of Orcish visages patterned after Trinimac's own auric-tinged skin. The name itself translates from the Orcish tongue as \"Blade of Courage\" and refers to Trinimac's legendary weapon, Penitent. They see themselves as Trinimac's sword made manifest, cutting a new path through the ancient and stifling traditions that\u2014as they put it\u2014have \"held back the Orsimer people for untold generations.\"\nMany among the Orcish old guard see the Vosh Rakh as either a foolish fad that will soon fade away or as dangerous fanatics who will stop at nothing to destroy the Orcish way of life. Either way, the old guard refuses to be swayed by the arguments and the promises. They won't abandon the traditions that make Orcs\u2014as they put it\u2014\"strong and powerful and better than any puny Elf.\" They hold fast to the concept of the stronghold and the clan, rejecting the call to create a single Orc nation. They maintain the grudge, for ill will and resentment fuel the fire in their bellies and the anger in their hearts. And they maintain their steadfast faith in Malacath, god of curses and the betrayed, for he blesses them with conflict and the bloody Code of Malacath.\nBut the Vosh Rakh see the old guard as simply another challenge that Trinimac will help them overcome. Malacath, they claim, is nothing more than a weak and vengeful pretender trying to steal Trinimac's glory. Once the Orcs accept Trinimac and come together as a united people, then Trinimac will bless them with aid and succor in every battle set before them\u2014from the battle to rebuild Orsinium, to the war against the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, and to fighting for honor and prestige among the other races, Trinimac will bring victory and glory to all.\nEnd Note: At the time of this writing, rumors have begun to circulate claiming that the Vosh Rakh has begun using deceitful, even deadly, tactics in their battle to win the hearts and minds of the Orcs. I have yet to substantiate these rumors as anything more than the angry words of members of the old guard, but I thought I should include them here. I will attempt to learn more and record my findings in a latter volume."}

He is the main antagonist in the and books. He is also best known for constructing the Ingenium\u2014a device which kept the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; afloat. He was Sul's friend until they faced in the Ministry of Truth and Sul destroyed the Ingenium.\nPhysical appearance.\nHe appeared to be a Dunmer of average size, his gray hair pulled back in a long queue. He wore a sort of loose umber robe with wide sleeves and black slippers. His eyes weren\u2019t red, like a Dunmer's; the orbs where milky white and the surrounds black.\nBackground.\nVuhon's Ingenium needed souls to run correctly. &lt;a href=\"Ezhmaar%20Sul\"&gt;Ezhmaar Sul&lt;/a&gt;'s wife,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ilzheven\"&gt;Ilzheven&lt;/a&gt;, was chosen to power the Ingenium. Vuhon claimed that her souls was of an appropriate type and could fuel it for months. However, Sul thought that Ilzheven had been chosen because she loved Sul and not Vuhon. Sul tried to rescue her, but damaged the Ingenium in the process, causing the Ministry of Truth to crash into &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Sul and Vuhon were trapped in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, from which Vuhon managed to get out of by striking a deal with Umbra, a sentient being that split from Clavicus Vile. His life would be spared, but he would have to create a new Ingenium, which needed to be able to escape Clavicus Vile's realm. This new Ingenium was put to use, and allowed for their escape from the realm. It tore a piece of Oblivion out in the process, which was later called Umbriel. Vuhon made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Hierem\"&gt;Hierem&lt;/a&gt; to summon Umbriel into &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Hierem performed a ritual in &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; tree.\n&lt;a href=\"Umbriel%20Crisis\"&gt;Umbriel Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\n43 years after Vuhon disappeared into Clavicus Vile's realm, Umbriel managed to escape from Vile's realm. It appeared in the south-east of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Umbriel headed directly to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; in order to find Umbra, the only thing that could stop Umbriel. An army of undead that followed Umbriel by land razed everything that got in Umbriel's path, supplying Umbriel with the souls needed.\nWhen Umbriel arrived at Vivec City, the zombies discovered Attrebus and Sul searching for Umbra. Vuhon teleported Sul and Attrebus to his presence. They had a conversation about what had happened 43 years ago. Vuhon needed the power of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; to completely break free Umbriel from Vile's influence. He proposed Attrebus to set him free if he convinved his father to surrender the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.\nSul managed to free himself, and he attacked Vuhon. While Vuhon was distracted with Sul, Attrebus approached him from behind with &lt;a href=\"Flashing\"&gt;Flashing&lt;/a&gt; unsheathed. Vuhon discovered Attrebus and the tendrils that had trapped him before became rigid again. Sul grabbed Attrebus and they escaped from Umbriel.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhel\"&gt;Lord Rhel&lt;/a&gt; organized a tasting where the best four kitchens of Umbriel competed. The winner would prepare a meal for Lord Umbriel. After &lt;a href=\"Toel\"&gt;Toel&lt;/a&gt;'s death, &lt;a href=\"Anna%C3%AFg\"&gt;Anna\u00efg&lt;/a&gt; took the lead of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Irrel\"&gt;Lord Irrel&lt;/a&gt;'s kitchen. She won the tasting, and she was promoted to chef. She prepared a meal for Lord Umbriel heavily influenced by the Dunmeri cuisine. Vuhon was very pleased by the meal. They talked about her life in Tamriel. Vuhon asked her to kill &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt;, who had organized a rebellion among the &lt;a href=\"skraw\"&gt;skraw&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVuhon had a meeting with Hierem just before arriving at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. When Hierem teleported back to his chambers, Attrebus and Sul were in turn teleported to Umbriel. Sul stabbed him with &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;, but the blade didn't damage Vuhon. In the mean time, Anna\u00efg had poisoned the trees from Umbriel, weakening Vuhon.\nAttrebus and Sul escaped from Vuhon. They meet Anna\u00efg, who told them about the poison. Vuhon had to absorb Rhel and three other lords to keep going on in his body and find the venom\u2019s mother. &lt;a href=\"Mere-Glim\"&gt;Mere-Glim&lt;/a&gt; guided Attrebus and Sul to the Ingenium, Umbriel's soul. Sul tried to destroy it with Umbra, but Vuhon stopped him. Umbra fell to the floor, and Attrebus jumped to catch it. Vuhon tried to stop him, but Attrebus was faster than him. Sul managed to take back the sword from Attrebus. Glim pulled Attrebus and Sul to the bottom of the sump. Sul fainted due to the pressure of the water, so Attrebus drew Umbra from the sheath on Sul\u2019s back and stabbed the the door that lead to the Ingenium. Once they were inside the room where the Ingenium was stored, Vuhon tried to stop Attrebus, but he was fast enough to stab the Ingenium.\nUmbra (the being) possessed Vuhon's body. Umbra offered Sul power, but Sul wasn't interested in anything but revenge. Umbra throttled Sul, but after a time, Umbra (the sword) finished destroying the ingenium and Umbra was snaked back away from Vuhon's body into the blade. Vuhon told Attrebus that if they killed him Umbriel would fall into the Imperial City. However, Mere-Glim now had the power to remove the flying city from Tamriel. Attrebus spared Vuhon's life, and Umbriel travelled to the &lt;a href=\"Realm%20of%20the%20Hist\"&gt;Realm of the Hist&lt;/a&gt;."}

Two focusing Crystals are missing to repair the automaton he has, who he believes can open the entrance and he asks the Soulless One to assist in finding them.\nFollow the markers to find the crystals, fight the creatures attacking and then return to the entrance to speak with Neramo. He is delighted and starts to repair the automaton and the rod that controls it. Then he performs a demonstration for the Soulless One to watch and observe. He sends it off to open the door.\nEnter the ruin with Neramo, and he asks for another favor. He suspects the usual defenses are in place and as he is averse to danger could they help him repair the Dwemer generators inside. After accepting the task he gives the control rod to them and explains how it works. The automatom needs to be escorted to the each generator so it can repair them.\nEscort the automaton to the generators, and meet up with Neramo after it's done in the central chamber of the ruin. He is once again delighted and that Bthzark breathes again. Then he asks for a more personal project that will give more coin in reward. He explains he accepted the request from Bhosek to explore the ruins as he knew there where something inside he believes others have died trying to obtain.\nKnowledge is the greates tresure, The Dwemer guarded their secrets very well and hid a set of schematisc, mechanical drawings that he greatly desire to possess. If they find anyone of those earlier explorers they might have the schematics nearby.\nEnter the assembly chamber with Neramo and fight the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spiders&lt;/a&gt; on the way, passing some skeletons and finally the last skeleton deep inside. Beside him is the Dwemer Schematics. Pick it up and head outside to find Neramo.\nHe pretends he was just on his way to find them and asks if the Vestige found the schematics. Give them to him and he is ecstatic and says that this places him in their debt. He asks if there is something he can do in return, and he is intrigued as he heard &lt;a href=\"Kaleen\"&gt;Kaleen&lt;/a&gt; was on her way to &lt;a href=\"Betnikh\"&gt;Betnikh&lt;/a&gt;, then he can do some research on the ruins there but he promise to help with the heist first.

In case you've been living in an &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt; since the dawn of recorded history, involvement with Dagon and his ilk is frowned upon quite fiercely by most populations of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Having this book or its companion volume in your possession could earn you suspicion from your neighbors as well as agents of the law. In many districts worship of the Master of &lt;a href=\"Mehrune%27s%20Razor\"&gt;Razors&lt;/a&gt; is illegal, and communion rituals involving the Daedric Prince are punishable by death.\nAmongst even the Daedric Princes, none are more openly concerned with the suffering of mortals. Whenever Dagon appears he leaves destruction in his wake, and contact with the Master of Razors often results in death for the conjurer\u2014along with everyone in the vicinity. Sudden floods, thunderstorms, and other natural disasters all over Tamriel have been tied to communions with Mehrunes Dagon, and the most detailed account I've read about occurred in &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hranvard%20Frostfinger\"&gt;Hranvard Frostfinger&lt;/a&gt;, a witch of Eastmarch, is said to have sacrificed thirteen innocents to Dagon in a single night, prompting the Daedric Prince to briefly open a portal from the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The only witnesses were members of the &lt;a href=\"Direfrost%20Family\"&gt;Direfrost family&lt;/a&gt;, a clan of witch-hunters, who managed to find and slay Hranvard. Immediately following, they came under a mysterious and brutal attack themselves. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Yllothon\"&gt;Yllothon&lt;/a&gt;, was the only survivor, who later wrote in his memoirs:\n\"We followed the stench of burning flesh for a half-mile, and we caught up to (Hranvard) at nightfall, by the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. She lay cackling among her thirteen victims, whose bodies had been stacked in a mass grave, encircled by spidery writing. Slaying her was an easy task\u2014all it took was a single silver bolt. But when the deed was done, the air suddenly began to boil and crack. Fearing some residual spell, I had my men retreat up the nearest pass, where we watched the snow below catch fire, and the sky split apart with flame. We turned to flee, but it was too late. Fire poured from the wound in the air and engulfed my thirty men. I tried to help them but the flames wouldn't die, and wouldn't burn my flesh. A voice bellowed from the burning maw above, 'You will suffer better among the living.'\"\nMany, including members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, are skeptical of Yllothon's story, respected as he was amongst the Direfrost hunters. They found no sign of Mehrunes Dagon at the Sea of Ghosts\u2014save the blasted, mirrored sand. Obviously, the Direfrosts disagree: there was still the matter of thirty missing hunters. The Direfrosts have since intensified their war against the covens of Eastmarch.\nThe Mages Guild, however, has struck the event from their records of note, citing the blasted sand at the Sea of Ghosts as a meteorological phenomenon. But I believed Yllothon was correct; I was there, as a senior advisor on the party that surveyed that beach.\nVolume II of this collection contains a detailed account of everything I found at the Sea of Ghosts, including half of the \"spidery circle\" that Yllothon describes. Any aspiring conjurer who wants a chance at contacting Mehrunes Dagon should follow me there."}

If the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; aids the college, the ban on the festival is lifted by Elisif, who instead institutes that the Burning becomes a weekly festival.\nQuests.\nThe quest begins inside the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Location%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Viarmo\"&gt;Viarmo&lt;/a&gt; (same person who asks the Last Dragonborn to return a book from the bard in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;). Upon speaking to him, the Dragonborn is given a dialog option to ask for admission to the college. He then tells the story of &lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;King Olaf's Verse&lt;/a&gt;, which was thought to be lost when Olaf ordered the copies destroyed. However, one copy is suspected to be with the bard at &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Men%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Dead Men's Respite&lt;/a&gt;.

This also might be because the ash wastes they call home have far better visibility than the dense forests normal spriggans prefer, allowing them to keep their foes well in sight. When they reach critical health instead of regaining health after collapsing they explode with rolling fire continuously similar to the way a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flame atronach&lt;/a&gt; does upon death. If allowed, they will revive, though it takes a few more seconds and they do not have the added benefit of increased defense, hence the need for the rolling fire explosions.\nUnlike their regular counterparts, burnt spriggans display fire resistance."}

If persuaded, he will say that there is a ghost down there that thinks he is her lover, and who gives him all of these things. Either way, he will show you the door, and perform a ritual to open it using a poem on an enchanted sword. Head inside and talk to Jurak-dar there. He will tell you that to remove the barrier here, you need to recite poetry, like he did to open the door.

After giving it to him, he will go up to her and speak with her, and they will both ascend into &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with Jurak-dar hereafter to finish the quest."}

Instead, head over near the Old Attius Farm Cellar trap door and wait past midnight. It should be unlocked and the Buyer will be down there by himself at first.

The text itself can not really be interpreted as \"canon,\" more so it attempts to persuade the reader to deconstruct the idea of canon entirely. The story was also designed to address several of the mysterious concepts introduced in some of Kirkbride's earlier works, as well as in .\nC0DA is set in the far distant future of the late Fifth Era, where an apocalyptic event known as &lt;a href=\"Landfall\"&gt;Landfall&lt;/a&gt; has forced the remaining inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; to take refuge on the moon &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;. The story centers around the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; noble, &lt;a href=\"Jubal-lun-Sul\"&gt;Jubal-lun-Sul&lt;/a&gt;, who seeks the means to shepherd his people to a safe world, away from Landfall. His actions eventually culminate with the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; and his marriage to &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, making way for the birth of a new universe.\nThe original content of the book is accessible from the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//archive.org/details/TES_C0da/page/n1/mode/1up\"&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nC0DA's background is introduced in the text \"&lt;a href=\"Loveletter%20From%20the%20Fifth%20Era%2C%20The%20True%20Purpose%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Loveletter From the Fifth Era, The True Purpose of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\", which brings some insight into a few aspects of C0DA's lore, most importantly the concept of the \"Amaranth.\" The Amaranth is a state that lies beyond all existence and the means to create a brand new universe; it was designed to present the natural \"end-point\" of the Elder Scrolls mythology.\nC0DA's timeline officially begins with a currently unreleased text known as \"Dies Irae,\" said to feature a catastrophe resulting in the death of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon%23Reclamations\"&gt;Three Good Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. It continues with the short text, \"The Prophet of Landfall,\" which depicts the arrival of the Numidium and the very beginning of Landfall. It is heavily implied that the Numidium's return was caused by its siege of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; which lasted from the \"&lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt; until long into the Fifth.\" The Prophet of Landfall is followed by another unreleased text referred to as \"Stringendo,\" which progresses into the partially released text \"Landfall: Day One.\" This text depicts the events leading up to the refugees escaping Nirn on a ship known as the Wonderweir, including the erasure of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; race and the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;'s confrontation with the Numidium, utilizing &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt;. The subsequent and final text is C0DA itself, bringing a hypothetical end and new beginning to the Elder Scrolls lore.\nPlot.\nSometime well into the Fifth Era, a catastrophic event known as Landfall has forced the surviving inhabitants of Nirn to take refuge under the surface of the moon, Masser. Those refugees who escaped from Morrowind have reformed a sprawling new community known as Ald Sotha in the Velothiid, also known as Morrowind 2, built from the burrows of titanic worms. The winds on the moon's surface make it too hazardous to traverse. When the winds die down during periods referred to as \"Landfall Season,\" all inhabitants of Velothiid are permitted to make pilgrimage to the moon's surface. However, the dangers of the journey deter most people from taking it, and because of this, many have forgotten where they originally came from. The narrative opens on Jubal-lun-Sul, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; noble of the old salt-merchant House Sul, a bloodline said to be registered by C0DA. He is overlooking from the balcony of his under-manor, reminiscing about his first pilgrimage and consultation with Memory and the Wheels of Lull.\nThe setting flashes back to the year 5E 892 during the 88th Landfall Season. Jubal-lun-Sul travels with his wealthy friend, &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; Hir, through a worm tunnel on what is to be his first pilgrimage to the moon's surface. Jubal appears sheepish and slightly anxious, while Hir, who has clearly made the pilgrimage before, is much more optimistic. Upon exiting the tunnel, they look upon the remains of Nirn, now the Wheels of Lull, an interlocking skeleton of fiery debris, gears and other mechanical apparatus, as well as what appear to be incomprehensible mathematical equations.\nBack to the present day, Hir visits Jubal at his under-manor, and Jubal appears hesitant to share the results of his marriage proposal to the High Alma. Hir, a busy man, and in a hurry, demands he spit out the news. To Hlaalu Hir's astonishment, Jubal excitedly states that the High Alma had agreed to allow him to marry her daughter. Hir, both cheerful and confused, wonders how Jubal managed to convince the High Alma to agree to a marriage so far outside of her caste. Confirming Hir's suspicions, Jubal states that there is a catch, that he must hunt a specific thing to prove his worth. Given it is Sacrifice Season, Hir believes the High Alma has sent him on a suicidal pursuit to kill a Worm. Jubal denies this and states his actual target was picked by Memory, that he must hunt and kill the Numidium, a notion Hir finds amusingly ludicrous.\nJubal-lun-Sul and Hlaalu Hir travel together to a corner club owned by Hir. Sitting in a booth, Jubal says he needs a \"cat,\" a request that Hir is reluctant to fulfill but eventually gives into. A skinny &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; comes to their table and hands over a bag of &lt;a href=\"Skooma\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt;, on the house, which Jubal smokes from a pipe. Jubal then perceives himself back in the Velothiid Worm tunnels, though different from before. He is greeted by the ghostly Wheels of Lull, with \"women's eyes\" appearing within its cogs.\nJubal and Hir eventually find themselves walking through a multi-leveled marketplace in Ald Sotha, privately overseen by Hir's family, for reasons concerning Jubal's marriage. The friends are interrupted by two mysterious ghost-like apparitions in the form of fingers, referred to as the \"Digitals.\" The Digitals point at Jubal accusingly, seemingly frightening the market's crowd into hiding. Something glows to the left of Jubal, but he pays no mind, instead telling the Digitals to quiet down, as their loud noises are distressing the pedestrians. While Hir attempts to turn Jubal's attention to the growing light to his side, in which the people are truly hiding from, the Digitals accuse Jubal of trying to be a condescending groom. Jubal asserts he is merely shopping for a weapon, to which the glowing light reveals itself to be Vivec, who states that he may be able to help him.\nThe story flashes back to old &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, designated Morrowind (0) during Eras now erased. Jubal begins to monologue over the fabled life of Vivec. He states that a youthful Vivec, alongside his friends &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, discovered a hidden cave with a &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;special stone&lt;/a&gt; that gave them powers that they used to chase away &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;. Switching now to a different story of Vivec's legendary origins, designated Morrowind (1), Vivec is now a teenager leading a gang of guttersnipes in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. He is visited by a masked soldier of the extinct &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar, who sees something special within Vivec. Vivec eventually becomes a general of House Indoril and drives out a horde of demonic Ash monsters; where it is said that he fought so well he became a god.\nThe next fable, one known well by the people of Velothiid, is set in a land known as \"Tomorrowind,\" also dated to an erased Era. The people of the comic book styled Neo-Victorian Tomorrowind are being terrorized by strange figures with television sets for heads, transforming their victims to match their odd appearance. &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;, depicted as a camera-wielding journalist, runs from these monsters and calls for Vivec on his wristwatch. Vivec arrives and picks up Alandro with &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;; they meet up with the members of the \"Pseudo-6th-House,\" Almalexia, Sotha Sil, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, all seemingly presented in a satirical grasp on real-life Superhero comics. Alandro Sul recommends that they get Nerevar for help, to which Vivec responds saying \"Ha. which one.\" The group descends into an inter-dimensional tunnel made of liquid video in order to find the Intellective, a bionic brain-headed despot from the future, revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Yagrum%20Bagarn\"&gt;Yagrum Bagarn&lt;/a&gt;. The Intellective is accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; scientists, who are upgrading their master. Alandro Sul, shocked by the current situation, wonders whether the Intellective is making another Numidium, to which Vivec replies that he's buying one instead.\nJubal is shown sitting in his study; he breaks away from the Tomorrowind story, stating that after the return of Numidium, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;time stopped making sense&lt;/a&gt; and the inhabitants of Tomorrowind were forced to live inside the moon in an event known as Landfall. However, Jubal believes he has found a way to escape from Landfall. He also believes his ancestor, Alandro Sul, knew how to escape too.\nThe setting returns to Tomorrowind, in a reminiscent documentation of the whole ordeal. Alandro Sul narrates his memories of Vivec and the Pseudo-Sixth House, praising them as \"super-people\" capable of doing the impossible to save the world. He concludes by saying that he can't imagine a world where their kind of impossible isn't possible.\nBack to the Ald Sotha marketplace, Jubal tells Vivec he is not supposed to see him yet. Vivec then teleports himself and Jubal back to the Sul under-manor where Jubal states that the people who just witnessed him teleport are going to think he is cheating. Vivec vanishes after Jubal turns his back to him, which makes Jubal believe Vivec has forgotten the things he had once said, a flaw he intends to fix. Following this, Jubal walks over to his balcony and calls upon his servitor to send a micro-wasp missile message to Hlaalu Hir immediately.\nSometime later, Hlaalu Hir arrives at Jubal's tea room, complaining about the expense of Jubal's request. Nevertheless, Hir offers Jubal a flask of &lt;a href=\"Sujamma\"&gt;Sujamma&lt;/a&gt; to help cope with what he's about to go through. It is revealed that Hir has hired a group of Khajiit surgeons for Jubal, who are to perform a strange surgical procedure injecting large amounts of Skooma to put him in an extreme psychedelic state. As Jubal begins hallucinating, one of the surgeons begins to mention an old Khajiiti proverb: \"Two moons, two paws, ten claws. Take but one away and you\u2014\" Jubal interrupts him saying \"cut them both off.\"\nThe scene cuts to a corner club in Ald Sotha where Jubal is having his bachelor party. The regular patrons have been replaced with strange guests, including many gods and demi-gods. Jubal wears bandages over the stumps where his hands used to be. As he does not recognize many of the guests, Jubal grows nervous, but Hlaalu Hir assures him he'll be fine. Jubal goes to speak with some of his divine guests, including &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist&lt;/a&gt; tree, and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. While drunk, he gets into a particularly heated conversation with &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, whom he ridicules for failing to keep his control over time. As the argument continues, Jubal eventually tells Akatosh to go away as he is drinking with the groom of his &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;brother's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;dead body&lt;/a&gt;. As Akatosh vanishes, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; approaches Jubal congratulating him, but Jubal tells him to go away too, calling him a \"virus.\" As Talos angrily backs away, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; confronts Jubal and insists that he apologize to Talos immediately. Making amends, Jubal sits with Talos where they both continue to get even more intoxicated. Jubal and Talos then decide to leave the party, holding each other up for support. Contemplating the argument they had just had, Talos demands to know why Jubal called him a virus. Jubal replies saying the reason for this insult was because Talos had fed off \"the Mastery\" like a virus, something he doesn't take any particular offense to as the alternative situation would have required one of them to &lt;a href=\"Enantiomorph\"&gt;win at the expense of the other&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalos and Jubal-lun-Sul exit the subterranean tunnels leading to the surface of the moon. There, Jubal points to the remains of Nirn stating that the Arena was where they used to live. Jubal goes on to say that, from the beginning, the only reason they were put there was to fight, which is a notion he doesn't quite understand. Talos, as he begins to transform into &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, tells Jubal that he is lying and that anyone who has cut off their own hands already understands; Jubal had the Arena in reach, but decided to refuse it. Knowing time was almost up, Jubal begins to meditate, and just as Lorkhan decides to leave, Jubal takes back his insult of calling him a \"virus\" and instead refers to him as a \"preacher.\"\nAs he sits meditating, Jubal-lun-Sul is finally visited by the massive spiky Numidium. Jubal greets the Numidium\u2014who only replies with empty speech bubbles\u2014stating he has to kill it now. As he promised no tricks, the Numidium agrees to shrink to Jubal's size for the time being. Jubal decides to start his confrontation with the contrarian Numidium by reciting scriptures from each of their respective cultures, the Dunmer and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning with the words of his people, Jubal delivers a line from &lt;a href=\"36%20Lessons%20of%20Vivec%2C%20Sermon%2011\"&gt;Sermon 11&lt;/a&gt;:\nKnowing every assertion made makes the Numidium want to destroy more and more, Jubal continues with the words of the Dwemer, in which he simply repeats \"No\" over and over again. Jubal states that while the Numidium wants to think of its philosophy as \"Never Underestimate The Little Guy,\" it is really only coming off as a brat, which gets nobody anywhere. Jubal goes on to reveal that the Numidium was, itself, the \"Disappearance of the Dwarves,\" their attempted escape from existence, which begs the question of why the Numidium keeps trying to come back. Jubal asks the Numidium if it has some sort of unfinished business, to which the Numidium replies saying \"maybe.\" This makes Jubal incredibly frustrated, as that is the \"magic word\" and they both promised to not use any tricks. The Numidium reiterates, stating \"GREY AREA. GREY MAYBE.\" With these words said, Jubal's assumption of the Numidium was proven correct, and he yells at it that the whole time, all it wanted was to win, which the Numidium affirmed with a simple \"YES.\" Jubal, who had finally gotten what he wanted from the Numidium, apologizes to it before decapitating it with an empty speech bubble. While Jubal lay exhausted over the Numidium's corpse the Digitals return saying that there is no more Wheel or Lull, and that the time for union and Amaranth has come.\nThe next day, Jubal is ready for his wedding, clad in the brass shell of the defeated Numidium. As he is preparing, however, the room is flooded with &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; assassins, led by Hlaalu Hir. A micro-wasp missile appears and begins drilling into Jubal's forehead. Jubal tells his old friend to call it off to no avail, Hir only replies stating that this is painful for him too. Jubal, growing ghost hands, pulls out the wasp himself and proceeds to kill off the Morag Tong assassins. While fighting, Jubal asks Hir what hurt him the most, which Hir discloses was that Jubal never told him what the Wheels of Lull had said.\nFlashing back to the time Jubal made his first pilgrimage, he is greeted by the Wheels of Lull, a spirit known as Memory. Memory thanks Jubal for making the pilgrimage as fewer people make the journey with each passing year. Jubal asks her why, and Memory responds saying that she is leaving soon. Memory continues, urging Jubal to not tell anyone she told him this because otherwise they will all come to her, and she hates goodbyes.\nIn the present, Jubal continues to kill the remaining Morag Tong assassins, finally getting to Hlaalu Hir whom he proceeds to choke to death. Jubal, speaking over Hir's dead body, assures that Hir's &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; is dead and that he will never get to know what Memory said. Regardless, Jubal tells Hir to go in peace knowing that Memory was right, that goodbyes are the worst.\nJubal now enters the Temple of Ald Sotha, where the whole Dunmeri race is present for his wedding. His wife-to-be, the High Alma's daughter, is revealed to be Vivec taken a female form. The priest overseeing the wedding is Lorkhan. As Jubal and Vivec recite their vows, Akatosh, occupying in the gaping wound where Lorkhan's &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt; once resided, begins eating his own tail. Once Vivec and Jubal kiss, Lorkhan's wound is healed and all things are made secure. The story ends with the birth of the first Nu-Man, who will become the next Amaranth.\nNotes.\nHis wife later officially confirmed that any C0DA prequels/sequels/companions (including the any unreleased aforementioned texts) are no longer on the drawing board."}

{"id": "605275", "revid": "26459635", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=605275", "title": "CHIM", "text": "CHIM ( k\u026am or t\u0283\u026am,) in &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20script\"&gt;Daedric script&lt;/a&gt; spelled as (), called the Secret Syllable of Royalty, is a state in which one can break free of all known laws and corruptions of Oblivion. It allows for the user to return to a state before the mingling of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; and manipulate the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; how they please. CHIM is often associated with Love, which seemingly connects it to the concept of God actually being \"Love.\"\nBackground.\nThe word in the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt; language translates roughly to \"royalty\", \"starlight\", and \"high splendor\", and is represented by a symbol that constantly changes but is normally recognized by a \"Crowned Tower that threatens to break apart at the slightest break in concentration.\" CHIM is the final stage of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;, which can only be achieved by viewing the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Aurbis%29\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt;, which encompasses the universe, while keeping one's own individuality in its presence. Failing to keep one's individuality in the presence of the Tower will result in the erasure of its viewer from the universe, an occurrence known as a \"Zero Sum.\" Once CHIM is achieved, people experience a state in which time is bent both inward and outward into \"a shape that is always new\" as well as an incomprehensible sense of the &lt;a href=\"Godhead\"&gt;Godhead&lt;/a&gt;. One who achieves CHIM is able to observe the Tower without fear and reside within it. CHIM is possibly the fifth step of the Walking Ways.\nMore information.\nThe first and most famous attempt at CHIM was the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, which was pursued by the god &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; after he saw the Tower and began his Psijic Endeavor. Lorkhan's attempt at CHIM failed through manners that may have been intentional. It is stated by &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; that Lorkhan more than likely intentionally sabotaged his CHIM experiment so that others would know how to not fail it. Lorkhan's failure showed the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; that it was not possible for the original spirits to achieve states of existence such as CHIM, for they can not know the \"joy of mortals,\" the knowing that death is merely an illusion and merely a cycle to be broken. The original spirits were immeasurable and infinite, only separated by their vanities and egos. Their infinite scale and ineffability made it hard for them to ponder their ends and limits, and thus, could not pinpoint their own individuality from the Aurbis. This inherent omnipotence made it impossible for them to know the true joy of liberation that mortal spirits could experience from escaping their natural limitations. For this reason Lorkhan began to formulate the Mortal Plane as a way in which true transcendence could be achieved, as only mortals have the ability to surpass all their boundaries, laws, and corruptions, put in place by immortal divinities. Mundus itself was designed to be a reflection of the Aurbis and, by association, the Tower. Lorkhan's failure sent his consciousness adrift as an entity known as the Void Ghost that resides within the hidden &lt;a href=\"The%20Serpent\"&gt;The Serpent&lt;/a&gt; constellation where he tries to continue his goal of helping others reach states that exist beyond CHIM.\nTwo beings who are thought to have achieved CHIM are Vivec and &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec supposedly learned of CHIM after marrying and mating with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec wrote extensively on its nature, and used CHIM to banish Azura from the world during his trial. Talos achieved CHIM before ascending to godhood, but how he did so is not entirely known. According to some sources, in an act of love, Talos used CHIM to effectively erase the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; retroactively from all history, being quoted as saying:\nThis quote is cross-referenced by &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s in his \"&lt;a href=\"Commentaries%20on%20the%20Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;\" which state:\nThe \"Red King\" might refer to Talos, and his jungled home would be referring to Cyrodiil."}

Almost immediately after giving himself the title of Ard, he took to exterminating the surviving members of the Blackdrake clan to secure his hold of the city against any potential rivals. In doing so, he threw them off the highest walls of the city.\nSometime between 2E 573 and &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Councilor%20Itinia\"&gt;Councilor Itinia&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Helvar%20Tarperian\"&gt;Helvar Tarperian&lt;/a&gt; to Markarth with a letter requesting Caddach travel to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and accept the title of Emperor due to him the final surviving member of the Blackdrake clan. Refusing this, Caddach grabbed the agent and dangled her over the walls of Markarth exclaiming he is the final member of the Blackdrake clan as he threw his kin from atop the walls they stood on after they wished to venture to Cyrodiil to retrieve the title of Emperor. He stated the only time he would return to Cyrodiil is if he was invading.\nIn 2E 582, Caddach accepted the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Reach%20witch\"&gt;Reach witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arana\"&gt;Arana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Count%20Verandis%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;Count Verandis Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; defeating &lt;a href=\"Rada%20al-Saran\"&gt;Rada al-Saran&lt;/a&gt; and his advisor &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Belain\"&gt;Lady Belain&lt;/a&gt;, saving Markarth from the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Host\"&gt;Gray Host&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is said that he is not afraid of anyone, not even a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt;, and resides in Coldharbour. He died by decapitation.\nInitially met in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;The Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt;, he later appears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Location%29\"&gt;The Harborage&lt;/a&gt;, and later on in many locations around Coldharbour. He has &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Hovel\"&gt;a hovel&lt;/a&gt; setup in a Nordic ruin in the southern part of the zone.\nBackground.\nCadwell was formerly known as &lt;a href=\"Cadwell%20the%20Betrayer%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Cadwell the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;, a champion and knight of a time long past. He was known to help people but his motives weren't entirely altruistic. \nCadwell was friends with a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; hero named &lt;a href=\"Khunzar-ri\"&gt;Khunzar-ri&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he managed to stop the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;. This accomplishment was achieved by tricking &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; into placing a portion of his power in &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Jode\"&gt;Plane of Jode&lt;/a&gt;. Blinded by his ambition, Kaalgrontiid ordered his brothers to do the same. Once the dragons were weakened, Cadwell and Khunzar-ri trapped them inside the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;. \nSoon afterwards, Cadwell killed Khunzar-ri by stabbing him in the back, an act which earned him the nickname, \"the Betrayer.\" Cadwell hoped to steal the power of the dragons within the Core and slaughtered his way through Shadow Dance Temple to reach it, but &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;'s adepts managed to stop him by cutting off his head and dismembering his body before he could achieve his goal. \nCadwell's body parts were buried in separate locations throughout Elsweyr, with his head being buried in a grave marked with his title. Cadwell lost all memory of his past self, becoming genuinely altruistic to the point of deeply hating his old self.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven%20in%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Soul Shriven in Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the gate to &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; is warded off, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris&lt;/a&gt; consult him in order to find a new route, with the latter stating that because he's the oldest of the Soul Shriven, he must know Coldharbour well. He tells them of an alternate path to the Prophet's cell\u2014the Undercroft\u2014which is accessed by following the river. After warning of traps and enemies, he also admits doubt to the plan's success, but wishes the party good luck anyway.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Vestige and Lyris arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt; to rescue &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, they ask the soul shriven in the nearby town how to get inside the castle undetected. The locals direct them to Cadwell, whom they rescue from Worm Cultists. Grateful for their assistance, Cadwell assists them in infiltrating the castle and again during their escape by opening a locked gate from the outside. The Vestige then has the choice between bringing Cadwell back to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; or leaving him in Coldharbour.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Weight%20of%20Three%20Crowns\"&gt;The Weight of Three Crowns&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttend the summit and devise a plan to invade Coldharbour.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Hollow%20City%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;.\nFind a base from which to launch your assault on &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Army%20of%20Meridia\"&gt;The Army of Meridia&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon arriving in Coldharbour with the Fighters and Mages Guild force, the Vestige is separated by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses, and lands alone to the south of the &lt;a href=\"Hollow%20City\"&gt;Hollow City&lt;/a&gt;, near Cadwell's hovel. The old knight directs them north to the city. Afterwards, he assists survivors from Tamriel in returning to the Hollow City by using portals to traverse to Coldharbour.\n&lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Shackle\"&gt;Breaking the Shackle&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Vestige rescues &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; from the Black Forge, Cadwell helps defend Vanus from &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Vestige, &lt;a href=\"Treva\"&gt;Treva&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Svari\"&gt;Svari&lt;/a&gt; while Vanus destroys the Great Shackle.\n&lt;a href=\"Crossing%20the%20Chasm\"&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/a&gt;.\nCadwell directs the Vestige to destroy Molag Bal's reinforcement portals while the Tamrielic force of Mages and Fighters Guild members fight their way across the Chasm. He also fights\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Grunda%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Grunda&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Vestige after they reached the gatehouse at the end of the Chasm.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Assault\"&gt;The Final Assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the Planar Vortex was reached, the Groundskeeper revealed herself to be Meridia. She guided the Vestige and their group, including Cadwell, as they destroyed Dark Anchors. Once the Light of Meridia's power was released at the focal point of the Vortex, Meridia transported the survivors back to the Hollow City before they were killed.\n&lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Schemes\"&gt;God of Schemes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Five Companions had performed the ritual to imbue the Vestige with the power of Akatosh, the surviving Companions were attacked by Daedra. Before they could be overwhelmed, Cadwell arrived and brought them through a portal to the Harborage. Once the Vestige had defeated Molag Bal and recovered their soul, Cadwell declared he was now pledged to serve Meridia. He told the Vestige how to use the Light of Meridia to journey to the lands of their enemy alliances should they be interested in exploring them.\n&lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Silver\"&gt;Cadwell's Silver&lt;/a&gt;.\nExperience one of the other alliances.\n&lt;a href=\"Cadwell%27s%20Gold\"&gt;Cadwell's Gold&lt;/a&gt;.\nExperience the final alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Cadwell%20the%20Betrayer%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Cadwell the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khamira%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khamira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; make efforts to prevent the resurrection of the Betrayer at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Zumog%20Phoom\"&gt;Zumog Phoom&lt;/a&gt;. When the resurrection succeeds, Cadwell disintegrates. The Vestige must track down the Betrayer and slay him, as well as ensure he cannot open the doorway to &lt;a href=\"Plane%20of%20Jode\"&gt;Plane of Jode&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nVanus Galerion: \"I did it.

And, as soon as you deal with the planar vortex, everything will be as right as rain!\"\nVanus Galerion: \"What? Explain yourself, man!

The Great Shackle has been destroyed, but not before a planar vortex was established. We must destroy this vortex before it sucks the very essences of Nirn into Coldharbour. The Fighters Guild shall deal with the Chasm's defenders, but blades have little power against magic.\"\nVanus Galerion: \"And that's where my mages come in. My scouts report that some kind of magical fixtures block access to the path across the Chasm. Mages there already work on a way to overcome these fixtures, and we are prepared to lend our strength when the main forces arrive.\"\nSergeant Kamu: \"A sound plan. Plays to our unique strengths. But this one wonders, what if the mages can't overcome Molag Bal's magic?\"\nVanus Galerion: \"What a ridiculous question! Of course my mages can overcome this magic!\"\nCadwell: \"Ah, magic!

But to be honest with you, I'm not feeling as confident as Vanus about this.\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"We shall fight with all our strength. There is no other option. Lives will be lost, but hopefully a world will be saved.\"\n\"Know that the Chasm is only the first stage of this battle.

Mind your tongue!\"\nLaloriaran Dynar: \"Darien only seeks to lighten a tense situation. Still, we have to try. To do nothing is to doom Tamriel to certain destruction.\"\nDarien Gautier: \"Well, when you put it that way, there are a lot of lovely ladies that need to be saved...\"\nVanus Galerion \"Yes, well, be that as it may, we launch our assault on the Chasm immediately. The King needs to talk to the champion and I must discuss some final details with the mages. The rest of you have your own preparations to see to, I'm sure.\"\nCadwell: \"I knew I'd find them here!
