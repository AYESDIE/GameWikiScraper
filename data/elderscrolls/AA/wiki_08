Marbruk was built by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, as an initiative to bring the High Elves closer to their Wood Elven allies.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nMarbruk is situated on the eastern border in the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking%20Court\"&gt;Wilderking Court&lt;/a&gt;. It connects the north of Greenshade to the south, similar to Woodhearth in the coast. Marbruk is located in an area traditionally occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Driladan%20Clan\"&gt;Driladan Clan&lt;/a&gt; of Wood Elves. To the north of Marbruk's Northern Gate, is the &lt;a href=\"Driladan%20Pass\"&gt;Driladan Pass&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bridge that goes over a large ravine. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Merchant%27s%20Tunnels\"&gt;Old Merchant's Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; run through the Pass, and it is more commonly used because a wooden bridge is not sufficient than a cave system. The ruined town of &lt;a href=\"Whisper%20Grove\"&gt;Whisper Grove&lt;/a&gt; is across the ravine, but it is generally avoided. To the south is the forest settlement of &lt;a href=\"Bramblebreach\"&gt;Bramblebreach&lt;/a&gt;, where many of the tribal Bosmer live in Greenshade. An altar for the Wilderking is on the outskirts of town. Continuing southwest will lead to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Greenheart\"&gt;Greenheart&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Marbruk was founded, with the purpose of bringing citizens of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; together in a familiar environment. But that was not the only reason, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; has left the provinces in stress, with the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; making advances into Greenshade. Marbruk was built to protect the Wood Elves as well. Oddly enough, Marbruk's construction came with controversy, but not from the people that would be expected. Wood Elves from urban settlements such as &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;, or cities beyond Valenwood, opposed the decision, with many thinking their culture has been compromised so much already. Meanwhile, the Wood Elves of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;, who are against any foreign inquiries, were really fascinated with the city's construction, as it used imported wood and stone, rather than Valenwood's own flora. Marbruk prospered amidst the First Aldmeri Dominion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in Marbruk had created a vault for the Aldmeri Dominion, which stores various artifacts and anomalies throughout Tamriel, such as the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Nirnroot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crimson Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Crown%20of%20Nenalata\"&gt;Ayleid Crown of Nenalata&lt;/a&gt;. One such artifact was the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful stuff associated with &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, the Altmer God of Magic. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, Vicereeve Pelidil had stolen the Staff of Magnus and began leading the fragmented &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, with the intent of reviving Naemon and establishing him as the High King of Summerset. While the Shade of Naemon was awakened, Pelidil had died in a heated battle between the Dominion off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Seaside%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Seaside Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. The Shade of Naemon had taken the Staff of Magnus, with the intent of destroying the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Valenwood\"&gt;Heart of Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hectahame\"&gt;Hectahame&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldmeri Dominion rallied their forces at Marbruk, attempting to break the Heritance's hold at &lt;a href=\"Driladan%20Pass\"&gt;Driladan Pass&lt;/a&gt; beyond Marbruk's North Gate. In the end, Naemon was defeated and the Staff was secured.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the village of Marbruk Field in their quest to recover the pieces."}

The high Altmer presence in the city has resulted in some local Bosmer to consider the city to be an Altmer colony rather than a multicultural centre to be shared between the three Aldmeri races. Opposition towards the city tends to be strongest in Bosmer cities such as &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;, and less prevalent among local Bosmer in the areas surrounding Marbruk, who find the city fascinating. The city was constructed with stone imported from elsewhere in the Aldmeri Dominion on the explicit command of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; in order to respect the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; which is held in high esteem by local Bosmer.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Marbruk%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Racuvar%20Bala\"&gt;Racuvar Bala&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gandra-Lye\"&gt;Gandra-Lye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Crown%20of%20Nenalata\"&gt;Crown of Nenalta&lt;/a&gt; are located at the guildhall, along with the very rare plants like &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Nirnroot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crimson nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"domica%20redwort\"&gt;domica redwort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Tear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Roland's Tear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gleamblossom\"&gt;gleamblossom&lt;/a&gt;, inside the Relic Room.

The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; have few quarries, and the forest in these parts is so overgrown, the ground so fertile, that it's difficult to find quality deposits. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; expressly commanded that we disturb as little of Valenwood to build the city as possible.\nInterestingly, Wood Elves from outside Valenwood and from the bigger settlements, such as &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt;, have objected more strenuously to Marbruk's construction than the local Wood Elves, who are mostly fascinated by the stone constructions rising up among them. If I had to guess, I'd say that the symbolic importance of Valenwood is greater for those who don't live there than for those who do. It's as if these more \"civilized\" Wood Elves fear they've already compromised their culture in some way, so they feel obligated to protest the construction.\nQueen Ayrenn has assured both parties of Wood Elves that Marbruk is necessary to the defense of the Wood Elf way of life, especially against the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, and so far this assurance seems to have prevented any serious interference with our work, although there has been the occasional incident of tools going missing or stone being carved into perverse shapes overnight."}

He asks that no one outside the temple be killed, but those guarding the &lt;a href=\"Unique%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; inside are permitted to be killed, if necessary. The Gray Fox places a marker on the map for the temple location, in the far northeastern part of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.

Once there, a temple and Monk's Quarters with &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Hridi\"&gt;Brother Hridi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Hjar\"&gt;Brother Hjar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Holger\"&gt;Brother Holger&lt;/a&gt; inside, as well as the Ancestor Moth Crypt can be found. Ask the brothers if they can help and Brother Holger is the only one who is willing to assist with information.\nIn the Crypt.\nHead into the crypt and then into the Temple of the Moth Halls. It'll be quite dark inside (blind enemies don't need light), so bring a &lt;a href=\"torch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fin%20Gleam\"&gt;Fin Gleam&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;.

The priests cannot detect the Hero while they are in &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak mode&lt;/a&gt;. If one gets too close, pause and remove any armor and stay close to the walls. This section of the quest is excellent for leveling the Sneak &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Catacombs and Caverns.\nHead through the door to the Catacombs of The Temple of The Moth where more priests are encountered. Watch out for &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;floor traps&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Caverns, also watch out for more floor traps as well as &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, though the enemies scale depending on level. Fight through to the Shrine of the Moth.\nThe Shrine.\nInside, there is a large room with an altar and &lt;a href=\"Savilla%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Savilla's Stone&lt;/a&gt; in the middle, along with a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Dark Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt; that shoots &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost spells&lt;/a&gt; every few seconds. At least one Blind Moth Prelate guards the stone. Kill him or sneak past, grab the Stone and head to the room on the right, where there is a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nInside the chest, a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; titled \"\" can be found. It describes the mask of the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently, the mask was stolen, so &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; placed a curse on it, so whomever wears it is lost in the shadows, his name and memories never to be remembered.\nTake the note and the stone back to the Gray Fox in Bruma to complete the quest. Bringing the note back allows a discussion about the mask and the Gray Fox's nature.\nAlternate Methods.\nA &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Telekinesis spell&lt;/a&gt; with sufficient range can pull Savilla's Stone away from the guardian without triggering the Welkynd stone trap, which fires a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost spell&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf your Sneak skill is high enough, you can also sneak up behind the guardian so he is positioned between you and the Welkynd stone. The stone will fire frost spells at you, but they will hit the guardian instead, and he will die after about three hits, allowing you to grab the stone."}

She asks for help in collecting essences of Aetherius using a wyress torchbug.

She feels sympathetic for the creatures killed, as they are usually not so aggressive. She then asks the Vestige to stand back when she performs the ritual but asks them to follow. She runs to the mill and cast a spell protection on the door and walks inside. Follow her inside and talk to her again.\nThe ward protecting the door will buy them some time so they can figure out what to do next as the villagers can't stay in the mill forever. She suggests them to talk to &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Jehanne\"&gt;Wyress Jehanne&lt;/a&gt; if they would like to help more. Completing the quest will reward the Vestige a Wyress Sash and some ."}

Turtle clasps crafted in the Breton style are considered cultural items. Terrapin-shell lanterns are fashioned from a polished turtle shell and lined with copper leaf. Turtle seed dolls with amber inlays by the Bright-Throats are highly sought after, both as protective talismans and works of native art; Bright- elders contend that the turtle is a powerful and unruly totem\u2014one that sees both the very old and the very new with perfect clarity.

Described as being shaped like a paddle or boat oar, it is made without the use of any metal.\nThe Argonian smith starts with a length of wood\u2014anywhere from the length of their arm or tail\u2014then spends a week or so shaving down the wood until it achieves a paddle shape. Bones and fine-cut obsidian chisels are then used to carve ornate patterns into the face of the paddle. Most of these patterns form abstract animal shapes, such as &lt;a href=\"Crocodile\"&gt;crocodiles&lt;/a&gt;. Once the wood is cured, stained, and polished, the smith chips down raw stones (such as obsidian) into sharpened, knife-blade shapes, from crude squares to evenly shaved fangs. Once these \"teeth\" are hewn, they set them into the paddle using wood or bone pegs and boiled depassa gum, which adheres like a paste to wood and stone. Once the teeth are set in place, the smith wraps the handle in strips of leather or bark, creating a grip that won't slip no matter how slick it gets with rain or blood. All in all, the process takes about three weeks to craft."}

The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; escapes the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt; and learns the basic components of the game.\nWalkthrough.\nPrison break.\n begins with a &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt; in a cell of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;, with no worldly possessions and wearing no more than rags. Upon approaching the cell door, a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in the opposite cell, Valen Dreth, insults the prisoner; what he says varies depending on the selected &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; and gender.\nSoon, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; arrives, escorted by three &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. He remarks that he saw the prisoner in his dreams, and orders his Blades not to hurt the prisoner, allowing them to follow. A secret passage in the cell opens; follow them inside. Even when they tell the prisoner to stay put, they are able to follow them through most sections of the sewer; they will not attack except in self-defense.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Agent\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Agent&lt;/a&gt;s ambush the party. Depending on the difficulty level, the &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;assassins&lt;/a&gt; may be quite strong in contrast to the party, but generally they do not target the prisoner specifically. It is best to stick to using the &lt;a href=\"Flare\"&gt;Flare&lt;/a&gt;, until Captain &lt;a href=\"Renault\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; is killed. Once Renault is dead, pick up her &lt;a href=\"Renault%27s%20Akaviri%20Katana\"&gt;katana&lt;/a&gt; for a reward later.\nAlternate route.\nImperial Prison.\nThe Blades soon force the prisoner to stay behind by locking the door behind them. Off to the right, a section of the wall crumbles and two &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; come through. Kill them and proceed through the broken wall. Through the cave, the prisoner encounters a few more rats. To the left, there will be a dead &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; with a few &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leather armor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt;. There may be random &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;precious gems&lt;/a&gt; hiding in the area around the bones. Also there will be a barrel, a chest and a crate each with some &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; and lockpicks. Towards the exit there is a dead &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shaman\"&gt;Goblin Shaman&lt;/a&gt; with some &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;scrolls&lt;/a&gt; and the key to the door.\nImperial Substructure.\nIn the next room there is another rat that should be easily disposed of and a chest with a &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weak potion of sorcery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;iron armor&lt;/a&gt;. Through the next little path, there are rats and a single &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;. The zombie should deal with the rats. Just proceed through the next few rooms until arriving at the door to the last area. Would-be &lt;a href=\"Character%20Classes%20%28Oblivion%29%23Alchemist\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; might want to collect the &lt;a href=\"Fungi%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; scattered throughout the dungeon.\nNatural caverns.\nFollow the path down until the goblin is reached. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marksman%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; are useful here. Kill the goblin and find some &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Novice%20Mortar%20and%20Pestle\"&gt;mortar and pestle&lt;/a&gt;. Mix them together to make a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt;, useful for the next few rooms. Keep going until reaching the big room. The Goblin Shaman carries a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shaman%20Staff\"&gt;a unique staff&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used or sold later.\nImperial Subterrane.\nExiting the cave system, the prisoner finds themselves on a ledge above the ground and sees the Emperor walking with his guards. As they approach the ledge, they are ambushed by a few more Mythic Dawn agents. After the agents are dead and the prisoner climbs down from the ledge, the Blades draw their &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt;, contemplating killing the prisoner. The Emperor insists he or she is trustworthy and should be allowed to follow. At this point, the Emperor asks which &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;birthsign&lt;/a&gt; the prisoner\u00a0was born under. These signs grant different bonuses. The sign can be changed again at the end of the quest, if the wrong one is picked.\nFollow them through several chambers, fighting more assassins and finally reaching a dead end. When the Blades realize that they have been led into a trap, they instruct the prisoner to stay with the Emperor while they go kill off the assassins. The Emperor can go no further and hands over the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to take to &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;. After he has his say, a secret door opens up behind him and an assassin cuts him down. The prisoner is unable to move until the Emperor has slumped to the floor. This assassin is somewhat tougher than the others previously encountered, but &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; comes in to make short work of him after he is finished in the other room. When everyone is dead, Baurus gives the key to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison%20Sewers\"&gt;Imperial Prison Sewers&lt;/a&gt;. He also helps with &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; selection. Like the birthsign, this can be changed at the end of the quest.\nGo through the secret passage and open a grate to the sewers. The sewers are filled with rats and goblins. None of these should present a challenge. Off to the right, in the main room, there are six &lt;a href=\"Cheese%20Wheel\"&gt;Cheese Wheel&lt;/a&gt;s and six sacks of &lt;a href=\"Flour%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;flour&lt;/a&gt;\u2014excellent for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter navigating the sewer, a grate is encountered. This is the final chance to modify race, class, and/or birthsign. These cannot be altered after leaving the sewers. Afterward, activate the gate and choose: \"Finished-Exit Sewers.\""}

Like the Twilight Lady herself, the \"Chase Away\" song is slippery and unpredictable. It should not be sung unless the need is great.\nIn ancient times it was used to treat disease and ward off cane-locusts. But then came the Middle-Dawn that twisted the Moon-Bishops' tails and made them forgetful. Now it is only used to drive out the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dro-m'Athra dance to no music but the beating &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. It is a song without song\u2014dark and seductive. The heartbeat is a lie that repeats and repeats until it becomes truth to the cat who hears it. When a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; accepts the will of Lorkhaj as truth, they forget the &lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and become Lost Cats. Khajiit that are well and truly bent cannot be saved through song, they can only be banished with knives and moonlight. Cats that still struggle against the Heart, however, can be drawn back from the Darks.\nThe S'virash Sahaala's strength lies in its elusiveness. The Clan Mothers will tell you to sing no songs in the presence of the dro-m'Athra, and they are wise to do so. Heedless singing will draw you closer to the Heart. Your song will fall in with the beat, your tail will twitch in time, and you will slide into the Maw of Lorkhaj whisker-first. The \"Chase Away\" song is the only song that can break the Heart's tempo. The notes dance up and down the scale like a mad shadow, confusing the Darks and making the Heart weak and sluggish. Eventually the tempo will break and the corruption will pass.\nEven so, those who sing the S'virash Sahaala take a great risk. The dro-m'Athra hate Azurah's hymns and will take great pains to kill any cat who sings them. So take heed, Cantor\u2014if you confront &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;'s dark litter, you must move swiftly and keep your wits. A moment's weakness can end in disaster."}

If that gives you cause to wonder, I will not deny that I was once a &lt;a href=\"pyromancer\"&gt;pyromancer&lt;/a&gt; of great skill.\nExhausted and near the end of my spells, I parlayed with the wyrm, offering it life if it would share it's secrets. Haughty to the end, it agreed to one secret for one life. I asked for name, but it told me it would rather die than surrender that. Instead offered me something else. And that how I learned how to defy the Law of Firsts.\nThe law itself is inviolate. However, the skillful enchanter can weave &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Effect\"&gt;two enchantments simultaneously&lt;/a&gt; into an item. For &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, the limit is two. The dragon said that men and elves have two arms, two legs, two eyes and two ears. I asked why that mattered, and the beast just laughed.\nThe enchanter must weave one enchantment with the left hand while weaving the other with the right. The eyes must focus on one and only one enchantment, while the ears only pay attention to the other. When I asked about my legs, the beast laughed again.\nI spent two years mastering the technique. Just last month I made a sword with both &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fear%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; enchantments. Now I am too weak to make another. I go to my death victorious, for I have done what no other enchanter in modern times has done."}

Two-handed skill is raised by the use of large melee &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; that are wielded with two hands. \nDue to the use of both hands, a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; or another weapon cannot be used while a two-handed weapon is equipped. When using two-handed weapons, the weapon can be used to &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt; incoming attacks. Two-handed weapons can do significantly more damage per strike than single one-handed weapons made of the same materials, but they take more time to swing and their power attacks drain &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; faster. Two-handed weapons have a greater reach than one-handed weapons and cannot be dual-wielded.\nComparisons with other games.\n&lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt; no longer require two hands to wield.\nLeveling.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Two-Handed skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nQuests.\nThe following quests increase or help to increase the Two-Handed skill:\nTwo-Handed weapons.\nThe following are the weapons that benefit from this skill:\nCraftable weapons.\nThis is a list of Two-Handed weapons that the Dragonborn is able to craft at a &lt;a href=\"Forge\"&gt;Forge&lt;/a&gt; given the appropriate perks.\nNon-craftable weapons.\nThis is a list of Two-Handed weapons that are not able to be crafted by the Dragonborn. They are either received as a quest reward or looted throughout the world. They may or may not be unique.\nPerks.\nThe following are &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available to select as the skill is leveled up.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDamage.\nThe two-handed skill directly increases the damage dealt with two-handed weapons. For each skill level, the damage increases by 0.5%. This increase is multiplicative with damage increase from the barbarian perk and weapon improvements.\nComparison to other combat styles.\nA two-handed build is balanced between dual wielding and shield builds in both attack and defense. Both hands are reserved for an offensive weapon, giving improved damage over weapon and shield builds; however, not as high as dual wielding against single foes as with the &lt;a href=\"Sweep\"&gt;Sweep&lt;/a&gt; perk, two-handed weapons may deal more area damage.\nThe greatest advantage of two-handed weapons over dual wielding is blocking, and particularly activating the &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Reflexes\"&gt;Quick Reflexes&lt;/a&gt; perk in the &lt;a href=\"Block%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; skill tree, which slows down the world whenever the weapon is used for blocking a power attack, allowing for greater reactions and manoeuvrability. Blocking is impossible while dual wielding, though they may always switch to using a shield or unequipping one weapon to block with the other to take advantage of their Block skill and related perks.\nAnother advantage of two-handed weapons as opposed to dual wielding or use of a weapon and shield is that two-handed weapons can strike multiple targets with a single strike using the &lt;a href=\"Sweep\"&gt;Sweep&lt;/a&gt; perk. Since two-handed weapons have best chance to stagger a target, a sweeping power attack may cause damage and stagger multiple targets in front of the Dragonborn.\nThe biggest disadvantage of two-handed weapons is that they do not work nearly as well with stealth combat. There are three perks in the Sneak skill tree to give one-handed weapons (especially daggers) as well as bows and crossbows significant sneak attack bonuses over even the most powerful two-handed weapons.\nOverall, two-handed weapons represent a melee combat style all its own. Although, two-handed weapons do not necessarily do more damage per second than other melee combat styles, two-handed weapons as opposed to one-handed weapon styles have greater reach and can potentially affect several targets at once."}

According to the rumor mill, Auria's\u00a0lover, &lt;a href=\"Jorundr\"&gt;Jorundr&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0has been\u00a0arrested for stealing money from Auria. Auria reportedly needs help recovering the stolen money.\nWalkthrough.\nArnora.\nAt a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"disposition\"&gt;disposition&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of at least 60, Arnora reveals that\u00a0Jorundr is in jail for murder. Arnora claims that Jourundr forced her to act as his accomplice in stealing a tax shipment headed to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and that\u00a0in the chaos, Jorundr killed a guard. They fled and hid the stolen goods, but the &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Bruma City Guard&lt;/a&gt; eventually traced them and Jorundr was arrested. Arnora discovered that before he was arrested, Jorundr hid the stolen goods elsewhere.\nShe asks for the Hero to help in convincing Jorundr to give up the location of the hidden stash, and she\u00a0agrees to give them half if they do so.\nBruma Jail.\nVisit Jorundr in prison. He will not talk to the Hero, so they will\u00a0have to commit a &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; and get incarcerated themself. The fastest way is by attempting to pick the lock of his cell with the guard present, attempting to &lt;a href=\"steal\"&gt;steal&lt;/a&gt; something in the presence of guards, or by attacking the guard once.\u00a0Select the option\u00a0\"Go to Jail\" when caught.\nOnce inside Jorundr's cell, he will reveal to them his side of the story. According to him, Arnora was the one pushing to rob a larger, well-guarded tax shipment. In the midst of the ambush and chaos, she killed a guard. They fled for the mountains. While Arnora went looking for \"supplies,\" Jorundr hid the stolen goods elsewhere. Soon, the Bruma City Guard caught him and threw him in jail, while Arnora lives free. Jorundr wants revenge, for he suspects that Arnora tipped off the guards to his location and therefore was directly involved in his arrest.\u00a0\nHe asks them to kill Arnora and promises to reveal the location of the gold to them if they bring him proof of her death (the amulet that she always wears). He knows that he will\u00a0be in jail for the long run for the murder he claims that he\u00a0did not\u00a0commit, but he would rather have Arnora dead and they have the gold than have her live free.\nArnora's house.\nOnce free from jail, head to Arnora's house. Do not\u00a0forget to recover the stolen goods from the evidence chest in the Bruma dungeon, since those were taken away from them when they were arrested.\nOnce at Arnora's house, there are two options:\nGoing with Arnora.\nIf one sides with Arnora and tells her of Jorundr's plans, she will give them the key to a chest downstairs containing her true amulet. She asks them to return it to Jorundr so that\u00a0he will be fooled into revealing the location of the stolen goods.\nWhen presenting the amulet to Jorundr, he tells the Hero that the goods are located outside Bruma's city walls. Head outside Bruma via the northern gate and follow the road to where the path diverges into three paths. The chest is located in a cluster of rocks on the slope to the right of the road, and there is a brown bush as well. Move toward the bush and they'll be approached by &lt;a href=\"Tyrellius%20Logellus\"&gt;Tyrellius Logellus&lt;/a&gt;, a corrupt prison guard.\nTyrellius reveals to them that he overheard their conversation with Jorundr, and that he wants the goods for himself. He claims that he has already killed Arnora, and attacks them. Once\u00a0Tyrellius is dead, retrieve the stolen goods from the semi-buried stash in the rocks behind him. Return to Arnora's house to find her dead body, which officially\u00a0completes the quest.\nGoing with Jorundr.\nIf one chooses to side with Jorundr, simply head to Arnora's house and slay her. Take the fake amulet off her body, as well as her keys. Head downstairs and open the locked chest next to the bed. Take Arnora's True Amulet and return to the jail and show both amulets to Jorundr.\nJorundr is surprised that Arnora has two amulets, but identifies one as the \"true\" amulet. He joyfully reveals the location of the stolen goods to them. It is outside Bruma's northern gate, just off the center path to the right, behind a brown bush and half-buried in some rocks. Take the items to complete the quest.\nReward.\nOne will receive the stolen goods and + 1 fame for completing the quest in both ways. However, they can choose to loot the standard guard armor and silver longsword off of Tyrellius's body once he is dead. Despite what the journal entry says at the conclusion of the quest, there is no punishment for either killing Tyrellius or finding Arnora's dead body."}

Seeking revenge, he created a prophecy which, if enacted, would block out the sun for eternity.

The bow was said to be used by Auri-El himself and had the power of the sun at its disposal. After collecting the bow, a blood-stained arrow must be shot into the sun, causing a mysterious energy to block out its rays. This energy, however, only lasts during daylight hours.\nReactions.\nUpon witnessing the Tyranny of the Sun, NPCs will react to it.

When you become Uggamog, these Ayleid ruins will respond to you and the creatures here will serve you. Those things alone will give you a life of power greater than you could have ever imagined, but it's the name that's the greatest treasure. When people hear the name \"Uggamog\", they quiver with terror. No one will ever cause you any trouble again.\nAll that's required to inherit your birthright is to mix your blood with mine. I have soaked this very letter with my blood, so you must simply add a drop of your own, and the transformation will take place. I hope you enjoy your inheritance as much as I've enjoyed mine.\nYour father,\nUggamog"}

I'm a fairly good treasure hunter, if I do say so myself, but those moneylenders are making it difficult for me and my family. I need to collect enough treasure to pay off the moneylenders before things get ugly.\nI survived my first foray into the vault. I had to dispatch one &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; I wasn't able to sneak past, but at least a found a small coffer that contained a few pieces of gold. Nowhere near enough to pay off my debts, but a good start nevertheless.\nWhen I returned to our camp, I saw that the weather had taken a turn for the worse. My poor wife was freezing and the baby wasn't doing much better. I couldn't leave them out in the elements, but it was also too treacherous to try to travel. My only choice was to take them with me back into Icehammer's Vault.\nAt least it's relatively warm and dry within the tomb. And the hunting has been going well. A few more days and I might actually have enough to pay my debts with a little left to spare!\nThe draugr are becoming more and more of a problem, however. They seem to be searching the tomb for us. I know that sounds crazy. They are mindless walking corpses, after all. But it really seems like they're making a concerted effort to find us.\nDamn the weather! The storm raging outside is still too intense for us to chance\u2014and I really should collect a few more items from these burial chambers. One more night, and then I'm getting my family out of here.\nWhat a fool I was! A complete and utter fool! While I was rooting around in one of the burial chambers, a horde of draugr broke through the barricade I had set up and attacked my poor, wife. I can see that she died valiantly, trying to defend our child from the monsters. For all the good it did! Now both my wife and baby are dead, and I am alone in this cursed vault!\nI saw another exit down a deserted corridor. I'll try to avoid the draugr and escape through there."}

{"id": "561164", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=561164", "title": "Uldor", "text": "Uldor is an &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; wizard in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Mourning%20Springs\"&gt;Temple of the Mourning Springs&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;. He is the main antagonist of \"&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Tears of the Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBackground.\nAt one point, Uldor was once a powerful mage, who could control legions of undead, being powerful enough to transcend his own death. He was eventually locked away in the Temple of the Mourning Springs on Khenarthi's Roost by the Maormer. They gave the local &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; there the &lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Stone\"&gt;Mourning Stone&lt;/a&gt; to keep it sealed.\nIn 2E 582, &lt;a href=\"Ealcil\"&gt;Ealcil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gathwen\"&gt;Gathwen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rurelion\"&gt;Rurelion&lt;/a&gt; went on an expedition into the temple. Ealcil removed the Mourning Stone from it for research, unaware of its purpose. Immediately after, the party was attacked by undead, controlled by Uldor. Ealcil successfully escaped, but the rest of the group remained, and one of them was ultimately taken over by the Maormer wizard.\nPersonality.\nUldor is shown to be arrogant and greedy, claiming things that he does not possess to be his. He states that the Vestige's body will soon be under his control the first time that he finds them. He desires &lt;a href=\"Eagle%27s%20Strand\"&gt;Eagle's Strand&lt;/a&gt; and Khenarthi's Roost as well, seeing them as opportunities to increase his power with more potential puppets for his ultimate conquest. He is also possessive of his trophies, stopping the spirits whose bodies he has from escaping, as well as wanting to keep Rurelion under his influence.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Tears of the Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the removal of the Mourning Stone, Rurelion has gone missing, causing Gathwen to recruit the Vestige to join her in finding her master. Uldor will appear as a skeleton at the front gate, warning the two of their eventual fate\u2014to be his minions\u2014as well as explaining that Rurelion is his. He wards the catacombs of the temple twice, and places sentries outside to protect his ritual.\nOnce the catacombs are entered, and the puzzle complete, the pair will find Rurelion speaking strangely; Uldor soon reveals that he is possessing Gathwen's master, explaining how he was imprisoned at the temple by the Mourning Stone until it was removed. He refuses to take over the Vestige, calling the body poisonous and soiled attire. He begins the ritual to create an undead army to wipe out Eagle's Strand, but is thwarted when the Vestige and Gathwen dispel it. Uldor angrily states that his plan is not over, but Rurelion takes the moment of weakness to fight for control, running into the Great Hall.\nIn the next room, the Vestige will find Rurelion free of Uldor's control for the moment, having forced him back into the tomb beyond the hall temporarily. After the traps are disarmed, Gathwen will arrive to hear that Rurelion plans to enter the tomb as a distraction while the Vestige places the Tears of the Two Moons on the pedestals, trapping Uldor inside. She will volunteer to be the distraction instead, forcing the Vestige to choose between her or Rurelion. Whoever is chosen will accompany them inside, while the other retrieves the Mourning Stone.\nAs the Vestige and whoever is chosen enter the tomb, Uldor will fall for the plan, taking control of either Rurelion or Gathwen. He will then send lightning strikes at the Vestige as he cackles. Once the Vestige places the stones on the pedestals, he will be trapped in the tomb with either Rurelion or Gathwen.\nCombat.\nWhen fighting Uldor, the best way is to activate the pillars as quickly as possible, staying mobile unless one is capable of absorbing a lot of damage. Uldor is only able to be defeated if all four stones as placed, and, therefore, cannot be attacked. If the Vestige is about to die, leave the room. Uldor cannot attack with his spells outside of the tomb.\nAdvanced Necromancy.\nUldor can control any corpse or &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; that he can access. He uses numerous of them, including &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Warrior%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skeletal Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Archer%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Skeletal Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Cryomancer\"&gt;Skeletal Cryomancer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Revenants&lt;/a&gt; to guard the temple from the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;. He also summons more to take over Eagle's Strand, although the ritual is interrupted.\nEnhanced Mental Abilities.\nIn addition to being able to control corpses, Uldor can also possess live people as well, as seen with Rurelion and Gathwen, although this appears to be more difficult than controlling undead.\nShock Spells.\nUldor can also send bolts of lightning at his enemies, dealing ranged damage from above. Although they take a bit to charge, and more to fire, they can be deadly to a stationary enemy.\nDialogue.\nAfter reaching the temple steps:\n\"Turn back. You aren't welcome here.\"\nInside the Central Ruins:\n\"Ears that large and you still don't listen? Perhaps you need a few alterations. There was a time when the sound of Uldor's voice commanded the terror of thousands.\"\nConversations.\nAfter disrupting the ritual:\nUldor: \"\"Stay back!\" \nRurelion: \"\"Uldor! Get out of my body, now!\" \nUldor: \"\"Silence! None command Uldor!\" \nIn the Great Hall:\nRurelion: \"\"Uldor, I command you! By the Tears of the Two Moons, return to your prison!\" \nUldor: \"\"Ahh! That won't hold me for long!\" \nApproaching the tomb, if Rurelion is chosen to be sacrificed:\nRurelion: \"\"I've reconsidered what our combined power can do, Uldor. I willingly give myself over.\" \nUldor: \"\"I knew such power would tempt you. Very well.\" \nRurelion: \"\"Hurry! Place the Tears of the Two Moons in the pedestals!\" \nUldor: \"\"Wretched fool! I'll turn your friend to ash!\" \nIf it was Gathwen, this is what occurs instead:\nGathwen: \"\"Uldor, my master was a fool to doubt your power. I'll help you wreak the vengeance you seek, if you allow me.\" \nUldor: \"\"Such a spectacular, willing garment! Very well.\" \nGathwen: \"\"I can't fight him for long! Quickly, place the Tears of the Two Moons in the pedestals!\" \nUldor: \"\"Wretched fool! I'll turn your friend to ash!\" "}

Confidante and chief advisor to the Emperor, Ocato was present during the Emperor's meeting with the Agent, before being sent to &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Emperor Uriel's assassination in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, Ocato became the de facto leader of the Empire as the head of the Elder Council. As Gates to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; started opening around &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; began to invade, it was largely Ocato's job to hold the Empire together. Some of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s nobility, including Count &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Terentius\"&gt;Regulus Terentius&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt;, believed that Ocato intended to use the Oblivion Crisis to crown himself Emperor and that he did not truly care about Cyrodiil.\nOcato reluctantly became &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%200\"&gt;4E 0&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; until a new leader could be established. He convened the full Elder Council in an unsuccessful bid to select a new Emperor. Ocato was one of the few people to believe &lt;a href=\"Lathenil%20of%20Sunhold\"&gt;Lathenil of Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround &lt;a href=\"4E%2014\"&gt;4E 14&lt;/a&gt; Ocato was assassinated by the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the Elder Council to fracture and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, where multiple people tried to claim the Ruby Throne.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Allies%20for%20Bruma\"&gt;Allies for Bruma&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; is sent by &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, they approached Ocato to ask for aid for &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; to protect Emperor Uriel's last remaining heir, &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt;, Ocato refused. Ocato claimed he wished to help, but that he would have a political crisis if he tried to move any troops from other provinces to protect his interests in Cyrodiil.\n&lt;a href=\"Light%20the%20Dragonfires\"&gt;Light the Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the retrieval of the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, Martin Septim came to the Imperial City to claim his title of Emperor. Ocato had already considered the matter with the Elder Council and happily accepted Martin as the Emperor. But before they could complete the ceremony to relight the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; and reestablish the barriers between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and Oblivion, the Imperial City was attacked by Daedra, led by Mehrunes Dagon himself.\nOcato helped Martin fight his way to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;, but they were too late; the barriers between the realms were gone. Martin, however, used the divine blood within the Amulet of Kings to transform himself into an Avatar of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and banish Dagon back to Oblivion. Unfortunately, this caused Martin to turn into stone afterward, destroying the Septim bloodline.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dragon%20Armor%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Imperial Dragon Armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the battle, Ocato names the Hero of Kvatch the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and provides them with a full suit of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Dragon%20Armor%20%28Armor%29\"&gt;Imperial Dragon Armor&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0however it takes fourteen days to make. Ocato continued to serve as the &lt;a href=\"Potentate\"&gt;Potentate&lt;/a&gt; of the Empire in the place of a true Emperor, now having to deal with several provinces that threatened to break their ties to the Empire. He continued to lead the Elder Council well after the Oblivion Crisis.\nDialogue.\n\"From the Blades, did you say? Jauffre sent you? What's this about? Quickly, now.\"\n\"Please excuse me.

The Oculory in the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; was used to store and protect unique and powerful artifacts. Hidden away within the ruins of Mzulft\u00a0and Tower of Mzark\u00a0in\u00a0Blackreach, the Oculory was an extremely advanced machine and one of the notable technological advances and creations made by the Dwemer.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, an organization of mages known as &lt;a href=\"The%20Synod\"&gt;The Synod&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0went to\u00a0Mzulft\u00a0to\u00a0experiment with the device, designed to collect starlight and transmute it, analyze it, into projectable energy.\nDesign and function.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Paratus%20Decimius\"&gt;Paratus Decimius&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; inspired the design for the Oculory at Mzulft; however, instead of portraying a map of the stars, the Oculory was designed to portray all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, to help The Synod locate magical relics of interest.\nThere is another Oculory located inside the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Mzark\"&gt;Tower of Mzark&lt;/a&gt;; this Oculory has a completely different purpose and function than the Oculory at Mzulft. According to Septimus Signus the Dwemer had devised a method to read and transcribe the information stored within an elder scroll, without risking the blindness induced by their repeated viewing. The warp in light produced by the Oculory's array of lenses, while preventing physical harm, was still unable (by the nature of the information within a scroll) to shield one's mind from the progressive maddening associated with repetitive viewing. Employing the use of a Dwemer Lexicon, as is done with the \u00a0&lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll (Dragon)&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0per Signus' request, can allow the information to be transcribed into a representative format, which may then be analysed without so much as glimpsing the original source.\nOperation.\nThe Oculory is susceptible to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spell Tomes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; on the table beside its control mechanisms exists for the purpose of moving its lenses and thus redirecting its light beams. Only one spell, cast by one hand, is needed to move the beams. &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;Dual Wielding&lt;/a&gt; any combination of frost and fire spells also moves the beams.\nOnce the light beams on the Dwemer Apparatus align with the lenses hung on the rotating ceiling, it displays a map of Tamriel on a wall of rock. Without the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Crystal\"&gt;Focusing Crystal&lt;/a&gt;, the device remains inactive."}

Odahviing's original temple and Dragon Priest are currently unknown, but the temple was likely besieged during the Dragon War, like many of the other lairs in Skyrim. And the Priest was killed amidst the chaos. Odahviing's soul was not absorbed by a &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, essentially leaving him dormant until the return of the World-Eater.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Odahviing was one of the many Dragons that were resurrected by Alduin, who had returned to the mortal plane after the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;.

Seeking to gain access to the remote temple, the Last Dragonborn needed intel on Alduin's location, and sought help from &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, whose palace of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; is designed to hold a Dragon. With the help of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn had called Odahviing. The Dragon initially thought that the Dragonborn challenged him, but in reality, Odahviing was captured and used to uncover Alduin's location. Acknowledging his defeat, Odahviing took the Dragonborn to the outskirts of Skuldafn, where he would leave them, and seek refuge at the Throat of the World. With Alduin killed in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Crisis was over, and Odahviing retired at the Throat of the World with other Dragons and Paarthurnax, awaiting the Dragonborn's call to battle."}

While captured, Odahviing bargains with the Dragonborn for his freedom.

The noon sun was directly overhead and everything was warm and bright. The had left their &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; village, Granitsta, early that morning for a day in the wilderness, a picnic, and with a stern warning from their father to be home before dark. They crossed a huge field that was bare save a single rose bush right in the middle.\nThe little girl asked Froedwig about it.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"according to father a great battle was fought in this place many years ago. The battle was visited by the God of all warriors, &lt;a href=\"Reymon%20Ebonarm\"&gt;Reymon Ebon Arm&lt;/a&gt;, who caused the leaders to end the battle and return to their homes. It is said that the rose bush grows where he stood that day.\"\n\"Oh, how exciting,\" giggled Silvanda.\nThe children continued their trek approaching some woods. As they entered the forest the air became very cool and a deep quiet seemed to envelope them.\n\"What is that?\"\nSilvanda pointed to a large hole in the ground from which protruded a long, thick pole. Around the hole thorny plants had grown into an impenetrable wall.\n\"I don't know,\" said Froedwig, \"but let's see if we can get a closer look.\"\n\"Stop!\"\nThey did.\nLooking beyond the hole, the children saw an elderly Redguard of many years. His gray beard, scraggly hair and stooped shoulders certainly did not support the authoritarian command he gave. But the children stopped just the same as he approached.\n\"Who are you?\" stammered Froedwig as Silvanda carefully tucked herself behind her brother's back.\n\"My name is &lt;a href=\"Hoennig%20Groevinger\"&gt;Hoennig Groevinger&lt;/a&gt;, and I live in these woods.\"\n\"Why can't we examine yon hole, Master Groevinger?\" asked Froedwig.\n\"Because, my dear children, it and what it holds are cursed. Now just wh-h-h-o are you?\" he stuttered, mimicing Froedwig.\nFinally gaining his composure, Froedwig said, \"I am Froedwig-aj- Murr of the village Granitsta. This is my sister Silvanda. We are on an outing. Can you tell us about this mysterious hole?\"\n\"Well,\" said the old man as he slowly settled to the ground, \"Why don't you sit here with me for a while and I will tell you about &lt;a href=\"Oelander%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Oelander's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. That's the handle of the fabled weapon sticking out from yonder chasm.\"\nWith this the children also settled into sitting positions in front of the old Redguard ranger.\nGroevinger began, \"Many year's ago there was a huge battle fought in this very field ...\"\n\"Oh, yes, I know,\" said Silvanda, interrupting the old man. \"It was ended by the Warrior God Reymon Ebonarm, and the magic rose bush grows where he stood that day...\" she continued breathlessly.\nThe old man sternly cleared his throat causing the little girl to again shrink behind her brother.\n\"Now, if I may continue without interruption... On the day that battle ended, a young Redguard soldier stopped in this spot as he was leaving to go to his home. He carried the equipment he had used on the field which included a marvelously fashioned war hammer that had been given to him by his father. The weapon was beautifully made and unknown to the young warrior carried an enchantment that had protected him through the vicious battle just ended.\"\n\"The young man, &lt;a href=\"Oelander\"&gt;Oelander&lt;/a&gt; by name, rested by this very tree. Suddenly he was confronted by a wizard dressed all in black from head to toe. Without so much as a how-do-you-do, the wizard demanded that Oelander give him his hammer. Still flushed from the battle, the young man just looked at the dark man and laughed. The wizard shaking with rage raised his hands to cast a horrible spell against the soldier. However, the young man was quicker. The huge war hammer whistled through the air smiting the wizard a mortal blow just as the spell left his fingers. There was a loud explosion.\"\nThe children stared at the old man. He surpressed a grin and continued.\n\"Clouds of dusk and smoke covered the forest clearing, and when the air settled, yon hole was there with the hammer's handle protruding from it. Oelander and the wizard had vanished! The thorny vines you see grew up immediately around the hole, and to this day no one has been able to approach it close enough to remove that marvelous weapon. Many have tried and all have failed. It is said that only someone of tremendous merit can take it.\"\nAll of a sudden, both children in unison stood and shouted, \"Oh, look how the day has gone. We must go. If we are late getting home, our father will be most unhappy with us.\"\nAs they turned to leave, Froedwig said to the old man, \"Thank you, Master Groevinger, for telling us of Oelander's Hammer. You know, I may just come back one day and try to retrieve it!\"\nAs they disappeared from his view, the old man said to himself, \"Ah, yes, Master Froedrig aj-Murr, you just might do that.\""}

The once-proud streets and buildings have vanished and been replaced with a collection of wooden structures and rough stonework shrouded in a permanent fog-like mist. In order to understand how such a large city became nothing more than a glorified fortress, one need only look to the history books for answers.\nRiften was a major hub of activity for trade caravans and travelers to and from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Fishing skiffs could be seen dotting the lake at all hours of the day and the bustling city was alive with activity at night. The city guard was formidable and maintained a tight grasp on its populace, keeping them safe from harm. The marketplace in Riften was also quite a draw, containing numerous stands offering wares from across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt;, amidst the confusion of the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hosgunn%20Crossed-Daggers\"&gt;Hosgunn Crossed-Daggers&lt;/a&gt; was installed as &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; when the previous Jarl had been assassinated. Although many believe that Hosgunn was responsible, and cries of protest filled the streets of Riften, the Jarl took the throne and immediately took action to protect his station. Using the city guard, he had the streets cleared of protesters and initiated a curfew. Any caught breaking the curfew was immediately jailed without process or executed if it was a repeat offence.\nFor over 40 years, Hosgunn ruled Riften with a black heart and an iron fist. He imposed ridiculous taxes upon his subjects and any merchants that wished to sell their wares within the city walls. Hosgunn kept most of the coin for himself, using it to construct a massive wooden castle with unnecessarily lavish quartering within. The castle took seven years to build, and became a visual reminder of the people's oppression which earned it the nickname \"Hosgunn's Folly.\" Towards the end of his reign, the streets of Riften became littered with refuse and it's people plagued by disease and hunger.\nThen, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20129\"&gt;4E 129&lt;/a&gt;, the people had finally had enough. With their numbers, they were able to temporarily overwhelm the city guard long enough to set Hosgunn's Folly on fire with the greedy Jarl still within. As the fighting recommended, the fire spread through the city unchecked. By the morning, the people had emerged victorious, but not without great cost. Most of the city was now in ruins and many had died.\nIt took five years to rebuild Riften into the smaller city that it is today. And even though over fifty years had passed since then, it still has yet to fully recover. Some believe it will never achieve the level of affluence it saw at the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, but there are a few who still hold on to the hope that Riften can return from the ashes and become a center of commerce once again."}

After doing so, the Vestige can meet Veya and Naryu at Kudanat, to which the camp will have been ransacked and torn apart by the Warclaws. The Vestige must find information about this.

After this, the Vestige can head back to Balmora and tell Councilor Eris about Ulran's murder, in which he will end the conversation with an apology directed towards Veya, and the quest will be complete."}

Jephre gave heed to the nature of the forests and delighted in the gurgling streams and brooks. It was Jephre who taught the birds to sing their songs of the seasons and He that taught the streams the tinkling ethereal tune. The very trees are said to have moved close to hear him sing on the warm summer nights of those elder days. It was in this time that the first great ballads of the elves were made, crafted from the songs that Jephre taught to the sylvan youth who frolicked to his lively tunes and ballads of nature and the unspoiled forest. In truth, He is worshipped as &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; of song and forest.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, Jephre is considered one of the Major Sylvan gods with temples and altars in the deep woodland places. Elven tradition holds that children with a gift for song have been blessed by Jephre himself. Legend has it he blessed the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; with a natural affinity for nature and particularly the forest. Most Wood Elven Rangers worship Jephre.\nIt was his great eagerness for natural beauty that led him to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Sumurset\"&gt;Isle of Sumurset&lt;/a&gt;. He taught the great sea birds to sing and molded the crash of wave against beach into a song of whispers and power It is said by the &lt;a href=\"high%20elves\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; that Jephre hears and sees all within distance of water, whether it be beach, brook, stream or fall. It is further said that the very birds keep watch for Jephre, in repayment for the songs he taught them. It is said he blessed the high elves with a beauty to match the beauty of their island home.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dark%20elves\"&gt;dark elves&lt;/a&gt; have a legend that Jephre walked the earth before the first day, and in the light of the stars weaved a song so beautiful that the very stars moved to its sway. Some of the stars to this very day still wink and blink in memory of the song of night and darkness. Due to his influence most if not all Elven &lt;a href=\"Bard\"&gt;Bard&lt;/a&gt;s pay homage to Jephre.\nThe natural order of things is the basis for Jephre's temples in Valenwood and the Sumurset Isle. The one thing Jephre will not tolerate is the harmful manipulation of the natural order of things."}

It serves as an introduction to the storyline.\nBackground.\n\"A junior member of the Mages Guild named Skaldir insists that he and his associates have made a significant magical discovery\u2014one that could prove disastrous if left uninvestigated.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn any of Tamriel's &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; halls, you may come across a document called the \"&lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Eye%20Dispatch\"&gt;Order of the Eye Dispatch&lt;/a&gt;\". This document will mention that one of the mages guild's scryers, &lt;a href=\"Skaldir\"&gt;Skaldir&lt;/a&gt;, has made a great discovery, and wishes to meet you in the &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; guild hall. Head to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deshaan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; to meet him; the moment you arrive, his shadow will come to life and kill him. Speak to &lt;a href=\"Bonafryd\"&gt;Bonafryd&lt;/a&gt; about what just happened, and she will tell you that she and Skaldir belong to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Order of the Eye&lt;/a&gt;, and that they have discovered about a terrible Daedric artifact. She will ask you to go warn the other members of the order. \nThe other members can be visited in any order. &lt;a href=\"Neelo\"&gt;Neelo&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, just east of the wayshrine. He will initially distrust you, but you can intimidate him into acting rationally. If you do not intimidate him, . He will allow you to take &lt;a href=\"Neelo%27s%20Notes\"&gt;his notes&lt;/a&gt;, which he has hidden among the nearby roots. The notes will mention him consistently seeing a Breton woman when scrying for the artifact. \n&lt;a href=\"Adeber%20Loumont\"&gt;Adeber Loumont&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;. Head to the mages guild there and speak with &lt;a href=\"Eloic%20Montieu\"&gt;Eloic Montieu&lt;/a&gt;; he will tell you that Adeber needed some alone time and has probably headed for the area behind the guild hall. Head there, and you will find Adeber's body alongside &lt;a href=\"Adeber%27s%20Journal\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt;. The journal will mention that his scrying with crows has revealed something resembling a door or portal, with a key or arrow going through. You can bring the news of Adeber's demise to Eloic, but doing so will not impact the rest of the quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Wenridil\"&gt;Wenridil&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt;. She will be behind the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Residence\"&gt;Queen's Residence&lt;/a&gt;. The moment you arrive, she will be attacked by her shadow and flee; kill the shadow, then seek her out in the mages guildhall. She will be hiding in the corner; speak with her and she will tell you that she hid &lt;a href=\"Wenridil%27s%20Logbook\"&gt;her notes&lt;/a&gt; in the planter on the other side of the room. These notes will mention that she saw something spherical, yet totally impassable. \nOnce you have warned all three of the other mages, you will see a vision of a woman named &lt;a href=\"Lilatha\"&gt;Lilatha&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her, and she will tell you that she is from the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. She is seeking the same artifact that the scryers are after; she thinks that finding it will help stop the murders. She is having trouble finding it though; she tells you that in order to find the artifact, she will need you to gather two items, an &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anuic Lantern&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Liminal Lens&lt;/a&gt;. These can be used to power an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Obscuros\"&gt;Obscuros&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used to locate the Daedric artifact.\nFor the lantern, Lilatha will direct you to a sunken ship off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;. Said ship will be off the southern coast of the island; search the inside and you will find &lt;a href=\"Soggy%20Note%20%28Online%29\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt; saying that a great prize was stolen from this ship and hidden at &lt;a href=\"Hazak%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Hazak's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, on the northeast of the island. Head there and look for a freshly packed crate; it should be on the westernmost pier. The crate will contain the Anuic Lantern.\nThe Liminal Lens can be found in &lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Sepulchers\"&gt;The Howling Sepulchers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt;. It will be in the northeast, near the end of the road there. Head all the way through the dungeon and to the Dragon Priest's Burial Chamber. The Lens will be in the chest next to where the dragon priest &lt;a href=\"Akiirdal\"&gt;Akiirdal&lt;/a&gt; is standing. You will probably have to defeat him before you can claim the lens, and he is quite strong, so come prepared. On your way out, make sure to take the left path so you can grab the skyshard in this dungeon, if you do not have it already.\nOnce you have both the objects, head to &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;. Lilatha has prepared a boat for you there to take you to her location, but the moment you find it, Bonafryd will appear and tell you not to leave yet. Speak with her and she will tell you that she has been tracking you ever since you spoke to her in Mournhold. She will insist that it is too dangerous to go on this trip alone and that she should come with you. At this point, you can choose whether to accept that offer. If you refuse, she will stay behind and secretly make her own way to the island. Should you accept, you two should then board the boat and set sail for &lt;a href=\"Dranil%20Kir\"&gt;Lilatha's island&lt;/a&gt;. \nOnce you are on the island, follow the path to reach Liliatha's location. You will find her at a campfire; she will tell you to follow her to the Obscuros Scrying Chamber. Inside the chamber, Liliatha will be attacked by her shadow. Defeat it, and then Bonafryd will enter; she reveals herself to be working for the entity that is opposing you, and will proceed to attack. Deal with her too, then place the lens and the lantern in the machine and activate the Obscuros. You will see a vision of something happening in the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;. After seeing the vision, speak with Liliatha to finish the quest."}

Led by Flame-Herald Bahsei, they plan to summon something named Xalvakka. I must purge the area of these brutes and stop their plan before this creature enters our realm.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis walkthrough is for normal mode. Experiences on veteran mode may differ.\nIn Rockgrove, you will find an Argonian named Dust-On-Scales. He will tell you that the xanmeer here has been overrun by the Sul-Xan, who are trying to summon the daedra &lt;a href=\"Xalvakka\"&gt;Xalvakka&lt;/a&gt; by feeding it souls. His apprentices stayed behind to fend off the attackers, but were not heard from since. He will then ask for your help in stopping the Sul-Xan.\nHead through the gate to the east, to the Overgrown Thoroughfare. As you engage with the enemies here, take care to stay out of the water; it will damage you. With regards to the enemies in this dungeon, there are three types: the soulreavers should be lured away from the group and dealt with once all the other enemies are down. They like to throw AoEs around but these can be evaded without too much difficulty. The Death Hoppers are frogs who will target random players regardless of being taunted. The reavers are very strong; take care to avoid their light attacks. Bloodseekers are sinimarly strong, but your true priority should be in taking out Havocrel Torchcasters whenever you see these. \nProceed along the path and dispatch any mobs along the way. If you head northward, you will see a group of wounded militants up ahead. The moment you engage with them, a miniboss will spawn; &lt;a href=\"Basks-In-Snakes\"&gt;Basks-In-Snakes&lt;/a&gt;. True to his name, this guy likes to summon hordes of snakes to his aid, but these are not hard to defeat. Just press the attack and Basks-In-Snakes will die. \nHead back and towards the Xanmeer. In the south of the area, you will find the door to the Ruined Springs. The first boss awaits behind this door; &lt;a href=\"Oaxiltso\"&gt;Oaxiltso&lt;/a&gt; The important thing to take heed of here is the poison mechanic. Every so often the boss will poison a player, which deals damage over time. You know you have been poisoned when your screen turns green. If you have been poisoned, head into one of the pools in the corners of the map to cure yourself; the pool will become poisoned and spawn some Death Hoppers, which must then be dealt with. This boss also likes to spawn a Havocrel Annihilator to help him; take this thing down quickly.\nOnce the boss has been defeated, head on into the Xanmeer. You will have to fight through several rooms full of enemies inside, some of which can be tricky. Make your way to the top, then through the door to face the second boss, &lt;a href=\"Flame-Herald%20Bahsei\"&gt;Flame-Herald Bahsei&lt;/a&gt;. When facing this boss, you will notice the Oblivion Gate in the far right corner of the battlefield. This gate is of little relevance in the battle itself; the boss likes to spawn daedra to help her, but they will not come from the gate. These additional daedra like to use area of effect attacks, but they can be lured into their own area of effect to damage them. Kill the boss's allies when they spawn; focusing on them is important to avoid getting overwhelmed. The boss herself likes to curse the players furthest from her; this will cause explosions that hurt all players in the vicinity. Take care to avoid the blast. At a certain point, meteors will start falling down; watch out for areas of effect. These meteors will contain a sun that must be destroyed as quickly as possible, lest they wipe the group. \nAfter you defeat Bahsei, his soul will be drawn into the oblivion gate; you will hear Xalvakka's voice proclaiming that she is coming. Dust-On-Scales does not know how to close the oblivion gate from the outside; he will ask you to head in to defeat Xalvakka there. Head through and you will find yourself in &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;. Head along the path; you will have to face some enemies along the way, including a miniboss called the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Titan%20%28Rockgrove%29\"&gt;Ash Titan&lt;/a&gt;. This miniboss will have two daedra to help him; focus on the daedra while avoiding the meteors, then shift your attention to the main boss once the other enemies are dead\nHead on after defeating the Titan; you will see a tower up ahead. As you cross the bridge, you will see Xalvakka herself appear on the ground floor of the tower. Head over there and start the fight. She has an attack that will deal 5 hits; the main tank should try to avoid as many hits as possible, though it does not matter if you get hit one or two times. She will also summon ghosts and daedroths to her aid; kill these as they appear. Occasionally, the boss will get a shield around herself; to dispel this shield, . Once the boss is at 70%, she will head for the stairs; follow her, for this floor will soon be one with the lava. There will be fire traps on the staircase; you can take as much time as you want avoiding these, as the staircase will not fall under the lava. On the second floor, the fight will mostly go the same as on the ground floor, except that the boss has one new attack. She will split into three and cover the ground with an area of effect damage. The two copies will be see-through when you approach them; focus your damage on the real boss and she will eventually stop the attack. Once theboss drops to 40%, she will again head for the stairs to the top floor. Follow her, same as before. This final battlefield has a giant hole in the middle; take care not to fall in. It can be difficult to see the floor when the boss is doing her stage-wide area of effect, so pay attention. She will also start throwing fireballs at you. \nOnce Xalvakka lies dead, the souls of the people will be freed, and you will be teleported back to Rockgrove. Speak with Dust-On-Scales here to finish the quest."}

I clean forgot about it. Lots of other things on my mind. Busy hands, lots to do, people to see\u2013you know how it is. Here, take it and go away. I hope Antias appreciates this.\"\nWhen the Vestige speaks to Bosekus Sun-Belly, he will profess his worship of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; and disdain for Zenithar.

He is but a shadow to Sithis, the Perfect Chaos. Perhaps if you do me a favor, I will make an offering.\"\nWhen the offerings have been collected and taken to the shrine, the Vestige should return to Antias to complete the quest and recieve a reward.\n\"You smell like burnt corn.

To this end, Signus sent the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, who had come visited the cave in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Blackreach\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt; with a blank Dwemer &lt;a href=\"lexicon\"&gt;lexicon&lt;/a&gt; to inscribe the information of an Elder Scroll on to. The information informed Signus that he needed the blood of a Dwemer to open the lockbox, but since the Dwemer were extinct, he opt to create a facsimile. He sent the Dragonborn to acquire the blood of various elven races so he could inject himself with the mixture and open the lockbox. Once the lockbox was opened, Signus was turned to dust and Hermaeus Mora granted the \"Oghma Infinium\" to the Dragonborn, hoping they would use the tome's knowledge and serve as his new champion."}

He is also the primary antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College's&lt;/a&gt; storyline.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20King%20Olaf\"&gt;Burning of King Olaf&lt;/a&gt; festival, Olaf is depicted as a tyrant, and an effigy of him is burned. During the &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Tending%20the%20Flames\"&gt;Tending the Flames&lt;/a&gt;,\" a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;King Olaf's Verse&lt;/a&gt;\" must be obtained, before the Bards College can open classes to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. One of the choices for rewriting the \"Verse\" includes changing the character of Olaf into &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Adonato%20Leotelli\"&gt;Adonato Leotelli&lt;/a&gt;'s account, \"&lt;a href=\"Olaf%20and%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Olaf and the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\", Olaf One-Eye fought the dragon Numinex with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, in the presence of several witnesses. Drawing the battle toward Whiterun, Olaf contained the dragon within a prison in the Cloud District. The people of Whiterun renamed the keep &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt; in honor of this task. Numinex stayed there, trapped, until his death.\nOlaf became High King of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; after the battle, facing mixed opinions from his peers. Because most witnesses of his victory against Numinex became extremely wealthy after he became High King, many believed that they were paid to provide false testimony to the events that took place atop Mount Anthor. Sometime during Olaf's reign as High King, Olaf expanded Skyrim's boundaries when he conquered the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe poet &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt; wrote a heretical elegy, defaming Olaf and labeling him a traitor. Copies of Svaknir's script were burned until none remained, save the one buried with Olaf in &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Men%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Dead Men's Respite&lt;/a&gt;, the tomb of Olaf where Svaknir's body was also laid to rest in. Even this script was badly damaged, forcing the Dragonborn to rewrite it with &lt;a href=\"Viarmo\"&gt;Viarmo&lt;/a&gt;, the headmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Tending%20the%20Flames\"&gt;Tending the Flames&lt;/a&gt;.\nViarmo tasks the Dragonborn with recovering Svaknir's lost verse, said to still reside in Olaf's tomb. The verse is needed to convince &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt; of the legitimacy of the Burning of Olaf festival the Bards College wishes to perform. During the recovery of the manuscript, Olaf, whose body has become a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;, attacks and is defeated by the Dragonborn.\nThe Dragonborn can pass a &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;persuade test&lt;/a&gt; to change Olaf's history, where it can be rewritten to show Olaf as actually being a dragon in human form.\n&lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Dragonborn encounters Olaf One-Eye in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe spirit of Olaf states that, despite Svaknir's defaming words, he respects the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt; as an honest opponent, and wished to greet him as a friend in the Hall of Valor, meaning that there could have been some truth to Svaknir\u2019s account of Olaf\u2019s capture of the dragon. Svaknir is seen making his way to the Hall of Valor.

{"id": "65247", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=65247", "title": "Olaf and the Dragon", "text": "Olaf and the Dragon is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nOne of the more colorful legends in &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord folklore&lt;/a&gt; is the tale of &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago in the First Age, a fearsome &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; named Numinex ravaged the whole of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadful drake wiped out entire villages, burned cities and killed countless Nords. It seemed that no power in Tamriel could stop the monster.\nThis was a troubled time in Skyrim's history, for a bitter war of succession raged between the &lt;a href=\"holds\"&gt;holds&lt;/a&gt;. The Jarls might have been able to the beast if they had worked together, but trust was in desperately short supply.\nA skillful warrior named Olaf came forward and promised to defeat the beast. In some accounts, he is the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. In other versions of the legend, Olaf promises the people of Whiterun that he will capture the monster if they will name him Jarl. At any rate, Olaf ventures forth with a handful of his most trusted warriors and seeks the beast out, eventually finding Numinex in his lair atop . Needless to say, it's an epic battle.\nFirst, Olaf comes at the dragon with his &lt;a href=\"Axe%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;. Some variants of the legend say that Olaf and the beast battled with blade and claw for days, but were too evenly matched for either to gain an advantage. Most accounts hold that Olaf, perhaps frustrated that his &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; are completely ineffectual against the dragon, finally casts them aside. Giving voice to the rage that has been building within him, Olaf unleashes a terrible &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere again, the stories diverge. Many accounts hold that Olaf did not realize he possessed the power of Dragon-speech, while others suggest that he had long possessed this gift, but wished to test himself against the dragon in martial combat first. Virtually all variations of the legend, however, agree on what happened next.\nUsing the awesome powers of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20language\"&gt;Dragon language&lt;/a&gt;, Numinex and Olaf engage in an epic shouting duel atop Mount Athor. So forceful are their words, they are said to shatter the stone and split the sky. Finally, Numinex collapses from a combination of injury and sheer exhaustion. Somehow - and this detail is conspicuously absent in virtually every account - Olaf manages to convey the dragon all the way back to the capital city of Whiterun.\nThe people of Whiterun are suitably impressed with Olaf's hostage. They build a huge stone holding cell at the rear of the palace, which they rename \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;.\" This enormous cell serves as Numinex's prison until his death.\nOlaf himself eventually becomes the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim, putting an end to the war of succession. Presumably, his great deed made him the only leader upon whom all the people could agree, and so the land once again has peace.\nAs a visitor to Skyrim, I find this tale both fascinating and highly entertaining. It is one of the most celebrated legends of the Nords, and one can easily understand why. It's a story of surpassing heroism, in which a resourceful and worthy Nord does battle with a truly terrifying adversary and emerges victorious by yelling him into submission. The only way in which this could have been even more of a Nordic tale would be if Olaf beat Numinex in a drinking contest.\nThe legend is not without its doubters, however. The bard &lt;a href=\"Svaknir\"&gt;Svaknir&lt;/a&gt;, who lived during Olaf's reign, wrote and performed an alliterative &lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;verse&lt;/a&gt; that challenged Olaf's version of events. Enraged, the High King threw the rebellious bard in prison and destroyed all written copies of the verse. How I would love to lay hands on a copy of that verse! I admit, I am immensely curious to know what assertions Svaknir made about how Olaf really defeated Numinex.\nThere are a few ancient bard texts that provide one possible answer. These tomes suggest that Numinex was particularly foul-tempered because he was extremely old. In these accounts, the dragon spends his final years terrorizing the country side before flying off to the top of Mount Athor to die in peace.\nWhen Olaf finds Numinex, the dragon is too weak to defend himself. Olaf and his men capture the beast without effort, but decide to take advantage of the situation by fabricating a heroic tale. It is worth noting that all of Olaf's warriors who were said to witness the shout duel went on to become wealth leaders during Olaf's reign as High King.\nHowever, it is equally likely that Svaknir had some grudge against Olaf, and his scandalous verse was an attempt to damage the High King's reputation. Alas, we will never know.\nI leave you now, good reader, with this gentle reminder: A good historian must remain impartial, and consider all points of view. Time has a way of distorting our record of events, so the closer you can get to the original sources, the better!"}

Grafting the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;heartstone&lt;/a&gt; to the subject is proving much more difficult than I originally anticipated. I've used almost every method I can think of, and still there's no sign of reanimation. At this rate, it could be years before I make any progress... which is time that I just can't afford right now. If my vengeance is to come to fruition, I need results. If not, I may need to resort to more dramatic measures.\nDay 47\nIt finally appears that I'm making some progress. After my latest experiment, &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Carius&lt;/a&gt;'s eyes briefly opened and he moved his arms. It lasted for less than a few moments, but it's the first sign of progress I've seen since I arrived here. A few of my assistants were insisting that I was imagining things, but I dismissed them for their insolence. They won't be bothering anyone ever again.\nDay 55\nGeneral Carius awoke fully today. He bolted upright after my incantations and began staggering around like a blind man. He seemed to ignore my commands... in fact, hearing my voice seemed to increase his hostility. I was able to remove the hearstone before he became violent, but this isn't a result that I expected. Even though he's able to be awakened, I feel as though the real work has just begun.\nDay 59\nThe general is still unable or unwilling to listen to my commands. He's acting increasingly paranoid, and appears to have his own free will. He's convinced that I am a \"spy\" or the \"enemy,\" and I've had to restrain him to prevent him from outright attacking me. This is becoming intolerable. I'm beginning to wonder if someone with a heartstone can be commanded at all. If my experiments with General Carius fail, I may have to resort to self-experimentation... something I've been avoiding for a long time."}

I need more power.\nI'm out of test subjects, except for &lt;a href=\"Niyya\"&gt;Niyya&lt;/a&gt;. I saved her for last. She pretended to be my friend when I first came here. But now I know the truth. The voices have told me all about her lies and betrayal. She works with Neloth to bring me down. I've saved a special experiment just for her. It will take quite a while to complete.\nI can't attack Neloth directly, he's too powerful. But I can make his life uncomfortable. I've killed &lt;a href=\"Varona%20Nelas%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;his steward&lt;/a&gt;. I've withered &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;his home&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe I should poison his precious tea.

Ildari, his apprentice, volunteered to be his test subject before he underwent the operation himself, but she was accidentally killed when Neloth performed the operation incorrectly, a death he describes as \"most annoying.\" At least, that was what he believed \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; found her empty sarcophagus, and this led Neloth to suspect she was kept from dying by the Heart Stone still embedded in her chest. From her journals, it becomes apparent during the quest Old Friends that Ildari survived, and greatly resents Neloth's bungled operation \u2014 mentioning that he promised her power and glory but gave her only great pain \u2014 and that she plans to get her revenge by necromantically raising an army of &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt; to destroy &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter escaping her grave, Ildari traveled to &lt;a href=\"Highpoint%20Tower\"&gt;Highpoint Tower&lt;/a&gt; and was taken in by a group of miners, who believed she was severely injured and nursed her back to health. Through the Heart Stone, Ildari noticed that she had become stronger, could feel the \"bones in the ash\" calling to her, and had learned how to \"bind the spirits to bone and ash and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;raise a servant&lt;/a&gt; to do [her] bidding\" (according to &lt;a href=\"Ildari%27s%20Journal%2C%20vol.%20II\"&gt;volume II of her journal&lt;/a&gt;). However, she also started to become paranoid from constantly hearing the bones' voices in her head. The voices told her that the miners wanted her Heart Stone for themselves. Raising her Ash Spawn from the ground, she killed the miners' leader and then imprisoned the others as her own test subjects, though it is unknown what experiments she conducted on them. Highpoint Tower thereby became her base of operations where she could plot her revenge upon Neloth undisturbed.\n&lt;a href=\"Ildari%27s%20journal\"&gt;Ildari's journal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; (unrelated to the three volumes found in Highpoint Tower) details her successful attempts at re-animating &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt; from the dead, to use him as a puppet in her plan to get revenge on Neloth.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;March of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer former presence in Fort Frostmoth is attested to by a journal of hers found in the fort's underground crypt during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"March%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;March of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Friends\"&gt;Old Friends&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is under attack by an unknown force.\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0killed &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt;'s previous steward &lt;a href=\"Varona%20Nelas%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Varona Nelas&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0and part of his tower mysteriously withered.\nAfter Neloth assigns to the Dragonborn the task of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;finding him a new steward&lt;/a&gt;, and after the withered part of Tel Mithryn\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Healing%20a%20House\"&gt;is repaired&lt;/a&gt;, a third attack causes Neloth to reveal to the Dragonborn his suspicion that the attacks are organized - the same suspicion that\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Veleth\"&gt;Captain Veleth&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0has about the attacks on\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Neloth gives the Dragonborn the task of discovering the source of the attacks. After a while, it turns out that Ildari is behind the attacks, in search of revenge.\nDialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Friends\"&gt;Old Friends&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"You've gone far enough. Neloth is a fool to think he could send some low life to finish me off.\"\nCombat.\nIn combat, Ildari will use her Staff of Lightning Bolts, ward and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shock&lt;/a&gt; spells. If fought in her final chambers, she will be aided by two soul-gem fueled traps that will shoot lightning towards intruders. These traps can be disabled by removing the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; manually or with a projectile.\nShe can be defeated at any time after she initially appears in the line of sight of the player. With a powerful shot or blow in stealth, she may go down in one hit. However, after her health is depleted, as long as she still possesses her heart stone, she will not die. She will drop to one knee, still alive, and can be further attacked, but not damaged. Once downed, the Dragonborn can interact with her and choose the \"Rip Heart Out\" option to kill her. Alternatively, if her heart stone is pickpocketed, she will also die."}

Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Ilessan Hills in their quest to recover the pieces.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the Barony of the Ilessan Hills was under the reign of an unknown Baron, whose name was not recorded in the history books. The Ilessan Hills existed among the twenty-three other nations of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The Ilessan Hills, itself is in a mainland march that is next to the Kingdom of Daggerfall, one of the three great kingdoms of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Later in the same year, the Warp in the West resulted in the Kingdoms expanding their territories, absorbing the smaller nations. The Barony of the Ilessan Hills was annexed into the Kingdom of Daggerfall along with other regions on the northern coast of the Iliac. The forested regions of the Ilessan Hills and &lt;a href=\"Daenia\"&gt;Daenia&lt;/a&gt; were affected greatly by the Warp. Forest fires would erupt between the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms."}

The fort is divided into two sections: Ilinalta's Deep and Ilinalta's Deluge.\nHistory.\nAfter killing one of his students at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, Malyn Varen came to this area to experiment with &lt;a href=\"Azura%27s%20Star%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to achieve immortality by trapping himself inside the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Artifacts%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric artifact&lt;/a&gt;.\nSublocations.\nIlinalta's Deep.\nThe fort is mostly submerged, and has only one entrance, a trapdoor on the top of the large sunken tower. Upon entering the fort the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will be confronted with a crucified skeleton. In the room with a large body of water, there is an underwater passage that leads to a room with a chest and dresser, and the &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Breathing%20Water\"&gt;Breathing Water&lt;/a&gt;\", floating near the ceiling. In the room with the drop-down bridge, there is an underwater door with a lock to pick. Behind the door are a shelf and a chest.\nIlinalta's Deluge.\nThis level opens into a large room with a small storage room to the east. The &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Doors%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;The Doors of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;\" is on a table in the northwest part of this room. The next hallway contains six prison cells, four of which are secured with Adept-level locks. The next &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; can be challenging to a Dragonborn who is unprepared and/or of a low level; his skeletal minions also seem to be very effective against any followers that may be with the player. The following room is partially underwater, with a raised area the necromancers have been using for sacrifices. Curving stairwells lead up towards the next room, and down into the water. The final room contains Malyn Varen's skeleton and the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Broken Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;, along with a ladder that leads outside to the top of the mostly intact tower in the lake.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Star%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Black Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nHelp find and repair Azura's Star.\n&lt;a href=\"Arniel%27s%20Endeavor\"&gt;Arniel's Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;.\nUncover an ancient Dwemer secret (radiant).\n&lt;a href=\"Totems%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Totems of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.\nRetrieve the Totem of Hircine (radiant).\nTrivia.\nNecromancer 1 \"More souls are needed for the Star.

He's given me the ring he stole and asked me to entreat Hircine for forgiveness.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may hear rumors of the savage murder of a little girl. Alternatively, one can walk to the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; on the edge of town, where her parents are holding a funeral with the priest of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Runil\"&gt;Runil&lt;/a&gt;, and talk to them. In either case, no one seems quite sure how someone could commit such a horrible crime, but the culprit is currently locked away in the &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Jail\"&gt;Falkreath Jail&lt;/a&gt; if the Dragonborn wants to find out.\nThe Hunt.\n&lt;a href=\"Sinding\"&gt;Sinding&lt;/a&gt; (found in Falkreath Jail, under the Barracks) will tell the Dragonborn of a rare animal, the &lt;a href=\"White%20Stag\"&gt;White Stag&lt;/a&gt;, that needs to be killed to appease Hircine, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt. Sinding gives the Dragonborn the &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Ring%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Cursed Ring of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, which auto-equips and cannot be removed. While worn, it causes the wearer to transform into a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; at random, even if they do not have &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt;. Note that transforming will remove all equipped items, including the ring, so transforming once will solve the problem of unpredictable transformations.\nAfter that, Sinding escapes, transforming into his &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Form%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Beast Form&lt;/a&gt; to climb out of his cell. To remove the cursed ring, the Dragonborn must track down the White Stag and slay it. Note that the White Stag regenerates health very quickly, so it may be difficult for low-level players to kill it. It also runs away from the player and &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;, just like a regular Elk. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak-attacks&lt;/a&gt; with bows will be useful here, as well as powerful &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Incinerate\"&gt;Incinerate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Spear\"&gt;Icy Spear&lt;/a&gt;, especially if dual-cast. After having killed it, the Stag's spirit appears and approaches the Dragonborn, and Hircine will speak through it. He commands the Dragonborn to go to the place where Sinding has fled, and to kill him to gain the Daedric Lord's favor.\nSinding can be found at &lt;a href=\"Bloated%20Man%27s%20Grotto\"&gt;Bloated Man's Grotto&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving, the Dragonborn will meet some hunters at a campsite, who are outmatched by Sinding. Note that if the player is in werewolf form, talking with the necessary characters is not possible, so wait for it to wear off.\nTalking with the dying &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"J%27Kier\"&gt;J'Kier&lt;/a&gt;, will reveal that Sinding is too strong for the &lt;a href=\"Hunters%20of%20Hircine\"&gt;Hunters of Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, and he will tell the player to kill Sinding in the name of Hircine before dying. The objective at this point is to wander through the walkways until Sinding is met in a clearing; he will speak to the player from his perch on a rock outcropping. There are two choices at the end of the conversation; one is to tell him that he will be killed for Hircine, the other is to tell Sinding that they will kill the hunters for him.\nKilling Sinding.\n\"You've done well, hunter.\"\nPicking the dialogue option to kill Sinding will make him accept his fate, though he will flee through the pathways away from the player, killing Hunters as he goes, until he reaches a dead end.\nSinding is a powerful foe, and often uses power attacks. &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost-based&lt;/a&gt; attacks can be useful here, as they will drain his Stamina, preventing as many power attacks. Note that he is immune to &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralyzing&lt;/a&gt; spells and poisons. When low of health, he will not yield but rather attempt to flee. This can be used to an advantage to attack him without reprisal. After he is dead, skin him and the aspect of Hircine appears in Sinding's ghostly human form, congratulating them and Hircine will give the player the &lt;a href=\"Savior%27s%20Hide%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Savior's Hide&lt;/a&gt;.\nSaving Sinding.\n\"Well met again, Hunter.\"\nIf the dialogue option is selected to spare him, Sinding will be grateful, and he will help the player kill the Hunters, saying \"We will hunt together!\"\nEven if a high level, the Hunters are not very powerful foes; and still wear low-level armor, such as &lt;a href=\"Hide%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Armor\"&gt;studded&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fur%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fur&lt;/a&gt; armors. Some Hunters wear only clothing, while one or two wear &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Armor\"&gt;Steel Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Each area along the path to the dead end has two-three Hunters. Having a follower along will help if having trouble, and Sinding can kill the Hunters in two hits.\nAfter the dead end is reached and the Hunters have been killed, speak to Sinding. After the conversation ends, leave him and exit the Grotto to meet Hircine, who will congratulate the player and give them their reward.\nReward.\nThe reward received varies depending on the Dragonborn's choices:\nIt is also possible to obtain both of these rewards using one of a number of similar exploits:"}

One downside to this skill is that most races start with relatively low &lt;a href=\"Personality%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Personality&lt;/a&gt;. Also &lt;a href=\"Mercantile%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mercantile&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Speechcraft%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speechcraft&lt;/a&gt; are not considered very useful. This makes it very hard to raise the Personality attribute high enough to get the most use out of one's magicka. The most useful spells in this skill set are not accessible until journeyman level. Despite all this, Illusion is ideal for sneaks and mages. &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Night-Eye%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt; are great for sneaking around in the dark. Silence is good for stopping mages in their tracks. &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt; is costly but can be a lifesaver. &lt;a href=\"Light%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; spells will be appreciated by almost any character (except a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;), that hates stumbling around in dark dungeons. Illusion is the magic specialty of the &lt;a href=\"Bravil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; mages guild chapter. Also, with 100% chameleon, the Hero is completely invisible in the game, though enemies can still hear any noises made.\nActually, Illusion magic can be very useful for players who do not increase their Personality attribute. &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Charm&lt;/a&gt; is a great spell to use on characters when getting important information without worrying about Speechcraft. If one joins the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, a useful, cheap Charm spell can be created. A simple high-magnitude, low-duration (five seconds should be ample, as time stops when an NPC is spoken to), spell does not cost much to cast, and can be extremely valuable for a character with low Personality, Speechcraft or &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;."}

I mean, look at old Bols over there with his old, sweat-and-saliva stained shirt, his head like a giant, corprus-infected melon, and that faltered gait of his like a guar with venereal warts. It's a wonder he even remembers to put on his pants in the morning, it really is. Now, compare him with me.\"\"Yes, just look at me. I'm the picture of perfection. Look at these nails. Do you know how much I had to pay these filthy Hlaalu manicurists for these? Look at my flawless complexion, the ideal proportions of my body. Do you think the gods created such an image of majesty for the purpose of blacksmithing? Certainly not, my very naive friend. Clearly I'm destined to become an adventurer.\"\"\nbecome an adventurer \"Do you mock me, plebe? I aspire to heights greater than you've ever dreamed of. Do you think monsters and evil man will stand any chance when they behold this majestic specimen of humanity striding toward them? No! The will quail and faint at the sight of me. I will wave their corpses aside with a swipe of my hand. My greatness is inevitbale. In fact, I believe I will start on my adventuring just today.

Her eyes' color was red, like the last fading of a sunset.\nHistory.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; disappeared, the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; needed a source of power to hold &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; in the air. The &lt;a href=\"Ingenium\"&gt;Ingenium&lt;/a&gt; was used to keep the &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Ministry of Truth&lt;/a&gt; floating. In order to work properly, the Ingenium needed mortal souls. Firstly, only the souls of criminals and outlaws were used to run the Ingenium. Yet, &lt;a href=\"Vuhon\"&gt;Vuhon&lt;/a&gt; discovered that around twelve 'large' souls could power it for for months.\nAccording to Vuhon, Ilzheven had the right sort of soul, so she was chosen to power the Ingenium. However, Sul claimed that she had been chosen because she loved Sul and not Vuhon. Sul tried to save her, but he ended up destroying the Ingenium. Ilzheven died and Baar Dau fell destroying &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; and its surroundings. It is thought that the collision was the direct cause of the eruption of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe appeared in a vision sent by &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; to Sul as the last time he saw her, pale and lifeless. Sul traveled to &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; searching for &lt;a href=\"Umbra\"&gt;Umbra&lt;/a&gt;. However, he found an excavation where the sword should have been. Someone had taken the sword. Ilzheven's ghost formed from a column of dust. Sul had to control his feelings to ask her what had happened to Umbra. Ilzheven told him that a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; wearing a ring with a draugr had taken the sword. She also told Sul that she knew what had happened and to let it go."}

{"id": "3324", "revid": "32767830", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3324", "title": "Imga", "text": "The Imga, also known as Great Apes, are a race of ape-like &lt;a href=\"beastfolk\"&gt;beastfolk&lt;/a&gt; native to the province of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. The Imga, along with the other beastfolk of Valenwood, are believed to have prospered in the area before &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i intervention. The &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; sometimes use them as slaves, as they do with other beastfolk.\nBackground.\nThe Imga commonly view &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; as their superiors and view their society with high esteem. Imga are known to try to emulate their Altmer masters by wearing capes, duelling with swords and attempting to speak with dialect that presents perfect enunciation and courtly manners despite their heavy and baritone voices. Some Imga who desperately want to imitate their overlords are known to shave their bodies and powder their skin white to appear more like the Altmer. In doing this, they often accidentally cut themselves in the process. However, the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; was an Imga who did not share the beliefs of his fellow Great Apes; in fact, Marukh apparently despised all &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, all Imga disappeared from Valenwood. According to the author &lt;a href=\"Cirantille\"&gt;Cirantille&lt;/a&gt;, the Imga had \"gone to visit &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;\" in order to wait out the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Falinesti had also disappeared some years prior to 2E 582, and it is unknown when the city or the race returned to the province. Imga refer to each other with gentry affiliated titles such as Baron, Duke, or Earl when addressing members of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, despite not having any actual holdings of their own. Instead, Imga are normally known to take up refuge in old human trading posts of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; that have long since been abandoned. Despite their use of old human trading posts as shelter, Imga seem to normally believe that humans are lesser beings than themselves and, in order to show this, pretend that humans smell bad when in their presence by holding a perfumed corner of their capes to their noses. Whether or not Imga still hold these anti-human beliefs is unknown, but some more recent sources seem to show them working with humans without any issues.\nImga are known to be naturally dexterous and can quickly climb through trees with relative ease. For this reason, colonies of Imga are known to annually harvest &lt;a href=\"Kollopi\"&gt;Kollopi&lt;/a&gt; from the precarious &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt;, a well-known Valenwood delicacy. Imga are considered by some to be idiotic and baboonish, often noted to grin everywhere they go. It is currently unknown how the reproductive system of the Imga works. There is a species of small monkey-like creatures known as &lt;a href=\"Imgakin%20Monkey\"&gt;Imgakin&lt;/a&gt;, though it is unknown if they bare any relation to the Imga.\nAppearance.\nImga naturally grow fur, which can sometimes be white in color."}

In order to free him, a prisoner registry in the steward of Whiterun's quarters must be changed and a letter stolen from the Jarl's quarters in Dragonsreach.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing five Small Jobs in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin Mallory&lt;/a&gt; receives an urgent missive from &lt;a href=\"Olfrid%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Olfrid Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt;, a wealthy &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; residing in Whiterun. It appears that &lt;a href=\"Arn\"&gt;Arn&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of Olfrid, who was incarcerated inside Whiterun's prison, committed a serious crime in &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; that will result in his execution. The guards in Whiterun do not yet know of Arn's identity, and Olfrid intends to forge Arn a new identity in order to avoid his execution.\nHead to Olfrid Battle-Born in Whiterun. He will tell the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; that they need to do two things: steal a letter from the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;'s quarters and change the prisoner registry in the Steward's quarters.\nNow go to &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, the Jarl's\u00a0palace. Walk up the stairs to the right of the Jarl's throne and enter the door on the left to the Jarl's quarters. The prison registry is on a table in the room immediately to the right, where the steward's quarters are. Activate it to forge the necessary information. Make sure to do so when the Jarl's Steward is not in the room, and the doors are closed to avoid being noticed by the Hold Guards patrolling outside the room.\nThere are three guards usually walking around. Up the stairs in the next room, go right to the Jarl's study/office area and take the letter from the desk. On the desk is a skill book as well: \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Ages%20of%20Man\"&gt;Before the Ages of Man&lt;/a&gt;\". Read it for a point in &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt;. While here, do not forget to grab the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;Stone of Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; that is here as well if not collected earlier. Now exit the castle and return to Olfrid. He may be in the &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Huntsman\"&gt;Drunken Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;. He is quite pleased with this and promises his support for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; with handling things for them in Whiterun with the full support of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Battle-Born\"&gt;Clan Battle-Born&lt;/a&gt; behind him.\nUpon completion of this quest, a &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;random enchanted leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt; will be received. Return to Delvin to see that the Flagon has improved slightly with a new merchant having moved in."}

The town guard had to carry torches to make their rounds; but the man who came to call at my chapel carried no light with him. I came to learn that &lt;a href=\"Movarth%20Piquine\"&gt;Movarth Piquine&lt;/a&gt; could see in the dark almost as well as the light - an excellent talent, considering his interests were exclusively nocturnal.\nOne of my acolytes brought him to me, and from the look of him, I at first thought he was in need of healing. He was pale to the point of opalescence with a face that looked like it had once been very handsome before some unspeakable suffering. The dark circles under his eyes bespoke exhaustion, but the eyes themselves were alert, intense, almost insane.\nHe quickly dismissed my notion that he himself was ill, though he did want to discuss a specific disease.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;,\" he said, and then paused at my quizzical look. \"I was told that you were someone I should seek out for help understanding it.\"\n\"Who told you that?\" I asked with a smile.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Tissina%20Gray\"&gt;Tissina Gray&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nI immediately remembered her. A brave, beautiful knight who had needed my assistance separating fact from fiction on the subject of the vampire. It had been two years, and I had never heard whether my advice had proved effective.\n\"You've spoken to her? How is her ladyship?\" I asked.\n\"Dead,\" Movarth replied coldly, and then, responding to my shock, he added to perhaps soften the blow. \"She said your advice was invaluable, at least for the one vampire. When last I talked to her, she was tracking another. It killed her.\"\n\"Then the advice I gave her was not enough,\" I sighed. \"Why do you think it would be enough for you?\"\n\"I was a teacher once myself, years ago,\" he said. \"Not in a university. A trainer in the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. But I know that if a student doesn't ask the right questions, the teacher cannot be responsible for his failure. I intend to ask you the right questions.\"\nAnd that he did. For hours, he asked questions and I answered what I could, but he never volunteered any information about himself. He never smiled. He only studied me with those intense eyes of his, committing every word I said to memory.\nFinally, I turned the questioning around. \"You said you were a trainer at the Fighters Guild. Are you on an assignment for them?\"\n\"No,\" he said curtly, and finally I could detect some weariness in those feverish eyes of his. \"I would like to continue this tomorrow night, if I could. I need to get some sleep and absorb this.\"\n\"You sleep during the day,\" I smiled.\nTo my surprise, he returned the smile, though it was more of a grimace. \"When tracking your prey, you adapt their habits.\"\nThe next day, he did return with more questions, these ones very specific. He wanted to know about the vampires of eastern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. I told him about the most powerful tribe, the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan\"&gt;Volkihar Clan&lt;/a&gt;, paranoid and cruel, whose very breath could freeze their victims' blood in the veins. I explained to him how they lived beneath the ice of remote and haunted lakes, never venturing into the world of men except to feed.\nMovarth Piquine listened carefully, and asked more questions into the night, until at last he was ready to leave.\n\"I will not see you for a few days,\" he said. \"But I will return, and tell you how helpful your information has been.\"\nTrue to his word, the man returned to my chapel shortly after midnight four days later. There was a fresh scar on his cheek, but he was smiling that grim but satisfied smile of his.\n\"Your advice helped me very much,\" he said. \"But you should know that the Volkihar have an additional ability you didn't mention. They can reach through the ice of their lakes without breaking it. It was quite a nasty surprise, being grabbed from below without any warning.\"\n\"How remarkable,\" I said with a laugh. \"And terrifying. You're lucky you survived.\"\n\"I don't believe in luck. I believe in knowledge and training. Your information helped me, and my skill at melee combat sealed the bloodsucker's fate. I've never believed in weaponry of any kind. Too many unknowns. Even the best swordsmith has created a flawed blade, but you know what your body is capable of. I know I can land a thousand blows without losing my balance, provided I get the first strike.\"\n\"The first strike?\" I murmured. \"So you must never be surprised.\"\n\"That is why I came to you,\" said Movarth. \"You know more than anyone alive about these monsters, in all their cursed varieties across the land. Now you must tell me about the vampires of northern &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nI did as he asked, and once again, his questions taxed my knowledge. There were many tribes to cover. The &lt;a href=\"Bonsamu\"&gt;Bonsamu&lt;/a&gt; who were indistinguishable from &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; except when seen by candlelight. The &lt;a href=\"Keerilth\"&gt;Keerilth&lt;/a&gt; who could disintegrate into mist. The &lt;a href=\"Yekef\"&gt;Yekef&lt;/a&gt; who swallowed men whole. The dread &lt;a href=\"Telboth\"&gt;Telboth&lt;/a&gt; who preyed on children, eventually taking their place in the family, waiting patiently for years before murdering them all in their unnatural hunger.\nOnce again, he bade me farewell, promising to return in a few weeks, and once again, he returned as he said, just after midnight. This time, Movarth had no fresh scars, but he again had new information.\n\"You were wrong about the Keerilth being unable to vaporize when pushed underwater,\" he said, patting my shoulder fondly. \"Fortunately, they cannot travel far in their mist form, and I was able to track it down.\"\n\"It must have surprised it fearfully. Your field knowledge is becoming impressive,\" I said. \"I should have had an acolyte like you decades ago.\"\n\"Now, tell me,\" he said. \"Of the vampires of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nI told him what I could. There was but one tribe in Cyrodiil, a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20Vampyrum%20Order\"&gt;powerful clan&lt;/a&gt; who had ousted all other competitors, much like the Imperials themselves had done. Their true name was unknown, lost in history, but they were experts at concealment. If they kept themselves well-fed, they were indistinguishable from living persons. They were cultured, more civilized than the vampires of the provinces, preferring to feed on victims while they were asleep, unaware.\n\"They will be difficult to surprise,\" Movarth frowned. \"But I will seek one out, and tell you what I learn. And then you will tell me of the vampires of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and the Summerset Isles, yes?\"\nI nodded, knowing then that this was a man on an eternal quest. He wouldn't be satisfied with but the barest hint of how things were. He needed to know it all.\nHe did not return for a month, and on the night that he did, I could see his frustration and despair, though there were no lights burning in my chapel.\n\"I failed,\" he said, as I lit a candle. \"You were right. I could not find a single one.\"\nI brought the light up to my face and smiled. He was surprised, even stunned by the pallor of my flesh, the dark hunger in my ageless eyes, and the teeth. Oh, yes, I think the teeth definitely surprised the man who could not afford to be surprised.\n\"I haven't fed in seventy-two hours,\" I explained, as I fell on him. He did not land the first blow or the last."}

The \"&lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fortify Destruction&lt;/a&gt;\" property is useful for reducing the &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; cost (armor) and increasing the damage inflicted (potion).

As you know, the city's underground is a complex nest of sewer drains and crumbling Ayleid ruins. We've always assumed that there was a grand design in their construction, but lacked the requisite resources to prove it. Now, with help from &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chancellor Tharn&lt;/a&gt; and the wise &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, we've been able to delve deeper than we ever thought possible.\nOur survey indicates that all channels and passages eventually lead to the &lt;a href=\"Centrata\"&gt;Centrata&lt;/a&gt;, a massive underground chamber that houses the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;'s foundation. I can tell you, it is quite a sight to behold. The Tower rests on a stone monopile, supported by six massive vaults. The significance of this discovery cannot be overstated. It confirms countless architectural theories about the six districts' connections to the Tower and the age of the city's infrastructure. It might also grant us valuable insights into the nature of the White-Gold Tower and its power over &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nI would like to conduct a more thorough investigation, but our esteemed benefactor Mannimarco has declared the area off-limits. I do not mean to sound ungrateful. Without his help we never would have found the Centrata. But we still have a great deal to learn about how the chamber was constructed. I hope that the Elder Council might intercede on our behalf.\nBest regards,\n&lt;a href=\"Mycaelis%20Julus\"&gt;Mycaelis Julus&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial Architect, Council for Civic Planning"}

{"id": "5987", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5987", "title": "Imperial Battlemage", "text": "The term Imperial Battlemage has had a variety of meanings throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;'s history. Most generally it refers to a &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; directly in the service of the Emperor of Tamriel, and who serves as part of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;. Imperial Battlemage has also been used to refer to a body of Battlemage troops, most particularly those which were trained at the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe title initially referred to an elite form of troops in the service of either the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; (the text is unclear which started the tradition). Initially, the term merely referred to battlemages in general, which were a new form of combat troops at the time, but under the Reman Empire came to refer to the leader of these troops, who was also granted a seat on the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;. Following the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Potentate\"&gt;Akaviri Potentate&lt;/a&gt;, the post was used generally to refer to warrior-caster troops, without any political connotation.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; appointed &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt; to the position in its former meaning, and the term had fallen into enough disuse that Arctus is sometimes considered the first to hold the post. Arctus takes an active role in the diplomacy and politics of Tiber's conquest, in addition to performing ceremonial and research duties for his emperor. It is at this time that we see the title Grand Battlemage used to describe the leader of the Imperial Battlemages unit.\nAfter Zurin's death, it seems no further Imperial Battlemages were appointed during Tiber's rule, and the post lay vacant until revived by the Empress &lt;a href=\"Morihatha%20Septim\"&gt;Morihatha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next known Imperial Battlemage was under the service of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn imprisoned Uriel in 3E 389, and impersonated him until his defeat by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Barenziah\"&gt;Queen Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;'s champion ten years later. He was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Ocato\"&gt;Ocato&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Stormcrown%20Interregnum\"&gt;Stormcrown Interregnum&lt;/a&gt;, there have been no known Imperial Battlemages."}

When &lt;a href=\"Lokir\"&gt;Lokir&lt;/a&gt; panics and makes a run for it, she orders him cut down by archers and asks if anyone else feels like running, before turning her attention to the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their name not being on the list of those to be executed, she insists that they be sent to the block and executed anyway. During the execution, she commands the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20Arkay\"&gt;Priestess of Arkay&lt;/a&gt; to give the condemned their last rites, which is interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; who insists upon getting his execution over with, and places her foot upon the back of each of the condemned to prepare them for the Headsman. After one soldier is executed, the Captain will single out the Dragonborn as the next victim, with a unique comment dependent on their chosen race. When Alduin arrives, she will yell at the sentries to report on what they see before the dragon unleashes his fury on the town.\nIf the Dragonborn\u00a0follows &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial Captain is never seen again. If &lt;a href=\"Ralof\"&gt;Ralof&lt;/a&gt; is followed, the Imperial Captain, along with one of her soldiers, will flee into the tunnels beneath the town. Upon unlocking the door that leads into the keep, she and the soldier will attack Ralof and the Dragonborn to prevent their escape. She must be killed to get the key to exit the keep.\nConversations.\nPrisoners Dragonborn, Ulfric, Ralof, and Lokir are transported by cart to their execution.\nCaptain: \"Get these prisoners out of the carts.

This version of the Census was written before &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel VII&lt;/a&gt;'s demise, and is contemporary with &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20Guide%20to%20the%20Empire%2C%20Third%20Edition\"&gt;the current Pocketguide&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnjoy.\n-MK\nThe Imperial Census of Daedra Lords.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Dusk and Dawn, maintains the domain of &lt;a href=\"Moonshadow%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Moonshadow&lt;/a&gt;, a twilight country of shades and half-thoughts. Visitors to this isle have historically come mainly from the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; of eastern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;catfolk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, whose people both hold a great affection for the mother of immanence, though by separate roads. At the time of this writing, regular gateways to Moonshadow have been inaccessible for the last several years. Whether this has to do with the unlawful incidents at &lt;a href=\"Hogithum\"&gt;Hogithum Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the Capital City or mere whim of Azura herself, no one can say. Of course, Azura's most famous acts of recent times is the Incarnation of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, a subject that while far beyond the scope of this pamphlet has been felt to the present day.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, the so-called Prince of Plots, has renamed his country of labyrinthine policy and betrayals yet again. Formerly \u201c&lt;a href=\"Snake%20Mount\"&gt;Snake Mount&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, Prince Boethiah's maze gardens and twisted towers is called \"&lt;a href=\"Attribution%27s%20Share\"&gt;Attribution's Share&lt;/a&gt;\", a realm best avoided by those that live outside the arcano-politic. Boethiah, like his cohort Azura, is much revered by the followers of the former &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; Temple, but sub-cults of his are entrenched in nearly every terrestrial seat of governance. His traditional festival date is the 2nd of Sun's Dusk, when many contracts are writ between kings and commoners alike.\n&lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, child-god of the &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Star\"&gt;Morningstar&lt;/a&gt;, bestows a strange tranquility to his lands that seem concordant to his spheres of mockery and oath breaking, though what shape such concepts might take is admittedly unfathomable. Perhaps by rendering his domains as idyllic countryside the Prince exemplifies his greatest aspect, and that which ingratiates him to his many followers, the power of serenity through wish fulfillment. Only the strongest of the Emperor's servants are advised to make covenant with Prince Clavicus, and even then are warned against sipping from the &lt;a href=\"Bitter%20Cup\"&gt;Bitter Cup&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, \u201cthe Gardener of Men\u201d, claims that he is one of the oldest Princes, born of thrown-away ideas used during the creation of mortality in the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;. Imperial Mananauts have verified that his influence on fate and time is real and unfeigned, implications of which tie this Prince directly with &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Since Akatosh is the prime temporal spirit whose appearance led to the formation of the world, perhaps Hermaeus Mora speaks the truth. Nevertheless, it is the will of His Majesty Uriel VII that only on the official holiday of 5th First Seed should any propitiation to this Daedric Prince be delivered. \"All else is mutation.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hircine%27s%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt; have been closed by consensus of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; until further notice. It is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness.\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; holds the hardest to access of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;'s extant lands, the &lt;a href=\"Ashpit\"&gt;Ashpit&lt;/a&gt;. As Prince Patron of the disenfranchised and cast out, it is only reasonable that the pathways to his domain take on a characteristic level of concealment. &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, gives &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; its highest esteem, which is surprising when one considers the normal Orcish revilement of Daedric spirits. One might conjecture then that the rumors of Malacath not being a true &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt; but an imprisoned aetherial spirit are true. It would certainly fit the Prince of Exile that he be one himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of &lt;a href=\"Mehrune%27s%20Razor\"&gt;Razors&lt;/a&gt;, has proven himself time and again the enemy of the Empire. Of terrible aspect and crowned in beaten copper, the four-armed Prince of Destruction has troubled the borders of the Mundus with warfare, foul rumor, and force of arms. Banished to dissolution during the &lt;a href=\"Weir%20Gate\"&gt;Weir Gate&lt;/a&gt; massacre and again at &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; by battlemages of the 33rd, Mehrunes Dagon is returned to Oblivion once more, and the stars have foretold that his tenacity has known no forfeiture. All heroes of Cyrodiil are called upon to stand vigil against his hidden agencies.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;'s domains in Oblivion are numerous and obscured, collected together by vast strands of magical ghostweb. All of them are devoted to her spheres of sex and secret murder. Echoing this same structure are the various esoteric cults devoted to her across Tamriel, many of which are forbidden by Imperial law. Her aspect is shrouded and manifold, even when she appears in the crowds that gather within her temples during Frost Fall.\n&lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;'s holdings in Oblivion are collectively known as \"&lt;a href=\"Colored%20Rooms\"&gt;The Colored Rooms&lt;/a&gt;\". Another Prince whose origins may not entirely be outside of the aetherial, Meridia has at several times been linked to &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; the Sun. The most famous account of this association is the Tract of Merid-nunda, which overtly casts Meridia in the role of a wayward &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Ge\"&gt;solar daughter&lt;/a&gt;, cast from the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;heavens&lt;/a&gt; for consorting with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;illicit spectra&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, King of Strife, is second only to his brother Prince Mehrunes Dagon in the enmity of our Emperor. His lands are the charnel houses the slave pens of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, which hold no contrition for those travelers that visit them in error or purpose. That Molag Bal is allowed his holiday at all hearkens back to a treaty of ancient times, when he reputedly lent his infernal power to the creation of the first &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem\"&gt;soulgems&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;'s Scuttling Void has been closed by consensus of the Elder Council until further notice. It is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness.\n&lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; is accorded the title Ur-dra by nearly all the Royalty of Oblivion. As the mother of night, she claims to be an aspect of the original Void itself, and it is generally deemed best to fortify this declaration in one's evening prayers.\n&lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;'s pits have always been inaccessible to mortals. Our only real knowledge of them comes from reports of the other diabolical Princes. It is said that Peryite guards the lowest orders of Oblivion and that his summoners are to regard his likeness to Akatosh as some primordial and curious jest.\n&lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Hedonism, lords over no less than ten times ten thousand pleasure pockets of the Void. As revelry and drunken stupor fall under this Prince's influence, he has been a favorite of many Emperors since the first foundation. Records even indicate that he resided in &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and helped in the somewhat dubious draftsmanship of the Crendali Festivals, whose vulgarities did little to help Imperial expansion into &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summersets&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Asylums&lt;/a&gt; have been closed by consensus of the Elder Council until further notice. It is mentioned here only for the sake of completeness.\n&lt;a href=\"Vaernima\"&gt;Vaernima&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Omen and Dream, shares a special mageographic connection with the Mundus, since mortal sleepers often slip into her realm without any help at all. Traditional sacrifice to Vaernima is held on the 10th of Suns Height, but as with most luck spirits, prayers to this Daedric Prince occur quite frequently, and not always before bedtime."}

{"id": "1715", "revid": "26968877", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1715", "title": "Imperial City", "text": "The Imperial City, also known as Cyrodiil City, is the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Tamrielic Empire&lt;/a&gt;, based in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. It is the ancient capital of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, and home of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. It is located on &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartlands&lt;/a&gt; region of Cyrodiil. Unlike the other towns in Cyrodiil, the city itself does not have a coat of arms of its own and instead uses the black dragon that is the Imperial insignia.\nBackground.\nThe Imperial City grew up around the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, originally the seat of &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; rule of Cyrodiil. The city itself is divided into ten districts, the Imperial District located around the Tower itself, and nine others grouped around it. These comprise the temples, markets, arena, docks, university and residential districts of the city.\nBelow the city, there is a complex sewer system, seemingly designed by the Ayleids for the subterranean movement of goods as well as disposal of sewage. Control of the sewers has also proved to be key in securing the city itself throughout its history, with the battle between the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; for control of the city ultimately being decided by who controlled the sewers.\nAyleid influences.\nWhen the Ayleids arrived in Cyrodiil, they built the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; and used a &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Var%20Stone\"&gt;Tel Var Stone&lt;/a&gt; to serve as its Zero Stone as the Tel Var Stones contained a dormant power. It has been theorized that when this stone is weakened enough, Mundus would cease to exist. The Ayleids also constructed shrines beneath the city for worship.\nDistricts.\nIn the city, there are in total seven districts: &lt;a href=\"Green%20Emperor%20Way\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt;, also referred to as the Palace District, the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Arena District&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Elven%20Gardens%20District\"&gt;Elven Gardens District&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20-%20Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;. There are also two smaller walled districts located outside of the city proper. The &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; is located to the southeast and the Imperial Legion Compound (which includes the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;) is located in the northeast. The last district is the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Imperial City Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;, the harbor district, which is located to the southwest of the city proper.\nGreen Emperor Way is the central district of the Imperial City and the location of the White-Gold Tower, also known as the Imperial Palace. The various &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s of the Empires of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, rule the provinces of Tamriel from the Imperial Palace. The &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, powerful tools of prophecy and divination, are also located within the confines of the White-Gold Tower, and are guarded with fanatical devotion by the blind priests of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Cult of the Ancestor Moth&lt;/a&gt; and the Imperial Legion. A cemetery used for the burial of the nobility of Cyrodiil and other important persons surrounds the Imperial Palace. Six gates lead to the other districts of the Imperial City from Green Emperor Way.\nStarting from the northwest, the Imperial City's series of concentric districts begin with the Elven Gardens. The Elven Gardens is a pleasant residential area, supported economically by two well-known inns: &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Broad%27s%20Boarding%20House\"&gt;Luther Broad's Boarding House&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20King%20and%20Queen%20Tavern\"&gt;The King and Queen Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalos Plaza, located in the western region of the Imperial City, is an exclusive residential area and the location of the main gateway to the Imperial City. The district is supported economically by &lt;a href=\"The%20Tiber%20Septim%20Hotel\"&gt;The Tiber Septim Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive hotel used regularly by the nobility of Tamriel during visits to the capital city. It is an expensive hotel for the use of prosperous and important visitors to the Imperial City. In the center of the Talos Plaza district stands a statue of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon God of Time, in his &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; aspect, which is a famous location around which the people of the Imperial City gather to meet and converse. One of the residents of this district is the Ayleid artifact collector &lt;a href=\"Umbacano%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Umbacano&lt;/a&gt;, whose manor is located just across the street from the statue of Akatosh.\nThe Temple District is the location of the magnificent and ancient &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;. This temple is nearly as old as the White-Gold Tower and was constructed in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; following the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; from the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Hegemonies\"&gt;Ayleid Hegemonies&lt;/a&gt; by Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Temple of the One was where the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; burned before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the Temple District is &lt;a href=\"The%20All-Saints%20Inn\"&gt;The All-Saints Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which opens its doors to visitors and pilgrims alike. The gateway to the southwest of the Temple District leads to the Imperial City Waterfront.\nThe Arboretum is the garden district located in the southeast region of the Imperial City. In this district stands the statues of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;: Akatosh, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;. The statue of Talos, or &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the middle of the Arboretum, encircled by the statues of the other Gods. The gateway to the southeast of the Arboretum leads to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;.\nNext is the Arena District, where the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Imperial City Arena&lt;/a&gt; is located. This is the site of all gladiator combat in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; following the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;. Two groups of gladiators fight at carefully scheduled times: the \"Blue Team\" and the \"Yellow Team\". Before they are allowed to enter the Arena and enjoy the spectacle of gladiator combat, all visitors are required to bet on a match or join one of the two teams as a combatant. The management and training of both gladiator teams is handled professionally in the basement of the Arena, known as the Bloodworks by the Imperial City's citizenry. Two statues mark the district: the statue of Queen Alessia in the southern region of the district and the statue of &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; in the northern region of the district. Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; was the first ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the first of the Imperial Empires of Tamriel, and the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; religion. Morihaus was a pit fighter who led Alessia's armies in the taking of White-Gold Tower and brought about the end of the Ayleid Hegemonies.\nThe Market District is the busiest district of the Imperial City. All kinds of people and races from throughout Tamriel are seen there. All kinds of items change hands here, from weapons and armor to alchemy ingredients and books. The merchants who set up shop in the Market District are officially regulated by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Office%20of%20Imperial%20Commerce\"&gt;Office of Imperial Commerce&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from the official regulator, the merchants in the Market District created their own organization to control the prices of items and the economic balance within the Market District. The organization is named the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Concerned%20Merchants\"&gt;Society of Concerned Merchants&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored publicity and news office is also located there. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Horse%20Courier\"&gt;Black Horse Courier&lt;/a&gt; is run by a group of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who hunt for news and deliver newspapers to various cities across Cyrodiil. There are two statues in the Market District: the statue of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; located near the gateway to the Elven Gardens, and the statue of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Tiber Septim, located near the gateway to the Arena District. The gateway in the northeast region of the Market District leads to the Imperial Legion Compound.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; Compound, separate from the main thoroughfares of the Imperial City, is located to the northeast of the city proper. It is headquarters of the Imperial Legion as well as its armory and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;. The troublemakers and other various prisoners were kept locked up in that prison. The prison is also connected to an ancient labyrinth of Ayleid ruins, a fact not known to the general populace of the Imperial City. However, the Imperial Legion is aware of that fact and keeps the ruins sealed.\nThe commander of the Imperial Legion during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Adamus%20Phillida\"&gt;Adamus Phillida&lt;/a&gt;. He was renowned across Cyrodiil for his constant war against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and had led the Imperial Legion for forty years, surviving many attempts on his life by the assassin guild he sought to destroy. In the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; can kill him during the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; questline, during which he will retire to &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; is the site of the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil. The University is closed to all non-members and low-level recruits of the Mages Guild. To gain access to that prestigious university, an aspiring mage needs a recommendation letter from the various heads of the guildhalls across Cyrodiil.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis, the Mages Guild was led by &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful mage who took a strong stance against &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Under his leadership, the Mages Guild banned Necromancy from the Mages Guild, an act that was regretted by many other high-level members of the Guild.\nA special branch of the Imperial Legion known as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s guard the university. They are highly trained in the magical arts as well as the use of the blade and heavy armor. The Arcane University contains various buildings dedicated to each of the magical arts and studies such as the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lustratorium&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; study, the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29%23Chironasium\"&gt;Chironasium&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; study, the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29%23Praxographical%20Center\"&gt;Praxographical Center&lt;/a&gt; for the creation of spells, and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29%23Mystic%20Archives\"&gt;Mystic Archives&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Arcane Library. In the center of that circular compound was the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The Arch-Mage's Tower consists of a lobby, the Council Chambers, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Orrery\"&gt;Imperial Orrery&lt;/a&gt; in the basement. The Arch-Mage and the Council members manage the entire Mages Guild throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the Arcane University. The Imperial Orrery is one of two contraptions in Tamriel that studied the celestial bodies. The first of the two was created by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Waterfront is the harbor and docks of the Imperial City and was located to southwest of the city proper. This is the region where ships from throughout Tamriel come to trade, pick up and drop off goods, and conduct other economical business. An underground route connects the Waterfront to the Temple District. The inhabitants of the Waterfront District mostly consist of the lower classes of Imperial society; beggars and ruffians are often seen prowling the district.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; is widely known to operate in that area, yet the Imperial Legion has difficulty capturing the Guild's leaders, the &lt;a href=\"Doyen\"&gt;Doyen&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;. The beggars in the Waterfront are quite protective to any inquiries about the Gray Fox, and it is considered obvious by the Imperial Legion that a symbiotic relationship is maintained between the Thieves Guild and the beggars. It was even said that the beggars are under the personal protection of the Gray Fox.\nLayout.\nThe central ring-shaped hub of the city is split up into districts, beginning North-East and moving clockwise:\nOutside the center ring are three districts:"}

A vast sewer system interconnected with &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ruined Ayleid structures&lt;/a&gt; run under the city.\nSublocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Palace\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation of the White-Gold Tower and residence of the various &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Emperor Way, also known as the Palace District, forms the heart of the Imperial City.\n&lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Market District to the northeast is the busiest district of the Imperial City. All kinds of people and races from throughout Tamriel are seen there. All kinds of items change hands here, from weapons and armor to alchemy ingredients and books. The merchants who set up shop in the Market District are officially regulated by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Office%20of%20Imperial%20Commerce\"&gt;Office of Imperial Commerce&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from the official regulator, the merchants in the Market District created their own organization to control the prices of items and the economic balance within the Market District. The organization is named the &lt;a href=\"Society%20of%20Concerned%20Merchants\"&gt;Society of Concerned Merchants&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;-sponsored publicity and news office is also located there. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Horse%20Courier\"&gt;Black Horse Courier&lt;/a&gt; is run by a group of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who hunt for news and deliver newspapers to various cities across Cyrodiil. There are two statues in the Market District: the statue of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; located near the gateway to the Elven Gardens, and the statue of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim\"&gt;Pelagius Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Tiber Septim, located near the gateway to the Arena District. The gateway in the northeast region of the Market District leads to the Imperial Legion Compound.\n&lt;a href=\"Arena%20District%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arena District&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arena District east of the Palace District is the site of all gladiator combat in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; following the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20Arena%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt;. Two groups of gladiators fight at carefully scheduled times: the \"Blue Team\" and the \"Yellow Team\". Before they are allowed to enter the Arena and enjoy the spectacle of gladiator combat, all visitors are required to bet on a match or join one of the two teams as a combatant. The management and training of both gladiator teams is handled professionally in the basement of the Arena, known as the Bloodworks by the Imperial City's citizenry. Two statues mark the district: the statue of Queen Alessia in the southern region of the district and the statue of &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; in the northern region of the district.\n&lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Arboretum is the garden district located in the southeast region of the Imperial City. In this district stands the statues of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;: Akatosh, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;. The statue of Talos, or &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, is located in the middle of the Arboretum, encircled by the statues of the other Gods. The gateway to the southeast of the Arboretum leads to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20District\"&gt;Temple District&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Temple District in the southwest is the location of the magnificent and ancient &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt;. This temple is nearly as old as the White-Gold Tower and was constructed in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; following the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; from the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Hegemonies\"&gt;Ayleid Hegemonies&lt;/a&gt; by Queen &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Temple of the One was where the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; burned before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Also in the Temple District is &lt;a href=\"The%20All-Saints%20Inn\"&gt;The All-Saints Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which opens its doors to visitors and pilgrims alike. The gateway to the southwest of the Temple District leads to the Imperial City Waterfront.\n&lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalos Plaza, located in the western region of the Imperial City, is an exclusive residential area and the location of the main gateway to the Imperial City. The district is supported economically by &lt;a href=\"The%20Tiber%20Septim%20Hotel\"&gt;The Tiber Septim Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive hotel used regularly by the nobility of Tamriel during visits to the capital city. It is an expensive hotel for the use of prosperous and important visitors to the Imperial City. In the center of the Talos Plaza district stands a statue of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon God of Time, in his &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; aspect, which is a famous location around which the people of the Imperial City gather to meet and converse. One of the residents of this district is the Ayleid artifact collector &lt;a href=\"Umbacano%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Umbacano&lt;/a&gt;, whose manor is located just across the street from the statue of Akatosh.\n&lt;a href=\"Elven%20Gardens%20District%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elven Gardens District&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Elven Gardens is a pleasant residential area in the northwest of the city, supported economically by two well-known inns: &lt;a href=\"Luther%20Broad%27s%20Boarding%20House\"&gt;Luther Broad's Boarding House&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20King%20and%20Queen%20Tavern\"&gt;The King and Queen Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; Compound, separate from the main thoroughfares of the Imperial City, is located to the northeast of the city proper. It is headquarters of the Imperial Legion as well as its armory and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;. The troublemakers and other various prisoners were kept locked up in that prison. The prison is also connected to an ancient labyrinth of Ayleid ruins, a fact not known to the general populace of the Imperial City. However, the Imperial Legion is aware of that fact and keeps the ruins sealed.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; is the site of the headquarters of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil. The University is closed to all non-members and low-level recruits of the Mages Guild. To gain access to that prestigious university, an aspiring mage needs a recommendation letter from the various heads of the guildhalls across Cyrodiil.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis, the Mages Guild was led by &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful mage who took a strong stance against &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. Under his leadership, the Mages Guild banned Necromancy from the Mages Guild, an act that was regretted by many other high-level members of the Guild.\nA special branch of the Imperial Legion known as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s guard the university. They are highly trained in the magical arts as well as the use of the blade and heavy armor. The Arcane University contains various buildings dedicated to each of the magical arts and studies such as the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Lustratorium&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt; study, the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29%23Chironasium\"&gt;Chironasium&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; study, the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29%23Praxographical%20Center\"&gt;Praxographical Center&lt;/a&gt; for the creation of spells, and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29%23Mystic%20Archives\"&gt;Mystic Archives&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Arcane Library. In the center of that circular compound was the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The Arch-Mage's Tower consists of a lobby, the Council Chambers, the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Quarters&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Orrery\"&gt;Imperial Orrery&lt;/a&gt; in the basement. The Arch-Mage and the Council members manage the entire Mages Guild throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the Arcane University. The Imperial Orrery is one of two contraptions in Tamriel that studied the celestial bodies. The first of the two was created by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Waterfront is the harbor and docks of the Imperial City and was located to southwest of the city proper. This is the region where ships from throughout Tamriel come to trade, pick up and drop off goods, and conduct other economical business. An underground route connects the Waterfront to the Temple District. The inhabitants of the Waterfront District mostly consist of the lower classes of Imperial society; beggars and ruffians are often seen prowling the district.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; is widely known to operate in that area, yet the Imperial Legion has difficulty capturing the Guild's leaders, the &lt;a href=\"Doyen\"&gt;Doyen&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;. The beggars in the Waterfront are quite protective to any inquiries about the Gray Fox, and it is considered obvious by the Imperial Legion that a symbiotic relationship is maintained between the Thieves Guild and the beggars. It was even said that the beggars are under the personal protection of the Gray Fox.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Sewers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City Sewers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Imperial City Sewers run under all the city's district apart from the Waterfront and the Prison. The labyrinthine structure is infested by various creatures.\nQuests.\nQuests which start in the Imperial City, sorted by district:\nNotable residents.\n\"For a full list of all the residents of the Imperial City, see &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29/Residents\"&gt;Imperial City (Oblivion)/Residents&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

It is a huge zone and PvP will happen constantly, except in the two player-versus-enemy &lt;a href=\"group%20dungeons\"&gt;group dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Prison%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Imperial City was released for a price of 2,500 on August 31st for PC/Mac players, September 15th for Xbox One players and September 16th for PS4 players.\nBackground.\nThe Imperial City was built countless millennia ago by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and is heralded as one of their greatest constructions. The Imperial City has historically been the center of each &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; The famed &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; has been the seat of hundreds of emperors, empresses and potentates ever since it was constructed, the most recent in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; being Empress-Regent &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt; following the disappearance of her husband Emperor &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; began in the Imperial City in &lt;a href=\"2E%20578\"&gt;2E 578&lt;/a&gt; when the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; tricked Emperor Aquilarios into using the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; with the promise of legitimizing his claim to the throne and becoming &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was a trap; the ritual tore the veil between &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and caused the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt; to occur. A &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; deployed over the White-Gold Tower and hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; poured out to initiate the invasion of Tamriel. The city was quickly overrun and captured by &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal's&lt;/a&gt; forces, and it eventually became their main base of operations in Tamriel. The Imperials led a resistance against the Daedra, but there was no hope for the civilians still trapped in the city. The city was completely corrupted, with thousands of Daedra inside, but the Imperials continue to stand their ground.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in the Imperial City and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralised areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe Imperial City features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. It is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in the Imperial City. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nThirteen Skyshards can be found in the Imperial City totaling in four &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nEight books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in the Imperial City and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively. The Imperial City only has foul water fishing spots."}

The next door is locked and there is no key to get through. The remaining floors are only accessible in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ultimate%20Heist%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Ultimate Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe only way to actually get through to these floors is to enter a passage called the old way. This is located in the Imperial Sewers. One can also use &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console commands&lt;/a&gt; to unlock the doors, but this can become very complicated because the guards will attack when one enters restricted areas.\nDuring the Great War of &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;\u2013&lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;175&lt;/a&gt; the Imperial City was captured and sacked, the Imperial Palace was burnt and the White-Gold Tower was looted."}

{"id": "23891", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23891", "title": "Imperial City Sewers (Oblivion)", "text": "The Imperial City Sewers are in fact not one area, but several interconnected areas that span the entire underside of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. It connects all the major districts except the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Waterfront\"&gt;Waterfront&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe sewers are inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Rats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mudcrab%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mudcrabs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bandits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. There are two exits that lead outside of the city onto the &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and another exit for each district.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; are said to use the Imperial City Sewers to move around the city unseen. At low levels, one will only encounter goblins, rats and mudcrabs. The bandits and undead will be leveled as per normal.\nIt is possible to cross the entire Imperial City by using the sewers. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero's&lt;/a&gt; first visit to the Imperial City Sewers is right at the start of the game. The sewers are a great place to go if one wish to escape from people/ sunlight (if one is a vampire). Overall, it is a major role in the storyline, for this tunnel system plays host to the Path of Dawn quest, and helping the Hero escape from prison in the beginning.\nSections.\nMarket Sewers.\nEntering from the garden during the day one will find a sleeping bandit and some cheap loot. For a low level character, it is a good place to practice sneaking. There is a door in the sewers that cannot be opened from the Market Sewers side. To open the door enter the sewers in the &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt; and then go through the sewers to the Market Sewers entrance, where the door can be opened with a nearby wheel.\nIn the Market Sewers there are two trap doors leading to &lt;a href=\"The%20Best%20Defense\"&gt;The Best Defense&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Main%20Ingredient\"&gt;The Main Ingredient&lt;/a&gt;. These doors both have very hard locks. Also worth noting is that if one pick these locks and are in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;, one can easily acquire many items worth fencing, just make sure it's after about 10 or 11 PM. The sewers contain mud crabs, rats and bandits, all with good items to loot for beginners. There are a lot of low level chests to loot.\nElven Gardens Sewers.\nThe entrance is through a grate beside a well in a small garden. Going straight forward from the entrance when inside, leads to the Sewer Waterworks. Turning right and then right again after the stairs, leads to the canal. When going over the bridge in to the room next to the canal, one can find a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; with minor loot. In the same room there is an exit to &lt;a href=\"Othrelos\"&gt;Othrelos&lt;/a&gt; basement.\nComing back in to the canal room, turn the wheel and a gate opens in the water and one is able to go through to the next room. There is also a chest there with minor loot. Go SW along the canal until the end and in the next room there is an exit to &lt;a href=\"Irene%20Metrick\"&gt;Irene Metrick&lt;/a&gt;s basement. There are mostly mud crabs and rats in this section.\nThe second part of the sewer is reached after going through the Sewer Waterworks. Walking through the canal water will lead to a room where there are exits to Sunken Sewers and &lt;a href=\"Fathis%20Ules\"&gt;Fathis Ules&lt;/a&gt; basement. Behind the stairs to the Sunken Sewer is a locked chest with some . Beside is another chest with some &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;.\nSewer Waterworks.\nThe entrance from the Elven Garden Sewers leads to a room next to the canal. In here there are &lt;a href=\"Leveled\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; and they summon &lt;a href=\"zombie%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt;. Near their living area one can find a few chests with minor loot. This part of the sewer has a few rooms attached to the canal. There is a second exit to the Elven Garden Sewers, this leads to the second part of that sewer.\nSunken Sewers.\nThis part of the sewer is where the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; members are meeting. It is empty after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;The Path of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\" in the main quest line. One can find a few chests, one is locked, with various &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; in them. Here are also &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn%20Commentaries\"&gt;Mythic Dawn Commentaries 1\u20133&lt;/a&gt; found, left by the members when they left or were killed. There are two beds here one can use. The exit from the main area leads to Talos Plaza Sewers.\nTalos Plaza Sewers.\nWhen entering this part of the sewers from the Sunken sewers, directly ahead goblins have set up a camp. There are two chests with minor loot. Walking along the tunnels and one passes the exit to &lt;a href=\"Dynari%20Amnis\"&gt;Dynari Amnis&lt;/a&gt; basement.\nFurther along exits to &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt; and the South West Tunnel are found. The rest of the tunnels in this section is pretty empty except for a few mud crabs and some rats. Near the exit to the Talos Plaza is a locked chest with some loot.\nSouth West Tunnel.\nThis part of the sewer is empty except for a few mud crabs. At one end of the tunnel is a locked chest with minor loot. The tunnel has exits to the Talos Plaza Sewers and the Temple Sewers.\nTemple Sewers.\nThe Temple sewers are a large area with a round large room in the center. There are three different tunnel systems leading from this room. Leveled goblins are found here so be careful as they can be hard to dispose off. There are a few chests here with minor loot and leveled loot.\nThere are only exits to &lt;a href=\"Amantius%20Allectus\"&gt;Amantius Allectus&lt;/a&gt; basement and the South West Tunnel here so one have to backtrack to get out.\nNorth Tunnel.\nThe North Tunnel is divided into two sections, a small tunnel with a canal when coming from the Market sewers. Then a larger area with two large rooms and the canal in the middle.\nThere are mud crabs and rats in the smaller area. Bandits can be found in the larger area. A few chests with leveled loot are found near the bandits. In the large room next to the exit to the &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt; one will find a &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; in the water. The exit to the City Isle has a very hard lock.\nPalace Sewers.\nComing in from Beneath the Bloodworks, there are two circular rooms that lead to a canal with the door to &lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Way\"&gt;The Old Way&lt;/a&gt;. During the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ultimate%20Heist%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Ultimate Heist&lt;/a&gt;\" the Hero will get a key from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; so they can go through the palace sewer and enter the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruin&lt;/a&gt; The Old Way, hidden under the sewer. The other entrance to this part of the sewer is in the Palace. One will encounter rats and wild dog on the way.\nSouth East Tunnel.\nThere are two entrances to this part of the tunnel, one from the waterfront and one from the &lt;a href=\"Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;. The tunnels exits to the Beneath the Bloodworks section. There is nothing of value here and only mud crabs and rats can be found.\nBeneath the Bloodworks.\nIn the maze of tunnels and rooms that make up the Bloodworks sewers, one will find that &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; have been known to inhabit this area of the sewers, and it is a part of the path to the Imperial Palace during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Ultimate%20Heist%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Ultimate Heist&lt;/a&gt;\" for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are corpses hanging from the ceiling and coffins almost everywhere. Several chests can be found with various loot.\nThe name refers to the area of the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Bloodworks\"&gt;Arena Bloodworks&lt;/a&gt;, so called because blood from gladiatorial matches commonly seeps into the training room. It is possible that the blood that drips into the Bloodworks also seeps into the sewers below, which would explain the presence of vampires in the area.\nThere are exits to the South West Tunnel, Market Sewer and the Palace Sewer. A key is needed to enter the Palace Sewer as one can't pick the lock. The door to the Market Sewer has a very hard lock.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;The Path of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter discovering that the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Dawn\"&gt;Mythic Dawn&lt;/a&gt; during the assault on &lt;a href=\"Weynon%20Priory%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weynon Priory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jauffre%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Jauffre&lt;/a&gt; wants the Hero to meet with &lt;a href=\"Baurus\"&gt;Baurus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to help find the location of the Amulet of Kings.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ultimate%20Heist%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Ultimate Heist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final piece the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gray%20Fox%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt; needs to complete his grand (but unrevealed) scheme is an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial City Palace&lt;/a&gt; itself. To start, he gives the Hero the &lt;a href=\"Boots%20of%20Springheel%20Jak%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Boots of Springheel Jak&lt;/a&gt;, which he believes they may need at some point, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Arrow%20of%20Extrication%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Arrow of Extrication&lt;/a&gt;, which supposedly should unlock something.\n&lt;a href=\"Scheduled%20for%20Execution\"&gt;Scheduled for Execution&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vicente%20Valtieri\"&gt;Vicente Valtieri&lt;/a&gt; asks the Hero to kill a prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Valen%20Dreth\"&gt;Valen Dreth&lt;/a&gt;, who is soon to be released from prison. The bonus is earned by not killing any guards during the course of the mission."}

Sometimes called the Miracle of Peace, this event occurred at the end of . It is a kind of event known as a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;, during which the laws of causality are suspended and time is flexible.\nContext.\nPrior to the Warp, the Iliac Bay region and the province of High Rock more generally was filled with many petty kingdoms, so much so that the phrase \"find a new hill, become a king\" was proverbial in the province. The largest cities of note were &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. Adjacent to High Rock was Hammerfell, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, with a long-standing claim on the island of &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt; which Daggerfall disputed. In addition to this, the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; had recently been founded by &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Gortwog&lt;/a&gt;, much to the resentment of its neighbors.\nResults.\nAs a result of the Warp, the forty-four independent kingdoms of the Iliac Bay were rearranged into the three distinct kingdoms of Daggerfall, Sentinel and Wayrest, each of which had greatly expanded holdings. Great battles apparently being fought on the borders of each, with some regions believing one day less had passed than was in fact the case.\nIn addition to the human kingdoms being granted additional land, Orsinium was established with lands of its own. However, it was not granted full autonomy by the Empire, and was considered part of High Rock, despite holding territories in both High Rock and Hammerfell.\nCause.\nThe Warp was caused by the activation of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"the%20Agent\"&gt;the Agent&lt;/a&gt;, causing a Dragon Break which allowed each contesting faction to use the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; to control the Numidium to achieve their aims. However, the inhabitants of Tamriel are largely unaware of this and the cause of the Warp in the West is officially a miracle and a mystery. The author of the official report into the Warp is aware that the Miracle of Peace was not of divine origin, although Imperial proclamation claims that it was so. They speculate that the Totem was used, but have no idea how or why."}

If you have not read the first two books, '&lt;a href=\"Beggar%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Beggar&lt;/a&gt;' and '&lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;', you would be well advised to do so.\nSuoibud Erol did not know much of his past, nor did he care to.\nAs a child, he had lived in Erolgard, but the kingdom was very poor and taxes were as a result very high. He was too young to manage his abundant inheritance, but his servants, fearing that their master would be ruined, moved him to &lt;a href=\"Jallenheim\"&gt;Jallenheim&lt;/a&gt;. No one knew why that location was picked. Some old maid, long dead now, had thought it was a good place to raise a child. No one else had a better idea.\nThere may have been children with a more pampered, more spoiled existence than young Suoibud, but that is doubtful. As he grew, he understood that he was rich, but he had nothing else. No family, no social position, no security at all. Loyalty, he found out on more than one occasion, cannot truly be bought. Knowing that he had but one asset, a vast fortune, he was determined to protect it, and, if possible, increase it.\nSome otherwise perfectly nice people are greedy, but Suoibud was that rare accident of nature or breeding who has no other interest but acquiring and hoarding gold. He was willing to do anything to increase his fortune. Most recently, he had begun secretly hiring mercenaries to attack desirable properties, and then buying them when no one wanted to live there any more. The attacks would then, of course, cease, and Suoibud would have profitable land which he had purchased for a song. It had begun small with a few farms, but recently he had begun a more ambitious campaign.\nIn north-central &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, there is an area called The &lt;a href=\"Aalto\"&gt;Aalto&lt;/a&gt;, which is of unique geographical interest. It is a dormant volcanic valley surrounded on all sides by glaciers, so the earth is hot from the volcano, but the constant water drizzle and air is frigid. A grape called &lt;a href=\"Jazbay%20Grapes\"&gt;Jazbay&lt;/a&gt; grows there comfortably, and everywhere else in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; it withers and dies. The strange vineyard is a privately owned, and the wine produced from it is thus rare and extremely expensive. It is said that the Emperor needs the permission of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Council\"&gt;Imperial Council&lt;/a&gt; to have a glass of it once a year.\nIn order to harass the owner of The Aalto into selling his land cheap, Suoibud had to hire more than a few mercenaries. He had to hire the finest private army in Skyrim.\nSuoibud did not like spending money, but he had agreed to pay the general of the army, a woman called Laicifitra, a gem the size of an apple. He had not given it to her yet \u2014 payment was to be delivered on the success of the mission \u2014 but he had trouble sleeping knowing that he was going to giving up such a prize. He always slept during the day so he could watch his storehouse by night, when he knew thieves were about.\nThat brings us up to this moment when, after a fitful sleep, Suoibud woke up at about noon, and surprised a thief in his bedroom. The thief was Eslaf.\nEslaf had been contemplating a leap from the window, a hundred feet down, into the branches of a tree beyond the walls of the fortified palace, and a tumble into a stack of hay. Anyone who has ever attempted such a feat will testify that it takes some concentration and nerve to do such a thing. When he saw that the rich man sleeping in the room had awakened, both left him, and Eslaf slipped behind a tall ornamental shield on display to wait for Suoibud to go back to sleep.\nSuoibud did not go back to sleep. He had heard nothing, but could feel someone in the room with him. He stood up and began pacing the room.\nSuoibud paced and paced, and gradually decided that he was imagining things. No one was there. His fortune was safe and secure.\nHe was returning to his bed when he heard a clunk. Turning around, he saw the gem, the one he was to give to Laicifitra on the floor by the Atmoran cavalry shield. A hand reached out from behind the shield and grabbed it up.\n'Thief!' Suoibud cried out, grabbing a jeweled &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; katana from the wall and lunging at the shield.\nThe 'fight' between Eslaf and Suoibud will not go down in the annals of great duels. Suoibud did not know how to use a sword, and Eslaf was no expert at blocking with a shield. It was clumsy, it was awkward. Suoibud was furious, but was psychologically incapable of using the sword in any way that could damage its fine filligree, reducing its market value. Eslaf kept moving, dragging the shield with him, trying to keep it between him and the blade, which is, after all, the most essential part of any block.\nSuoibud screamed in frustration as he struck at the shield, bumping its way across the room. He even tried negotiating with the thief, explaining that the gem was promised to a great warrior named Laicifitra, and if he would give it back, Suoibud would happily give him something else in return. Eslaf was not a genius, but he did not believe that.\nBy the time Suoibud's guards came to the bedroom in response to their master's calls, he had succeeded in backing the shield into a window.\nThey fell on the shield, having considerable more expertise with their swords than Suoibud did, but they discovered that there was no one behind it. Eslaf had leapt out the window and escaped.\nAs he ran heavily through the streets of Jallenheim, making jingling noises from the gold coins in his pockets, and feeling the huge gem chafe where he had hidden it, Eslaf did not know where he should go next. He knew only that he could never go back to that town, and he must avoid this warrior named Laicifitra who had claims on the jewel.\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book &lt;a href=\"King%20%28Book%29\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;"}

Preferring to mix offensive power with defensive ability, warriors prefer to use a good &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Axe%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; and shrug off attacks with heavy armor. Warriors do not tire easily and are capable of repairing their own gear.\nThe Warrior is a premade &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription and use.\nWarriors are powerful melee fighters, preferring to get up-close and personal with the enemy. Their heavy armor provides protection from marksmen and other warriors as they plow through enemies with sword, axe and &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;, greatly reducing the damage they take.\nWarriors are extremely well protected, able to comfortably use heavy armor and shields to defend against the enemy's strikes, and their high health gained from the Endurance attribute allows them to shrug off what damage is done to them.\nIn terms of attack, warriors are no less able. A warrior can wield any melee tool, and even use their fists if necessary. As such, a disarmed warrior is never without a weapon, and if their original weapon is lost they can simply fight on with whatever weaponry can be taken from the opponent. The versatile nature of a warrior means that they can carry a range of weapons, and their high encumbrance limit (due to strength) allows them to take to the field with three or four weapons without severely impacting their carrying ability. This allows a warrior to fight with a favorite weapon, while still having a few backups in case they are disarmed.\nSkills of the forge are another hallmark of the warrior, and they can quickly and easily repair their own damaged equipment or that of felled foes which the warrior intends to sell. Warriors who are particularly skilled can even enhance their equipment beyond what is normally possible (through the Expert armorer perk).\nLastly, warriors need to be able to quickly close the space between them and their chosen foe, and so Athletics is an essential skill, allowing warriors to cover ground quickly, and restore their fatigue quicker."}

He will complain that his workers ran off the moment the necromancers invaded, and left his improved ship designs behind for anyone to find. He will ask you to go get these ship designs before they fall into the hands of a hostile power. \nThe first set of designs in on the ship immediately to your southwest. You can also find a Skyshard and a Lorebook near this ship; the book \"&lt;a href=\"Flesh%20to%20Cut%20from%20Bone\"&gt;Flesh to Cut from Bone&lt;/a&gt;\" can be found on the scaffolding on starboard side, and the skyshard can be found on port side beneath the scaffolding, so be sure to pick those up. Either way, head north until you find another ship; the next designs will be on that one. The final designs will be in the north of town, on the same ship where the &lt;a href=\"Withered%20Hand\"&gt;Withered Hand&lt;/a&gt; set up the North Focus during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Alasan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Alasan's Plot&lt;/a&gt;.\" You will find a Dunmer named &lt;a href=\"Llasi%20Omoren\"&gt;Llasi Omoren&lt;/a&gt; there; she has the designs, but she will beg you to let her keep them.

Wasten Coridale is well-known for the Hanging Gardens, with beautiful and fertile grottos. Many fishermen come here for exotic findings.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWasten Coridale is situated off the coast of the Isle of Summerset, specifically off of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the province. For the longest time, Wasten Coridale was uninhabited, teeming with all sorts of animals and a honeycomb-esque cave system throughout the island. There are two islands that makeup Wasten Coridale. The northern one is the smallest and is the least explored, with only a port adjacent to the southern island. The southern island is the largest and has ruins dotting the area. There is a path going from the south-central beach to an opening in the western coast. Because of Wasten Coridale's location, it is targeted by Sea Serpents and the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;. Wasten Coridale is known for its Hanging Gardens, which is located in the center of the Coridale township. The gardens are riddled with Elden fountains and ancient chains, with representations of the &lt;a href=\"Earth-Bones\"&gt;Earth-Bones&lt;/a&gt; and their transient rules.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the island of Wasten Coraldale was taken control by the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Sharks\"&gt;Storm Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful militia consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt;. The Storm Sharks had utilized the beaches of Wasten Coraldale as their staging grounds for a potential invasion of the Summerset Isles. They had already set sail for areas such as &lt;a href=\"Sunhold\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt;. At around this time, an angler fleet had landed on the island, fishing as most would on Wasten Coraldale. The leader of the fleet, &lt;a href=\"Curtaros\"&gt;Curtaros&lt;/a&gt; had wandered off to an isolated beach, resting while the Maormer, under the control of &lt;a href=\"Stormsinger%20Farya\"&gt;Stormsinger Farya&lt;/a&gt; had attacked his angler fleet. Meanwhile, on the mainland, Curtaros' daughter, &lt;a href=\"Hiranesse\"&gt;Hiranesse&lt;/a&gt; had become worried, prompting her to send a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;traveler&lt;/a&gt; to help find her father. The two were eventually able to inflict massive damage to one of their ships and escaping with the remaining survivors of the angler fleet. At around this time, the &lt;a href=\"Augur%20of%20the%20Obscure\"&gt;Augur of the Obscure&lt;/a&gt; had been lost on the island, to which it was recovered by the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.

No matter what happens outside these catacombs, the Betrayer must be punished for his crimes. He must be imprisoned so that his evil cannot spread to the world beyond!\nWe tried to kill the foul creature. After he betrayed and murdered High King Durac and the council of &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; kings, we sent a small force of warriors and mages into the catacombs to hunt Virmaril down and end his vile existence. I was a part of that force. It pains me to write these words, but they are true and undeniable. We failed.\nIt soon became apparent that we could not slay a being that is not truly alive. Instead, we quickly developed a new plan. We would weaken Virmaril and trap him deep within the catacombs. And then we would sacrifice ourselves - use our own soul magic to turn ourselves into immortal, eternal watchers. We would serve as Virmaril's guardians and imprisoners until the end of time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"soul%20magic\"&gt;soul magic&lt;/a&gt; did its work. We have sealed Virnaril behind a soul-ward and placed him in a suspended state - not unlike a deep sleep. We are now the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Watchers\"&gt;Eternal Watchers&lt;/a&gt;, pledged to guard the Betrayer and making sure his plan to unleash his army of &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; never comes to pass.\nNow we simply wait. And watch. Forever.\n&lt;a href=\"Garalan\"&gt;Garalan&lt;/a&gt; has been complaining about hearing strange voices in his head. We ignored him. After all, haven't we all gone a little bit insane during our never-ending obligation? I'm sure he'll be fine.\nNow I'm hearing the voices. At times it sounds like a thousand voices talking at once, a jumble of noise and confusion. Then it becomes the whisper of a single voice, so low I can barely hear it. But every so often, the voice comes to me in crisp, clear tones and I recognize the speaker. Somehow, some way, the impossible has happened.\nVirmaril is awake."}

I must know: are the stories true? Surely you've heard them. Tales of the stones granting powers to Heroes of old, those special few being able to choose any stone to rewrite his fate. Of course you've heard them, that's why you touch the stones as you pass by. You've heard they bring luck, or a sign from the gods. But you think little of the action. It has no true meaning for you. I see it in your eyes as you pass. You do not believe. But I have always believed. Always felt that I was one of the few whose fate was not sealed at birth by the stars overhead. One of the few who could use these stones, draw on the power of the gods to change my life, change my future. I have always felt it.\nI have done much in my years. Fought battles, defended villages, quested and adventured throughout Skyrim. I have bested &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; in combat, and performed deeds worthy of everlasting praise in song from the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Skyrim%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt;. No task was too small or great if it could bring me honor, glory, proof that I was worthy of the stones' power. And yet, nothing.\nI have found many of these accursed stones in my travels, and none have responded to my touch. With each new feat I would return to the Guardians, wondering if the gods finally deemed me worthy. But now those days are gone. I am an old man, with no fight left in me. And so here I sit, watching the faces of those who pass by on their daily errands, their mundane travels from one city or town to another. Most of you do not even give the stones a passing glance. You have never heard their call, you will never feel drawn to them. Some days, I envy you that.\nLong will I wait at the Guardians, for I must know. Are the stories true?"}
