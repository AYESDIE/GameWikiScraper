Although hide stretched and tied over frames of bone may appear temporary, they are usually cocooned within sacred tree hollows and range dramatically in size. Wander the rivers and coast, where traders can provide quality imported lumber without breaking the Green Pact, and you will find more traditional wooden abodes.\nJourney deeper into the forests if you dare, and you may stumble across the city of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;. Both have dwellings on the forest floor (typically built by other races, usually the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;), but many homes are both concealed and cradled within the canopy of &lt;a href=\"graht-oak\"&gt;graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; trees. Citified tree-folk favor a life among the branches and have woven them together to form limbed pathways, without contravening the law of the land. Trails of thick, living vines anchor dozens of platforms that carry goods and people among the graht-oak. These platforms are hoisted by strong, often foreign laborers.\nBone, resin, and sinew are employed in Bosmeri bridge design. A secondary market in such scraps allows the tree-dweller to tip their animal waste from above to the ground below, where it is scavenged and reworked into a variety of items\u2014certainly better than the refuse-strewn thoroughfares of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. As the moons rise, additional light is provided by luminous lichen, molds, and &lt;a href=\"Fungi%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fungal&lt;/a&gt; growths living at the perpetually shadowed base of the oaks. Higher up, nocturnal flowers feed from the graht-oak, attracting &lt;a href=\"Torchbugs%20%28Online%29\"&gt;torchbugs&lt;/a&gt;, whose hives light the branch platforms without the aid of fire. Adaptation to overcome self-imposed and crippling shortcomings has allowed the Wood Elf to survive, even thrive, despite their rigorous restrictions."}

This includes the card drawn at the start of the turn but does not include cards drawn from a rune being broken. For decks that feature the ability to drawn more cards than is typical, whether by &lt;a href=\"Actions%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Summon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"keyword\"&gt;keyword&lt;/a&gt;s or creatures with &lt;a href=\"Pilfer\"&gt;Pilfer&lt;/a&gt;, Arcanaeum Librarian can become tremendously powerful.\nAs with other cards whose strength relies in accumulating power or health over time, summoning Arcanaeum Librarian in the &lt;a href=\"Lanes%23Shadow%20Lane\"&gt;Shadow Lane&lt;/a&gt; when available will increase its early survivability by preventing it from being attacked the next turn.

The &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; heavily affects the results of working at one.\nDisenchanting.\nMost enchanted items can be disenchanted, granting the Dragonborn the knowledge of how to place the effect on other non-enchanted items, but destroying the object in the process. &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Staves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amulets%20of%20the%20Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Amulets of the Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; as well as some unique items remain enchanted permanently, thus some unique effects cannot be replicated. Disenchanting also increases the Dragonborn's enchanting skill.\nEnchanting.\nLearned enchantments can be applied to most mundane equipment making them magical. Most enhancements can be only applied to certain pieces of equipment, such as damaging enhancements to weapons. Most enhancements' strength depends on the size of the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; used and the Dragonborn's enchanting skill and active &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt;, especially the &lt;a href=\"Enchanter%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Enchanter&lt;/a&gt; perk level. Also several &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; perks affect the outcome as can potions and, with , certain pieces of apparel. For an item to have more than one enhancement the enchanting skill perk &lt;a href=\"Extra%20Effect\"&gt;Extra Effect&lt;/a&gt; needs to be active.\nThe enchanter must select the desired effect or effects, a mundane item that will be enhanced and a filled soul gem. After the third component is selected, the item's name can be changed by pressing F , Y , triangle , or X . Soul gems with greater capacities will naturally cause a much more pronounced effect than those with a smaller capacity.\nAfter the enchanting process is complete the item's damage and armor rating can only be improved with the perk &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Arcane Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeapons.\nThere are 17 weapon enchantments available, 18 with \"Dragonborn\", that all have a variable number of charges. Each time the weapon's enhancement is applied to its target, it loses one charge until it runs out after which the magical effects are no longer active. Weapons can be recharged by using souls from filled soul gems and recharging increases the enchanting skill by a fixed amount. Weapons can also be recharged with &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Siphon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Siphon&lt;/a&gt;. Some enhancements' effect can be adjusted to be weaker thus increasing the number of uses.\nApparel.\nThe types of enchantments allowed on apparel are determined by what part of the body the apparel is covering. Unlike weapon enchantments, apparel enchantments do not require recharging and stay enchanted indefinitely. The strength of the enchantment is dependent on the size of soul used to enchant it and the enchanter's perks and skill, except for &lt;a href=\"muffle\"&gt;muffle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Waterbreathing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;water breathing&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocations.\nArcane Enchanters are located throughout the realm, in most cases in the vicinity of a powerful mage. There is one in most &lt;a href=\"jarl\"&gt;jarl's&lt;/a&gt; headquarters and one can be purchased or crafted for all the Dragonborn's homes except for &lt;a href=\"Breezehome\"&gt;Breezehome&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrafting.\nThe Enchanter can be crafted for a &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt; as part of .

It is the headquarters and the seat of power for the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nLayout.\nThe Arcane University is located on the &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt;, within one of the two small towers situated to the east of the main &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;. The walls of the University form a circular area, outside the main city walls, of roughly the same area as the innermost circle of the Imperial City, &lt;a href=\"Green%20Emperor%20Way\"&gt;Green Emperor Way&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe layout is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Prison\"&gt;Imperial Prison&lt;/a&gt;, located in the northeastern tower, consisting of a single circular wall, surrounding an open grassy area with the main tower situated slightly off-center in the middle of the area. The university layout includes a second, much larger building immediately behind the tower, which houses the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Orrery\"&gt;Imperial Orrery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Tower&lt;/a&gt; is a smaller version of the massive White Gold Tower, approximately the same size and shape as the Imperial Guard towers found around the outside edge of the Imperial City proper. Its key distinguishing feature is the cone-shaped addition to the top of the tower, which houses the Arch-Mage's personal quarters. The tower also contains the Mages' Guild council chambers, and at the lowest level, a small lobby. The lobby is the only section of the tower open to the public.\nThe majority of the University grounds are located behind a thick wall, and are off-limits to visitors. The main tower sits precisely in the center of this wall, atop a raised walkway. Large iron gates extend out from the tower along the walls, and will only open for Mages' Guild members of at least &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk%23Magic%20Arts\"&gt;Apprentice&lt;/a&gt; rank. Non-members are permitted into the tower lobby, where a few guild members are usually found, but cannot exit into the university grounds or &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; city, the walls around the outside of the University house a number of buildings, most of which are two stories with no basement. There is a small Imperial watchtower near the back of the university, shorter than those in the city proper, which is home to the Imperial Battlemages patrolling the university grounds. The only gate through the walls leads to the northwest, to a short footbridge leading to a gate into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccess to the University.\nApprentice.\nAccess to the university grounds is granted upon reaching Apprentice rank in the Mages' Guild. This rank is bestowed upon the Hero by &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt;, after completing all of the recommendation quests. At this point, both the iron gates outside of the tower, and the two rear doors from the tower lobby, will open. This grants the apprentice access to most of the campus services as well; though the buildings themselves are open to Mages' Guild associates, such low ranking members would normally be unable to reach them.\nEvoker.\nThe upper floors of the tower itself are off-limits to lower level guild members. Access to these floors is through teleporter pads found in the lobby. The pads are similar to the teleportation system used by the Morrowind guild halls, but those in the university are keyed to a single permanent destination, and they activate automatically.\nOnce the Hero has reached the rank of &lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;, they are granted access to the second floor, which holds the council chambers. The &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; himself, and the other two council members (&lt;a href=\"Irlav%20Jarol\"&gt;Irlav Jarol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caranya\"&gt;Caranya&lt;/a&gt;), are found here most of the time.\nArch-Mage.\nThe top floor of the tower holds the private chambers of the Arch-Mage himself, so the Hero will not be given access to this floor until they have ascended to that rank.\nAfter completing the Mages' Guild recommendation quests, the Hero can complete all of the arcane quests and become the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero is then granted access to the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Quarters%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Private Quarters&lt;/a&gt;, of which inside is an enchanted chest. Putting a common &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; in it duplicates the ingredient, after 24 (in-game) hours, into ten. It is advisable to collect the duplicated ingredients before a week is up or everything inside will disappear.\nAlternate ways to access.\nAcrobatics.\nThere are a couple of ways to enter the main university grounds without being a Mages' Guild Apprentice. With a high enough &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; skill (extremely high, well over 100), the wall itself can be scaled. Doing so involves jumping from the parapet nearest the Arch-Mage's lobby, onto the lobby roof itself, then several more jumps over the wall. One will drop down a considerable distance, and take damage even at higher skill levels.\nThe Hero can also wait outside the lobby for one of the characters that regularly walks in and out of the university to open the gate, and follow them in. However, even if they manage to get onto the grounds, none of the buildings will open unless they are already a Mages' Guild member.\nPaintbrushes.\nAnother way to gain entrance into the university without being an Apprentice is to use the paintbrush glitch. They should have a decent Acrobatics skill (at least 50) and ten to twenty paintbrushes. Drop one, jump on top of it, and drop another. Repeat until they get to the top, then jump off.\nAnother way of doing this requires less Acrobatics skill. They need some paintbrushes. Go to the ledge near the left-hand-side iron gate (upon entering the Arcane University area). Drop a paintbrush, jump on it, then repeat until they are high enough to jump on the roofing above that gate. Now jump and move sideways until over the top. Landing on the ledge on the other side prevents most, if not all damage.\nServices/Sections.\nThe Arcane University provides a number of services that cannot be found anywhere else in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the guild members who reside in the university are a wealth of information for the aspiring mage and for all citizens of Cyrodiil.\nThe Hero can find libraries, archives, classrooms and lecture halls, practice rooms, alchemical laboratories, enchanting centers, spell-crafting halls and living quarters throughout the university, with important, usable items in every location. Provided here is a short description of each location and the (Numbers) indicate the position on the map to the right.\nPraxographical Center.\nThe Praxographical Center (2) is the home to the spell crafters of the Mages' Guild. It contains several &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altars of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of dedicated spell vendors. This area is open only to Apprentice rank (or higher) members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Borissean\"&gt;Borissean&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaspar%20Stegine\"&gt;Gaspar Stegine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spell Merchants&lt;/a&gt;, can usually be found here and upstairs one can find their living quarters.\nMystic Archives.\nThe Mystic Archives (3) are the central repository of the Mages' Guild's knowledge in Cyrodiil. It is a vast library, containing many books that cannot be found anywhere else on Tamriel, in which most are found upstairs.\nThe archives are run by &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt;, a repository of arcane knowledge. A number of quests, including part of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt;, require the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to find books here, or speak to &lt;a href=\"Tar-Meena\"&gt;Tar-Meena&lt;/a&gt; herself who sometimes can be found in the lobby.\nMage Quarters.\nThe Mage Quarters (4) is a part of the Arcane University. Only guild members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29%23Ranks%20and%20guild%20perks\"&gt;rank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Associate\"&gt;Associate&lt;/a&gt; and higher can enter. It serves as the sleeping quarters for the members of the university.\n&lt;a href=\"Beds%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Beds&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the first level, on the second level, and in the basement. All containers here reset. A &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; woman here &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;trains&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;.\nImperial Watchtower.\nThe Imperial Watchtower (5) is the section of the Arcane University which houses a few &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Battlemage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; for the defense of the University. It resembles very closely the various other watchtowers in that it contains similar accoutrements and serves as quarters for part of the Imperial Watch. The tower, while unlocked, is not open to anyone (i.e. it displays a to signify trespassing), regardless of &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; affiliation.\nThe towers are located at the back of the University, and the main entrance, which is on the north-west side in the public area, leads to the &lt;a href=\"City%20Isle%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;City Isle&lt;/a&gt; and features a foot bridge leading to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arboretum\"&gt;Arboretum&lt;/a&gt;.\nA ladder leads to the \"Imperial Watch Barracks\", a small room lined with four beds and accompanying chests. There is no third floor or basement.\nThis area is located inside the Arcane University and accessible only to Associate rank (or higher) members of the Mages Guild.\nPractice Rooms.\nThe Practice Rooms (6) are parts of the Arcane University where students can practice their magic on targets. &lt;a href=\"Renald%20Viernis\"&gt;Renald Viernis&lt;/a&gt; is the Practice Room Proctor.\nThe building has two floors with three targets on the ground floor, and three on the 2nd floor. If the Hero stands in between the mages and the targets, they can get the &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; effects.\nChironasium.\nThe Chironasium (7) provides enchantment services to guild members. The building contains several &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altars of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, where mages can use soul gems to add enchantments to their mundane items.\nThis building is also notable for its caretaker, &lt;a href=\"Delmar\"&gt;Delmar&lt;/a&gt;, who assists all novice mages in obtaining their &lt;a href=\"Mage%27s%20Staff%20%28Custom%29\"&gt;Mage's Staff&lt;/a&gt;. One can also find the &lt;a href=\"Skill%20Perk%23Magic%20Arts\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Martina%20Floria\"&gt;Martina Floria&lt;/a&gt; here. This area is open only to Apprentice rank (or higher) members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nLustratorium.\nThe Lustratorium (8) is the main alchemical center of the University. It includes a few alchemy books, and is run by &lt;a href=\"Julienne%20Fanis\"&gt;Julienne Fanis&lt;/a&gt;, a noted alchemical researcher though she is often found in the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Arch-Mage's Lobby&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Lustratorium, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; can meet people who know things about &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, or discover useful books. Upstairs is a more relaxed area with chairs, tables and a study area.\nUniversity Tower and Arch-Mage's Lobby.\nIn the tower itself, the bottom floor foyer contains the Arch-Mage's lobby (9). This is the main audience chamber for higher ranking guild members, and the only area of the University that is open to the public. &lt;a href=\"Master-Wizard\"&gt;Master-Wizard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt;, the second highest-ranking member of the guild, is usually found here holding audiences.\nWhenever the Hero is sent to talk to a university staff member, they are likely found in the lobby during some portion of the day. The lobby also holds the only entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Orrery\"&gt;Imperial Orrery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second floor of the university tower is the chambers for the Council of Mages, and the three council members are usually found here. The top floor of the university tower houses the quarters of the Arch-Mage himself. In addition to the standard bed and storage, the arch-mage has access to his own personal altars of spellmaking and enchanting, as well as an enchanted chest which can replicate alchemical ingredients.\nOutside of these buildings, on the main university grounds, there is a lecture area that is frequently used by instructors to teach classes of approximately a half-dozen students.\nAt other times, various guild members can be found wandering the grounds, or sitting in the open area park benches. As Arch-Mage, the Hero can request for one of these guild members to follow them and fight at their side. In addition, near the entrance to the Lustratorium is a garden full of various plant species, some of them only found in distant parts of Cyrodiil.\nOrrery.\nThe Imperial Orrery is one of the few working observatories on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, although it is in need of repair.

He is also a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;, and believes that &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; is to blame for allowing him to turn after becoming &lt;a href=\"Vampirism\"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nSometime in the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, Vyrthur served as the Arch-Curate within the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. During this time he was turned into a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt; by one of the initiates of the Chantry.\nHe believed that Auri-El, the Snow Elves' primary deity, betrayed him by not providing him with any protection against &lt;a href=\"Diseases%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;. In an act of revenge for allowing him to become inflicted with vampirism, Vyrthur created the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; prophecy, the fulfillment of which would weaken Auri-El's overall influence on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and provide him some measure of personal satisfaction for his suffering. All that was needed to fulfill this prophecy was the blood of a &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Daughter of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Chantry of Auri-El was attacked by the twisted remnants of his extinct race - the &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;. Several stormed the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, but Vyrthur evidently defeated the intruders, freezing them solid within casings of ice.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to obtain Auriel's Bow, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is tasked by &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; to fill the &lt;a href=\"Initiate%27s%20Ewer\"&gt;Initiate's Ewer&lt;/a&gt; at five of Auriel's &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Wayshrines&lt;/a&gt;, in order to unlock the Inner Sanctum where Vyrthur awaits with the bow in his possession.\nAfter entering Auriel's Chapel, he can be found seated on a throne behind a magical wall of ice. Approaching him will begin a short dialogue, admitting that he has been waiting all this time for someone to bring the final component to him, namely &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he unleashes swarms of frozen Falmer and &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Chaurus&lt;/a&gt; upon the Dragonborn and Serana.\nOnce the swarms have been defeated, Vyrthur will destroy the entire roof of the chapel in a fit of rage and retreat out to a grand balcony overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;. He is promptly defeated by the Dragonborn and Serana, leaving his brother Gelebor as the only known Snow Elf.\nConversations.\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Did you really come here expecting to claim Auriel's Bow? You've done exactly as I predicted and brought your fetching companion to me.\"\nSerana: \"Wait, is he talking about me?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Which, I'm sorry to say, means your usefulness is at an end!\"\nAfter killing the first wave of Falmer:\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"An impressive display, but a wasted effort. You delay nothing but your own deaths!\"\nSerana: \"Watch out! He's pulling down the ceiling!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Finish them!\"\nAfter killing the second wave of Falmer:\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"This has gone on long enough.\"\nSerana: \"Your life ends here, Vyrthur!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Child, my life ended long before you were born!\"\nAfter killing the third wave of Falmer:\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"No... I won't let you ruin centuries of preparations...\"\nSerana: \"Surrender and give us the bow!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Death first!\"\nAfter the collapsing of the chantry:\nSerana: \"\"Enough, Vyrthur. Give us &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;the bow&lt;/a&gt;!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"How dare you. I was the Arch-Curate of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, girl.

But Auriel should have protected you...\"\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"The moment I was infected by one of my own Initiates, Auri-El turned his back on me. I swore I'd have my revenge, no matter what the cost.\"\nSerana: \"You want to take revenge... on a god?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"Auri-El himself may have been beyond my reach, but his influence on our world wasn't. All I needed was the blood of a vampire and his own weapon, Auriel's Bow.\"\nSerana: \"\"The blood of a vampire... Auriel's Bow... It... it was you? You created &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;that prophecy&lt;/a&gt;?\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"A prophecy that lacked a single, final ingredient... the blood of a pure vampire. The blood of a &lt;a href=\"Daughters%20of%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Daughter of Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\"\"\nSerana: \"You were waiting... all this time for someone with my blood to come along. Well, too bad for you... I intend on keeping it. Let's see if your blood has any power to it!\"\nArch-Curate Vyrthur: \"What trickery is this?\"\nCombat.\nIn battle, he uses ice magic. Spells such as &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Spear\"&gt;Icy Spear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Cloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frost Cloak&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to a unique variant of &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Drain%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampiric Drain&lt;/a&gt; that also drains &lt;a href=\"Stamina%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, make up the core of his arsenal. He also typically summons a &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the battle. Once his &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; runs out, he switches to his &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost-enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven Dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is possible to defeat him very quickly and easily when using the full &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; shout to blow him off the grand balcony, causing him to fall to his death. However, the armor he wears may become unobtainable as a result.\nHe will say the following statements during battle:\nNotable items.\nArch-Curate Vyrthur wears the only obtainable set of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Falmer%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Falmer Armor&lt;/a&gt;.

Those who will grow into great leaders, remarkable scholars, and mighty warriors for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. And, starting this season, for the entire &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, as well. Often, my visions don't manifest until a student has spent some time within the Academy. Most years, no one emerges who quite matches my hopes and dreams.\nWhich is why I was encouraged, confused, and a bit frightened when I started receiving visions of three students who haven't even arrived at the Academy yet. At first, I worried that my visions were faulty. But this is not the case. These visions are as clear as any I've ever experienced, albeit with dark undertones I do not yet understand.\nMy first vision concerned &lt;a href=\"Tedras%20Relvi\"&gt;Tedras Relvi&lt;/a&gt;. A noble son of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, his entire life has involved magic. His father is a &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, his mother a &lt;a href=\"Healer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;. Pompous and a bit of a whiny brat, Tedras is lazy and hard-headed. He's also a master of word and wit. In fact, I think he might make a better bard than a wizard. Still, I must heed my visions. From what I've seen, his future self grows into a master negotiator.\n&lt;a href=\"Hadmar%20the%20Thin-Boned\"&gt;Hadmar the Thin-Boned&lt;/a&gt; was the subject of my second vision. It's rare for me to see a &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; in a vision, and rarer still that a Nord develops significant magical talent. With a pure heart and a warrior's spirit, Hadmar possesses a good soul. He's also dumb as a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt;. Will he embrace his magical studies? Regardless, I see him standing tall upon the field of battle. Does he have the makings of a battlemage, perhaps?\nThe final vision concerned &lt;a href=\"Lena%20Dalvel\"&gt;Lena Dalvel&lt;/a&gt;, and it was the most confusing of the three. Her lineage contains almost no magical heritage. In fact, I'm not sure how she got an invitation to our school\u2014perhaps a House noble recognized her talent? Her vision is the most promising\u2014and the most frightening. Lena stands on a balance that could easily tip toward the darkness or the light, two possible paths for her to walk. One path shows her as a great leader of the people, serving in a coming time of troubles. The other path shows her involvement in the destruction of the world. This particular vision disturbs me greatly, and it must not be allowed to come to pass. She must finish her trials under my guidance. It's imperative that her proper destiny be fulfilled."}

It also leads into &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcanaeum\"&gt;The Arcanaeum&lt;/a&gt; and the top of the College of Winterhold. The hall bends to the right, opening into a circular room with an alchemy garden in the center.

Around the perimeter of the room resides a &lt;a href=\"Rest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bed&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Arcane Enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alchemy Lab&lt;/a&gt;, and several storage devices, including a safe.\nItem regeneration.\n&lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Potion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, food, and other items can be looted from the Arch-Mage's quarters.

If the Dragonborn becomes Arch-Mage, the items no longer regenerate as swiftly. 30 days for ingredients; as well as the Staff of the Frost Atronach, Boots, Troll Skull, Baskets, etc."}

The rooms behind the tower are barred from the public; only mages who have received recommendations from each city can pass beyond them.\nThe tower itself contains three levels: the lobby, the council chambers, and the Arch-Mage's private quarters, respectively. The lobby is open to the public, while the Council Chambers are only accessible to &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and above, unless instruction to meet another, higher ranking mage there is given, such as with &lt;a href=\"Evoker\"&gt;Evoker&lt;/a&gt;s who receive their tasks from &lt;a href=\"Irlav%20Jarol\"&gt;Irlav Jarol&lt;/a&gt;.\nArch-Mage's Lobby.\nThis area contains the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29%23Orrery\"&gt;Orrery&lt;/a&gt;. It also has 2 entrances to the Arcane University and one to the courtyard.\nThis is the only building that can be entered before completing the Mages Guild Recommendations. The door to the plug-in specific Imperial Orrery is across from the entrance. The two doors on either side of it lead to University grounds, which cannot be accessed without the proper authorization.\nA portal on the east side of the room leads to the Arch-Mage's Tower Council Chambers. The display case beside this door holds three &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;grand soul gems&lt;/a&gt;, of which two are filled, and is locked with a &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;very hard lock&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bothiel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bothiel&lt;/a&gt; and Council member &lt;a href=\"Raminus%20Polus\"&gt;Raminus Polus&lt;/a&gt; can be found roaming the lobby during daylight hours. Raminus gives quests and advancements in rank to Mages Guild members, and also sells spells to members and non-members.\nCouncil Chambers.\nThis is where the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; himself can be found during the daytime. The entrance to this room is through a portal in the lobby. A table in the middle of the room holds a scroll of minor heal other and absorb agility can be found on, along with a recipe for a Restore Fatigue potion. Two barrels and a sack, all containing clutter, sit on the east side of the room, with two more clutter sacks in a northern alcove.\nA display case with a very hard lock beside the barrels holds two replica glass daggers and an empty lesser soul gem. There are two bookshelves in the chamber; a novice alembic sits on top of the southernmost. A portal to the right of the entrance transports members to the Arch-Mage's Quarters. The two barrels respawn, but the three sacks do not.\nCouncil members &lt;a href=\"Irlav%20Jarol\"&gt;Irlav Jarol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caranya\"&gt;Caranya&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the chambers most of the day.\nArch-Mage's Quarters.\nThis is the Arch-Mage's room, containing an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Enchanting\"&gt;Altar of Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt; and a special &lt;a href=\"enchanted%20chest\"&gt;enchanted chest&lt;/a&gt; used in &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThree bookshelves can be found within the quarters. Three novice retorts and two mortars and pestles can be found on the shelves of one bookshelf and another smaller one holds a few books, including a fragment of the \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Hrormir\"&gt;Song of Hrormir&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Children%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Children of the Sky&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Firmament\"&gt;The Firmament&lt;/a&gt;\". Between these two bookshelves stands an enchanting altar.\nThe tallest bookcase contains many books, including \"&lt;a href=\"Aevar%20Stone-Singer\"&gt;Aevar Stone-Singer&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hanging%20Gardens\"&gt;Hanging Gardens&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"More%20Than%20Mortal\"&gt;More Than Mortal&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Provinces%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Provinces of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Seed\"&gt;The Seed&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Arcana%20Restored\"&gt;Arcana Restored&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Daedra\"&gt;Spirit of the Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\", and a novice calcinator. A sample of &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt; grows next to this bookcase.\nTraven's amenities include two desks, with one holding four books including a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20History%20and%20Culture\"&gt;Dwemer History and Culture&lt;/a&gt;\" and a copy of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20King%20of%20the%20Ayleids\"&gt;The Last King of the Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;\", as well as a novice alembic and calcinator. A small wine rack lies next to his bed, containing nine bottles of &lt;a href=\"Surilie%20Brothers%20Wine\"&gt;Surilie Brothers Wine&lt;/a&gt; and a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Tamika%20Vintage%20399\"&gt;Tamika Vintage 399&lt;/a&gt;. Between the wine rack and the enchanted chest stands a spellmaking altar.\nAt the foot of his bed a chest of drawers holds clothing, and on the left side of his bed is the Arch-Mage's nightstand, which is the only container in the room safe for long-term storage, and needs a key. A plate with two apples and a pear sits on top. The two baskets at the head of the bed hold a sample of bonemeal and another of imp gall."}

If spoken to, he will tell you that he and his order are gathering relics to Arkay, to stem the tide of undead. Alvaren's associates have been sent to various parts of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, but he yas yet to receive word from any of them. He will ask you to go to the locations his associates were sent to and investigate. \nThere are three people you should be looking for; &lt;a href=\"Edweg\"&gt;Edweg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Matthiaume\"&gt;Matthiaume&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cesabelle\"&gt;Cesabelle&lt;/a&gt;.

Look behind a crumbled wall just west of the map icon. She has found the relic she was looking for, and was just about to return to Alvaren with it. \nMatthiaume will be in the far west of the region, in the &lt;a href=\"Flyleaf%20Catacombs\"&gt;Flyleaf Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;. You will find his body a piece of &lt;a href=\"Matthiaume%27s%20Journal\"&gt;his journal&lt;/a&gt; in a room along the southeastern hallway. He apparently died at the hands of the bandits here while looking for something called &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Saint Ellencia's Prayer Book&lt;/a&gt;. You can find this relic in the northeastern room. This room also houses the dungeon's boss &lt;a href=\"Miremonwe%20Spellslinger\"&gt;Miremonwe Spellslinger&lt;/a&gt; as well as a skyshard, so you might want to deal with these things. You will be looking for an ancient grave in the northeast of the room; dig there and you will find the prayer book. On your way out, make sure to read Handre's Last Will to start the quest &lt;a href=\"Fadeel%27s%20Freedom\"&gt;Fadeel's Freedom&lt;/a&gt;.\nYour final target is Edweg, who will be southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost%20Downs\"&gt;Hoarfrost Downs&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Barrows\"&gt;Sanguine Barrows&lt;/a&gt;.

The relic you're looking for, the &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fingerbone of Saint Marben&lt;/a&gt;, is located at the top of the barrows, but Edweg is unwilling to put himself in danger to retrieve it.

Growing up as a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, Tarvus was drawn to the words of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec the Warrior-Poet&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of three divine rulers of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and joined the Tribunal Temple in order to serve him. While training as an acolyte, he sought to eventually become a &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt;, but Vivec persuaded him to pursue the life in the priesthood instead. The diligence and dedication he displayed in his service to the Tribunal convinced Vivec to select Tarvus as his new archcanon, the youngest in history at the time of the Interregnum.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Archcanon%27s%20Office\"&gt;his office&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Hall of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, located within the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Canton%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Temple Canton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, Archcanon Tarvus provided counsel to Vivec and directed Tribunal operations in the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; region of Morrowind. He also oversaw construction of Vivec City, initiated studies into the feasibility of creating a &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;new Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; in Vvardenfell, and wrote several books describing the militant orders of the Tribunal Temple. In the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Tarvus directed the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige's&lt;/a&gt; investigation into the origins of a mysterious illness afflicting Vivec.\nBiography.\nEarly Life.\nApproximately 220 years old during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;, Tarvus Indoril was likely born to &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; parents around the year &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;2E 363.&lt;/a&gt; He spent his formative years as a member of &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, one of the five &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; that dominated &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. This conservative and orthodox upbringing instilled within him a belief in the racial and cultural superiority of the Dunmer, a suspicion of foreign outlanders, and reverence for the traditions of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from House Indoril, the sermons and exploits of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec the Warrior-Poet&lt;/a&gt;\u2014one of the three Living Gods that constituted the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;\u2014also greatly influenced Tarvus. The ideals of chivalry, duty, and honor embodied by Vivec resonated with Tarvus and inspired much of his future development.\nAs a member of House Indoril and a devotee of Lord Vivec, Tarvus felt pressured to dedicate his life to the service of the Tribunal Temple. Casting aside his youthful inclination towards adventure and poetry, he became an acolyte of the Temple and underwent the basic training it required of its servants. After the completion of his training, Tarvus sought to join one of the militant orders responsible for defending the Tribunal and enforcing its will throughout Morrowind. Although he briefly considered enlisting with the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;, Tarvus primarily aspired to join the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an adventurous and roguish order of warriors that served as the personal champions of Vivec and protectors of the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; pilgrimage routes\u2014due to their personal service of Vivec. Vivec, however, personally intervened and convinced Tarvus to join the priesthood instead.\nThroughout his career with the Temple, Tarvus demonstrated tremendous aptitude for both his spiritual and administrative duties. This aptitude, combined with his diligence and dedication to the Tribunal, resulted in his rapid advancement through the ranks of the Tribunal Temple hierarchy. Eventually, Tarvus achieved the rank of &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the highest religious office in Vvardenfell during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;\u2014following the death of his predecessor. By granting him the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon%27s%20Signet\"&gt;signet ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archcanon%27s%20Office\"&gt;office&lt;/a&gt; that signaled his new position, Vivec also bestowed upon Tarvus the distinction of being the youngest &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; to attain the rank of archcanon.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Conundrum\"&gt;Divine Conundrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchcanon Tarvus will disapprove of asking an outlander like the Vestige to help with Vivec's problem.

Yours truly, Seventy-sixth &lt;a href=\"Adjuvant%20Drumara\"&gt;Adjuvant Drumara&lt;/a&gt;, sat down to interview the busy cleric in his well-appointed office in the Hall of Wisdom, in the canton directly across from &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Palace%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec's Palace&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdjuvant Drumara: Thank you for agreeing to talk with me, Archcanon. The faithful who regularly read our weekly missives have been asking to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; who keeps the Temple and the city running smoothly.\nArchcanon Tarvus: Lord Vivec and the Tribunal keep the wheels turning. I am merely their servant.\nAdjuvant Drumara: Modest, as always! How did you find your way to a life of religious service?\nArchcanon Tarvus: I grew up in &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, so while a role in the Temple wasn't guaranteed, it was certainly strongly encouraged. I found that the words of the Warrior-Poet moved me, and I quickly gravitated toward serving Lord Vivec. Here's a secret few people know\u2014I almost dedicated myself to the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt;. The call to adventure appealed to my younger self, and I even fancied myself something of a poet. Lord Vivec, however, had other plans for me.\nAdjuvant Drumara: So it's true that Lord Vivec himself recruited you into his priesthood?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Let's not make the story more significant than the reality. I was a young acolyte, training for a life of service in the Temple. When the time came to choose a path, Lord Vivec talked to me and suggested I would do better in the priesthood than as a swashbuckling Armiger or a militaristic &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;. I meditated on my choice and discovered, deep in my heart, that I agreed with him.\nAdjuvant Drumara: And then you demonstrated a real talent for both spiritual and administrative labors, rising to become the youngest canon ever to attain the rank of archcanon?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Young? I suppose so. But that was so long ago. I worked hard, constantly demonstrating my devotion to Vivec, the Three, and the people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. That Lord Vivec saw fit to reward me with this honor and this responsibility, well, you'd have to ask him why I of all the canons was ultimately selected to replace my predecessor. I am just grateful for the opportunity to help my Lord and serve my Temple.\nAdjuvant Drumara: Your sermons on the dangers of outlanders in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; can be quite stirring. Do you think our land really faces a threat from those who come with different cultures and beliefs?\nArchcanon Tarvus: For a minor priest and functionary, you tend to ask leading questions. My views on outlanders, however, are quite well known and completely consistent. No one other than the Dark Elves can claim such a unique relationship as we have with our Living Gods. That gives us a perspective and outlook on life that is, in fact, superior to every other culture in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. We are stronger when we are pure, when our culture isn't polluted by the thoughts and ideas of the lesser peoples. But other than that, I have nothing against the occasional outlander visiting our fair and beautiful island of Vvardenfell. \"To challenge the strange allows us to know our strength,\" as the Warrior-Poet has written.\nAdjuvant Drumara: One of your closest aides, &lt;a href=\"Canon%20Llevule\"&gt;Canon Llevule Andrano&lt;/a&gt;, has been quoted as saying that you \"carry the burden of Lord Vivec and the entire palace atop your shoulders.\" Do you agree with his assessment?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Is it a burden to serve the Warrior-Poet? Is it an obligation to make sure the business of the palace and the Temple and the city progresses smoothly and without stumble? I do what I do for my love of the Tribunal and its people. That is not a burden, Adjuvant Drumara, that is a rare and singular privilege! I do my best to instill that same attitude in all of the priests that serve under my administration. You would do well to remember that, as I am quite certain you fit into that category.\nAdjuvant Drumara: Of course, Archcanon Tarvus. I simply asked so that I could quote you accurately. May I ask one more question before we conclude this interview?\nArchcanon Tarvus: If you must.\nAdjuvant Drumara: How is the work on Vivec City coming along?\nArchcanon Tarvus: Construction on Lord Vivec's metropolis proceeds just as the Warrior-Poet has commanded. The cantons take shape like islands in the bay. The ziggurats rise as though to touch &lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; itself. It is already a masterpiece, and it is not yet nearly half done! Vivec City is already the envy of every other nation in Tamriel. Imagine the accolades we shall receive as it nears completion! Now, if we're done here, I have the business of Lord Vivec to get back to."}

Archers are able to take down most foes before they have a chance to draw their sword. Archers typically wear light armor and can use any weapon, although their weapons of choice tend to be the long bow and the short bow. Needing both hands for utilizing their weapons of choice, archers rarely carry shields. A high agility ensures accuracy in delivering their arrows, and a high strength ensures maximum penetration.\nDescription.\nThough good all-round light skirmishers, unsurprisingly it is the bow that defines the Archer class. &lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; is their primary offensive skill, and with no specialty in &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; and only wearing &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt;, they will want to make full use of it to kill or soften up enemies at range.\n&lt;a href=\"Sneak\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Marksman\"&gt;Marksman&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most powerful combinations in the game and will help an Archer get a powerful first hit on unsuspecting opponents, or evade combat altogether if they want. In the late game when Sneak is at a high level, Archers will be able to one-shot most weaker enemies and use hit and fade tactics against tough foes. An Archer can even take up a life of crime if so desired (being skilled at lockpicking also helps).\nArchers work best at range but are far from helpless in close quarters. A Combat type character, they are capable of using either &lt;a href=\"Blade\"&gt;Blade&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blunt\"&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt; class weapons effectively, though it is best to specialize in one or the other. Which style of weapon an Archer uses is largely a matter of taste. The Archer has no Block skill so that means they don't lose out much by not using a shield and wielding a large two-handed weapon instead. A one-handed weapon allows for fast attacks, two-handed ones hit hard and have a longer reach but are slower and drain\u00a0more fatigue when swung. Or, since an Archer also has the &lt;a href=\"Hand-to-Hand\"&gt;Hand-to-Hand&lt;/a&gt; skill, it is possible to forgo using any melee weapon at all.\nLastly the Archer is also an &lt;a href=\"Armorer\"&gt;Armorer&lt;/a&gt; who can maintain their weapons and armor to keep them in mint condition."}

This can be used to send a creature to attack an enemy that would not be viable for other to attack, place a creature with &lt;a href=\"Guard%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Guard&lt;/a&gt; in the opposite lane to prevent other creatures in that lane or the summoner themselves from being attacked, or avoid a creature in their current lane thereby allowing them to bypass a Guard or avoid a lethal attack. Additionally, enemy creatures may also be moved. Moving an enemy creature to the other lane may make it vulnerable to attacks by a stronger friendly creature or away from a Guard in its original lane, prevent it from attacking another friendly creature or the player directly if there is a friendly Guard in the lane it is moving to, or allow creatures in its original lane or the enemy summoner themselves to be attacked if the creature moving is a Guard.\nArcher's Gambit also deals 1 point of damage to the enemy creature with the greatest power. This can serve to defeat creatures with 1 health or make other creatures easier to defeat. The card &lt;a href=\"Finish%20Off\"&gt;Finish Off&lt;/a&gt; can pair with cards that deal small amounts of damage against strong creatures as it will kill any creature that is wounded. Thus, a creature that has been damaged with Archer's Gambit can be instantly killed, regardless of its remaining health."}

The Archery skill is raised by and governs the use of &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crossbows%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;crossbows&lt;/a&gt;. Archery benefits from &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Thief Stone&lt;/a&gt; (Though it appears under the warrior stone on the skill tree simply because it is the last thief stone affected skill on the warrior side, such as enchanting is on the mage side). Users of the skill, such as &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunters&lt;/a&gt;, are trained in the use of bows and arrows. The greater the skill, the more deadly the shot. Archery provides low health and &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lightly armored&lt;/a&gt; characters the means to engage foes from a safe distance and allows repeated &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneak attacks&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes of bow.\nBows.\nA bow is a flexible, bent or curved ranged weapon, strung taut from end to end with a string. Arrows are nocked into the string and then drawn. The string is then released, propelling the arrow forward. The weight of the bow dictates the effort required to pull the string back, or \"draw.\" The heavier the bow, the longer it will take to fully draw. The longer the amount of time taken to fully draw a bow, the more damage a shot will do, and the faster and farther an arrow will travel. While a bow is drawn, movement is reduced significantly.\nBows can be found in stores all over Skyrim. Most stores that sell them are dedicated to selling ranged weapons, mostly carrying both bows and arrows as well as certain light armor a character may use. Many different creatures carry variants of bows, including the &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; found in most dungeons and caves in Skyrim. Some &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found in places ranging from camps to keeps, also carry bows and arrows. Bows, like swords, get stronger depending on what they are made of.\nCrossbows.\nA crossbow consists of a bow mounted horizontally onto a mechanical stock. The bow string is pulled back onto a catch which holds the string taut. A &lt;a href=\"Bolts%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;bolt&lt;/a&gt; is then loaded into a groove in front of the catch. When a lever located at the bottom of the stock is pulled, the catch is released and the bow string pushes the bolt forward. Crossbows are slower to reload than most bows are to redraw, but they shoot projectiles at a higher velocity than most bows. They still however have the same reduction of speed while reloading. Crossbows make a noticeable sound when fired and nearby enemies may become aware of the source, but are still useful for stealth attacks due to their high damage. The slightly lower rate of fire when compared to standard bows is less important when a character is able to kill their target on the first hit. Crossbows are generally more expensive than their bow counterparts. \nRange.\nThere are two types of ranges for both bows and crossbows: arc range and maximum range.\nArc range.\nThe arc range varies between each type of bow and crossbow. It is directly proportional to a bow's/crossbow's firing velocity.\nBows always fire in an upwards arc, propelling the arrow slightly upwards. A bow with a high firing velocity will have a long arc range. When fired from a high velocity bow, the arrow will continue traveling in an upwards arc for a longer period of time, and will eventually start to drop and arc slightly downwards. After this, the arrow will eventually come to a point in which it drops steeply and its horizontal speed decelerates immensely. If in the air for a long enough period of time, the arrow will have lost all horizontal velocity and fall completely.\nThis works similarly for crossbow bolts, however when bolts are fired they are not propelled in an upwards arc. Instead, they will travel straight from the Crossbow. Because they don't travel in an upwards arc, they will begin to drop immediately and will enter a steep downwards arc earlier than that of an arrow.\nMaximum range.\nThe maximum range is a range that is universal for both bows and crossbows. It is the maximum range an arrow or bolt will travel from the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; before it stops doing damage. This range usually occurs around 60\u201365 meters. At this point, all arrows and bolts will do no damage to the target, regardless of whether or not the target is in rendering range of the archer. Arrows and bolts that hit a foe past this range will most often clip through them and continue traveling until hitting an object (i.e. a tree, the ground, etc.). A non-hostile character will not become hostile when this happens, however an already hostile character will immediately begin to look for the Dragonborn if the projectile lands close enough.\nDamage.\nThe damage caused by an archery hit is equal to the sum of the bow's damage and the arrow's damage divided by the time it takes to fire the bow (see &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; for details on draw times). Thus, using a five point better bow or a five point better arrow increases the damage by the same amount. It should also be noted that since damage is inversely proportional to draw time, the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29%23Perks\"&gt;Quick Shot&lt;/a&gt; perk not only increases rate of fire by 30%, it also increases damage by a factor of three and a third by multiplying the time in the denominator by 30%.\nAll damage is computed before bonuses from Overdraw, &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;stealth attacks&lt;/a&gt; and enchanted items.\nAs an example, a &lt;a href=\"Dragonbone%20Bow\"&gt;dragonbone bow&lt;/a&gt; (30 damage, speed 0.75) firing a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;daedric arrow&lt;/a&gt; (24 damage) by an archer with 40% Overdraw and Quick Shot:\n(30+24)/(0.75*0.30)*1.40 = (54/0.225)*1.40 = 240*1.4 = 336 points of damage.\nThe same character using a &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunting bow&lt;/a&gt; (7 damage, speed 0.937) and an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Arrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron arrow&lt;/a&gt; (8 damage) would do:\n(7+8)/(0.937*0.30)*1.40 = 75 points of damage.\nLeveling.\nBooks.\nThe following books provide a permanent one-time increase to the Dragonborn's Archery skill. See each book's page for a list of possible locations.\nTrainers.\nThe following individuals can increase this skill by giving them gold:\nArchery weapons.\nThe following are the confirmed weapons that benefit from this skill. Damage, weight, and value are base values, independent of &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill level&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt;.\nCrossbows.\n\"All crossbows are craftable and are a part of only\"\nPerks.\nThe following are &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; that become available to select as the skill is leveled up:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nLeveling Archery.\nThe equation governing skill gain in Archery is thought to resemble something like this:\nThus, this relies on a damaging hit being scored. Therefore, to gain experience, the target must have health points, and that the attack must take away health (so no experience is gained if they nullify damage with a block or dodge).\nUpon a damaging hit, the skill experience gained is based on the Base weapon damage and the Base ammunition damage. Therefore an excellent bow and arrows with high damage will level the skill most rapidly \"per shot,\" but if the goal is to achieve the most leveling \"per enemy\" then basic iron arrows will provide the most total skill since the portion of the damage absorbed by the target's armor still counts toward the skill. The equation ignores perk increases, sneak multipliers, damage boosts from enchantments, or fully drawing the bow. As a result, firing arrows rapidly into a target will yield just as much experience per shot as a full or overdrawn shot. This will therefore result in more experience being gained from a single target, and faster gain, by using quick and weak shots (and poorer quality arrows), since the target will survive more of them.\nThe division by x is to represent that the base damage is not directly translated into skill experience. Currently, the actual value is unknown.\nA &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bound Bow&lt;/a&gt; will also allow one to increase Archery, as well as provide free arrows.\nOne method of leveling is to sneak attack the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; at High Hrothgar. Find one of the Greybeards (preferably in the main area meditating), behind them at short distance, and simply shoot over and over (waiting a few seconds between shots yields sneak attacks, which will train Sneak at the same time). This can also help leveling Restoration with the use of the Healing Hands spell. (Using melee or magic will result in angering them.)\nAnother good target for training is &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;, who has very high health, cannot die permanently, and will not fight back. However, this method requires significant progress in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quest line.\nAnother way to quickly level Archery also requires joining the Dark Brotherhood. Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, jump onto the ledge that oversees the pool and training area. This can be done by jumping from the nearby staircase. Once on the ledge, wait until &lt;a href=\"Veezara\"&gt;Veezara&lt;/a&gt; sits on the ground, completely in view, and then enter Sneak mode and shoot him. As it is unlikely that anyone will see this, it's possible to fire constantly, training both Archery and Sneak steadily. A similar technique can be used on &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt;.\nA different method is to visit the special archery trainer, &lt;a href=\"Angi\"&gt;Angi&lt;/a&gt;, who lives in a cabin in the southwest corner of the map by &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. She trains in archery for free by letting the Dragonborn shoot at targets with special practice arrows. Completing her training will grant a total of six free levels. This is best done with a high Archery skill, since like any other trainer, each boost bumps the Dragonborn's skill up to the next level, ignoring the experience required to reach it. Training with her at level 94 will allow maximizing the skill, skipping the final six levels, which would normally require the greatest amount of time to complete.\nA free method of training would be to train with &lt;a href=\"Niruin\"&gt;Niruin&lt;/a&gt; in the Thieves' guild. He is a master trainer, and can train the Dragonborn up to level 90, though after 50 his training can be expensive. It is suggested to approach him while he's in bed and have 800 gold, so the Dragonborn can wake him up, train, let him lie back down, then steal the gold from him. While boosting archery, this also levels the pickpocket skill. Doing this is suggested with Niruin because even if he catches the Dragonborn stealing, he will not become hostile. This can also be done with companions that train archery, allowing one to take the money back by merely asking to trade items."}

Unlike many other &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"DLC%20%28Online%29\"&gt;DLC&lt;/a&gt; books, it is not part of the &lt;a href=\"Library%20of%20Incunabula\"&gt;Library of Incunabula&lt;/a&gt; collection.\nContents.\nTo my esteemed &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Thorn\"&gt;lady&lt;/a&gt;,\nWhen you originally engaged my services to survey your lands, you neglected to mention the nature of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Thorn\"&gt;your abode&lt;/a&gt;. I admit that perhaps I could have performed more research on your history, but that sort of diligence is not often required for someone in my business. This may come as some surprise to you, but architectural surveyors do not live especially exciting lives. I spend most of my time reassuring clients that their newly constructed &lt;a href=\"Taverns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt; will not sink into the swamp. Encountering an ancient castle inhabited entirely by &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;people such as yourself&lt;/a&gt; may end up as the most thrilling moment in my career.\nI do not mention this out of fear or irritation. Indeed, you and your colleagues demonstrated the height of hospitality while I performed my tasks. I found my accommodations for the night comfortable and the roast your servants provided for dinner was quite delicious. I am surprised you could acquire such fine meat this far north. An occasional creaking noise in my room did wake me through the night, but I attribute that to the natural settling of such an ancient castle.\nInstead, I bring this to your attention because of the unfortunate fact that not everyone is as enlightened as I. If you engage other outside agents, they may react poorly if not properly prepared. But, like yourself, I am of a more cultured breed and thus did not succumb to such bigotries while performing my duties.\nSpeaking of which, here is a summary of my findings. My full report is included within the envelope.\nAs you feared, the mountain's frequent groundquakes have created significant damage throughout the castle. Cracks streak through the foundations at several key points. And some walls give the impression they could collapse at any moment. I fear that without immediate attention you could see entire sections fall into ruin. I have provided detailed sketches that pinpoint the most dire locations and recommend you seek repairs soon.\nI inquired with your representative about the origins of the castle. He only responded that you moved in once the &lt;a href=\"Snowbrood%20Clan\"&gt;first inhabitants&lt;/a&gt; no longer had any need for it. Learning more about how the castle was constructed will be important for shoring up any damage.\nIf this mountain continues to exhibit these geological disturbances, the castle will likely need ongoing maintenance. Without constant attention, it will inevitably collapse. Fortunately, someone such as yourself with a longer than average lifespan should have no problem overseeing such preservation efforts.\nFeel free to inquire for recommended masons or carpenters once you decide upon your course of action. Although I am not as familiar with specific local craftspeople, our guild will not hesitate to offer suggestions.\nYours in service,\n&lt;a href=\"Tarnolvar\"&gt;Tarnolvar&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Surveyor\nArchitectural Guild, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; Branch"}

Water flows from the summit, through the Grove, and towards the lower forest. Much of Archon's Grove is open-aired with dirt paths that lead to the inner den. Statues covered in vines and natural arches dot the area. Archon's Grove is known for growing a plant known as the Rose-of-Archon, which is a plant that is considered Mara's beauty incarnate. People from all over Summerset come to harvest these flowers.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;Early Years&lt;/a&gt;.\nA long time ago, there was an Altmer poet by the name of &lt;a href=\"Nenamil\"&gt;Nenamil&lt;/a&gt;, who would always sing ballads about &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, the Goddess of Love. As he grew older, Nenamil became known as the Archon of Song, and became more infatuated by Mara, traveling all over Summerset to be able to see her beauty for himself. It was until he reached what would become, Archon's Grove, that he realized that Mara was not a mere being, but rather beauty incarnate, and he felt this way when he saw the &lt;a href=\"Rose-of-Archon\"&gt;Rose-of-Archon&lt;/a&gt;, to which it became a staple of Mara. From then on, Nenamil taught Mara's ways to the people, and the flower was named after him, becoming sacred to Mara. Archon's Grove upheld this legend for many years.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the area of Archon's Grove was inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Thornfang%20Clan\"&gt;Thornfang Clan&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Werewolves\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; that worship &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the Daedric Prince of the Hunt. Because of their presence, pilgrims and the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt; were unable to go to and harvest these flowers, and so they hired the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Prosecution\"&gt;Divine Prosecution&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the flowers for the upcoming 58th day of the Divine Reverence. The leader of the Thornfang, &lt;a href=\"Den%20Mother%20Toamna\"&gt;Den Mother Toamna&lt;/a&gt;, had captured various pilgrims to sacrifice to Hircine. Eventually, the Den Mother was killed, and the flowers were acquired by a &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Newcomer&lt;/a&gt; hired by the Divine Prosecution.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Archen Grangrove in their quest to recover the pieces."}

He is generally worshiped as the most Manic or Demented individual ever to live, and has a congregation at the &lt;a href=\"Sacellum%20Arden-Sul\"&gt;Sacellum Arden-Sul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"New%20Sheoth\"&gt;New Sheoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe guidelines on how to become a new Duke or Duchess of Dementia or Mania, the \"Ritual of Accession,\" were set forth by Arden-Sul himself.\nAccording to the priest of Dementia, &lt;a href=\"Arctus\"&gt;Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, Arden-Sul's body is \"beyond &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;,\" while his soul is always watching, ready to pounce. The priest of Mania, &lt;a href=\"Dervenin%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Dervenin&lt;/a&gt; also believes Arden-Sul is still exerting influence over the land.\nMania.\nThe Mania side of the Shivering Isles regard Arden-Sul as \"the Artificer Superior,\" known for his craftsmanship and honeyed-tongue. There is no fear in speaking Arden-Sul's name freely, with the priest of Mania enjoying the sound of it.\nAccording to the Mania side, Arden-Sul held a night of absolute indulgence to celebrate his fondness for his brethren. However, the over-consumption of &lt;a href=\"Greenmote\"&gt;Greenmote&lt;/a&gt;, which flowed like water in a stream, caused the hearts of the revelers to explode out of their chests. The lifeblood then flowed from their lifeless bodies. This incident became the guideline for how to ascend to the dukedom of Mania.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;Heretic&lt;/a&gt;s of Mania, on the other hand, view Arden-Sul as the true leader of the Shivering Isles, rather than &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. They refer to Arden-Sul as \"he who gave his heart's blood.\"\nDementia.\nThe Dementia side of the Shivering Isles regard Arden-Sul as \"the Dark Deceiver,\" the bringer of pain and pleasure. One who is not a true Demented should not utter Arden-Sul's name lightly.\nAccording to the Dementia side, Arden-Sul suspected a traitor in his midst. To find the traitor, he fed poisoned wine to his allies and killed them all. He then removed their hearts and used an ancient scrying technique known as \"visceromancy\" to read the lifeblood. When Arden-Sul could not find the traitor, he tore out his own heart in distress. This incident became the guideline for how to ascend to the dukedom of Dementia.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zealot\"&gt;Zealot&lt;/a&gt;s of Dementia, on the other hand, believe Arden-Sul, or he \"who reads the winds in our entrails,\" to be the mortal aspect of Sheogorath."}

While he does not know the full story, he does know that the gauntlets belonged to a &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Casimir\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; of the old order, and that he struck and killed a beggar, causing the gauntlets to fall off his hands and become impossibe to move. To make matters worse for this old knight, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; cursed him and his family, a curse that lives on in his descendant &lt;a href=\"Kellen%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Kellen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAreldur will also state how Kellen had traveled from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes he could somehow lift the curse and is now living at the chapel. Talking to Kellen will confirm that he did come to see if he could lift that curse, but also reveals that he believes that Areldur is hiding something from him.\nTalking to Areldur at this point will confirm Kellen's suspicions. Areldur knew how to lift the curse from the beginning but has been unwilling to do it. In order for the curse to be lifted somebody else must take the curse on themselves, and how he is not strong enough to lift Kellen's curse and take it himself. He then tells the Hero how to lift the curse, reminding him what it will cost.\nAfter Kellen is cured, Areldur will question why he is a priest when he would not even help Kellen while the Hero did so without hesitation. He will then leave the Chapel and head out searching for himself.\nThe next time he is seen, he will be at the &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; may watch gladiatorial combats and bet on the outcome or join the Arena to fight in it themselves.\nThey gain one rank for every three fights they win. The Arena houses two teams; the Yellow Team and the Blue Team, pitted against each other in a never-ending series of fights.\nHistory of the Arena.\nThe Arena was founded by one of the greatest warriors known to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. There is not an exact date, but the Arena was constructed sometime during the tenth century of the First Era before 1E 980, the year that marked the end of the 30-year &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; that killed Gaiden Shinji and many other great heroes.\nGaiden Shinji was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;. His most famous quote was \"The best techniques are passed on by the survivors,\" which was made in 1E 947.\nDescription.\nThe Arena consists of the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Bloodworks\"&gt;Bloodworks&lt;/a&gt; (which contains the Red Room and the practice room), and the Arena itself. The Arena Bloodworks is headed by Blademaster &lt;a href=\"Owyn\"&gt;Owyn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ysabel%20Andronicus\"&gt;Ysabel Andronicus&lt;/a&gt; is the Battle Matron and serves as the Grand Champion's trainer and manager. Grand Champion &lt;a href=\"Agronak%20gro-Malog\"&gt;Agronak gro-Malog&lt;/a&gt; is practicing his swordsmanship skills. There is also find a &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Team%20Gladiator\"&gt;Blue Team Gladiator&lt;/a&gt;, who is either practicing archery or hand to hand, and the &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Team%20Champion\"&gt;Yellow Team Champion&lt;/a&gt;, who is practicing melee.\nThere are various &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;iron weapons&lt;/a&gt; scattered around the Bloodworks, as well as four bedrolls for resting. There are also two Raiment Cabinets which contain both the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Light%20Raiment\"&gt;Arena Light Raiment&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Heavy%20Raiment\"&gt;Arena Heavy Raiment&lt;/a&gt;, should the Hero lose track of their own.\nTo begin competing in the Arena, simply talk to Owyn and wear the chosen Arena Raiment. After the Hero tells him that they are prepared to battle, proceed through the Red Room to the Arena. When returning from battle, be sure to replenish health, magicka, and fatigue at the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Basin of Renewal&lt;/a&gt;.\nOpponents and victory rewards.\n\"PC Level Offset\" refers to how many levels higher the opponent will be compared to the Hero of Kvatch's level. Some opponents' weapons and armor will also be leveled appropriately.\nChampionship.\nOnce the Hero has achieved the rank of Champion, they are given the option of challenging Grand Champion &lt;a href=\"Agronak%20gro-Malog\"&gt;Agronak gro-Malog&lt;/a&gt;. Speak to the battle matron, Ysabel, for more information. She will let them choose an Arena Title from a list and people will then call them by this name after they become Grand Champion. The available names are as follows (some choices depend on the Hero's sex):\nUnlike other fights, they are allowed to wear any equipment they wish. Upon victory, they can loot the longsword, shield, and heavily &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted armor&lt;/a&gt; their opponent wears. To finish the quest, they must give gro-Malog's enchanted armor to Ysabel, who then rewards them with their own version with identical enchantments, again giving them the choice of a heavy or light version.\nAlthough an uncommon issue, if one completes &lt;a href=\"Origin%20of%20the%20Gray%20Prince\"&gt;Origin of the Gray Prince&lt;/a&gt; for Grand Champion Agronak gro-Malog before they fight him, it may count as a murder. This is because he does not fight back. He discovered the truth about his father who was a vampire, and now despises himself knowing he is half vampire.\nAs a result, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; may visit the Hero (if they are not already part of the &lt;a href=\"Factions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;) with the message: \"Your murder has been seen by unknown forces.\" If one wishes to kill Agronak when he gives up via the &lt;a href=\"Console%20Commands%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;console&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"Exploits%20%28Oblivion%29%23Arena\"&gt;Exploits&lt;/a&gt;), it will not count as a murder and the Dark Brotherhood will not visit them.\nLife of the Grand Champion.\nAfter becoming the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Champion\"&gt;Grand Champion&lt;/a&gt;, they are given the option of fighting a selection of monsters gathered from around &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; once a week. The selection of monsters and the gold prize depends on the Hero's level. They can use whatever armor and weapons they wish, and the corpses can be looted.\nThe total amount of gold earned is as follows: the lower level, the lower amount of gold. The fewer monsters fought, the lower the amount of gold. The less damage taken, the lower the amount of gold. For the most gold, fight three &lt;a href=\"Minotaur%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Minotaur Lords&lt;/a&gt; and take as much damage as possible.\nTips for arena battles.\nEasy arena fights.\nWhen the fight starts, run to the right side where there is a gray pillar near the closed fence and hop up on top of it. It might take a couple tries, but once on top of it, they can stand there without worrying about being hit. Sit there and simply use ranged attacks, such as spells.\nWhile on top of the pillar explained above, just go into sneaking mode and they will end up turning around and lose sight of them. This way, they can deal extra damage with stealthy attacks for easier killing.\nFor melee-focused characters, melee fighting is fairly straightforward, and health potions/Restoration spells can be very useful.\nWhen using either a one-handed weapon and a shield, or a two-handed, it is recommended to wait for an incoming enemy attack, block it, strike twice while the enemy is staggered, block again and so on. They can also do the same thing but when attacking, run around while hitting their opponent when they are staggered.\nThieves and stealthy Heroes.\nFor thieves and the stealthy types, assuming they have points in &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, a good tactic is to hit-and-run. This involves attacking with a few attacks and then stepping back to avoid the incoming enemy attack. If one is an archer, shooting a couple of arrows and then running when the opponent gets closer is also effective.\nIf low on arrows, wait for a fight with a single archer enemy. Begin the fight and walk backwards down the hallway they entered from. The enemy will follow down and attempt to shoot them repeatedly with his/her bow. The enemy will never run out of leveled arrows and when they see one coming, sidestep slightly, letting it stick into the wooden door behind. Then, whenever one wants, turn back and collect all the arrows.\nAcrobatics.\nIf they have high points in &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt;, it is also possible to jump up on the walls and behind the fences (it may take an extra nudge by their opponent to get them up there) around the arena, where most enemies will be unable to reach them. Simply shoot them down with a bow, or use magic to take enemies down.\nEnemy archers and spellcasters may be a bit more difficult to fight this way, since they are ranged and can shoot them. It is best to simply rush them. When the Hero becomes the Grand Champion, the fences in the arena are open, so they can no longer hide behind them. Use the fences as a good place to heal, it will help conserve healing potions and increase their restoration skill. They can also aim through the crack between the wall and the fence, though it is quite difficult to accomplish this. It will only work it one masters hitting the opponent through the crack or have a high Acrobatics skill.\nMages and thieves.\nFor mages and thief/mages, a good combination is to use &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt; a monster and then use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chameleon&lt;/a&gt; if their stealth is reasonably good) to skulk around in stealth mode. Summoning in conjunction with &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; can even be used to train their stealth and backstab skills.\nCombatants rarely pay any attention to conjured monsters so in general one can just sit back and re-summon, re-invisible as needed. Best of all, stealth, conjuration, and illusion are skills that are quickly trainable, the former by sneaking behind friendlies (do it with a summon, for instance) and the latter with simple spells. It is possible to beat the three-on-one fights without taking a hit using this method.\nSpells and staves.\nSome spells, such as Black Winter (&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Damage&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Paralyze&lt;/a&gt;), can be very useful against single opponents. Just paralyze them and then rush. For multiple enemies, use &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Ball%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fire Ball&lt;/a&gt;, or other splash-damage spells.\nSome of the staves found around Cyrodiil provide potent effects. However, be sure to check that the opponent is not resistant to the staff's effects.\nFighting in the Arena at low levels.\nStrangely, it is entirely possible to become Grand Champion as low as level 1, although the fight against three simultaneous opponents can be very difficult. The Grand Champion, and nearly all other single opponents, can be defeated with a simple block and swing strategy.\nAnother easy way to defeat opponents is simply staying put and &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; attacking with a bow. If one is a stealthy character, this will make arena fights very easy, as one never have to do any actual fighting. However, this requires a very high sneak skill.\nAfter becoming Grand Champion at a low level, the enemy monsters will be scaled to their level, including their reward for defeating them.\nA way to defeat Minotaur Lords (as Grand Champion): since the Minotaur Lords are so tall (especially due to the length of their horns), one can simply retreat back down the stairs of the team entrance after the gate opens and wait for the Minotaur Lords to attack. Due to their size, they will not be able to get down the stairs and the Hero will be able to use any ranged attack to defeat them. This allows them to fight three Minotaur Lords at once.\nBetting at the Arena.\nBesides fighting in the Arena, there is also the option of betting on daily fights between the two teams; the Yellow Team and the Blue Team. Regardless of whether or not one has fought any fights in the Arena, one is able to bet on either team. To bet, one must speak to the gatekeeper &lt;a href=\"Hundolin\"&gt;Hundolin&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Wood Elf&lt;/a&gt;, at the entrance to the Arena.\nSpeak with him between 9am and 9pm in order to place a bet of 25, 50 or 100 . After that, enter either of the doors to his left and watch the fight. The Hero's &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Luck&lt;/a&gt; plays a small part in the outcome of the bet. At least one of the effects luck has is to modify the health of the chosen combatant upward.\nIf one's bet wins, the reward is double the amount of what was bet on.\nOne can neither fight in an Arena match while one has an outstanding bet, nor can one bet on one's own match.\nIf the Hero is over 400 in Acrobatics, they can jump over the invisible wall and kill the enemy combatant themselves.\nIf the Hero steals the contents of Hundolin's takings chest, he will attack every time he sees the Hero. This means that one can no longer bet on the fight, as he will not talk to the Hero. However, if one steals the contents while nobody is watching, the Hero can still bet on the fights. The chest has 500 in it when no bets are placed in it, but the contents never respawn, even if one bets more and loses.\nOne can easily make a good amount of gold without doing any work at all by just saving before betting on a match. Then, if one loses, reload the saved game and repeat the process.\nIt is also possible to cheat using the console. Simply hit \"~\" to open the console, and select the NPC of the opposing team. Type codice_1 into the console and hit enter. This will count as a \"win\" and the Hero will receive gold for the bet.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hero can join the Arena and eventually become the new Grand Champion. Ask Hundolin or speak to Owyn directly at the Arena Bloodworks. When talking to him, he will be a bit angry, as he has other things to do. When asked about joining, he will be delighted, but still a bit condescending towards them."}

Ask &lt;a href=\"Hundolin\"&gt;Hundolin&lt;/a&gt; or speak to &lt;a href=\"Owyn\"&gt;Owyn&lt;/a&gt; directly at the &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Bloodworks\"&gt;Arena Bloodworks&lt;/a&gt;.\nWalkthrough.\nGo to the Arena and speak to Hundolin and he will direct the Hero to Owyn. He will be a bit angry as he has other things to do. When asked about joining he will be delighted but still a bit condescending towards them.\nHe will ask what kind of armor they would like, choose between &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Heavy%20Raiment%20%28Blue%20Team%29\"&gt;Arena Heavy Raiment&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Light%20Raiment%20%28Blue%20Team%29\"&gt;Arena Light Raiment&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero will also belong to the Blue team. They may also choose any &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shields%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"helmet\"&gt;helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Amulets%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;amulets&lt;/a&gt; to wear in addition to the provided armor.\nHe will also tell them to let him know when they are ready for a match. Tell Owyn when ready to compete, then he will let them know whom they will fight. Afterwards proceed through the Red Room to the Arena.\nThere are a total of eight ranks. To proceed through these ranks one will need to win three battles per rank, a total of 25 including the Grand Champion. The ranks are as follows:\nWhen returning from battle, be sure to replenish &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fatigue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Basin%20of%20Renewal\"&gt;Basin of Renewal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Grand Champion.\nWhen the last standard match has been fought, one may challenge the reigning Grand Champion, &lt;a href=\"Agronak%20gro-Malog\"&gt;The Gray Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Owyn sends the Hero to speak with Agronak to challenge him. He will accept the challenge and tell them to speak with &lt;a href=\"Ysabel%20Andronicus\"&gt;Ysabel&lt;/a&gt; as she is his trainer and manager.\nYsabel will tell the Hero the rules are different from normal fights. Looting the bodies is strictly forbidden during the previous matches but now they can take whatever the Grand Champion has. When they defeat the Grand Champion, she wants them to take his &lt;a href=\"Agronak%27s%20Raiment\"&gt;raiment&lt;/a&gt; and come back and give it to her. The Hero may wear any armor during this match. If the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Origin%20of%20the%20Gray%20Prince\"&gt;Origin of the Gray Prince&lt;/a&gt;\" is completed beforehand, Agronak will beg the Hero to kill him and will not fight back, making the battle significantly easier.\nWhen Agronak is killed, take his armor and go back to Ysabel. She will then reward them with their own version with identical enchantments, again giving them the choice of a heavy or light version. She will let them choose an &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29%23Championship\"&gt;Arena title&lt;/a&gt; from a list and people will then call them by this name after they become Grand Champion. She is very excited despite the circumstances as she liked Agronak. She tells the Hero to rest and then come back so they can discuss the future.\nAfter a rest or speak to her directly, she will inform them they can come back for weekly matches against various &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;. Just let her know when ready and she'll have acquired new creatures every week."}

While the author considered it a work of fiction, I've combed over the information in the story, and much to my delight, found much of it may be true!\nFor instance, there was indeed an Orc who fought in Dwarven mail after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, who rose to the rank of Bloodletter before mysteriously disappearing! The name is true for the blacksmith, who abandoned her shop in under equally unknown circumstances!\nWhile I have nothing on the Redguard, the name itself may be an alias. But the last sentence is most intriguing, as it implies our orc Bloodletter went north to Skyrim, and began fighting in the underground pits! In fact, I've heard there is an Orc living in &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Bthalft\"&gt;Bthalft Ruins&lt;/a&gt; who matches that description right now!\nI've requested the Orc meet with me in private, so I can ask him if he is indeed the one in the story. I am so excited! I know the book paints him as a bit unruly toward fans, but authors tend to exaggerate certain features. Besides, even if it were true, I'd be willing to bet time has softened his stance. He'll be more than pleased to meet a true fan of the Arena! I can't wait!"}

When he finally met the Prince, he spoke humbly and offered to drive a thousand men mad in exchange for greater magical power. Sheogorath was in an agreeable mood. He proposed a counteroffer, or as he called it, a \"game,\" during which Ravate must maintain his sanity for three days while Sheogorath does his best to drive the wizard insane. If Ravate survived, Sheogorath would grant him his wish.\nThough Sheogorath found the idea of the game fun, Ravate felt less so. When he attempted to flee, Sheogorath denied him and trapped the wizard within his realm, the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Shivering Isles&lt;/a&gt;, blocking off all exits. Ravate had no choice but to wander the realm, spending each moment looking over his shoulder and jumping at every noise. Each moment brought new terror as he waited for Sheogorath to begin.\nAfter three days, Sheogorath appeared to Ravate. By then, he was convinced every creature was out to get him at the whims of Sheogorath. Sheogorath, however, revealed he had, in fact, done nothing, and that Ravate had driven himself mad with his delusions. Therefore, Sheogorath had won. From that day forward, Ravate served Sheogorath and warned daring travelers who tried to approach Sheogorath of their inevitable defeat."}

{"id": "835611", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=835611", "title": "Raven Rock", "text": "Raven Rock is a settlement in the &lt;a href=\"Hirstaang%20Forest\"&gt;Hirstaang Forest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; founded and built by the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. It quickly became a mining colony.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nEast Empire Mining Colony.\nRaven Rock's initial appearance is different than it looks in the fourth era. Raven Rock's eastern wing is walled off to the rest of Solstheim. Raven Rock has one long stretch of road from the gate to the local trader. All of the houses are centered on this long road including the mine and inn. Raven Rock has one port since most of the ships coming to Solstheim go to Fort Frostmoth to the east. Raven Rock's architecture resembles the Colovian Imperial design seen in &lt;a href=\"Seyda%20Neen\"&gt;Seyda Neen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dagon%20Fel\"&gt;Dagon Fel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedoran Stronghold.\nOver the years, Raven Rock was given to House Redoran of Morrowind. This drastically changed Raven Rock's design. Raven Rock got rid of the traditional Imperial housing and went with the Redoran design of a large shellback. The only thing resembling the Imperial architecture are a couple of abandoned houses and &lt;a href=\"Morvayn%20Manor\"&gt;Morvayn Manor&lt;/a&gt;. Raven Rock's street became more curved and the docks were closer to the city. Now there is a town square that is surrounded by the mine, inn, farm, and the smithy. Because of the ash, the Bulwark, a fortified barrier wall, is buried in ash. From the wall to the Earth Stone, the streets and its houses become less damaged.\nHistory.\nThird Era.\nAfter a massive &lt;a href=\"Ebony\"&gt;Ebony&lt;/a&gt; vein was found along the southwestern coast of the &lt;a href=\"Hirstaang%20Forest\"&gt;Hirstaang Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the mining colony known as Raven Rock was founded in &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;. As construction on the town commenced, the Raven Rock mine began to be dug out and ebony shipments went straight for &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Raven Rock was originally a patch of open snow up until the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; stepped in and began production on the settlement. Three workers named &lt;a href=\"Falco%20Galenus\"&gt;Falco Galenus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gamin%20Girith\"&gt;Gamin Girith&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sabinus%20Oranius\"&gt;Sabinus Oranius&lt;/a&gt; were escorted by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to start work on Raven Rock. Imperial Nobleman &lt;a href=\"Carnius%20Magius\"&gt;Carnius Magius&lt;/a&gt; need to convince investors to fund the Raven Rock project by giving them Ebony Ore. With the ore, Raven Rock began construction and the town started to gain popularity.\nEventually in &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;, the town was populated by at least 30 people all of whom relied on the Ebony Mines. Overtime, Raven Rock was largely inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of its obscure location, Raven Rock wasn't affected by &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion on Tamriel known as the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Back in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s opened up across the Imperial Province and the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; need more manpower to protect the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; and the land, many soldiers stationed in Raven Rock moved back to Cyrodiil while some stayed to protect Raven Rock from local Bandits. regardless, Raven Rock stood firm for the final year of the third era. On mainland &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; however, things were only getting worse.\nAfter the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, members of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; had to relocate to a new home to reestablish themselves. &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Mistress Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; made a negotiation with the East Empire Company to have &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; refugees come and stay in Raven Rock. Brara's group of Dark Elves became a part of Raven Rock's way of life. The Dark Elves proved to the Imperials that they are a hard-working and reliable people when it comes to mining since they have tons of experience in Kwama Mines. This solidified the relationship between Brara and the Trading Company\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%205\"&gt;4E 5&lt;/a&gt;, after the Oblivion Crisis ended, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupts and destroys a large majority of Vvardenfell and the surrounding territories. Red Mountain manages to affect settlements as far as &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt;. Like all of Vvardenfell, Solstheim was covered in a thick shroud of ash and soot. The explosion from Red Mountain toppled the stone structures and annihilated wooden structures. Luckily, the mine was preserved from the blast. However, Raven Rock depended on nearby Fort Frostmoth for protection against bandits and the fort was buried underneath piles and piles of ash. Surviving Imperial Soldiers made a makeshift garrison that paled in comparison with Frostmoth. Brara was able to have Elite House Redoran Guards replace the Imperial Guards, they've protected Raven Rock ever since.\nLife has not been getting better after Red Mountain's blast, relentless ash storms have plagued the Hirstaag Forest and &lt;a href=\"Isinfier%20Plains\"&gt;Isinfier Plains&lt;/a&gt; and turned the southern Solstheim coast into a wasteland like the ashlands of Vvardenfell. Storms had left large dunes of ash that made living in Raven Rock hell to the people. In order to protect the town, Brara asked the Trading Company to build a large wall to protect the eastern side of the city. In almost a year, the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt; was built and it helped tremendously.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2016\"&gt;4E 16&lt;/a&gt;, Skyrim gave Solstheim back to the Dark Elves of Morrowind and because of this, the East Empire Trading Company was forced to give Raven Rock to &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;. Many Dunmer refugees that lived in Skyrim left to stay in Raven Rock. Now that Raven Rock was under Redoran control, Brara Morvayn was rightfully named Councilor of Raven Rock. Many of the Imperial citizens left Raven Rock to return to Cyrodiil. Brara continued to welcome incoming Dunmer. Dunmer coming into Raven Rock either stayed in the town to work on the mines or traveled the wastes as a nomad.\nThe next few decades was considered the Golden Age of Raven Rock's History. The mines were producing large amounts of mine and shipped them across the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; and the Dunmer folk lived happily and peacefully. Brara Morvayn passed away in &lt;a href=\"4E%2065\"&gt;4E 65&lt;/a&gt; due to old age, she was buried in the &lt;a href=\"Morvayn%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;Morvayn Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. Her son, &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; took her place and has proven to be just as capable of a leader.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2095\"&gt;4E 95&lt;/a&gt;, several assassins tried to murder Lleril but with the help of the Redoran Guard, the assassination attempt was a failure. It was eventually revealed by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Modyn%20Veleth\"&gt;Captain Modyn Veleth&lt;/a&gt; that the assassin was &lt;a href=\"Vilur%20Ulen\"&gt;Vilur Ulen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;. Ever since the removal of House Hlaalu being on the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Council\"&gt;Grand Council&lt;/a&gt;, Hlaalu and Redoran had a falling out between each other. Hlaalu believed Redoran was involved in Hlaalu's status as a Great House and held a grudge every since. Their efforts weren't over because the Redoran Guard eventually found that Vilur had been organizing a coup d'\u00e9tat against Lleril's grasp on Raven Rock. Vilur and his associates were executed.\nEven after the efforts by Vilur Ulen to ruin Raven Rock, the Dunmer began to respect Lleril Morvayn more and more, especially when in &lt;a href=\"4E%20130\"&gt;4E 130&lt;/a&gt;, the Bulwark began to fall apart until Lleril payed from his own pocket to rebuilt the Bulwark. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20150\"&gt;4E 150&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; invasion on Morrowind, a group of Argonians traveled to the isle of Solstheim to destroy the Dunmeri civilization there. Councilor Morvayn led the forces protecting Raven Rock from the Argonians. The main source of income in Raven Rock, the Ebony mine, had finally run dry in &lt;a href=\"4E%20170\"&gt;4E 170&lt;/a&gt;. Morvayn used what was left of his money to feed the people.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Councilor Morvayn still rules Raven Rock and has to constantly deal with threats coming from the Southern Wastes. After having a confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"Cultist\"&gt;Cultist of Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; ventured to Raven Rock to seek further info on the Dragon Priest &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;. The people of Raven Rock along with the rest of Solstheim had been acting very strangely, west of town is a monument known as the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt;. Raven Rock citizens were amassing a shrine dedicated to Miraak. From there, the Dragonborn met Master &lt;a href=\"Neloth\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; of House Telvanni and &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt; who told the traveler all about Miraak and pointed them to his &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; nearby the &lt;a href=\"Tree%20Stone\"&gt;Tree Stone&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter learning the &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;Bend Will&lt;/a&gt; shout from the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn traveled to the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker%20Stones\"&gt;All-Maker Stones&lt;/a&gt; excluding the Tree Stone and freed the citizens of Raven Rock from the Earth Stones curse.\nAfter the eruption of Red Mountain, a new types of creatures known as the &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt; have been endangering the people of Raven Rock for sometime. Captain Veleth and a squad of Redoran Guard had to deal with the Ash threat at the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Attius%20Farm\"&gt;Old Attius Farm&lt;/a&gt; east of town. The Dragonborn arrived at the scene and finished off the remaining Ash Spawn. Veleth thanks the Dragonborn and tasks them to infiltrate the abandoned Fort Frostmoth to kill the resurrected &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of the Imperial Legion. With Falx Carius dead, Raven Rock is safe once again.\nThe Raven Rock Mine is basically abandoned save for one old man who believed there was something more to the mines closing than a dry vein. &lt;a href=\"Crescius%20Caerellius\"&gt;Crescius Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; is the great-grandson of &lt;a href=\"Gratian%20Caerellius\"&gt;Gratian Caerellius&lt;/a&gt;, a miner and explorer who was alive during Raven Rock's inception. Gratian died in the Raven Rock mines after finding an ancient nordic blade of the Bloodskal Clan. Crescius tasked the Dragonborn into venturing deep into the mine and finding what exactly Gratian found in the depths of the mine. The traveler found the corpse of Gratian and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Blade\"&gt;Bloodskal Blade&lt;/a&gt;. With the blade, the Dragonborn entered &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow\"&gt;Bloodskal Barrow&lt;/a&gt; to find &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos%20%28Mask%29\"&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt;. With this new discovery, the Raven Rock Mine was open again and Ebony began to flow out of the mine as usually. This gave Raven Rock the economic comeback it needed.\nAfter defeating General Falx Carius at Fort Frostmoth and restoring the Raven Rock Mine, the Dragonborn was approached by Captain Veleth who directs them to Second Councilor &lt;a href=\"Adril%20Arano\"&gt;Adril Arano&lt;/a&gt;. Adril Arano worries that another assassination attempt is being made on Councilor Morvayn. Arano will ask the traveler to stake out the &lt;a href=\"Ulen%20Ancestral%20Tomb\"&gt;Ulen Ancestral Tomb&lt;/a&gt; where Vilur Ulen is buried. Will waiting at the tomb, &lt;a href=\"Tilisu%20Severin\"&gt;Tilisu Severin&lt;/a&gt; visits the tomb to pay respects to Vilur. The Dragonborn questions Tilisu and reports back to Arano who gives him the Key to &lt;a href=\"Severin%20Manor\"&gt;Severin Manor&lt;/a&gt;. At the manor, the Dragonborn learns that &lt;a href=\"Vendil%20Severin\"&gt;Vendil Severin&lt;/a&gt; is planning to assassinate Lleril Morvayn in honor of House Hlaalu using the Morag Tong stationed at &lt;a href=\"Ashfallow%20Citadel\"&gt;Ashfallow Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonborn then leaves for the ruined citadel and kills Vendil Severin. Raven Rock is safe again and is bound to prosper for the next few years.\nRaven Rock Mine.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20Mine\"&gt;Raven Rock Mine&lt;/a&gt; is the town's main cause for its economic prosperity, as the tunnels hold large quantities of Ebony ore, of which is highly valuable, with regular shipments out to Cyrodiil.\nIn 4E 181, however, the mines' ebony supply dried up and was thus closed by the East Empire Company. In reality, however, a group of diggers broke into &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow\"&gt;an old Nordic tomb&lt;/a&gt;, after which the Company sent &lt;a href=\"Gratian%20Caerellius%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Gratian Caerellius&lt;/a&gt; and his man's man &lt;a href=\"Millius\"&gt;Millius&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. Gratian and Millius, unfortunately, were killed by the Draugr inhabiting the ruins, leading to the East Empire Company covering it up by spreading false information that the mines were dried up.\nIn 4E 201, twenty years later, the Last Dragonborn &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Descent\"&gt;investigated Gratian's death&lt;/a&gt;, on behalf of his great-great-grandson, venturing into the mines, where it was discovered later that the ebony supply had never truly disappeared. Lleril Morvayn and Crescius Caerellius soon had the mines reopened, restoring some measure of Raven Rock's lost affluence, with ebony shipments going out regularly to House Redoran in Morrowind."}

The settlement was built on top of a very large ebony deposit. The mine itself is owned and operated by the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; and is used to procure substantial amounts of the raw ore which is then refined and transported to the capital province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe local &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; show much animosity towards the company for their increased presence and negligence of the nature on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and have become notorious for their outright disregard for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;legion&lt;/a&gt; and their absolutism. The positioning of the mine on an archaic &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; has only caused more prejudice with the natives.

He's suggested to go speak to &lt;a href=\"Graring\"&gt;Graring&lt;/a&gt;, one of the local Nords about it. He and his companions can be found at the junction of the &lt;a href=\"Harstrad%20River\"&gt;Harstrad River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isild%20River\"&gt;Isild River&lt;/a&gt; to the northeast of here.\n&lt;a href=\"Drastic%20Measures\"&gt;Drastic Measures&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarnius Magius requests the Incarnate deliver equipment to a group of Nords arriving on Solstheim.

It was owned by the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; before the ebony eventually dried up and they abandoned Raven Rock.\nIn reality, the miners once broke into an old tomb, also known as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Bloodskal Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to wake up the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the crypt and most of them, if not all, were killed.

He may be found inside Raven Rock Mine.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon entering the mine, the path starts down to the north, then turns left, where Crescius and &lt;a href=\"Aphia%20Velothi\"&gt;Aphia Velothi&lt;/a&gt; are arguing. Wooden steps lead up to a platform with a bed, table, and little else. Another set of wooden steps, then wooden ramps lead down. At the first dirt platform is a junction with paths leading east and south. The southern path quickly leads to a dead end.\nThe eastern path quickly leads to a fork. Continuing east leads to another dead end with a &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;. The north branch leads down a short ramp, past a large pit on the left, turns west, and proceeds down two longer ramps, where two more spiders lie in wait. At the bottom of the second ramp, the mine turns left (south), then gradually turns left (east), where another spider is waiting. Another wooden ramp leads down to a dirt platform where an opening to the east can be seen, but is apparently blocked by several pieces of wood. The wood pieces can be attacked, which knocks them down. Through the opening, an expert-locked &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company%20Strongbox\"&gt;East Empire Company strongbox&lt;/a&gt; is on a wooden crate, while to the left (north) is a locked gate that can be opened with the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20Mine%20Key\"&gt;Raven Rock Mine Key&lt;/a&gt; (which Crescius gives along with the quest \"The Final Descent\").\nThrough the gate and down a ramp, the mine slopes down to a crypt with a water-covered floor and several leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;. A chest is available high against the west wall. On the east end of the room is a swinging spiked gate trap that can be difficult for a follower to pass without being explicitly directed. The mine leads up to the east, turns left (north), then left again (west), where another draugr is waiting, along with another crypt area. After a jog right and then left around a short wall, the way continues west up some steps, and the rough mine becomes a finished stone cavern.\nThrough an open door is a large circular room with a large grate on the floor and several dead draugr (on the grate and sitting in thrones around the walls of the room). Upon entering the room, several leveled draugr will attack. Through the door on the other (west) side of the room is another room with a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt; on a pedestal against the southwest wall. To the right (north) then left (west) is a table with two dead draugr and several potions. Just to the right is a &lt;a href=\"stalhrim\"&gt;stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; deposit, which, when mined, reveals another dead draugr. To the right of the deposit is another table, this one with a soul gem and several &lt;a href=\"Ingredients%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ingredients&lt;/a&gt;. The cave turns to the east, where an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; can be found, along with several more ingredients, including two &lt;a href=\"Netch%20Jelly\"&gt;netch jellies&lt;/a&gt; on the back of the lab table.\nThe cave turns left (north), where two soul gem powered &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Trap\"&gt;shock traps&lt;/a&gt; are found. Beyond them, the cave drops down to an area with a water-covered floor and turns right (east) to an iron door. Beyond the door is a tall room with several draugr patrolling a bridge above the floor, plus another patrolling the floor area itself. At the east end of the room, behind a waterfall, is an apprentice-locked door to &lt;a href=\"Bloodskal%20Barrow%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Bloodskal Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. There is another source of &lt;a href=\"stalhrim\"&gt;stalhrim&lt;/a&gt; behind this door. \nTurning right, a short set of stairs leads to a ledge on the south side of the room overlooking the floor. Backtracking to the west along the ledge leads to a wooden log ram that leads up to a higher ledge. Proceeding back to the east along the higher ledge, there is a gate to the south that cannot be opened, then eventually, at the eastern end, is the bridge to the left (north). The other side of the bridge leads to another ledge to the left (west) with an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Enchanter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; at the western end with an expert-locked chest underneath. Opposite the enchanter is a pedestal that, when activated, opens the gate on the other side of the room that was passed earlier.\nThrough the gate, the cave leads to a T intersection. To the left (east), a &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; spell is on a pedestal in what is otherwise a dead end. To the right (west) is a spiral ramp leading up, with an adept-locked chest underneath and behind it. Up the ramp is a room away to the east with a shock trap; behind the shock trap is a false wall, opened by a chain behind the left torch, inside is an adept-locked chest and some loot. At the other end, the path turns left (north), then jogs left and right, eventually leading to a caged walkway to the north above the room with the waterfall. On the other side is a room with a poison dart trap. At the north end of the room is a wooden door leading to a closet with an adept-locked chest inside. Along the west wall, an opening leads to a rough area of the cave.\nThe path winds north and west, then opens high on the south wall of a very large room with two waterfalls. The only way to proceed is to fall down to the raised area directly in front, then again to the ledge above the river. At the bottom end of the river is a chest. Back at the north northwest end of the room are the bones of &lt;a href=\"Gratian%20Caerellius%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Gratian Caerellius&lt;/a&gt;, which are part of the quest \"Final Descent.\"\nDirectly ahead is a door flanked by two columns, all of which are glowing red. Read \"Passing Through the Bloodskal Door\" in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Descent\"&gt;The Final Descent&lt;/a&gt;\" quest article for information on how to open the door and what is beyond.\nAfter unlocking the door, there are multiple swinging blade traps that can cause difficulty for a follower to get through. Be warned that even with disease immunity from &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lycanthropy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampirism&lt;/a&gt;, these traps may still transmit diseases such as Rock Joint and Rattles. Beyond them is a gate opened by a lever to the left. In the room beyond is a chest, but simply walking up to it causes the Dragon Priest &lt;a href=\"Zahkriisos\"&gt;Zahkriisos&lt;/a&gt; to appear. After he is defeated, at the east end of the room is a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;. Back at the west end, the path to the right (north side) leads to a lever that closes or opens the gate. Beyond that is a on a pedestal, an arcane enchanter against the right (north) wall, a chest against the opposite wall, plus a spiral staircase leading up to a door to Bloodskal Barrow.\nBloodskal Barrow.\nBack in the room with multiple levels of ledges, if the door to Bloodskal Barrow is entered, the area is a dead end. Directly up the steps is a stalhrim deposit that, when mined, has another draugr behind it. Other than two urns flanking the deposit, there is nothing else available in this area.\nAt the other entrance (at the end of Raven Rock Mine, near the dragon priest), the cave climbs up to the west northwest, then comes to a rock wall with a pull chain to the left. Activating it opens the wall. Beyond is a cooking area with an alchemy lab, defended by several reavers. Further on, a campfire is on the right with five dead draugr around it. Continuing on, there are more reavers. In the northwest corner of a square area are the bodies of a &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Elf&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;. Up the steps at the end is a door to Solstheim."}

The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with getting rid of any Spriggans near the grove of trees at the Eastern end of the colony. &lt;a href=\"Unel%20Lloran\"&gt;Unel Lloran&lt;/a&gt; is involved in this quest.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"Race%20Against%20the%20Clock\"&gt;Race Against the Clock&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Stop%20the%20Messenger\"&gt;Stop the Messenger&lt;/a&gt;\", Falco/Carnius will tell the Nerevarine that the colony is being plaged by spriggans. They will task the Nerevarine with killing these spriggans, and reporting to Unel Lloran afterward.\nThe spriggans are located in the eastern part of Raven Rock, the part that is still under construction. There should be 4 of them in total. They can be quite challenging when they gang up on you, so try to pick them off one at a time. As always with spriggans, you have to kill them thrice before they stay dead.\nOnce the spriggans are dealt with, speak with Unel Lloran in the bar. He will be happy the spriggans are gone, but he will inform you that construction still cannot continue because the trees are indestructible. He suspects magic is in play, and speculates that they might be taken down if something were to happen to the roots. the roots run deep, so the miners might know something about it.\nHead into Raven Rock mine and speak with one of the miners. They will tell you that one of the mine shafts has been blocked off by some weird, indestructible roots. Head down there to the abandoned mine shaft and observe the roots for yourself. Return to Unel and he will ask you to guide him to the roots. Once he is there, he will speculate that poisoning the water the roots drink from will weaken the trees, allowing them to be chopped down. he requests the nerevarine bring him 5 bittergreen petals for this purpose.\nBittergreen petals cannot be found anywhere on Solstheim, so you will have to go to Vvardenfell to get some. The best way to do this is by using &lt;a href=\"Almsivi%20Intervention\"&gt;Almsivi Intervention&lt;/a&gt; to get to &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;, and then buying it from &lt;a href=\"Zanmulk%20Sammalamus\"&gt;Zanmulk Sammalamus&lt;/a&gt; in the temple. Once you have the bittergreen petals, bring them to Unel in the mine.\nReturn to your questgiver to receive your reward."}

Too small to even see the traveling merchant\u2019s wares atop his table, my father lifted me up so I could admire the strange angles, geometric engravings, and the unusual luster of a mace and shield on display. I was captivated. Though it\u2019s likely those first pieces I laid eyes on were reproductions, they were enough to stoke my curiosity for a lifetime.\nI apprenticed under my father, a well-regarded smith, and tried again and again as my skills improved to replicate the Dwemer designs that so fascinated me. One of the major difficulties, of course, was not having much in the way of example or instruction\u2014all I had to go on for ages were my memories. My father forbade me from searching for ruins on my own, though he did humor my passion by bringing me any book he could afford on the topic of the vanished race and their creations.\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was old enough to strike out alone that I made any substantial progress. I soon discovered how right it was of my father to keep me away from Dwemer ruins in my youth. They are treacherous places even for experienced adventurers, which I was certainly not the first time I charged headfirst into one. I was a bit too confident, I\u2019ll admit, and I never expected the spider construct that burst out of an opening in the wall as I walked by. I had no idea the ruins were still active!\nI was inexperienced and untried in combat, and without my skill as a smith, I doubt I would be here to tell my story today. My armor protected me from several blows I could not deflect in time with my shield as two more spiders clanked out from the darkness, and my well-balanced mace seemed to swing itself right into them, sending tiny gears and showers of sparks flying. It was over before I knew it, and I realized that I stood among piles of still-hissing metal treasure.\nCramming everything that would fit into my pack\u2014part of the carapace, a couple engraved legs, and an assortment of gears and springs\u2014I carefully made my way back to the surface. The Eight smiled on me that day, because it wasn\u2019t long before I was blinking in the sunlight, little worse for the wear than a few scratches and minor burns.\nBack at the forge with my prizes, I worked day and night on a new mace. I fashioned it after one in an ancient text my father had found, using my hard-won scrap to augment the smithing process. It became apparent quickly that this was what I\u2019d been missing the whole time! The product of that sleepless week has never been recognized as a reproduction by any scholar, smith, or relic-dealer.\nForging in the Dwemer style, as you can see, is not for the dabbler.

They are often considered barbaric savages by the other &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and are well known as the \"Witchmen of High Rock.\" While they are mostly close to &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; in stock, neither the Bretons nor the Reachmen themselves consider as such.\nBiology.\nDue to the converging location of the Reach on the borders of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, the Reachmen share ancestry with many of the other &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt; races of Tamriel. Their origins can be traced back to when Men and Mer first began breeding within the Western Reach. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Elves of High Rock&lt;/a&gt; massacred the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; population living in the occupied Western Reach, and because of this the Reachmen owe most of their ancestry to Bretons and Elves. The Reachmen were also believed to have interbred with &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nIt is stated that the Nords never knew of the Nedes or &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Manmeri&lt;/a&gt; until they first began entering the lands beyond their borders during the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, it is likely that the Reachmen first began immigrating into the Reach of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; sometime during or between the Conquests and the War of Succession, most likely when the western portions of Skyrim, including the Reach, had been conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, who had held control of the Reachmen's &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;indigenous lands&lt;/a&gt; during the time. Sometime around &lt;a href=\"1E%20500\"&gt;1E 500&lt;/a&gt;, the Reachmen would begin a bloody uprising against the Direnni Elves, claiming the Western Reach and possibly the Direnni-occupied &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;Reach of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, for their own kind. In this uprising, almost all the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i inhabitants of the Western Reach were exterminated. The Reachmen were said to have taken up residence in &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; disappeared around &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiege of Orsinium.\nDuring the thirty-year &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt; clan was allied with the forces of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and commanded by &lt;a href=\"General%20Mercedene\"&gt;General Mercedene&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Beast of the Reach,\" as mercenaries hired by King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt;. The Winterborn were previously commanded by &lt;a href=\"Evandene\"&gt;Evandene&lt;/a&gt;, who lost her title when she refused to kill civilians of a village. Her daughter Mercedene challenged her on the spot, killed her, cut our her heart, and ate it. Taking command of the Winterborn, she shot the villagers full of arrows and had her mother's corpse decorating an altar to &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime between &lt;a href=\"1E%20952\"&gt;1E 952&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1E%20973\"&gt;1E 973&lt;/a&gt;, Mercedene captured &lt;a href=\"Rokaug\"&gt;Rokaug&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of famed Orcish hero &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;. Under Joile's orders, she had to set up a duel between &lt;a href=\"Gaiden%20Shinji\"&gt;Gaiden Shinji&lt;/a&gt; and Baloth. To do this, she had Joile threaten Shinji that if he didn't accept, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt; would go in his place. She and Joile then manipulated Baloth by telling him his brother Rokaug died at her Winterborn forces, causing him to ally with King &lt;a href=\"Golkarr\"&gt;Golkarr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"First%20Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the duel, as Shinji and Baloth were fighting, Mercedene had &lt;a href=\"Joile%27s%20Archer\"&gt;Joile's Archer&lt;/a&gt;s assassinate them both, eliminating the most powerful soldiers of both Orsinium and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Lord Trystan discovered this plot shortly before-hand, but was too late to save the heroes. He ordered &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt; to kill Mercedene for her betrayal, and the Winterborn commander died at her hands. Trystan, Reliana, and Rokaug left Mercedene's body in Orsinium, where she would later rise as a &lt;a href=\"Wispmother\"&gt;Wispmother&lt;/a&gt; known as \"&lt;a href=\"Mercedene%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Mercedene the Cursed&lt;/a&gt;.\" Joile did not let Mercedene's sacrifice go in vain, and later executed his invasion of Hammerfell, but died during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bangkorai%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Bangkorai Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Red Eagle.\nThe Reachmen rule over the Reach would continue on until the 11th century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The Reach at this time was made up of ten, scattered, warring kingdoms, with the most notable of them being known as the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Hills\"&gt;Sundered Hills&lt;/a&gt;, where the Reachman hero, Faolan, better known as &lt;a href=\"Red%20Eagle\"&gt;Red Eagle&lt;/a&gt;, was born. The Red Eagle was prophesied to bring peace to the ten warring kingdoms and unite them all into one, collective, kingdom. However, in &lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;, the Reach was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian&lt;/a&gt; Empress, &lt;a href=\"Hestra\"&gt;Hestra&lt;/a&gt;. The Alessians conquered each kingdom, one by one, until only the Sundered Hills remained. The Empress sent envoys to negotiate a surrender with Faolan, but when he refused, the Elders of his kingdom exiled him and ceded the Sundered Hills to Hestra. In order to reclaim the Reach from the Empire, Faolan formed a resistance group made up of traditional Reachmen, using the Reach's myriad of cave systems to raid Imperial garrisons and the Reachmen that betrayed them. After being visited by a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;, the Red Eagle willingly gave up his humanity to become, possibly, the first &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Briarheart&lt;/a&gt; and a spirit of pure vengeance for his people. The Red Eagle's rebellion would spread throughout the Reach, raising in strength and numbers, and after two years, the Reach had been almost completely removed of the Empire's influence. Fearing defeat, Hestra sent a much larger army to secure the Reach under her control and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Red%20Eagle%27s%20Stronghold\"&gt;besieged the Red Eagle's stronghold&lt;/a&gt; for two weeks until Faolan's defense fell and the Reach was brought into the Empires control again.\nReman Empire.\nAfter the first &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202703\"&gt;1E 2703&lt;/a&gt;, the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; moved his focus to the Reach, splitting the region between Imperial controlled High Rock and Skyrim in order to stop Reachmen raids on mines in the region. Armies from &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; were consistently brought into the Reach to keep stability in the area. Reachmen were said to raid locations as far as &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; during this time. During the reign of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Kastav\"&gt;Kastav&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20Rebellion\"&gt;Winterhold Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%202804\"&gt;1E 2804&lt;/a&gt;, local Reachmen helped aid the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt; with supplies in the two year long siege of &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Era.\nThe Interregnum.\nMany years later, during the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, the Reach once again became an independent state. During this time, many border wars were fought between the Reachmen and the holds that surrounded &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. The Reachmen invaded &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; at some point, being led by a man by the name of &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt;, and created a rather short lived dynasty of Reachmen commonly known as the \"longhouse clan.\" In &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, Durcorach attempted to expand his empire by invading &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Durcorach conquered the lands of &lt;a href=\"Bankorai%20Pass\"&gt;Bankorgai&lt;/a&gt;, Evermore, &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camlorn\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;. The young king, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, was able to hold &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; through the invasion, and turned the tide of the war after defeating the Reachmen at &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;. The Reachmen Invasion of High Rock helped to unify the province and was highly responsible for the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. The longhouse clan would rule over the fractured Empire for almost thirty years before being deposed by &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, some Reachmen were known to have aided &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;'s plot to fuse &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;, as well as pester both the Daggerfall Covenant and &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;. In later years, some Reachmen allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, while other Reachmen groups would, instead, come into conflict with the Dominion.\nThe Reach was eventually reconquered by &lt;a href=\"Hjalti%20Early-Beard\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E 852&lt;/a&gt; during the closing years of the Interregnum, and the Reachmen were forced to live under the rule of the new &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;. During the period of early occupation, the Reach was put under the direct control of Provisional Governor Titus Alorius to see the region evolve into a new era of peace and prosperity.\nFourth Era.\nThe Forsworn Uprising.\nSince the Interregnum, &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; remained a hold of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; when a group of rebellious Reachmen known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, believing themselves the rightful rulers of the Reach, captured the capital city, &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;, with the intention of removing Nordic influence from the Reach and restoring the 'Old Ways' to their people. With the armies of the Empire out fighting the war, the Forsworn easily took the Reach for themselves, establishing their own, self-proclaimed, independent kingdom. Their king, &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over the Reach. While some scoff at the idea of the Reachmen's government being anything more than a chaotic rebellion, others claim that Madanach ruled relatively justly, with only a few crimes occasionally committed against former Nordic landowners. After the war with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, Madanach petitioned the Empire to be recognized as a legitimate kingdom.\nThe Markarth Incident.\nJarl &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt; of Markarth and his son &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt;, in their desperate attempt to reclaim the Reach from their usurpers, organized a militia led by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, with the promise of free &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship within the city. The militia reclaimed the Reach from the Reachmen during the event later known as the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, killing off a large number of those they considered associated with the rebellion or in any way responsible for the city's falling, and allegedly, murdered any citizen who did not do their part to fight the Forsworn. When the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; found out about Hrolfdir and Igmund's deal, the Empire was forced to arrest all the members of the militia for their violation of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, causing the event to become a key catalyst for the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. A large number of the Reachmen fled the city, running to the hills to continue their rebellion, becoming the contemporary Forsworn. Jarl Hrolfdir attempted to make peace with them only to be murdered in the process, with &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir%27s%20Shield\"&gt;his shield&lt;/a&gt; being gifted to Hagravens. Contempt for the Nords only grew, with the Forsworn now claiming they would kill off all the Nords that ruled the Reach.\nThe Forsworn Conspiracy.\nAfter the Markarth Incident, &lt;a href=\"Thonar%20Silver-Blood\"&gt;Thonar Silver-Blood&lt;/a&gt; saw the potential usefulness of the Forsworn to advance his family\u2019s control over the Hold, and used his influence to secretly spare Madanach from execution, making him, and the remaining Forsworn rebels, his personal puppets. This implies that Jarl Hrolfdir's assassination was possibly under Thonar's command. During this time, many mines and their owners were targeted by the Forsworn for the purpose of allowing the Silverblood family to take their lands under their own protection. Using his wealth to put the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Guard\"&gt;Markarth Guard&lt;/a&gt;s in his pocket, Thonar was able to effectively prevent the investigation of these attacks, as well as to hold the Reachmen within a low social-hierarchy to create a convenient, and cheap, labor force. Thonar would continue to use the Forsworn to benefit his own agenda of gaining widespread control over the Reach and its inhabitants, until &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; when Madanach began to rebel against Thonar's orders and continued the ideals of the original Forsworn Uprising.\nThe Old Ways.\nWhile most Reachmen had given up their more extreme traditional values by the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, some groups, most notably the Forsworn, continued to follow the traditions of their ancestors, being known as the 'Old Ways.' These 'Old Ways' are considered by many to be archaic and cruel, being said to only lead to ruin for the Reachmen.\nReligion.\nThe traditional Reachmen are often described as being barbaric Daedra worshiping savages, that revere and placate &lt;a href=\"Hagraven\"&gt;Hagraven&lt;/a&gt;s. The exact gods that the Reachmen worship are not clearly defined, but they seem to worship their own distinct pantheon they refer to as the Old Gods. The Reachmen's glorification of Hagravens hints that they may worship &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, but various shrines to the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; found in Forsworn camps seem to contradict this.\u00a0It is highly likely that some Reachmen worship both &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, or at least began worshiping Aedra in later years. Another possibility is that some of the previously civilized Forsworn tribesmen have not fully given up the gods of Imperial tradition.\nTraditionally, worship varied from tribe to tribe, as certain groups were known to center their worship on specific gods. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Crow-Wife%20Clan\"&gt;Crow-Wife Clan&lt;/a&gt; situated near &lt;a href=\"Evermore\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; primarily worshiped the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt;. The most commonly seen recipient of Reachmen worship is &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, with some clans seemingly developing entire pantheons around him based on his five stated aspects, Alrabeg, Storihbeg, Uricanbeg, Gulibeg, and Hrokkibeg, each represented by specified animal spirit. The Reachmen's worship of these more feral aspects of Hircine have put them at odds with some of the Witch clans of High Rock, who view him in a much less vicious light. Additional Daedra some Reachmen are said to worship are &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;, while none are known to worship &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;. Some have even speculated that the Reachmen may even have their own unknown pantheon of deities, unidentifiable to other religions, worshiped through ancient totems and talismans.\nThe observed Reachmen religion centers around the practice violent rites. Such rituals include flagellation, scarring, live burnings, blood bathing, dismemberment and possibly cannibalism, with some clans even being known to sacrifice children by cutting out their still-beating heart. &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt; and other such creatures are highly praised by Reachmen, being perceived as a blessing from Hircine rather than a curse. Reachmen shamans often practice rituals with Hagravens in order to master certain nature magics, with some, known as Gravesingers, dabbling in &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nReachmen association with the Aedra has been noted with &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; clans, although their names for these gods, if any, are unknown. In &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Tower%20Redoubt\"&gt;Broken Tower Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Shrine of Dibella&lt;/a&gt; can be found and at which a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt; not only performs what appears to be blood sacrifices at the statue, but also kidnaps &lt;a href=\"Fjotra\"&gt;Fjotra&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Sybil%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Sybil of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, and imprisons her in a cage. While possibly a barbaric form of worship, the ritual could also be interpreted as some purposeful form of desecration. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt;, while under the control of the Forsworn, possesses a shrine to &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;; while if the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; controls it, it will be for &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;; and if the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; control it, a shrine of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; will be present.\nCulture.\nThe traditional Reachmen seem to have a very deliberate tribal culture, wearing animal pelts and living in tents made of fur. The Reachmen have a known disdain for the civilized societies and cultures of Tamriel. Despite owning both &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; at various points in their history, they were never known to have established permanent settlements, seemingly preferring to live in remote mountainous regions and caves. The Reachmen view the Reach as some form of holy land gifted to them by Hircine, and so is defended ferociously by their kind. The magicians of their tribes practice a variety of taboo magics such as human sacrifice and the creation of &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt;s, a process which is viewed as the pinnacle of warriorhood among the Reachmen. For this reason, they are known as the \"Witchmen of High Rock.\" It is believed that a large number of their taboo magicks were acquired through trade between the Reachmen of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; tribes of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The Reachmen are said to posses their own language, though there is no evidence of any written form, as all primary Reachmen documents are transcribed from oral tradition. The most revered individual among the Reachmen is the legendary Red Eagle, who led the rebellion against the Empress Hestra in &lt;a href=\"1E%201030\"&gt;1E 1030&lt;/a&gt;. A prevalent Reachmen teaching is that subtlety and nuance are for the weak, and that the weak, in turn, deserve to be punished, this can be seen in many of their violent rites of passage. A fair number of Reachmen tribes are notably matriarchal.\nThe traditional Reachmen are also described as being very cruel, often kidnapping the inhabitants of villages and enslaving them. Firsthand accounts say that even the Reachmen's humor was normally dark and malicious, being known to pull pranks that cause physical harm to others. During times of war, the Reachmen were known to pillage, massacre, and raze any settlements they came across and were normally known to use overwhelming forces and speed when attacking cities rather than siege tactics, as they lacked proper siege weaponry and naval forces to do so. When, raiding villages or other tribes, Reachmen are said to prefer sneak attacks, catching their enemy by surprise and then dominating them. The Reachmen have been said to enjoy being enemies of the other races. Despite this, some old Reachmen tribes were noted to have no problems trading peacefully with the cities of northern Tamriel.\nThe Reach is home to many different clans, each clan has its own character and traditions. many reachmen do not know how to read and write, nor do they care. Some clans settle in one spot and build permanent camps, while others remain nomadic. Clans fall somewhere between extended family and home village; some people in a clan are related to each other, but others adopt the clan name to mark their allegiance. New clans appear all the time, as bands of like-minded reachmen come together to settle new land, follow herds of game, or take up raiding to plunder neighboring lands. As a result, clans can be surprisingly fluid, breaking up and reforming over time.\nA chief leads each clan. Some call themselves chieftains, speakers, elders, or kings, although most Reachmen think calling oneself \"king\" is a sort of putting on airs. Decades go by in the Reach with no clan-chiefs bothering to make the claim. But, if enough reachmen agree that one is strong enough to claim the title, then any clan-chief can be a king. To this day, Reachmen view the Longhouse Emperors as war-leaders they follow of their own free will.\nClans.\nThroughout history, there have been multiple Reachmen clans. They are as follows:"}

For months now, he had been struggling with his fellow &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Councilor\"&gt;Councilor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Master Neloth&lt;/a&gt;. Recently he always found himself on the defensive. It was intolerable - Master Gothren losing a battle with the contemptible Neloth. Inspired by their master's weapon, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;, Neloth's normally cowardly troops had been nigh invincible. Gothren's own troops had no hope, except to pray that &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; would reclaim his artifact. Considering how much havoc it was causing, it seemed likely that the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;daedra prince&lt;/a&gt; would allow Master Neloth its use for some time to come.\nAn acrobatic distraction would be a welcome relief.\n\"What tricks can your troupe perform?\" asked the wizard to the lead acrobat, Rhunen.\n\"Mighty Gothren, alas, we know no tricks. All the realizations of acrobacy we perform are real with no illusions. We wish we knew tricks, for it's far too time-consuming to have to master actual feats.\"\n\"Very well, what realizations of acrobacy can you perform?\" asked Gothren with what almost looked like a smile.\n\"Master Jereth will dazzle you as he juggles fifteen flaming globes while hopping across broken glass. Master Tulkiande will astound you as she supports her body with one finger while rotating hoops in ornate patterns with her legs. Master Mearvis will take a simple ebony blade --\"\n\"And the outlander female?\" asked the Ashkhan with some disapprobation and a dismissive gesture toward the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; woman in the troupe.\n\"Master &lt;a href=\"Senyndie\"&gt;Senyndie&lt;/a&gt;? Ah, Mighty Gothren, she hails from the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; where she won renown for her skill at climbing sheer surfaces. You must see her at work to believe it. She moves vertically like you and I move horizontally.\"\n\"That is all very well, but I do not like outlanders in my court,\" said the Ashkhan. \"Many are spies.\"\n\"Oh, well, Master Neloth felt that --\"\n\"Neloth?!\" roared Gothren. \"You entertained that whoreson?!\"\n\"Two days ago, yes. I remember that he said there have been strained relations between you two. He also had some concerns about the outlanders in our troupe, though it was our &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; tumbler Master S'Rabba who he was particularly suspicious of. In fact, the irony is that he thought S'Rabba was a spy for you. Well, you know Khajiit. Actually, maybe you don't.\"\n\"They are a slave race who hold little interest to me,\" growled Gothren.\n\"You're like Master Neloth then,\" said Rhunen quickly, fully aware of Gothren's growing rage, which that particular comment had only enflamed. \"He wasn't used to Khajiit either. Or their dark sense of humor. He took some sarcastic comments from Master S'Rabba literally, and we all ended up being tortured for information about you and your troops. You probably haven't had the experience of being tortured for information you don't have, have you? I wouldn't recommend it. Eventually, we were let go on the understanding that we would never set foot in &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt; again. Actually, not all of us were let go. Master S'Rabba had apparently died under torture. You have probably had experience torturing the slave races and know how easily they break.\"\n\"No, I haven't,\" replied Master Gothren. The fury was dead.\n\"We should have probably left then, but we decided that he still owed us for the entertainment we provided under torture. We weren't sure how to collect, but he mentioned during the course of his ravings that he had a very valuable bauble. A razor of some kind.\"\n\"Mehrunes' Razor,\" he gasped. \"What -- what did you do?\"\n\"Masters Harakostil and Thelegorm compressed themselves low enough to squirm under the gates so they could lower the bridge into the main courtyard of the stronghold. Masters Tulkiande, Mearvis, Jereth, and I formed a pyramid to give Master Senyndie a boost up to the tower of &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Naga%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Naga&lt;/a&gt;. She scaled it to the top --\"\n\"She scaled it?\" asked Gothren, who was familiar with the tower.\n\"It was high, but the surface of these Telvanni mushrooms is practically a ladder to someone of Master Senyndie's skills. In a few minutes' time, she was in the room with the razor in hand. In a few more minutes, she was back down the tower and we were running for the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Inn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gateway Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Now, with all humility, I would say that no one is faster on their feet than our troupe, but Master Neloth's guards were surprisingly quick. I sent the troupe through the gate to the docks while I distracted the guards.\"\n\"I confess, I never associated brave actions with traveling acrobats,\" said Gothren.\n\"It wasn't bravery, it was economics,\" smiled Rhunen. \"I considered the amount of gold and time it takes to train a good troupe, and it seemed smarter to try to save everyone. In any case, I lured the guards around to the back of the &lt;a href=\"Gateway%20Inn%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gateway Inn&lt;/a&gt;, far from the others, and when I was sure they were safe, I jumped off the wall and into the water.\"\n\"You jumped off the wall?\"\n\"Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I did. It's pretty tall. It was a simple matter, especially since I could land in the water. Still, it's only a matter of rolling and twisting the body like so. I'll demonstrate it if you want.\"\n\"Later, if you please,\" said the Ashkhan. \"What happened then?\"\n\"We arrived here at court,\" said Rhunen simply.\n\"And when did Master Neloth get Mehrunes' Razor back from you?\"\n\"Mighty Gothren, that part of the story hasn't happened yet,\" said Rhunen. \"Are you ready for us to perform for you now? I hadn't told you yet about our latest realization of acrobacy when Master Mearvis takes a simple ebony blade and juggles it in one hand and a handful of marshmerrow reeds in the other. I don't want to give the whole effect away, but at the end of the act, you have some very fine sheets of papyrus.\"\n\"It sounds delightful, Master Rhunen,\" said Gothren. \"I look forward to seeing it in a few days time, but I must leave now to meet Master Neloth on the field. I will soon return for a victory celebration, and I want to see all your realizations of acrobacy. In the meantime, you will be honored guests with every luxury the Archmagister of House Telvanni can afford.\"\n\"So the room and board will be almost as nice as a third rate show in &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Senyndie as they took their rooms a few hours later. \"Why do we bother with these backwoods performances?\"\n\"There are already so many jugglers in Rihad,\" said Rhunen with a shrug."}

Speak with him; he will tell you that he does not like it when the Bosmer tell his clan what to do, and that they need to be put in their place. When you are done talking, the Green Lady will show up; talk to her and she will tell you that she thinks Agrakh is hiding something. She will ask you to step outside with her so she can disguise you. \nThe Green Lady will disguise you as a Drublog Champion. This will allow you to move about the camp freely; head over to the beach to the northeast and eavesdrop on the shaman there. You can hide behind the pile of crates next to the tower. You will overhear the shaman talking to himself about the chief talking to an apparition through a ritual. Once he is gone, head up the tower and light the ritual candles. An apparition called &lt;a href=\"The%20Hound\"&gt;The Hound&lt;/a&gt; will appear; talk to it and it will tell you that it has promised the Drublog a thousand cities to plunder if they capture the Green Lady. \nThe moment you are done talking to the beast, an orc named Roku will show up and tell you that the Green Lady has fallen into te Drublog trap. She has realised that you are not in fact a Drublog, but she is a friend of the Green Lady, and wants to see her freed. She will ask you to try and sway her father, Shaman Glazulg, to help free the Green Lady. Glazulg is to the south, in the building with the mammoth's skull above the door. He can be persuaded into helping you; if you do not persuade him, . If you did persuade hum, he will give you a totem that can drain the magic binding the Green Lady. \nTake this to Roku at the entrance to the Arena, atop the cliff to the north. She will let you into the arena, where the Green Lady is trapped. There, destroy the binds trapping the Green Lady, and a scene will unfold. An apparition of the Hound will appear and tell Chieftain Agrakh to kill Roku. The Green Lady will then wake up and tell the chieftain that he has much to answer for before shoving him aside. She will say that she knows who the Hound truly is, and then lave the arena. Follow her and speak with her outside to finish the quest."}

It is home to the cities of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rawl'kha&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;. The lattermost city is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; spiritual leader.\nBackground.\nReaper's March is a region frequently subject to conflicts and wars between the Khajiit, &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; who occupy the three-sided border. Although separated by the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;, Colovian cities such as &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; often make incursions into the areas surrounding the border cities. Despite concerted attempts to control the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Woods\"&gt;Northern Woods&lt;/a&gt; centralized through the occupation of Arenthia, Colovian forces would be forced to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and organised Khajiit resistance forces.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;, working through the &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Cult\"&gt;Stonefire Cult&lt;/a&gt;, would attempt to advance the progress of the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; in Reaper's March before being defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; and their allies. Concurrently, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mane%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Mane&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit of an ancient disgraced &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, was unleashed by the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;. His return would serve as a trial to determine which of the twins, &lt;a href=\"Shazah\"&gt;Shazah&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;Khali&lt;/a&gt;, would become the new Mane and spiritual leader of the Khajiit. The resolution of the crisis would serve to unify the races of the Dominion.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Reaper's March and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nReaper's March features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests conclude the Aldmeri Dominion's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Reaper's March. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Reaper's March totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTwenty-nine books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Reaper's March and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

There are Reavers that rely solely on &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt;, Reaver Archers, and Reavers that will attempt to attack with &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; weapons.

Their weapons are generally random and level dependent, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Stormfang%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Stormfang&lt;/a&gt;, which is found on a Reaver Lord in &lt;a href=\"Brodir%20Grove%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Brodir Grove&lt;/a&gt;.

They\u00a0are\u00a0generally in areas where fellow Reavers are abundant, so make sure you come prepared to face multiple enemies (bring a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or &lt;a href=\"Summon%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Summon&lt;/a&gt;)."}

It is the quest for the &lt;a href=\"Dreadsail%20Reef\"&gt;Dreadsail Reef&lt;/a&gt; trial.\nBackground.\n\"Admiral Galvendier of the Dufort Flotilla requires soldiers for an assault on the Dreadsail pirate fleet's headquarters.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis walkthrough is for normal difficulty. Players playing on Veteran may have different experiences.\nUpon entering Dreadsail Reef, you will find yourself in the hull of a ship. In this ship, you will find a man named Admiral Galvendier; he will tell you that the ship is here to eliminate the pirate queen Taleria and her fleet. He will give you the task of heading ashore and eliminating the queen. \nHead above deck and jump overboard, then swim towards the island to the east. Once at shore, head up the path for your first wave of enemies. Your primary focus when dealing with hordes of regular enemies should be the Keelcutters, as they can deal some heavy damage. You should also watch out for the Swashbucklers, who like to jump onto the furthest player from them. \nWhile heading further up the path, take care to avoid the catapult fire. Eventually, you will find the door to the Bloodsport Arena; the first boss waits inside. You will have to jump down to their platform; make sure not to accidentally jump in the water, as that will kill you. First, you will have to kill a few magical dogs before the actual bosses show up. One of them will enter the battlefield first; Turlassil is associated with the element of ice and Lylanar with the element of fire. There are two orbs to the side of the room; the red one will bestow the player who uses it a temporary dome of fire and the blue one a dome of ice. Get the dome of the opposing element over the boss. The dome will damage the player who holds it, so make sure you switch it around. The boss will summon some atronachs to its aid; make sure to deal with these fast. After a while, the boss will teleport back out of the arena and the other boss will enter the fray. Deal with him the same way as with the first boss, just use the opposite element. Once the second boss is sufficiently weakened, the first boss will come back; you will now be facing both of them. During this stage, make sure the fire and ice domes do not collide; this will cause explosions that will hurt your team. Make sure to kill the bosses at around the same time. \nOnce both are dead, head on into the Reef Warren. Here, you will notice a split in the road. Go either north or south; it does not matter which side you pick, as you will have to go down the other path later. If you head north, you will find yourself in the caverns; drop down into the water below. Follow the stream to the end and deal with the enemies there while avoiding the poisonous plants, then use all three levers there at the same time to open the way ahead. head on and go for a swim; you will get sucked along by the current, but you can press X to leave the water again once you are at the right point. There will be more enemies here as well as more levers; same deal as before. This song and dance will repeat itself one more time before you reach the room with the miniboss, &lt;a href=\"Bow%20Breaker\"&gt;Bow Breaker&lt;/a&gt;. Bone Breaker's weak point is his tail, so target that. Also make sure not to get overwhelmed by the other enemies this boss spawns. \nOnce the boss is dead, head through the next door and use the steering wheel to undo one of the locks preventing you from moving to the next real boss. Then jump down the ledge; you will find yourself in a tavern full of non-hostile pirates. Do not attack these pirates. Instead, head west to find your way back to the road split and take the other path. If you head south now, you will have to deal with some enemies before you reach the Tempest Heights. In this open-air area, you must watch out for lightning strikes; you will be safe from them if you take cover. Head along the path and fight your way across the bridge, and you will find another area with levers and a gate. you will have to search for a bit to find these levers; one is across a bridge, one is next to the gate and the other is to the left of the gate. Push on and you will find another such situation. Pull the levers and head through the gate, then across the bridge to find one last lever situation. \nBehind this gate rests the second miniboss, &lt;a href=\"Sail%20Ripper\"&gt;Sail Ripper&lt;/a&gt;. This guy likes to place an area of effect on a random player; when this happens, look for the donut-shaped area of effect in the room and stand in the middle to dispel the effect. Other than this the boss is fairly straightforward. Once he is dead, proceed on and turn another steering wheel to open the way to the next boss. Jump down the cliff and you will find yourself in the pirate tavern again; head through the gate to the east to get to the next boss arena, the Coral Cavern. \nThe boss here, the Reef Guardian, likes to create weaker copies of himself; kill these weaker versions first lest you get overwhelmed by them. He also likes to move to one of the puddles in this room to make himself invulnerable; when this happens, a few players should jump down the hole in the middle and navigate the waters toward the symbol of the puddle he is standing at. There, they need to defeat something called a Reef Heart to make the boss vulnerable again. \nOnce the Reef Guardian lies dead, proceed through the door to the east. Take care not to fall into the water in the next room; that will kill you. Fight your way through the last waves of enemies on your way to the final boss, Fleet Queen Taleria. When you reach the Coral Caldera where the pirate queen resides, jump down the ledge to confront the boss. She will transform into Tideborn Taleria, a very powerful final boss. This is among the most difficult fights in the game. You will be standing on a donut-shaped sand bank with Taleria in the middle. Make sure one of your tanks is diverting Taleria's attention away from the group, and one of your healers is constantly healing said tank. Taleria likes to summon tornadoes that will circle around the field; make sure you stay ahead of them, as getting hit by them will kill you instantly. She also has an attack where she will quickly summon a tidal wave; dodge this by getting into te water, but make sure to leave the water again quickly, as it will damage you. Taleria also has the tendency to summon her minions to the fight; these can quickly overwhelm you if not dealt with immediately. Finally, from time to time, a bridge will appear; a few players should cross to fight the mage on the other side. Once said mage is at half HP, he will create a portal back to the donut; follow him through the portal and beat him there. \nOnce she is dead, talk to Admiral Galvedier to finish the quest."}

He can't do anything without a direct approach. He then requests that the Nerevarine find what is the cause of the trouble.\nInvestigation.\nIf the Nerevarine talks with any of the soldiers, they say that they could make use of a \"good &lt;a href=\"Beverages%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;.\" The Hero must find a drink for the soldier. Any of the following can be used, sujamma, flin, mazte, greef, shein or Cyrodiilic brandy.\nThere are several ways to acquire a bottle of alcohol. It is possible to go back to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; and buy a drink in &lt;a href=\"Gnisis%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Gnisis&lt;/a&gt;.

Antonius will admit that Carius did not ban alcohol, claiming the shipments simply stopped arriving. He will deny any accusations made and will ask to be left alone.\nIf this is reported to the Captain, he will explain that nothing can be done without proof.\nThe homesick priest.\nAbove the Armory, Antonius' room can be found, his desk will be locked (level 50). Inside a large quantity of beverages can be found. With this proof, the Hero must return to Antonius. The latter will confess everything. Antonius explains that he hoped the soldiers would get agitated without any alcohol, and maybe start a mutiny. Due to the issuing chaos, Antonius would have requested to back home.\nThe Nerevarine can respond in two ways: either report the whole story to Captain Carius, or protect Antonius and lie to the captain.\nIf the truth is spoken, the captain will appear disappointed with Antonius, saying Antonius just needed to ask for a leave. As punishment, the captain decides that Antonius will not go back to Vvardenfell so soon.\nIf the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; lies to Captain Carius, the captain will be happy with the end of the disturbance, even if the cause was not discovered.\nIf Antonius is killed, the Captain will simply ask to stop the investigation."}

Watch for &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Failed%20Experiment\"&gt;Failed Experiment&lt;/a&gt;s. Once you get to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Vivisection\"&gt;Sanctum of Vivisection&lt;/a&gt;, they will find Relmyna down here, torturing people to death. One can help her by pressing the buttons next to the captives' cages. One will send a rain of darts into a defenseless character, another opens a trap door underneath the captive. If a captive dies, Relmyna will eventually bring him or her back to life. Don't fire arrows or spells at the captives, Relmyna will immediately call the Hero a murderer, and attack them.\nTalk to Relmyna, she recognizes them as the adventurer who slew her Gatekeeper. The ensuing conversation is lengthy and offers a choice of being rude or friendly, but it doesn't really matter what is chosen to say. In the end, Relmyna will give them a key to the &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Flesh%20and%20Bone\"&gt;Gardens of Flesh and Bone&lt;/a&gt; and tell them to get Blood Liqueur, Osseous Marrow, Dermis Membrane, and Essence of Breath.\nIf objecting to Relmyna torturing people to death, it's possible to speak to her about it. She will say that Sheogorath sanctions her experiments, and that she brings \"the worthy ones\" back to life. If the Hero continue to protest, she will offer to set them free in exchange for their participation. If agreeing, she will cast the spell &lt;a href=\"Exalted%20Pain\"&gt;Exalted Pain&lt;/a&gt; on them, which drains nearly every attribute the hero have, including health.\nThis might kill them outright and others may survive but will find some attributes damaged permanently, however all damaged attributes can be restored at an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20the%20Nine\"&gt;altar&lt;/a&gt;. The extent of the damage is presumably based on game difficulty and character level. If one submits to Exalted Pain, speak to her afterwards and she will give the Hero a pair of enchanted handcuffs called the &lt;a href=\"Manacles%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Manacles of Pain&lt;/a&gt;.\nGardens of Flesh and Bone.\nFollow the red arrow out to the &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Isles\"&gt;Realm of Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;. The Gardens of Flesh and Bone are in the northwest portion of the Fringe, the counterpoint to &lt;a href=\"Xeddefen\"&gt;Xeddefen&lt;/a&gt;. The Gardens are heavily trapped so watch for falling ceilings, giant shooting thorns and twisted roots that can be opened by a green switch to the side.\nThis is a large dungeon, but blockages of twisted roots will help direct you through it. The map and red/green arrows are also very useful. This portion of the quest is a straightforward search for four items. The Dermis Membrane and the Osseous Marrow are located on the &lt;a href=\"Conservatorium%20Corpusculum\"&gt;Conservatorium Corpusculum&lt;/a&gt; level.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Flesh%20and%20Bone\"&gt;Caverns of Susurration&lt;/a&gt; are a complex web of caves that double back on each other so often that the green arrow is useless. It's best to save at the entrance because you could get lost here. Head downward when possible, and follow the green-tinted gusts of wind with an eerie breathing sound that blow through the caverns. They are all sweeping toward the Essence of Breath. Activate the Essence once to gather all of the Breath and then again to take it.\nThe final ingredient, Blood Liqueur, can be found in the Natatorium of Wound Bled Tears. This is an especially dangerous section. Falling ceilings are abundant\u2014be careful when pushing buttons to open doors. Also, when entering the room with the chest on the altar, make sure to check underneath the chest as there is a third button which opens the door needed to go through. The Blood Liqueur can be found by activating the spring of blood in the blood-filled room.\nXaselm.\nHead back to Relmyna to help build the new Gatekeeper. Relmyna has created versions of each appendage and the Hero get to decide which one goes where. Follow the marker and go to the room with the hanging body organs. The names of the parts are fairly self-explanatory. Adding that part of the body will allow them to get a &lt;a href=\"Gatekeeper%27s%20Gift\"&gt;Gatekeeper's Gift&lt;/a&gt; when they later activate the live Gatekeeper.\nThe Fringe.\nOnce the bodyparts have been chosen for the Gatekeeper, accompany Relmyna to the Fringe. Once at the statue of Sheogorath that stands in front of the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Madness%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Gates of Madness&lt;/a&gt;, speak to Relmyna again. She will begin the ceremony and a pool of light will open in the ground. Toss all of the ingredients collected into the pool by activating it. Relmyna will helpfully remind them over and over again if some are still missing.\nShe will continue to chant her summon spell on while adding the body parts. Once the ceremony is over, a new Gatekeeper will be stomping around the Gates. Waiting a few seconds before leaving they will see a group of &lt;a href=\"Knight%20of%20Order%20%28Shivering%20Isles%29\"&gt;Knights of Order&lt;/a&gt; appear who will attack the Gatekeeper.\nRelmyna will also grant the &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Power\"&gt;Greater Power&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Flesh%20Atronach\"&gt;Summon Flesh Atronach&lt;/a&gt; to the Hero. If you try to talk to the gatekeeper, it will bestow a Greater power from one of its body parts. You can only have one Greater Power from the gatekeeper. Go back and tell Sheogorath and this will conclude the current quest and begin the next: &lt;a href=\"The%20Helpless%20Army\"&gt;The Helpless Army&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Dragonborn must kill him and take his place to assassinate the Emperor.\nBackground.\n\"I have been tasked with killing the Gourmet, but only one person knows the renowned chef's true identity and location - a man named Anton Virane. I must get this information from Anton Virane, and then kill him.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest begins by talking to Festus in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Sanctuary%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. He has a signed copy of a cookbook that appears to have a message for one &lt;a href=\"Anton%20Virane\"&gt;Anton Virane&lt;/a&gt;, who is located inside &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Keep%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Understone Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;. Festus instructs the Dragonborn to learn The Gourmet's identity from Virane, kill him, find and kill The Gourmet, then get his &lt;a href=\"Gourmet%27s%20Writ%20of%20Passage\"&gt;Writ of Passage&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow the Dragonborn to take The Gourmet's place and gain entry to the Emperor's Tower at &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;. He also suggests that The Gourmet's body be hidden, to prevent others from discovering his true identity. He gives the Dragonborn the cookbook \"&lt;a href=\"Uncommon%20Taste%20-%20Signed\"&gt;Uncommon Taste - Signed&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSpeaking with &lt;a href=\"Gabriella\"&gt;Gabriella&lt;/a&gt; before leaving will reveal her suggestion that The Gourmet's corpse be hidden in a body of water.\nFriend of a chef.\nAfter traveling to the Understone Keep, Anton Virane can be questioned on the whereabouts of The Gourmet. He will refuse to reveal the location at first, but can be convinced to do so by intimidating him and saying that the Dark Brotherhood wants to know. He will reveal The Gourmet's identity as &lt;a href=\"Balagog%20gro-Nolob\"&gt;Balagog gro-Nolob&lt;/a&gt;, an Orc who is located in the &lt;a href=\"Nightgate%20Inn\"&gt;Nightgate Inn&lt;/a&gt; over in &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe will then ask the Dragonborn to let him live. There are three responses to this: lying and telling him that he will not be harmed; telling him he has to die; or remaining silent, which will cause him to resume his schedule as normal. Choosing the second option, \"I'm afraid not,\" will cause him to flee, though no guards or other civilians will come to his defense until he is actually assaulted. In any case, he must be killed. Some methods to do this are:\nKilling The Gourmet.\nBalagog gro-Nolob can be found in the Nightgate Inn. He will either be down at the dock by the lake (during the day), or in his room in the inn's cellar. Killing him is rather simple, as there are no witnesses in the cellar and rarely any witnesses outside the inn, plus he has extremely low health and no armor.\nAcquiring the bonus.\nTo acquire the bonus, Balagog's body needs to be hidden somewhere. Back in the Sanctuary, Gabriella hinted that she uses bodies of water for hiding victims. The innkeeper of the Nightgate Inn, &lt;a href=\"Hadring\"&gt;Hadring&lt;/a&gt;, mentions that Balagog often goes down to the lake. So, the Dragonborn can wait until he leaves (around 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m.), then follow him to the lake, kill him, and drag his body into the water (the nearby river will not count). Due to his low health, even attacks such as &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; will kill him instantly. However, care must be taken when using a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;dragon shout&lt;/a&gt; as detection earns a &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bounty&lt;/a&gt; that is assigned to &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;The Reach&lt;/a&gt;. A high damage ranged attack may throw him in the water. At that point, his body can be looted, which will complete both tasks.\nIf he is killed in the cellar of the Nightgate Inn, there are several ways to hide his body. One is to drag his body and lift it into the large empty wine barrel at the east end of the room. Removing everything from his inventory will make his body lighter, and may be necessary to lift him into the barrel. Another way is to drag him behind the hay bales until this part of the quest is marked as completed. Dragging the body under the bed also works. Finally, if he is spoken to and told that he is going to be killed, he will run and try to hide behind a vat - if he is then killed there, his body is hidden enough to satisfy the \"hide his body\" objective.\nNote that the &lt;a href=\"Disintegrate%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Disintegrate&lt;/a&gt; perk or the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20Force\"&gt;Dragonborn Force&lt;/a&gt; enhancement to Unrelenting Force may turn Balagog's body to ash, making it impossible to hide.\nConclusion.\nThe quest is completed by reporting back to Festus Krex. Aside from giving payment to the Dragonborn, he also gives the &lt;a href=\"Nightweaver%27s%20Band\"&gt;Nightweaver's Band&lt;/a&gt; if the optional objective (hiding The Gourmet's body) is also completed."}

Paradise can only be visited once during the ending of the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;main quest line&lt;/a&gt; in .\nOverview.\nThe plane appeared to be an extremely beautiful one with trees, grass, peaceful water, white &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;deer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was not all peaceful, especially for the &lt;a href=\"Ascended%20Immortal\"&gt;Ascended Immortal&lt;/a&gt;s walking around the landscape.\nThe only door that leads to Carac Agaialor is a door guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kathutet%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Kathutet&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; then obtained the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from here.\nSublocations.\nSavage Garden.\nIt is here in the Savage Garden one enters from &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Ruler%20Temple%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cloud Ruler Temple&lt;/a&gt; when the portal is activated by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt;. The landscape is beautiful and colorful with flowers and vegetation. Everywhere are Ayleid ruins and stone paths leading to more ruins. But there are also &lt;a href=\"Daedroth%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedroths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Storm Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Frost Atronachs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Clannfears&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Spider Daedras&lt;/a&gt; present to harm everyone in sight.\nIn one small cave, Lair of Anaxes, some of the immortals have captured &lt;a href=\"Anaxes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anaxes&lt;/a&gt; so he can't harm them further but the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; can release him as a request from Kathutet to get the &lt;a href=\"Bands%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Bands of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; without the need to kill him.\nFollow the shoreline to the east from the cave and one will eventually get to a large island with a small Ayleid ruin. There is a &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Mud%20Crab\"&gt;Spectral Mud Crab&lt;/a&gt; guarding a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlooded Grotto.\nThe Flooded Grotto is a cave within Paradise and in order to reach Carac Agaialor one must pass this cave and the next room, the Forbidden Grotto. The first part of the cave is flooded and by the door to the Forbidden Grotto Kathutet will stand if the Hero hasn't spoken to him before. If the Bands of the Chosen have been given to the Hero, equip them in order to enter.\nThe Forbidden Grotto is a place for torture of the ascended immortals by the Dremoras. There are lava pits, cages hanging over lava streams ready to be lowered down. Here the Hero will encounter &lt;a href=\"Eldamil\"&gt;Eldamil&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; who assists the Hero in killing Camoran and his son and daughter. In here are several &lt;a href=\"The%20Punished%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;The Punished&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt; usually with different &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt; but one has some leveled items.\nPalace Carac Agaialor.\nExiting the Forbidden Grotto takes the Hero to the part of Paradise where Mankar Camoran has his Palace Carac Agaialor. On the left of the path is a large statue overlooking the island and behind is a path leading directly to the palace.\nStanding outside in the garden are his children, Ruma and Raven waiting to escort the Hero to their father and to retrieve the Amulet of Kings. When Mankar Camoran dies, the Paradise will cease to exist. The Paradise that he created with the &lt;a href=\"Mysterium%20Xarxes\"&gt;Mysterium Xarxes&lt;/a&gt; was, ironically, the very thing that led to his demise."}

The Order of Diagna, with the joint forces of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, attacked the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; during Gaiden's leadership. The war is known as the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20948\"&gt;1E 948&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall sent a letter to Shinji saying \"\"The orcs have been much plaguing the &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;ers and impeding traffic to the heart of the land.\"\" It took thirty years for the joint armies to breach and destroy Orsinium.\nDuring his lifetime, he was also the founder and original Blademaster of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arena%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;, which was completed shortly before the siege began. Gaiden Shinji was one of the many casualties of the Siege of Orsinium.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Ashes%20of%20Our%20Fathers\"&gt;The Ashes of Our Fathers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter going to &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Honor's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, the archaeological historians, &lt;a href=\"Lozruth\"&gt;Lozruth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sharela\"&gt;Sharela&lt;/a&gt; will be arguing about who is buried inside the tomb. Lozruth argues that it is Orcish hero &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, while Sharela argues that it is Blademaster Gaiden Shinji. They cannot fully confirm their speculations, however, as the tomb doors are currently sealed. Sharela sends the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to the Honor's Rest Catacombs to obtain more information.\nOnce there, the burial chamber of one of Shinji's disciples, &lt;a href=\"Tamahl\"&gt;Tamahl&lt;/a&gt;, is found. It contains a Memorial Pool, imbued with his memory of Shinji speaking to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Knights of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt; during the First Era. After drinking from the pool, you are transported to the memory as Tamahl. There, you can find Shinji arguing with Trystan:\nGaiden Shinji: \"\"Your &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; should call off &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;the siege&lt;/a&gt;. The battle is unjust.\"\"\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"Shinji... &lt;a href=\"Mercedene\"&gt;Mercedene&lt;/a&gt; now commands &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;us&lt;/a&gt;. The siege will not end.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"Mercedene? The Beat of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; is your general?\"\nLord Trystan: \"There's another way. Challenge &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth&lt;/a&gt; to a duel. You could end this siege with a swing of your blade.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; will never agree.\"\nLord Trystan: \"The Orcs love Baloth more than &lt;a href=\"Golkarr\"&gt;their own king&lt;/a&gt;. He'll agree\u2015his people have bled enough.\"\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"What would your king say? He appointed Mercedene.\"\nLord Trystan: \"King Jolie suggested this. He needs a victory, and won't care who delivers it.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"\"Then it shall be. The &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; will march to Orsinium.\"\"\nAfterwords, you can speak to Shinji about his upcoming duel with Baloth Bloodtusk, and later speak to Lord Trystan about Shinji.\nAfter Tamahl and &lt;a href=\"Arakaul\"&gt;Arakaul&lt;/a&gt;'s burial urns are collected, go back to the Honor's Rest sealed door. There, Lozruth and Sharela will be speaking to the Orsinium Advisor &lt;a href=\"Goruz\"&gt;Goruz&lt;/a&gt; about their findings. After placing the urns inside the wall, the door displaying Shinji and Baloth facing each other will open.\nAfter going inside, statues of the Order of Diagna and the Savage Sons, Shinji and Baloth's factions respectively, will be seen side-by-side in a large hall. Through the next door is the tombs of both Shinji and Baloth, on opposite sides of the room. A stone statue memorializing Shinji and Baloth's dual is seen in the centre, with a memorial pool in the back.\nAfter drinking from the pool, you will be transported to a memory of &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Reliana\"&gt;Commander Reliana&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Orsinium\"&gt;First Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. There, Baloth's injured brother &lt;a href=\"Rokaug\"&gt;Rokaug&lt;/a&gt; is revealed to be alive. He says Mercedene kept him captive and that she plans to assassinate both Shinji and Baloth as part of Jolie's plan.\nOnce you have exited the cave, Shinji and Baloth can be seen dueling on a ledge while having a conversation:\nGaiden Shinji: \"No duel should last longer than eight seconds.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;: \"What fool said that?\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"Myself! How long have we fought?\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"Eight minutes. What do you say to that?\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"I shall reconsider the proverb.\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"You'll have to defeat me to pass it on.\"\nGaiden Shinji: \"True enough! The best techniques are passed on by the survivors.\"\nBaloth Bloodtusk: \"That's a good proverb.\"\nHistory.\nShinji died somewhere between &lt;a href=\"1E%20952\"&gt;1E 952&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"1E%20973\"&gt;1E 973&lt;/a&gt; during the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; while fighting Baloth Bloodtusk. General Mercedene, a vicious commander and ancestor of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;, ordered both of the duelers to be shot, with Lord Trystan being the only survivor of the assassination.\nLegacy.\nHe is still remembered as a legendary hero by the participants of the Arena, who often use his name when talking in a manner that replaces deities, such as \"by Shinji,\" \"for Shinji's sake,\" and \"Shinji be with us.\" He also known for his quote, \"The best techniques are passed on by the survivors.\" The fort &lt;a href=\"Shinji%27s%20Scarp\"&gt;Shinji's Scarp&lt;/a&gt; was named after him.\nConversations.\n\"\"Do you see how King &lt;a href=\"Joile\"&gt;Joile&lt;/a&gt; forces my hand? If I refuse to challenge &lt;a href=\"Baloth%20Bloodtusk\"&gt;Baloth Bloodtusk&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; king will demand &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Trystan\"&gt;Lord Trystan&lt;/a&gt; do so in my place. My obedience, or my friend's life.\" \"This is what kings call 'leadership.'\"\n\"I shall miss this place. Each day a bed of burning coals, each night a plunge into cool water.

She learned her craft from the masters in the art of flesh sculpture. She studied with the Faculty of Chirurgeons in &lt;a href=\"Cloudrest\"&gt;Cloudrest&lt;/a&gt; and walked with the hollow-faced men of Nohotogrha for three years.\nShe practiced her trade in salons and manors all over Tamriel and nobles of the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; were among her clients. In recent times she has fallen from her high class lifestyle and often laments the fact that she is forced to offer her services in what she calls the \"backwaters of the world.\"\nInteractions.\nDragonborn makeover.\nGalathil is first mentioned after speaking to an innkeeper about rumors or in passing conversations with guards.

She initially doubts that the Dragonborn can afford her services and says to him/her that they \"have the smell of the vagabond\" about them. She charges 1,000 to alter the facial and body features of the Dragonborn. However, race, name and gender cannot be changed.\nIn addition, she will not offer her services if the Dragonborn is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"vampire%20lord\"&gt;vampire lord&lt;/a&gt;, claiming her techniques only work on the living, not those that have crossed over into undeath. A workaround for this is to &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29%23Curing%20vampirism%202\"&gt;cure&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Vampirism%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampirism&lt;/a&gt; before visiting Galathil. Then, any time after the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Echoes\"&gt;Chasing Echoes&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Kindred%20Judgment\"&gt;Kindred Judgment&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt; can be asked to confer vampirism provided that she has not cured herself."}

Its main hub is the city of &lt;a href=\"Vastyr\"&gt;Vastyr&lt;/a&gt;, which was controlled by &lt;a href=\"House%20Mornard\"&gt;House Mornard&lt;/a&gt; during the . Druidic ruins on were discovered on Galen, fixing the idea of its Breton history into collective imagination. The &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20Galen\"&gt;Druids of Galen&lt;/a&gt; were able to instill magic on Galen to balance nature and bring life to the land. There are a variety of remote parts of the island.\nHistory.\nAfter leaving High Rock around &lt;a href=\"1E%20330\"&gt;1E 330&lt;/a&gt;, the druids made the perilous voyage to the Systres. According to legend, this was either by following a mysterious \"song\" the eldest druids heard on the wind, or by carrying an Elder Scroll with them and following its guidance to the shores of their new adopted home, and named one of the islands Galen. In druid orthodoxy, the first Draoife harnessed the power of the Earthbones to transform the scarred, volcanic island into a verdant paradise. These \"three mornings of sail\" witnessed the rise of the druidic Circles.\nHouse Mornard once controlled the entire island chain, and their downfall began when Duke &lt;a href=\"Avrippe%20Mornard\"&gt;Avrippe Mornard&lt;/a&gt; fumbled the archipelago's response to the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20562\"&gt;2E 562&lt;/a&gt;. To make mattes worse, he allied himself with &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; in the feud between &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of losing the war, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt; stripped Avrippe and his house of their dukedom, reducing their rank to count and leaving them with only their mining concerns, their trade routes, and administration of the prison isle of &lt;a href=\"Amenos\"&gt;Amenos&lt;/a&gt;. Mornard was then forced to move its base of operations from High Isle, to Galen and the city of Vastyr. During the Three Banners War, the Dreadsails had been operating in the remote parts of Galen and Y'ffelon and the island lacked strong defenses; as such the rival House Dufort had no interest in protecting them."}

Outside the city of &lt;a href=\"Vastyr\"&gt;Vastyr&lt;/a&gt;, the island of Galen is largely wilderness inhabited by druids and the native wildlife. The eastern coast of the island is highly volcanic due to its proximity to Y'ffelon. Like the entire archipelago, expansive lava vents run underneath the entire landmass.\nBackground.\nThe islands were the seat of power of &lt;a href=\"Druid%20King%20Kasorayn\"&gt;Druid King Kasorayn&lt;/a&gt; before the dissolution of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20Galen\"&gt;Druids of Galen&lt;/a&gt; and are now inhabited mostly by the &lt;a href=\"Eldertide%20Cirlce\"&gt;Eldertide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonelore%20Circle\"&gt;Stonelore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Firesong%20Circle\"&gt;Firesong Circle&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Mornard\"&gt;House Mornard&lt;/a&gt; situated in the city of &lt;a href=\"Vastyr\"&gt;Vastyr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Westport\"&gt;Westport&lt;/a&gt; shipyard.\nAs a result of failing to address the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20562\"&gt;2E 562&lt;/a&gt; and later backing &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; in his &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; to take the throne of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, House Mornard had their titles and lands stripped from them by &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;, reducing their influence to only Galen, when they had previously ruled over the entire archipelago.

Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nGalen and Y'ffelon features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Bretons\"&gt;Legacy of the Bretons&lt;/a&gt; overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"High%20Isle%20and%20Amenos\"&gt;High Isle and Amenos&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Galen and Y'ffelon. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Note that the Epilogue for the Legacy of the Bretons requires the zone quests of both High Isle and Amenos and Galen and Y'ffelon to have been completed before it can be started.\nItem Sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nTen books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Galen and Y'ffelon and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

Trechtus' father and mother were common laborers, but his father had secretly, against the law of Lord Gyrnasse, taught himself and then Trechtus to read. Lord Gyrnasse had been advised that literate serfs were an abomination of nature and dangerous to themselves and their lords, and had closed all bookstalls within Sollicich-on-Ker. All booksellers, poets, and teachers were forbidden, except within Gyrnasse's keep. Nevertheless, a small scale smuggling operation kept a number of books and scrolls in circulation right under Gyrnasse's shadow.\nWhen Trechtus was eight, the smugglers were found and imprisoned. Some said that Trechtus's mother, an ignorant and religious woman fearful of her husband, was the betrayer of the smugglers, but there were other rumors as well. The trial of the smugglers was nonexistent, and the punishment swift. The body of Trechtus' father was kept hanging for weeks during the hottest summer Sollicich-on-Ker had seen in centuries.\nThree months later, Trechtus ran away from Lord Gyrnasse's estate. He made it as far as &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, half-way across &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;. A band of troubadours found him nearly dead, curled up in a ditch by the side of the road, nursed him to health, and employed him as an errand boy in return for food and shelter. One of the troubadours, a soothsayer named Heliand began testing Trechtus' mind and found the boy, though shy, to be preternaturally intelligent and sophisticated given his circumstances. Heliand recognized in the boy a commonality, for Heliand had been trained on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; as a mystic.\nWhen the troupe was performing in the village of &lt;a href=\"Potansa\"&gt;Potansa&lt;/a&gt; on the far eastern end of Summerset, Heliand took Trechtus, then a boy of eleven, to the Isle of Artaeum. The Magister of the Isle, &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, recognized potential in Trechtus and took him on as pupil, giving him the name of Vanus . Vanus trained his mind on the Isle of Artaeum, as well as his body.\nThus was the first Archmagister of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; trained. From the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; of the Isle of Artaeum, he received his training. From his childhood of want and injustice, he received his philosophy of sharing knowledge."}

He is the biological father of &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20IV\"&gt;Uriel Septim IV&lt;/a&gt;, who was the first indirect descendant to &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallivere Lariat was a noble from the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; who garnered the attention of Empress Katariah Septim, who ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; while her husband, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; was being treated for his infamous insanity. While he was recovering in his personal cell, Katariah had a relationship with Gallivere, which resulted in the birth of Uriel Septim IV. The relationship was publicly acknowledged, even when Pelagius Septim III was still recovering some time before his death in &lt;a href=\"Betony\"&gt;Betony&lt;/a&gt;. Gallivere Lariat derives from a noble family of Shornhelm known as the &lt;a href=\"House%20Lariat\"&gt;House Lariat&lt;/a&gt;, who are considered distant relatives to Tiber Septim. What happened to Gallivere Lariat is unknown.\nLegacy.\nGallivere Lariat's lineage would reside in the Imperial Palace for quite some time, beginning with Uriel Lariat IV. It was difficult for Uriel IV to gain acceptance from the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt;, considering his very distant relation to Tiber Septim, and despite the Lariat Family's immense influence, it was still a challenge to be fully recognized as the Emperor. But, Uriel IV managed to hold his own and became a substantial leader of the Third Empire, although the Emperor and the Elder Council would be at odds with each other. Uriel IV's son, &lt;a href=\"Andorak%20Septim\"&gt;Andorak Septim&lt;/a&gt; was denied the throne by a vote of the Elder Council, so the throne was given to more closer relative to Tiber Septim, with that relative being &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Cephorus Septim II&lt;/a&gt;. It was not a total loss for Andorak. However, the Elder Council had instead given Andorak his ancestral domain, the Kingdom of Shornhelm was given to Andorak Septim."}

I think he's aware I'm following him, and appears to be taking no unnecessary chances. I'm bringing all of my skills to the forefront in order to deceive him. It still pains me that the deception is necessary. When I became a &lt;a href=\"Nightingale\"&gt;Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;, using my newfound talents against my own was the furthest thought from my mind.\nThere was a close call today. I was settling down for a night's rest in the Cistern when Mercer Frey entered unexpectedly. He was creeping along the wall, but I spotted him immediately. He edged closer to the vault door, making his way carefully around the perimeter of the room, but suddenly stopped and turned towards my hiding place. I froze instantly, even holding my breath for a moment, but my position was already compromised. He abruptly turned and walked back towards the &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;Flagon&lt;/a&gt;. What was he doing? At last I have a piece of evidence that might explain Mercer Frey's actions. Instead of trying to follow him or break into his Manor, I used every loose-tongued source at my disposal to scour the Ratway looking for answers.\nIt took several weeks but &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt; was able to provide an interesting bit of information. Mercer had been spending inordinately large sums of coin on all manner of things unrelated to the Guild. How he was able to afford this was a mystery to me. The vault was impregnable, so what was the source of his coin?\nIt's been confirmed by my sources Mercer's been living an unduly lavish lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal pleasures. I have more than my share of evidence to confront him now. He must be stealing from the Guild, but, without proof, all I have is baseless accusation. Mercer came from wealthy stock, but the amount of coin he's been spending is immense.\nI've been giving it some serious thought. There's only a single way that Mercer could have access to vast amounts of coin. I hesitate to even believe it's possible. How could he possibly desecrate the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;? This goes far beyond mere greed, and transcends common theft. His actions could represent the failure of the Nightingales! Something that hasn't occurred in hundreds of years. Why? Why would he readily throw away everything he believes in? All I need is proof.\nMercer Frey has requested I meet him at &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Veil%20Sanctum\"&gt;Snow Veil Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; today. He sent a note by courier, so I can only assume he's already there. All my senses tell me it's a trap, but I have no choice. His message indicated the meeting was of the utmost urgency, and involved Guild business, so I'm obligated to go. I can't risk bringing anyone else with me, but I'm almost certain &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt; will disobey and follow."}

Sworn to protect the Shrine of &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;, she blessed him with extraordinary skill. Gallus was in a romantic relationship with Karliah, who he had mentored and inducted into the Nightingales.\nOne night, Gallus was caught breaking into a laboratory owned by &lt;a href=\"Enthir\"&gt;Enthir&lt;/a&gt;. Before he could call the guards, Gallus made a comment that intrigued Enthir. The two struck up a conversation, and eventually became dear friends. When asked why a scholarly man such as Gallus would turn to thievery, Enthir made a suggestion that Gallus always felt more comfortable breaking in through a window than he did bent over dusty tomes.\nUnfortunately, Gallus met his end after being lured to a remote location by Mercer Frey, who then murdered him. Mercer dumped his body into a nearby crypt, and framed Karliah for the killing, who was forced to flee.\u00a0However, Karliah was eventually able to reconnect with the Guild through the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, after Mercer's betrayal of the Guild became known.

The Dragonborn encounters Gallus while attempting to return the Skeleton Key. Gallus informs them that all of the Nightingales are losing their connection to Nocturnal, which has caused the remaining guards to become hostile. Gallus claims that he too, will soon lose his connection to Nocturnal if the Skeleton Key is not returned.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; has been placed in the &lt;a href=\"Ebonmere\"&gt;Ebonmere&lt;/a&gt;, Gallus and Karliah are reunited, but briefly.

In order to achieve that goal, he has allied himself with &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"silencer\"&gt;silencer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a group he has been at odds with.\nHe is the main antagonist of the main questline of , in which he is responsible for the death of many Dark Brotherhood members.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Ghost%20from%20the%20Past\"&gt;A Ghost from the Past&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the fumes of &lt;a href=\"Green-Venom-Tongue\"&gt;Green-Venom-Tongue&lt;/a&gt;'s resin, apparitions of Artorius and &lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Viria\"&gt;Lyra Viria&lt;/a&gt;'s from the past are seen, depicting Lyra's transformation into the Black Dragon:\nPrimate Artorius: \"Put away your weapon, child. We have much to discuss.You feel lost, without purpose. But the opposite is true. Everything has led you to me.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Viria\"&gt;Lyra Viria&lt;/a&gt;: \"Oh really? I just see another witness that needs to be silenced.\"\nArtorius: \"\"I performed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Sacrament\"&gt;Sacrament&lt;/a&gt; that brought you here.

I don't understand...\"\nArtorius: \"\"You need to turn away from the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and step into the light. Join me and together we'll walk the path to redemption.\"\"\nLyra: \"Redemption? I'm a murderer! There's no redemption for someone like me.\"\nArtorius: \"Nonsense, child. Akatosh performs more impressive miracles than that all the time. We just need to turn your talents to the holy work of the Dragon God. Become my champion, a sword of Akatosh\u2015my Black Dragon that burns away evil's darkness.\"\nLyra: \"I... yes. I see it now. I pledge my blade and my life to you and to Akatosh.

Time is my domain, murderer, not yours.\"\nOnce Artorius is defeated, he will kneel towards the stained glass. Astara commands you to finish him off, to which you pick up his staff and impale him.\nCombat.\nIn combat, Artorius has a very unique advantage in that he can stop time at will by freezing his minions and Dark Brotherhood members in place at will. When you are frozen, you must use crowd control to break free and attack him. The periods of time freezing are the only times in which Artorius can be dealt damage and the only time he moves around the cathedral. The periods of frozen time only last for about 20 seconds, after which he will return to the podium. Once all of Artorius' health is depleted, he will be kneeling in defeat at the stained glass of Akatosh, in which you must then activate his staff and impale him."}

I mean, Your Semi-Excellency!\" It was Jengesh the page boy, in a sweat from having run up the stairs. \"The Prince wants you right away, in the stables! Hurry!\"\n\"Now what?\" I said, as I shoved Ralliballah's Eleven Ritual Forms under my desk blotter\u2014the Prince had forbidden magic in the palace ever since his attempt to learn the Water Breathing spell had left him temporarily unable to breathe anything but water. (I'd told him he was inverting the fifth and sixth syllables, but he'd ignore me.) \"Are the &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; into the oats again?\"\n\"Nope!\" Jengesh smiled slyly. \"You'll have to see this for yourself.\"\nPrince Hew was pacing impatiently back and forth before the door to the stables, taking care to keep his curly-toed golden slippers out of the dung. \"Ah! There you are, Hafzi! I have something to show you\u2014and this time I know you'll be impressed!\" He waved one silk-clad arm toward his ever-present bodyguard, and Big Dhorlun slid the stable door open on its rollers.\nInside was the ugliest thing I'd ever seen. It looked like a &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; war chariot, but it was oversized, with four wheels instead of two, and with a big gold-fringed umbrella on a gilded frame over the rider's box. The box itself was garishly painted with glowing rainbows, the Prince's chosen symbol (\"Because I'm 'Prince Hue'\u2014get it?\"), and silver spatter-boards were mounted over the wheels to keep mud from besmirching the driver. The whole affair looked as heavy as an oxcart in a quarry.\n\"Isn't it glorious?\" the Prince asked. \"It's glorious, isn't it?\" he repeated, pointedly. \"Glorious.\"\n\"G-glorious. Yes, indeed. Exactly.\" I said. \"It's also ... rather large. But it looks to me like it would take about eight horses to draw it, and right now we have only six.\"\n\"Horses? Pfah! Horses are for the ordinary! My new princely chariot will be drawn by ... a &lt;a href=\"Haj%20Mota\"&gt;haj mota&lt;/a&gt;!\"\n\"A devil-tortoise? But no one's ever tamed one\u2014it can't be done. And where would Your Highness get it, anyway?\"\n\"I have one already!\" said Prince Hew, proudly twirling his handlebar moustache. \"I bought it from a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; merchant, who tamed it with soporific bug-smoke. Come see!\" And he led the way further into the stable.\nThat's when the screaming began. Normally I wouldn't use a hoary cliche like \"blood-curdling shrieks,\" but really, my heart froze at the sound, terrible wails from both humans and horses. Morad the stable-hand came running from the pens, wide-eyed, followed by a Wood Elf I didn't recognize. I got in his way, and when he tried to push past me I grabbed him by one of his cosmetic antlers. \"Ow! Stop it, lady! Run for it!\"\n\"Tell me what happened, and I'll let you go,\" I snarled, twisting the antler for emphasis.\n\"It's the haj mota! It must've gotten used to the sleep-smoke, because it woke up\u2014mad!\" He looked over his shoulder, trembling. \"It's eating the horses! And we're next\u2014let me go!\"\nI let him go. And then, out of the depths of the barn, came the thundering devil-tortoise, its jaws still dropping gobbets of horse. It was charging straight toward Prince Hew, who stood stock-still, watching it. I realized he was paralyzed with fear.\nI barely made it, but I tackled the Prince and knocked him out of the way just before the haj mota would have trampled him. It passed us, then stopped short and turned\u2014it was shockingly nimble\u2014and whacked Dhorlun with its heavy tail, sending him flying in one direction, and his two-handed sword in another. Then it focused on us, murder in its red, piggy eyes.\nI was sprawled atop Prince Hew, who was pawing at me with his pudgy hands and bleating, \"Save me, Hafzi! Save me!\" As the thing stepped closer and opened its great beak I tried to think of a spell, any spell, but with the Prince wheezing at me my mind was a blank.\nThe Prince ... wheezing ... Suddenly a spell formed in my mind, I blurted it out,and slapped the haj mota on its nose. Magicka poured from me and into the beast, which blinked, snorted, and began to shake its head left and right. It opened its jaws wide and burst out in great, wracking gasps, and then flung its legs out and flopped down, lungs heaving. In less than a minute it was dead, suffocated.\nBecause it couldn't find any water to breathe.\nI helped the Prince up, dusting off his silken robes, except for the part where he'd sat in horse dung, which I pretended not to notice. \"What ... what happened to it, Hafzi?\" he said. His eyes narrowed. \"You didn't use any magic on it, did you?\"\n\"It ... must have been a delayed reaction to the bug-smoke. A breathing problem!\" I nodded emphatically. \"Yes, it must have been the smoke. Remember the time I wore that &lt;a href=\"Rihad\"&gt;Rihad&lt;/a&gt; musk and you couldn't stop sneezing? Like that!\"\n\"Ah. Yes. Well, that was lucky, wasn't it? Dhorlun, run after that merchant and get my money back! I'm going to have to buy another six horses.\" He looked fondly at the hideous chariot. \"Maybe eight!\""}

You know how I feel about magic in the palace, Petty-Vizier!\"\n\"It ... it isn't mine, Your Highness! I confiscated it from Jengesh the page boy.\" I smiled unconvincingly.\n\"Hmph. And why aren't you wearing your official petty-vizier turban?\"\nI glanced at the awful magenta-and-green headwear on the corner of my desk and tried not to make a face. \"It's too warm to wear a hat, Your Magnificence.\"\n\"Nonsense, it's the middle of &lt;a href=\"First%20Seed\"&gt;First Seed&lt;/a&gt;! But I want to know if preparations for the festival are on schedule. You know how much my people love a good party!\"\nI shook my head. \"They're &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, Your Highness. They don't really go to parties much. Or at all.\"\n\"That's about to change! Now, are we prepared for pin-the-tail-on-the-&lt;a href=\"camel\"&gt;camel&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"Yes, Your Highness. Or we will be, once Morad gets back from having the splint put on his leg.\"\n\"Bobbing for gorapples?\"\n\"The tubs, fruit baskets, and towels are all lined up in the west courtyard.\"\n\"The Town-Guards' three-legged race?\"\nI cleared my throat. \"Well, there we have a problem, Your Sublimity, because none of the Guards have signed up for the event. They're ... reluctant, because they remember how you punished Corporal Zaqudh after last year's race.\"\n\"He was cheating! I had to punish him! And after all, he still has most of his toes.\"\n\"Even so, I don't believe they'll do it.\"\n\"Hmph.\" The Prince tugged on his moustache irritably. \"What if you can assure them that I know they won't cheat by untying their legs, because they won't be able to?\"\nThis was bad. It meant the Prince had an idea, and it was always bad when the Prince had an idea. \"What do you mean, 'won't be able to'?\" I asked warily.\n\"Ha ha! Dhorlun, come here,\" he called. His bodyguard ducked his head under the lintel and came in from the hallway. \"Hafzi, stand in front of that &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n urn,\" Prince Hew said. \"Dhorlun, stand next to the Petty-Vizier.\"\nI shrugged, and we took our positions, Big Dhorlun at my side, topping my height by a head and a half. Prince Hew raised his hands in an arcane gesture and I realized, to my horror, that he was about to try to cast a spell\u2014but before I could protest, it was done. The spell was invoked, the &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; surged over me, and I felt my left leg weld itself to Dhorlun's right. \"No!\" I cried. \"Highness, what have you done?\"\nThe Prince gave his moustache a self-satisfied twirl. \"Did you think you were the only one who could read Corvus Direnni, Hafzi? I stripped the binding clause out of Koron's Peremptory Summons, and discovered I could use it to bind other things than the will of a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;! Impressive, isn't it?\"\nI just gaped at him. Meanwhile, Big Dhorlun looked down at our magically-bound legs, grunted, and then tried to step forward. I had to grab his arm to keep from falling over, and even then I nearly dragged both of us down. Dhorlun shook his head. \"This is bad, Master. Don't like it. Make it go away, Master.\"\n\"Oh, very well. Unbind!\" the Prince said, and reversed the spell, but added an inadvisable gestural flourish that funneled far too much magicka into it. Dhorlun and I flew apart, hurled to opposite sides of the room, and the anciend Yokudan urn behind us shattered explosively.\nSuddenly a swirling cloud appeared above the shattered jar, and a hollow, ringing voice cried, \"Free! FREE! After an eon bound in that stinking jug, I'm free!\" The cloud rapidly coalesced into an armored floating torso with a helmed head and four arms, each of which gripped a huge scimitar. \"Now I take my vengeance on the world of mortals!\"\nThe scimitars began to whirl menacingly. I glanced at Dhorlun, but he'd gone head-first into my marble bust of &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; and was still stunned. \"Highness!\" I cried. \"Use your spell! Bind that thing before it chops us into hors-d'ouevres!\"\nPrince Hew's eyes goggled with horror. \"I c-can't! The unbinding spell drained all my magicka! It's up to you, Hafzi!\"\nI ducked as two scimitars whistled over my head, and dashed behind my desk. The thing was between me and the door\u2014it WAS up to me to bind it, but I hadn't cast a spell in months. Prince Hew shrieked as a scimitar slashed the tassels off his golden fez. \"Koron's Prison, Hafzi! It's our only chance!\"\n\"But that needs a container, and the urn is smashed!\"\n\"Use this!\" And the Prince tossed me the magenta-and-green petty-vizier turban.\nThree scimitars came down on my desk, smashing it to flinders, as I inverted the turban and cast Koron's Perdurable Prison. \"NOOO!\" the demon cried as it dwindled into the hated hat. \"I loathe the scent of hair oil...!\"\nAnd then it was gone. I was still trembling, but Prince Hew blinked, took a deep breath, and smiled. \"Well, that didn't end so badly, did it? At least, not as bad as the Iron Regatta, or that business with the pet toku gava! Now, where were we?\"\nI helped Big Dhorlun up out of the marble dust of the shattered statue. \"We were canceling the Guards' three-legged race, remember?\"\n\"I suppose you're right, Hafzi. You usually are.\" He brightened. \"I have it! After the gorapple bobbing contest, we'll have them use their crossbows to shoot the fruit off the heads of the losers! Oh, and ... just get rid of that turban.\""}

He later serves as the hidden main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; region and later again as the main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt; region in the form of a lich known as the Shade of Naemon.\nBackground.\nAfter the disappearance of his sister in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Naemon was named heir to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Alinor\"&gt;Throne of Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"2E%20565\"&gt;2E 565&lt;/a&gt; he matriculated into the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs%27%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Sapiarchs' Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;. Naemon, like his father, was a natural &lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;ceremoniarch&lt;/a&gt;, who seemed to have a genuine relish for the rites and duties ordained for the heir by tradition. When his father ascended to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Naemon immediately began preparing to speak the eighty-eight day &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20Liturgy\"&gt;Coronation Liturgy&lt;/a&gt; that would elevate him to the Throne of Alinor. Shortly after, Ayrenn made an unexpected return and announced that she was prepared, as the eldest heir, to assume the throne. She was crowned Queen Ayrenn on the 7th of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fall\"&gt;Frost Fall&lt;/a&gt; in the year 580.\nThe sculptor, &lt;a href=\"Falarcil\"&gt;Falarcil&lt;/a&gt;, is known to have questioned the relevance of a statue in Naemon's honor, given Ayrenn's return. Naemon's aide, &lt;a href=\"Cintelmo\"&gt;Cintelmo&lt;/a&gt;, responded that the Prince is royalty and therefore deserves a new statue to be made, regardless of whether he is to become king.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"To%20Tanzelwil\"&gt;To Tanzelwil&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeak to Naemon at &lt;a href=\"Tanzelwil\"&gt;Tanzelwil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Name%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;In the Name of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssist Ayrenn in completing an ancient ritual to gain the favor of the ancient ones.\n&lt;a href=\"Sever%20All%20Ties\"&gt;Sever All Ties&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter saving &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; from the Daedric invasion and killing &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt;, you must inform Queen Ayrenn. Once the quest is completed, Naemon will walk towards Ayrenn, and will have an argument with her, shortly before leaving to mourn his wife's passing.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Honor%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;The Honor of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiscover why the Khajiiti Embassy project has been stalled.\n&lt;a href=\"Fit%20to%20Rule\"&gt;Fit to Rule&lt;/a&gt;.\nRestore the Orrery.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Orrery%20of%20Elden%20Root\"&gt;The Orrery of Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Queen Ayrenn's ratification, in his jealousy Naemon will try to enter the Orrery. He will see a vision of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and will turn into an &lt;a href=\"Ogrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ogrim&lt;/a&gt; shortly afterwards, as the Orrery reveals the true forms of those who enter it. Naemon in his Ogrim form will attack you, and once you defeat him, he will revert to his Elvish body and lie dead on the floor of the ruins. Queen Ayrenn and &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt; will mourn his death.\n&lt;a href=\"Right%20of%20Theft\"&gt;Right of Theft&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Servant%20of%20Naemon\"&gt;Servant of Naemon&lt;/a&gt;, recently brought back by the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, has raised ancient warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Blackroot%20Clan\"&gt;Blackroot Clan&lt;/a&gt; and must be defeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Striking%20at%20the%20Heart\"&gt;Striking at the Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeat the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Naemon\"&gt;Shade of Naemon&lt;/a&gt; and save the &lt;a href=\"Valenheart\"&gt;Valenheart&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hectahame\"&gt;Hectahame&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nPrince Naemon: \"My Queen. How may I further the Dominion's goals today?\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Little brother. You're here.\"\nPrince Naemon: \"You only call me that when you've done something you regret. Or expect to regret.\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Naemon, then \u2026 what have they told you?\"\nPrince Naemon: \"\"When you snatched father's crown for yourself, you never once called me \"little brother.\" Did you know that?\"\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Please.

She's gone now, isn't she?\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Little brother \u2026 I would have told you myself, if I could.\"\nPrince Naemon: \"No regrets, dear sister. You did what must be done for the glory of the Dominion. How could there be shame in that?\"\nBefore the ceremony:\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Little brother, you shouldn't be here for this. \u00ab1\u00bb warned us of the dangers.\"\nPrince Naemon: \"I won't turn my back on family. My place is in your shadow, as it has always been.\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"I know this can't be easy for you.\"\nPrince Naemon: \"On the contrary. Today the Dominion shall see why a High Elf is fit to lead all of Tamriel.\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"I used to despise your certainty. But today it's \u2026 reassuring, oddly enough.\"\nPrince Naemon: \"Apology accepted.\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"(laughter)\"\nAfter activating the pillars around the Orrery:\nPrince Naemon: \"So this pile of moss and rubble determines the next emperor.\"\nKing Camoran Aeradan: \"The Orrery is ancient. Show some respect.\"\nAfter reactivating the Orrery:\nPrince Naemon: \"And now the Ayleid deathtrap will tell us if we have an emperor in our midst. Truly, a momentous day.\"\nQueen Ayrenn: \"Naemon, now is not the time.\"\nPrince Naemon: \"Ayrenn, there's always time to protect you from yourself.

Depending on the choices made, either Sameer or his brother Haqmir will go into exile and found the &lt;a href=\"Ash%27abah\"&gt;Ash'abah&lt;/a&gt;; the other brother will become king.\nConversations.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Initiation\"&gt;The Initiation&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn all of these conversations, the Vestige controls Sameer's dialogue.\nAt the start of the vision:\nPrince Haqmir: \"Sameer, my brother! Finally you stir! Did you drink too deeply from the starry well last night? This is unlike you. Quickly, pull yourself together. We can afford no idle time today.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I'm awake. What is going on?\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"Morwha's mercy! Maybe you took a head-bump, too! Did you forget about the battle? The Ra Gada will drive these evil Elves from our lands for good. I am to fight at your side today, brother. Tell me you still feel up to it!\"\nPrince Sameer: \"Of course. I'm always ready for a fight.\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"Now there is the Sameer I know. Sometime you will have to tell me what has befallen on this last night. A story of wildness, I am sure. Come now though. Our father prepares to address the Ra Gada. He is expecting us.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I'm still a little foggy. I have some questions first.\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"Sameer, I am really starting to worry. Have you been ensorcelled? The year is eight hundred and fifty-three. Our father is King Xakhwan, come from old Yokuda to settle here in the Alik'r desert. I hope this is starting to sound familiar \u2026.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"Shouldn't a prince be afforded a little more respect?\"\nPrince Haqmir: \"Blade's edge! I'm sorry. You are the crown prince, but I am your brother and I was worried. Please. Tell me you're all right. I have been looking forward to this battle for weeks, but father will not let me fight unless you lead the way.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"Why must we fight the Elves?\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"Because they do not want us here. Our people came across the sea from old Yokuda to settle here, but these Elves\u2014the Corelanya clan\u2014they would drive us from these shores. We are making our stand today, letting them know we are here to stay.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I had a dream. Something about a tribe called the Ash'abah?\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"The Ash'abah? These people I do not know. Are they also Elves? If we must, we will kill them too. I need you to focus though, Sameer. Focus on the battle today. We should hurry to hear father's speech.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"All right. I am ready to go.\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"Praise the gods! It would not be proper if we were not present when father makes his speech. He is very likely starting to worry about us himself.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"Then let us keep him waiting no longer.\"\nAfter listening to King Xakhwan's speech:\nKing Xakhwan: \"You look strong, Sameer. My heart is proud. I believe this will be a day of destiny for you and your brother. If we wish to remain here, we must cleanse the land of these Elves' taint.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I'm sure we will be victorious.\" \nKing Xakhwan: \"Yes, and much of the glory for this victory will go to you and your brother. I send you forth as my champions, to slice through the Elves' ranks and find their leader. You will cut off the snake's head and then the body will wither and die.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"You want us to go ahead of the soldiers?\" \nKing Xakhwan: \"Yes. It is a great honor, and a great responsibility. But you have proven your valor time and again, Sameer. I know you will succeed and clear the way for our people's future. Go now, and go with the gods, my son. You have my blessing.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I will go and fight today in your honor, father.\"\nUpon returning to the palace:\nVizier Yeqdah: \"You are too late, Sameer. Your father is dead. Even worse, some Elven necromancer \u2026. He turned your father into an abomination!\"\nPrince Sameer: \"What do you mean?\" \nVizier Yeqdah: \"The necromancer slew your father and then reanimated his corpse. It is the most terrible thing I have ever seen. He is lost. There is nothing to be done for it.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I can't just abandon him. I have to do something.\" \nVizier Yeqdah: \"Sameer \u2026 you must not go in there! You would have to strike down your own father! As darkly as these events have transpired, our laws remain sacred. Your father is honored dead. Harm his remains and you dishonor yourself!\"\nPrince Sameer: \"So you would just have us flee?\" \nVizier Yeqdah: \"Yes. There is no other choice to be made. I know your father would not want us to abandon our new home here, but he could not have foreseen this. He would not have us break the sacred law. You must not even consider such a thing.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I'll have to think about it.\"\nAfter speaking with &lt;a href=\"Vizier%20Yeqdah\"&gt;Vizier Yeqdah&lt;/a&gt;:\nIf the Vestige, as Prince Sameer, chose to slay King Xakhwan themselves, they will have these conversations with Prince Haqmir and Vizier Yeqdah afterward:\nPrince Haqmir: \"It is done, then? I would not have such courage. In my mind, you are a hero for what you have done.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I was just doing what was right.\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"No. You deserve to be honored for your actions, but the vizier says that by law, you must be exiled instead. I-I don't know what to do \u2026.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"It is all right, brother. I accept my sentence.\" \nPrince Haqmir: \"Your courage \u2026 your humility \u2026. You should be king, not I! I'm sorry. I suppose I must stop acting like a child and accept my responsibility. Whatever happens, though, your sacrifice will never be forgotten. I love you, my brother.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I love you too, Haqmir, and it's all right. True honor need not be named.\"\nVizier Yeqdah: \"Why, Sameer? Why? You have broken the most sacred tradition of the kingdom! Nothing can justify such sacrilege. The law is clear, Sameer. Exile. You must leave here now and never return.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"I accept my sentence.\" \nVizier Yeqdah: \"Good. Then there is nothing more for us to discuss. Let us hope your brother learns to listen to my counsel and to make better decisions than you have.\"\nPrince Sameer: \"He will make a fine king. Counsel him well.\""}

Its study has long languished due to its inherent perils, for summoned entities, particularly the more intelligent &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, resent being brought to &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; to do another's bidding, and often seek to do the conjurer a mischief.\nThe notable success I have had in formulating safe and reliable conjuration spells comes from my system of defining such magics as always having two essential and interlocking components: a summoning incantation and a binding rune. It is the latter part, of course, that protects the conjurer from the entity or item summoned by enthralling it to the summoner.\nHeretofore conjuration has been quite a dangerous pursuit due to the fact that a conjuring wizard had to cast summoning and binding as two separate spells, and if the binding was miscast or cast too slowly, the conjurer might pay for the error with his life. My innovation has been to interweave the magics of summoning and binding so that they become one spell that manifests both effects simultaneously, thus ensuring that what is summoned is also necessarily bound.\nThe apprentice is urged to apply himself diligently to study of the spells in the accompanying grimoire: though my methods have rendered conjuration less perilous, it is by no means an art to be attempted lightly and carelessly. The apprentice who does so will only briefly be a burden to his or her master."}

As acting guildmaster, I've called on the Thieves Guild to do something about it.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"Forever%20Hold%20Your%20Peace\"&gt;Forever Hold Your Peace&lt;/a&gt;,\" speak with &lt;a href=\"Andarri\"&gt;Andarri&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Den%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thieves Den&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that Silver-Claw is looking for you in the Den. \nYou will find Silver-Claw in the library. He will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt; are preparing to move out of &lt;a href=\"Abah%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Abah's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, and that they will take &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt; with them to &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt; to have her stand trial. The chaos of their departure will provide the perfect opportunity to sneak into &lt;a href=\"No%20Shira%20Citadel\"&gt;No Shira Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and rescue the guildmaster. First though, you must get the rest of the thieves guild on board. \nSpeak with &lt;a href=\"Velsa\"&gt;Velsa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Walks-Softly\"&gt;Walks-Softly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quen\"&gt;Quen&lt;/a&gt;. They will each offer their particular talents to aid in this rescue mission. Once everyone knows what to do, take the note on the table titled \"Evidence of Nicolas's Treachery\" and head out. \nHead out to the road northwest of No Shira Citadel to meet up with Quen. She will already have scouted the citadel for entry points. The Iron Wheel are no loner patrolling the exterior, and a distraction Velsa caused at the main gate has caused them to pull their guards to that area. Quen has also found a ga in the wall on the southwest side of the citadel, guarded by a single soldier. She will tell you to meet wit Walks-Softly there. \nHead to the gap and speak with Walks-Softly. He has a plan to get past the sentry and to acquire his uniform. The guard is constantly looking inside the citadel waiting on a drink, so Walks-Softly intends to pose as a drunk Argonian and offer the man a sip of his drink, spiked with sleeping potion. This plan works without a hitch, so you can now get inside. Speak with Walks-Softly there and he will tell you to head to the part of the ruins where Chief Inspector Rhanbiq entertains his guests. There, you should try to discover where they are holding Zeira. You should also drop off the evidence against &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt;, so that it can be used in his trial. \nRhanbiq's office is in the far east of the ruins. Once there, you will find not Rhanbiq but Magnifica Falorah. She does not believe Nicolas's claims that the raid on &lt;a href=\"Al-Danobia%20Tomb\"&gt;Al-Danobia Tomb&lt;/a&gt; was Zeira's plan all along; if you give her the evidence, she will tell you where to find Zeira. Zeira is in the dungeons below; Magnifica Falorah will guide you to the entrance. Stay close to her, and the Iron Wheel should leave you alone. \nAt the entrance, she will tell a disguised Walks-Softly to open the door. Head inside with him; he will tell you to go on ahead while he waits for the others. Proceed onward to the central hallway; this is where Nicolas's cell is. He will offer to tell you Zeira's location in exchange for a single lockpick, but before you can decide on whether to take this offer, your friends Walks-Softly, Quen and Velsa will arrive. You can talk to them about the situation to get their advice. \nIf you decide to hand Nicolas the lockpick, . If you do not give him a lockpick, you should head on to the warden's office, which is the western of the two northernmost rooms. Here, you will find detailing where Zeira is located and where they are transferring her. You will learn from this document that she is on a prison ship, waiting to be shipped off to Taneth. \nThe entrance to the harbor can be found by leaving the dungeons through the northeastern exit. To get into the ship, you can either pick the lock or you can get the key off &lt;a href=\"Private%20Brand\"&gt;Private Brand&lt;/a&gt;'s table, though this will likely mean you have to kill Brand. Either way, head belowdecks; you can find Rhanbiq and an imprisoned Zeira here. Talk to Rhanbiq to distract him so your thives guild friends can surround him; Velsa will knock him out. Once he has been dealt with, free Zeira and talk to her. \nZeira will thank you and everyone for freeing her, but the Thieves Guild's work is not yet done. The ship is loaded with contraband, and Zeira wants to steal all of it. That is no concern of yours though; leave the ship, then find a rowboat to the north to make your way back to Abah's Landing. Once there, head to the Den and talk to Zeira to finish the quest."}

If he succeeds, reality itself could be in danger.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, you will encounter a man named Galsa-Baru, who has a message for you from Leramil the Wise. There is a door in &lt;a href=\"Apocrypha%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt; that must not be opened lest all of reality unravel, but a &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Torvesard\"&gt;Torvesard&lt;/a&gt; is determined to open it. Galsa-Baru will tell you to meet with Leramil in the Outlaws Refuge. \nHead to the outlaws refuge. Here, you will find Leramil talking to &lt;a href=\"Fa-Nuit-Hen\"&gt;Fa-Nuit-Hen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bazrag%20gro-Fharun\"&gt;King Bazrag&lt;/a&gt;. Speak with her and she will tell you what is going on. Torvesard once served a Daedric Prince named Ithelia, but &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; has wiped Ithelia from everyone's memories, both mortals and immortals. However, Torvesard has uncovered two glyphics restoring his memory of Ithelia, and is determined to find a third glyphic to learn why and how she was locked away. Leramil will then share with you the ability to perceive the threads of fate and give you an item called the Echonir, which will allow you to see memories related to Ithelia. \nHermaeus Mora has sensed Torvesard's activity in three places: &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;. Leramil will open portals to these places for you. Once there, follow the glowing green threads of fate. \nIn Reaper's March, you will end up in the southern part of the city of &lt;a href=\"Dune%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, at the Temple of the Two Moons Path, where you will find a big cat named &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ri%27jhaad\"&gt;Old Ri'jhaad&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that you need the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; to find what you seek. Head into the shrines of Jone and Jode here on the temple grounds, then head back to the cat. He will take you to the spot where you can use the Echonir to view the memory. You will see a memory of soldiers sent by &lt;a href=\"Rid-Thar-ri%27Datta\"&gt;Rid-Thar-ri'Datta&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the temple being defeated by &lt;a href=\"Boethra\"&gt;Boethra&lt;/a&gt; faithful. Talk to Ri'jhaad about this and he will tell you that the Boethra faithful were mostly wiped out in the days of the &lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, but some of them held on in &lt;a href=\"Do%27Krin%20Monastery\"&gt;Do'Krin Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you to head there to continue your mission.\nDo'Krin is in southern Reaper's March, just north of the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Maw of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. The place is overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Cult\"&gt;Stonefire Cult&lt;/a&gt;, so take care. Head inside and follow the threads of fate to the northern room. There, you will find Leramil the Wise, as well as a portal to a Shrine of Boethra. Head through and proceed ahead, and you will witness Torvesard stealing Boethra's sacred sword, claiming he will use it to free Ithelia. Torvesard will then head out through a portal. Speak with Leramil and she will open portals to Stonefalls and Grahtwood, if you have not visited these places yet. \nIn Grahtwood, the threads of fate will lead you to the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Reliquary of Stars&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, you will meet a man named &lt;a href=\"Beragon\"&gt;Beragon&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt;. He is tracking a group called &lt;a href=\"the%20Recollecion\"&gt;the Recollecion&lt;/a&gt;, who have found a hidden shrine behind the waterfall here. He will agree to help with Torvesard if you agree to help with the Recollection. Head north into the main room and look behind the waterfall there to find a hidden door. This will lead you to a place called the Moonshadow Shrine; you will be facing the Recollection throughout these halls. At the end, you will find a shrine, where the Recollection leader &lt;a href=\"Endegor\"&gt;Endegor&lt;/a&gt; is waiting for you. He will say that Torvesard knew you would be here, but that this place does not have the relic Torvesard wanted. Endegor will then attack you; once you brin him to low health, he will transform into a giant &lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurcher&lt;/a&gt;, so you will have to deal with that. After Endegor has been dealt with, Beragon will notice \"&lt;a href=\"Endegor%27s%20Orders\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt;\" on the ground. It will tell you that Torvesard is looking elsewhere for the Lamp he wanted. Talk to Beragon about this and he will suggest you use your Echonir over by the altar. You will see a memory suggesting the lamp was moved to a cave to the north. At this point Leramil will show up; talk to Beragon and he will tell you he will continue to hunt the Recollection in the West Weald. Speak with Leramil hereafter and she will open portals to Reaper's March and Stonefalls, if you have not yet visited these places. \nIn Stonefalls, the threads will lead you to &lt;a href=\"Mephala%27s%20Nest\"&gt;Mephala's Nest&lt;/a&gt;. Follow them through the dungeon to a trap door in the northern chamber. This will lead you to a Shrine of Mephala. In this abandoned shrine, you will find a book titled \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Dance%20Along%20the%20Webs\"&gt;A Dance Along the Webs&lt;/a&gt;\". This book describes theMephala faithful's fear of the rising ALMSIVI temple. After reading it, Leramil will suggest using the Echonir to examine memories related to it. You cannot use it on the actual book; instead, head back to the ritual circle and use it there. You will see cultists discussing using something called the Skein of Secrets, which is accessed through a secret portal. The portal opens by spilling a bit of blood on the circle. Do this, then head through to the Sanctuary of Whispers. You will find Torvesard here, but no item. Talk to Torvesard and he will tell you why he is doing what he is doing. Long ago, Hermaeus Mora conspired with other princes to remove Ithelia and stop her from changing fate. Now Torvesard seeks to restore his prince using the very tools the princes once used against her. Speak with Leramil after this and she will open portals to Grahtwood and Reaper's March, if you have not yet visited these places. \nAfter you have visited all three sites, Leramil will point out that the artifacts Torvesard sought to obtain belonged to the three Good Daedra of the Dunmer faith. She will suggest meeting with an expert on ancient Dunmer religion, and will open a portal to Vvardenfell. Head through to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shrine of Auzra&lt;/a&gt; and speak with Curate Gadayn there. He will not know much, but will suggest that you visit &lt;a href=\"Holamayan%20Monastery%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Holamayan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; up north. The door to the monastery will be closed, but the abbott will come through a portal to greet you, as he knew you would be coming. Talk to him and he will give you permission to peruse the libraries here; follow him through his portal and head to the library. In the library, use the Echonir and you will see three ancient priests handling a book. That very same book, \"&lt;a href=\"Testament%20of%20Dandera%20Helas\"&gt;Testament of Dandera Helas&lt;/a&gt;\", will then appear on the table. Read it; it will describe how three priests gave their lives at a certain shrine to open a path for their princes to convene with Hermaeus Mora. \nTalk to Leramil about this and she will speculate that Torvesard thinks he can open the way to Mora's realm using the same shrine the priests used. She will suggest looking for the shrine, though she does not know where to start. She will suggest asking the priests in the monastery what they know. The priest you are looking for is &lt;a href=\"Nias%20Othralas\"&gt;Nias Othralas&lt;/a&gt;, in the westernmost room. He will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Inevitable%20Secrets\"&gt;Shrine of Inevitable Secrets&lt;/a&gt; was lost in the Merethic Era, but he will suggest that your Echonir can help locate it. It was supposedly located along the shores of &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. Head there and to the Daedric Ruins of Anudnabia. Once you arrive, Leramil will tell you to use the Echonir. You will see the priests allowing their princes to possess them, after which they waded into the water. Talk to Leramil about this and she will state that the shrine must have sunk underwater. She will craft a spell that will allow you to walk on the seafloor to reach the shrine. \nEnter the sea, and start searching the seafloor for the shrine. You will find it to your northeast. Head through the portal there into the shrine proper, in a demiplane. Torvesard and his Recollection have already reached the place; fight your way through some Recollection cultists to make your way to Torvesard. Once you reach him, he will use Boethiah's blade to open a portal into Apocrypha, which he will then pass through. Hermaeus Mora will show up once this has happened; speak with him and he will open the portal for you. Head into Apocrypha and pursue Torvesard. Make your way through to the Mythos Vault; you will have to face off against &lt;a href=\"Dexxiuk%20the%20Glass%20Mantikora\"&gt;Dexxiuk the Glass Mantikora&lt;/a&gt; here. Once Dexxiuk is dead, proceed on through the portal to the Glyphic of Shattered Reflections to pursue Torvesard. You will be too late; Torvesard will reach the memory, and you and him will learn what happened to Ithelia. \nTorvesard will deduce how to free his prince, and will go through another portal. Pursue him through the portal and then into Ithelia's prison. Torvesard will find the prison empty; talk to him and he will suggest that Ithelia escaped by herself the moment he started remembering. He will then depart to go look for Ithelia; head back to the Mythos Vault to speak with Hermaeus Mora there. He will confirm that Ithelia is free. This place was never her prison, being forgotten was. The end of the world can still be prevented however. Mora will suggest you speak with Leramil the Wise. She will suggest returning to Grahtwood and consulting with Beragon, and will open a portal there. Head through, then speak with her again to finish the quest."}

Talking to either one will reveal to you that a grand total of four soldiers were captured by the bandits. If you spoke to Talania first, she will tell you that she will not be long for this world, and that Eliana is here in the same room. Find Eliana in the northwest, and she will confirm that the other two guards are also still alive. Free Eliana, then start looking for the others. \nYou will find Veranus in a small room along the hallway to the southeast. He will be trapped in a magical force field; he will speculate that lighting the braziers around the room will dispel the barrier. There are three braziers, but they will only stay on for a limited time, so take care not to be slowed down too much by the bear traps in the room. Once they are all lit, Veranus will be able to escape. \nProceed ahead into the storage vaults. You will hear Decanus's voice coming from a pit below the path. Head down and you will find yourself in a crocodile lair; Decanius has managed to stay away from the beasts by getting the high ground. Speak with him and he will tell you about the birthsign panels on the walls ahead. They are the key to getting out of here; there is \"&lt;a href=\"An%20Unexpected%20Defense\"&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt;\" on the ground there next to a skeleton that will give you the right combinations. The right order to press the panels is Thief - Tower - Mage. After entering the combination, use the lever to escape the room, then head out of Fort Sphinxmoth. Talk to Eliana outside to finish the quest."}

The bottom of the cavern has an opening to the Iliac Bay, and an open area where the cavern meets the sea. The Caves are vast and sprawling across the underground. The entrance itself is practically invisible, containing a wooden door leading to the stone hallways underneath. It was likely an ancient stronghold to Daggerfall until it was sunken into the ground. There is a large hall with a massive staircase and a throne on the top, likely where the leader of the hold sits and watches over the area.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrivateer's Hold was populated by pirates hiding out in the Kingdom of Daggerfall, being insignificant to the residents of the region.

One such &lt;a href=\"The%20Agent\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; had crash landed on the coast of Daggerfall, during a harsh storm, washing up on the shores of the lower caverns in Privateer's Hold. The Agent was barely able to escape the bandit stronghold but was able to escape nonetheless, rendezvousing with &lt;a href=\"Brisienna%20Magnessen\"&gt;Brisienna Magnessen&lt;/a&gt; in a tavern somewhere in the Kingdom of Daggerfall. Lord &lt;a href=\"Naigon%20Strale\"&gt;Naigon Strale&lt;/a&gt; was an Ambassador sent to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Wayrest\"&gt;Kingdom of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt; that suffered a similar attack like the Agent, where a wall of water attacked his ship in the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. He felt suspicious about this and traveled to Wayrest to learn more. However, in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, he learned that the forces of Wayrest and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; waged war against each other around &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;. These events were tied with the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt; that occurred in the same year."}

There are a small amount of hidden doors including the first one, some of these will be opened by enemies, which reveals the location of the secret door.\nOnce the room pictured above is reached, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; must ascend the stairs and pull a lever to the left of the throne. They will have to do this while standing on the throne as it is raised upwards when the level is activated. This serves as a shortcut to the part of the dungeon which must be reached to get to the outside.\nPrivateer's Hold serves as a good way to level up a couple or ranks (if the enemies are killed, not avoided, or by simply resting). The exit of Privateer's Hold is, like all &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; exits, a stone arch and skulls within. There is also plenty of &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; to be gained."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; arrives at the dungeon, a brief tutorial on game mechanics is given if the tutorial prompt is accepted. Based upon the choices made in &lt;a href=\"Character%20Creation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;character creation&lt;/a&gt; and how the background questions were answered, certain &lt;a href=\"Classes%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; are received.\nBackground.\nA popup at the beginning of the quest reads as follows:\n\"You wake and look around the room. Some hours ago, you were in a boat, en route to Daggerfall, when a storm of supernatural strength boiled over the lilac Bay like a malefic creature. Your boat was destroyed, but you managed to swim through the churning water to a promontory rock. There you found a cave and escaped the fury of the storm. You had only just lit a small fire when a mudslide sealed you within. Your fear of being buried alive calmed when you saw the corridor leading out of the cavern. Perhaps there is a way out of this cave after all.\"\nThe Emperor has tasked the Hero with putting the Shade of King &lt;a href=\"Lysandus\"&gt;Lysandus&lt;/a&gt; to rest. While traveling to Daggerfall via a ship, a storm came and the Hero had to abandon the ship, swimming into a nearby cave. As the Hero made a fire, a mudslide blocked the exit. However, a passage was found inside the cave.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen the tutorial is first started, the Hero will be facing a wall. Turn around (Right and Left Arrows), and walk (Up Arrow) towards the corridor in the back. From there, take a turn to the left. Open the door by clicking it, then draw a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; and kill the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Rat%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;. There will be a chest containing &lt;a href=\"Gold%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;random loot&lt;/a&gt; in the room. To the left of the door will be a stairway, to which the Hero will have to travel up and follow the corridor. It is recommended to avoid the first door on the right, however, as there will be an &lt;a href=\"Imp\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt; inside which will kill the Hero at lower &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;. Continue passing the doors, and one will come up to a stairway. Walk up the stairs and take a right, then enter the room and kill the &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;. Then, go through the door to the right of the one initially entered. This will bring the Hero to the main chamber.\u00a0\nA &lt;a href=\"Bats\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; will approach the Hero, which will need to be slain. Afterward, one has two options: go up to the top of the stairway and kill the &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Warrior%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Skeleton Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, then jump onto the throne and hit a lever which will bring one to the , or go to the left of the stairway to the top of the room. There will be a hidden door between two torches. Open the door, and, after killing the bat, continue straight. This will lead the Hero into a stone tunnel. Go down the tunnel; there will be two doors to the right. It is recommended to not go near these doors, as there are two archers behind them who will ambush the Hero. Continue down the tunnel until a flight of stairs is reached. A door will be located to the right at the top of the stairs.\nThe door will open up to a ledge at the top of the main chamber. Proceed by going left, killing the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Rat%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt; at the slope that goes upwards. Afterward, go through the first door on the right. From here, one will be able to see the exit to the dungeon on the right wall. However, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Bat%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Giant Bat&lt;/a&gt; and a Rat towards the left, and an Imp further back. It is possible to either slay them and exit, or run straight towards the exit without fighting.\nFrom there, the Hero will need to &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;fast travel&lt;/a&gt; from Privateer's Hold and go to the city of Daggerfall. Shortly after arriving at the city, the Hero will receive a letter. This will then trigger the start of the next quest in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt;, \"&lt;a href=\"Instructions%20from%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Instructions from the Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

I saw a tall Elf gazing at me from the other side of the glass, his face warped by the curve of the sphere. He identified himself as &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and told me that I would live. He also told me that I had a son.\nThis came a surprise. I had no idea I was even pregnant. Apparently the factotums discovered the tiny, barely viable child while they rushed to stabilize my ruined body. In &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; his severe prematurity would have been a death sentence, but here the impossible seems effortless.\nI never had any intention of having a baby. Toting a child around while making war on the &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;i hardly seemed practical. But time and circumstance make fools of us all.\nI named him Marius\u2014after my paternal grandfather. I hope this journal will serve him well if I succumb to these injuries. He should know something of his heritage at the very least.\nDate: 15 Sun's Dusk, 1E 2712 (?)\nThe more I learn about the Clockwork City, the more it appeals to me. The &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt; provides few comforts. It's a dry and hard place\u2014full of strange machines and stranger people. Dark Elves mostly. I've met &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; before, of course, but these &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt; seem like a breed apart. They revere logic and innovation above almost anything else. Can you imagine? My fellow &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s always mocked me for my dedication to cold reason. \"Where's your fire, Luciana?\" As if there's no fire in rigorous thought.\nSotha Sil still checks in on me from time to time. I've never met another person like him. The apostles worship him as a god, but I get the sense that it makes him uncomfortable. He only occasionally makes eye contact\u2014not out of timidity, though. He's just always focused on something else. A device, or a book, or some other clockwork oddity. I ask him questions whenever the opportunity presents itself\u2014questions about the nature of this place, his motives, his history. I never get straight answers. Nonetheless, he seems to enjoy the back and forth. I get the sense that even here, surrounded by worshipers and loyal machines, he remains profoundly alone.\nThe apostles keep telling me that blasphemy is acceptable here\u2014even encouraged. But it seems like a belief without a backbone. My caretaker, Lector Marilia, was aghast when I told her about my conversations with the \"Clockwork God.\" For example, I asked Sotha Sil about those persistent rumors\u2014the ones about how he and the other Tribunes murdered &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Elf king. According to Marilia, the topic is strictly taboo. Even so, Sotha Sil answered my questions with a quiet grace that surprised even me.\n\"Why do you think things happen?\" he asked. I told him I didn't understand the question.\n\"Why are we sitting here talking? Why does young Marius exist? Why do I reign over this place, while you convalesce within it?\"\nI sat quiet for a moment, then replied: \"Because that's just the way it is.\"\nHis cold face melted into one of his solemn half-smiles. \"Exactly.\"\nI can't be sure, but it seemed like relief in his voice. His shoulders relaxed, his tone shifted\u2014he had the look of a man at peace with his sins. Soon afterward, he thanked me for the conversation and left the room in silence.\nI looked down at Marius, sleeping soundly in his brass crib. In that moment, things seemed to make sense. The Clockwork City finally started to feel like home."}

At least I think it's been a year \u2014 time moves so strangely here.\nIt wasn't an easy decision. In my heart, I've never stopped serving my liege, &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. But the conflicts of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; seem far away now. &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;; they all feel so distant\u2014so detached from everything that matters here. In the Clockwork City, labors matter. Logic matters. Order matters. As an apostle of Lord &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt;, I can make a real contribution. And I can honestly say, if anyone is worthy of supplanting Reman Cyrodiil in my heart, it's Sotha Sil.\nI struggled with the thought of worshiping him, initially\u2014mostly because he seems so uncomfortable with the idea. I worried that our conversations would cease, or that he would think less of me. Luckily, he seemed pleased when I told him the news.\n\"I can think of none better.\" he said. Then he knelt down beside Marius, and took his tiny hand. For a moment, he seemed very distant\u2014mournful almost. Eventually he whispered, \"Your mother is both mighty and wise. I am glad I found the two of you.\"\nI don't know why, but I blurted out, \"Why did you save us, anyway?\"\nSeht paused for a moment, then whispered, \"Because one day you will shine a light.\"\nBefore I could ask him what he meant, he vanished. Marius laughed at that. He never gets tired of seeing Sotha Sil dissolve in light. For my part, I felt a sense of unease. I hope I didn't offend him.\nDate: 26 First Seed, 1E 2721 (?)\nSomething is wrong. Marius collapsed again. According to the monitoring factotum, he grew weak and short of breath, then fell down just outside the Cloisters. This is the third time in as many weeks.\nAt first I thought he just pushed himself too hard. Nine year-old boys have a tendency to overexert, and he's always been a bit frail. But when I found him in his room, his face was pallid and there was a rattle in his voice. He asked me what was wrong. I told him I honestly didn't know. I'll take him to see the &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Factotum&lt;/a&gt; Medica tomorrow.\nDate: 9 Rain's Hand, 1E 2721 (?)\nAfter days of tests, the factotums and clinicians finally gave Marius a diagnosis: birth-related heart defect. Apparently, the circumstances of his birth (my ruined body, his severe prematurity, and the journey through the veil) caused some kind of hemorrhage, or twisting of the arteries. In Tamriel, he'd likely be dead already. Or rather, dead a second time.\nI asked for a prognosis, but the factotums refused to offer one, citing a wide range of potential outcomes. He could see thirty or he could die tomorrow. In either case, his life will be difficult and brief. I remain (uncharacteristically) optimistic. Lord Seht has mended worse injuries and brought people within a breath of passing back to life. Here in the Clockwork City, a defect like his can't possibly be terminal. I will petition Sotha Sil as soon as he emerges from seclusion.\""}

Marius's health continues to deteriorate. He spends most days in his room, studying or conducting his alchemical experiments. I'm pleased to report he has a rare gift when it comes to potions and tinctures. He loves to forage for reagents. Of course, finding living ingredients can prove difficult in the Radius. I restrict his adventures in herbalism to an hour a day. He resents me for it, but he's smart enough to know why he can't remain outside the walls of the fortress for long.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Factotums&lt;/a&gt; tell me that each passing day makes Marius's condition more serious. I hope that Lord &lt;a href=\"Seht\"&gt;Seht&lt;/a&gt; emerges soon.\nDate: 5 Second Seed, 1E 2724 (?)\nThree years and still no sign of Sotha Sil. The other &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt; tell me it could be decades or even centuries before he returns. Obviously, Marius and I don't have that kind of time.\nWe've settled into a comfortable routine nonetheless. While I attend to matters in the fortress and help tame portions of the Radius, Marius tinkers away with his flasks and alembics\u2014laboring for the glory of Sotha Sil. He keeps pestering me about limb replacement, saying that a brass hand could help increase accuracy during sensitive measurements. I keep telling him \"maybe next year,\" but I'm not sure how much longer that will work. He's strong-willed. Bull-headed even. Can't imagine where he gets that from.\nHis experiments continue to astound. To everyone's surprise, he invented a palliative that reduces his heartbeat to a quarter of its natural tempo without any obvious side effects. The factotums estimate it might increase his life expectancy at a commensurate rate. But again, nothing's certain. Direct intervention by Sotha Sil remains his best chance for recovery. If the Clockwork God doesn't come out of seclusion soon, I may have to take matters into my own hands.\nDate: 14 Sun's Dusk, 1E 2728 (?)\nMarius turned sixteen today. At least I think it's sixteen. Time inside the Clockwork City moves in mysterious ways. We celebrated with a trip to the top of the Clockwork Basilica. I had to carry him most of the way, as he doesn't have the stamina for long walks anymore.\nI'd never actually been to the top of the tower before. Sweeping vistas are meant for poets and lovers\u2014I am neither. I spend my days in the dusty streets and the lantern-lit hallways of the basilica\u2014shielded from the raw immensity of the city. But as I watched Marius marvel at Seht's bands sliding along the glass of the Celestiodrome, and the harsh desert of the Radius stretched out below, something moved inside me. I saw that this city truly is my home\u2014more of a home than &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; ever was. I see now that I will never return to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. I will live and die here in the Clockwork City.\nDate: 22 Second Seed, 1E 2730 (?)\nThings move quickly now. I found Marius slumped next to his alchemy table this morning\u2014barely responsive. I moved him to his bed, summoned one of our foremost clinicians and a handful of factotums to watch over him, and prepared for my journey into the Cogitum.\nThe more senior apostles urged me to reconsider, but patience is a luxury I can no longer afford. Only Sotha Sil can save Marius. If I can wake Lord Seht from his dreams, I know he'll do what's necessary to save my son. May Seht bless these honest labors. Time to go."}

I kept this journal for Marius's benefit, but he's gone now. Twenty years gone. Time supposedly makes things easier\u2014dulls the pain. But my grief is deeper now than it's ever been.\nBusyness. Order. These things help. I threw myself into my work\u2014marshaling the apostles into a stronger, leaner, more effective order. I cracked down on crime, published a treatise on Marius's alchemical experiments, focused on my spellcraft; but none of these accomplishments come close to filling gaping hole my son left behind.\nI never told anyone what took place in the Cogitum all those years ago. People are rightly afraid to broach the topic. Even now, twenty years later, my anger glows white-hot.\nBetrayal\u2014that's the only word I can think of. I forded through the Centralis as quickly as I could, destroying any hostile &lt;a href=\"Factotum%20%28Online%29\"&gt;factotum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fabricant%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fabricant&lt;/a&gt;, and mechanical trap that stood between me and Lord Seht. When I reached the Throne Aligned, I found &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; sitting on the stairs leading to his seat of power. He didn't even look up.\n\"I know why you're here,\" he said.\nI was so naive then, I smiled and rushed toward him like a child. \"Good!\" I cried. \"We have to move quickly. Marius is near to passing.\"\nBut Sotha Sil didn't stand up. He didn't even look me in the eye. \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"I cannot give you what you seek.\"\nI stumbled over my words, trying to understand what he was saying. I just repeated myself like an idiot, thinking perhaps that he hadn't heard me. \"Marius is dying. We have to get back to him as soon as possible!\"\nHe stood up and pursed his lips before speaking. \"I'm sorry,\" was his only reply.\nWe stood there in silence for what felt like an eternity. Eventually, I shook my head and whispered, \"I don't understand. My body was ruined and you healed me. It's only Marius's heart that needs mending.\"\nSeht approached, placed a brass hand on my shoulder and said, \"You misunderstand. It is within my power to heal Marius, but circumstances make it impossible. I grieve with you, Luciana.\"\nI looked up and there were tears in his eyes. I felt a great rage rise up within me. I reached for my hammer, and lifted it above my head just before Seht whispered a banishing word and sent me hurtling back toward the surface.\nMarius died two days later. Sotha Sil remains in the Cogitum Centralis to this day.\nThe other apostles offered the same trite consolations I used to give to the grieving parents of men who died under my command in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;. \"It was his time.\" \"He lived a good and honorable life.\" On and on. But in my heart, I will never forgive Sotha Sil. Never. I will remain a proctor of the apostles. I will always safeguard the city I love, and uphold the laws and traditions of the order. But my adoration for the Clockwork God has shriveled and starved.\nThis is my final entry. For any who choose to read this journal, know only this: Sotha Sil gives and takes without consultation or mercy. Do not mistake his interest for empathy. Do not mistake assistance for authentic acts of kindness. Some are saved, others are sacrificed. That's just the way of things in the Clockwork City."}

She became a soldier of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; and earned quite a name for herself during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;First Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;.

She was caught in a torrent of arcane energy, resulting in an explosion and bright light, mangling her body and sending her through the veil, where she eventually landed in the Clockwork City.\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; found her critically injured in the Radius, the outskirts of the city, and healed her wounds, replacing any unmendable parts of her body with robotic alternatives. When she asked him why, Sotha Sil told her \"Because one day you will shine a light.\" She discovered she was one month pregnant at the time, and later gave birth to her son Marius, named after her grandfather."}
