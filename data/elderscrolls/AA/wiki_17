The most basic form of heavy armor, both in cost and protection. Iron armor is very common and can be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; from the beginning of the game. The armor is worn by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; in the \"Skyrim\" official trailer, but instead of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Armor%20%28Armor%20Piece%29\"&gt;chest piece&lt;/a&gt;, he wears the &lt;a href=\"studded%20armor\"&gt;studded armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nIron armor is a rough, hand-forged set of heavy armor, in sharp contrast to the sleek, clean appearance of other armor sets. The standard set features a breastplate over a brown vest, plated gauntlets over fur gloves and thick greaves over heavy boots. The waist and legs are protected by more plating and a thick hide waistcloth. The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron helmet&lt;/a&gt; features two short horns, which are curled on female characters. The shield is a wooden round shield reinforced with iron. \nThe banded iron armor adds large pauldrons to the breastplate, along with a band of leather over its front. The shield becomes larger, and is now made entirely out of iron. \nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanted&lt;/a&gt; and unenchanted variants begin to appear throughout Skyrim at level 1. These locations include:\nVariants.\nBanded Iron.\nBanded Iron is a variant that is slightly stronger than standard iron armor and has a different style. There are only two pieces of this armor: &lt;a href=\"Banded%20Iron%20Armor\"&gt;Banded Iron Armor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Banded%20Iron%20Shield\"&gt;Banded Iron Shield&lt;/a&gt;. Both can be improved using &lt;a href=\"corundum%20ingot\"&gt;corundum ingot&lt;/a&gt;s rather than iron ingots.\nAncient Nord Armor.\n&lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nord%20Armor\"&gt;Ancient Nord Armor&lt;/a&gt; is a variant of the iron armor set and has identical base attributes, however it benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Smithing\"&gt;Daedric Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk, which vastly increases its armor rating when improved, making it comparable with some of the higher tier armors. It does not include a shield as part of the set.\nSmithing.\nIron armor requires no prerequisite &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Smithing&lt;/a&gt; level or &lt;a href=\"Perks%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;perks&lt;/a&gt; to forge. Pieces can be crafted at a &lt;a href=\"blacksmith%27s%20forge\"&gt;blacksmith's forge&lt;/a&gt; with the following components:\nRegular pieces can be improved at a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt; with an iron ingot and banded pieces with a &lt;a href=\"corundum%20ingot\"&gt;corundum ingot&lt;/a&gt;, however neither benefit from any Smithing perks.\nThis means armor cannot be improved past &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29%23Improvement\"&gt;flawless&lt;/a&gt; quality without boosting the Smithing skill over 100. This can be achieved by using &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Enchanting\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; items and/or &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing%23Potions\"&gt;blacksmithing potions&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Smithing\"&gt;Fortify Smithing&lt;/a&gt;."}

This elemental has the appearance of a great humanoid composed with large metal plates, highlighting the giant shoulders.

Once a flag has been captured it will display that team's color on the compass along with their color and symbol on the map itself and it will begin to generate points for the team. The more flags a team holds, the more points they will generate. When players try to take a hostile flag they must first diminish the flag to a neutral state, then build it up to their own, effectively doubling the time it takes to capture.\nWinning.\nWhen the match starts there are four flags on the map that must be captured by each team. Each flag starts out blank and white on the compass until captured by a team. The goal of the game is to reach win with the most points out of all three teams. This can be achieved in two ways, either by reaching the maximum score, or by having the most points when the 15 minute timer runs out.\nPost-match.\nOnce the game ends, a scoreboard will show everyone's kills, deaths, assists, damage dealt, health healed, and other medals earned through the match.\nTeams.\nWhen the match starts, the Vestige will be on one of three teams, Pit Daemons (Green), Fire Drakes (Orange), or Storm Lords (Purple). Each team's spawn is associated and surrounded by an aura with their color which acts as a barrier, only letting players of that team through."}

It has seen extensive combat in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Dominion Military preforms to duty of both protecting the citizens of the Dominion and representing the heritage of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i race, even the non-&lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; races of the Dominion. Only the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; can join the Dominion Military in &lt;a href=\"The%20Elder%20Scrolls%20Online\"&gt;The Elder Scrolls Online&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; gets no such chance despite the Dominion being present during the events of .\nUnits and strategies.\nStrategies and tactics.\nThe Dominion army knows, and makes use of, the phalanx formation. Individual Dominion soldiers are also known to use a combination of dirt tricks, subterfuge, and magic, according to the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nEach race is also known to use a variety of different tactics in one-on-one combat. The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; are known to attack from different sides or use &lt;a href=\"bows\"&gt;bows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arrows\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; to defeat their opponent. &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; use both their claws and tails to achieve victory. If disarmed, Khajiit will use their razor sharp claws to rip through light and medium armors, and they have even been noted to use their tails to hold knives and throwing weapons and use such weapons with deadly accuracy. High Elves are known to regularly use magic in combat to gain the upper hand, Daggerfall Covenant forces are told to close the gap to avoid being killed by magic.\nArms and armor.\nThe weapons and armor for the Dominion Military are standardized for all troops and deviations from the norms are not acceptable for military use. The design of the armor and weapons is very elegant and uses the Aldmeri Eagle quite a bit; according to &lt;a href=\"Aicantar%20of%20Shimmerene\"&gt;Aicantar of Shimmerene&lt;/a&gt; some even think that the eagle is overused.\nWeapons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt; used by the Dominion Military are as follows:\nArmor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; used by the Dominion Military is as follows:\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Three Banners War, the Dominion Military saw extensive use in both &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, where their forces were stretched thin by fighting &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; forces. Within the &lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Territory\"&gt;Dominion Territory&lt;/a&gt; fighting forces like the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Trooper\"&gt;Colovian Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s invading &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Cyrodiil, the Dominion Military fought several engagements with both the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; over several &lt;a href=\"fortifications\"&gt;fortifications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"towns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;towns&lt;/a&gt;. The war in Cyrodiil also extends into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; in which each of the alliances fight each other and the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; for control of the city. The Dominion and Legion also had several clashes in Cyrodiil during the conflict. The Dominion lost hundreds of soldiers in the Alliance War each fortnight.\nInside the Dominion, Colovian troopers from &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt; invaded the city of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Vile%20Manse\"&gt;The Vile Manse&lt;/a&gt;, and were even making headway to &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Village\"&gt;Vinedusk Village&lt;/a&gt;. The Colovian troopers were pushed out by Dominion Military forces and resistance fighters in Arenthia with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; increased their hold on &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; forces had several skirmishes with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but was quickly put down after the Empire stood united against them. While the Imperial Legion prepared for the invasion of Valenwood, Dominion forces were sent to probe the Imperial's defenses, but they were easily pushed back. In fact, they were so easily pushed back that the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20Soldier\"&gt;Imperial Legion Soldier&lt;/a&gt;s took to calling the Dominion forces \"Old Mary Dominion.\" The &lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Navy\"&gt;Dominion Navy&lt;/a&gt; however, fared much better in the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually the Empire resorted to using the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; and conquered the entire &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; sent Emperor &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; the heads of all the blades in the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and the Great War started the Dominion Military invaded both &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. All across the Empire, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces were pushed back time and time again. The Dominion Military quickly took the city of Leyawiin and cut off Bravil in Cyrodiil. Meanwhile in Hammerfell, the Dominion pushed the Imperials back across the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; in the now infamous &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Thirst\"&gt;March of Thirst&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe success of the invasion in Cyrodiil was surprising to the Dominion and the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. It was initially planned that the Dominion Military was to take Hammerfell and that Cyrodiil was just a distraction, but with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; within grasp the Dominion decided to invade the capital of the Empire. The Dominion pushed deep into Cyrodiil, taking the cities &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; with ease. The Dominion then pushed towards the Imperial City, surrounding the city on three sides. Fierce clashes between the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dominion%20Navy\"&gt;Dominion Navy&lt;/a&gt; occurred on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt;.\nSoon the Emperor and his armies were forced to fight their way out of the city. The Dominion, led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt;, took the city. Under Dominion rule the &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; was shut down for a period of time. All access in and out of the city was closed off. What happened inside the city is mostly unknown, but it is known that Naarifin attempted to cause &lt;a href=\"The%20Culling\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;, which nearly succeeded but was stopped by the hero from .\nAs the war went on, Imperial resistance stiffened in Hammerfell, but still the Dominion pushed on. The Emperor decided to invade the Imperial City as one last ditch effort. The Imperials withdrew forces from Hammerfell for support for the offensive on the Imperial City. The Imperials invaded, attacking from all three sides, and with great loss, took it back. The Great War then ended when the Emperor signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is and was one of the most powerful navies ever to set sail on the oceans of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion Navy has been used extensively in wars over the hundreds of years in its existence. From the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt; to the battles in the Alliance War, the Navy has been deployed all across Tamriel.\nAlliance War.\nDuring the Alliance War the navy fought several conflicts against the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Vipers\"&gt;Sea Vipers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; pirates that took advantage of the Alliance War by harassing the Aldmeri Dominion. Several Dominion ships are sunk by the Sea Vipers. Evidence of this is in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Cast%20Adrift\"&gt;Cast Adrift&lt;/a&gt;\" where the Sea Vipers used magical storms to sink the Dominion Ships. They also used scouting ships near &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTiber Wars.\nSometime in between the Alliance War and the Tiber Wars the First Aldmeri Dominion fell and the Second Aldmeri Dominion rose. The Second Aldmeri Dominion was an alliance between the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. When the Tiber Wars started the infantry forces of the Dominion are easily pushed back, but the navy held firm. They terrorized the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Bay\"&gt;Topal Bay&lt;/a&gt;. However, despite the navy's best efforts, eventually the Dominion fell to the Empire due to the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, and peace came to the Summerset Isles.\nWar of the Isle.\nAfter the Empire conquered the Second Aldmeri Dominion, the Summerset Isles still had war. In the year 3E 110, King &lt;a href=\"Orgnum\"&gt;Orgnum&lt;/a&gt; of the Maormer launched an invasion on the Summerset Isles that nearly succeeded. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Navy\"&gt;Imperial Navy&lt;/a&gt;, Summerset Isles Navy, and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; came together to defend against the Maormer. During the battle, a massive storm came in and destroyed the Maormer fleet and killed King Orgnum. The Psijics are credited for the creation of said storm.\nGreat War.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire was extremely weakened and some of the provinces began to break away. One of these provinces was the Summerset Isles. It went on to form the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and controlled the Summerset Isles, Valenwood, and the new states of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pellitine\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt;, which are formed from what used to be &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, war broke out between the Empire and the Dominion in a war known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;. One of the battles of the war was the Aldmeri campaign for the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Imperial and Dominion navies had epic clashes on &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; whilst massive ground battles occurred on &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; call it a &lt;a href=\"Hist\"&gt;Hist tree&lt;/a&gt; and their cold-blooded race can be driven into a berserk fury if it is attacked. The tree has something to do with their mating rituals and life-cycle, so that is understandable.\nBut avoiding their fury is the least of your worries. Damaging or destroying a Hist tree without a command-level order is expressly forbidden. In most mud-ridden, bug-infested, scale-skin settlements, the Hist tree is the only valuable resource worth taking \u2026 and it is very valuable.\nEach raiding party must include a contingent of sappers. Not wall-penetration specialists, but tree-sappers. Their weapons include tubes, pipes, drills, and portable distilleries. It is their job to recover as much \"&lt;a href=\"Hist%20sap\"&gt;Hist sap&lt;/a&gt;\" from these trees as possible. And, since the sap decays quickly, it is imperative each sapper crew be protected while the distillation process completes.\nFailure to recover Hist sap from each Argonian village means overall failure of the expedition, so be wary. The &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; does not tolerate failure."}

He says that Cunius, who lives in &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;, is a prominent and wealthy cult member, but has not donated anything yet. As he has an exculsive Imperial charter to exploit the rich &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; deposits of &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mine\"&gt;Caldera Mine&lt;/a&gt;, he must be very rich and giving away 500 should not be a problem. However, he has been avoiding the cult members and Iulus fears he will defer the matter indefinitely.\nWalkthrough.\nOnce in Caldera, the Nerevarine ought to ask around about Cunius Pelelius. The people in the village will refuse to give any information about him, regardless their disposition, claiming that it is more than their life worth to say something about such a rich man.\nCunius Pelelius himself resides at the &lt;a href=\"Governor%27s%20Hall\"&gt;Governor's Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Upon trying to convince him to donate the 500, he will postbone a meeting as Iulus Truptor had predicted. The other residents at the Governor's Hall have something to say about him, however. They hint that he has financial problems, and direct the Nerevarine to Olumba gro-Boglar to find out more. Olumba, who resides on an upstairs hallway, informs the Nerevarine that Cunius Pelelius is stealing raw ebony and sells it without paying the taxes, thus being guilty of smuggling. He proposes to ask the slaves at the Caldera Mine to find evidence, although he suspects it will be difficult to convince them to talk.\nTo get the salves inside Caldera Mine talking, the Nerevarine must raise their disposition. An elegant way of doing this is freeing the slaves with the helpf of the &lt;a href=\"Keys%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Caldera Slave Key&lt;/a&gt; that can be found inside the &lt;a href=\"Mining%20Guard%20Tower\"&gt;Mining Guard Tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20Mining%20Company\"&gt;Caldera Mining Company&lt;/a&gt;. The slaves will tell the Nerevarine that Cunius Pelelius is stealing and selling raw ebony from the mine, as he has financial problems.\nConfronted with this information, Cunius Pelelius will give in and hand the Nerevarine three pieces of raw ebony. They should sell it and bring the money to Iulus Truptor."}

By the end of the second, I found myself hopelessly lost. By the end of the fifth, I ran out of food. Now, as the sun sets on a full week of quiet misery, I cannot coax even a single drop of water from my canteen. It seems I will die in this place, surrounded by ghosts and prodigious stone gates.\nThese magic doors, how they mock me! Each whispers promises of escape, but in crossing their threshold, I find no sunlight\u2014only a bright void, then older, still-darker vaults. This &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; masonry is so stark. So solemn. While I shall die in the open, I nonetheless feel like I'm already entombed. Buried in a massive stone coffin.\nI do not die alone. The veil is thin here. So thin! I heard only whispers at first\u2014&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; whimpers, and Ayleid voices adrift on the wind. But by the third day, I saw them with my waking eyes: Ayleid ghosts, in all their garish splendor. They did not see me or react to my presence. They only went about their business, reenacting the events of their ancient lives. Some of these vignettes surprise me with their sheer banality. Others, however, feel rich with forgotten truth and arcane menace. Something terrible happened here\u2014to the Argonians at first, then the Ayleids later. Something in (or perhaps beneath) this ruin insists that I watch these events play out; insists that I apprehend the gravity of their consequences. Some force demands that I understand. This is why I die, I think. I fail to understand, and so I must remain.\nIf anyone finds this journal, pay careful heed to these ghosts. They tell the tale of some great Argonian prize. I only wish I had the insight to learn the deeper truths hidden within their words.\nEnough writing for now, I suppose. I see yet another gate nearby. Perhaps this one will lead me home. I just need to gather my strength. A few moments rest is all I need."}

Looking aroung the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; residence, they find a letter to Asteril's twin sister from Pelidil. The twin has been pretending to be Asteril. The Vestige finds her and discovers that the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Heritance&lt;/a&gt; plans to attack &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; with an army of &lt;a href=\"Maormer\"&gt;Maormer&lt;/a&gt; and undead.\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing \"&lt;a href=\"Veil%20of%20Illusion\"&gt;Veil of Illusion&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Fariel\"&gt;Treethane Fariel&lt;/a&gt; will ask you to head down and inspect &lt;a href=\"Asteril\"&gt;Asteril&lt;/a&gt;'s quarters with &lt;a href=\"Oromin\"&gt;Oromin&lt;/a&gt;.

Speak with Oromin and you will notice he cares more about the integrity of the Thalmor than about the fact that one of his soldiers has died. He will speculate that the person who killed Asteril is the same as the person who impersonated her to try and kill the Queen. \nWhile you were speaking with Oromin, &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; has found a secret passage behind a bookshelf.

Head through the tunnels to the old Imperial prison, then start looking for Laryaril.

There is a tunnel in the Ayleid ruins beneath the tree, which will lead behind Colovian lines. You are to head there and talk to Sergeant Herdor. \nReport to Herdor and she will tell you to head through the ruins with her, to take out the Colovians and protect the remains of Nendaer, the founder of the &lt;a href=\"Vinedusk%20Rangers\"&gt;Vinedusk Rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Head in and listen to Herdor's speech. &lt;a href=\"Glooredel\"&gt;Glooredel&lt;/a&gt; has prepared some admixture in the urn nearby; take it, then head on ahead. You will find that Glooredel and Herdor have incapacitated an enemy soldier; talk to Herdor and she will tell you that this soldier is refusing to talk. You are to sway her by blowing up a nearby crate of kindlepitch; either she talks or the tunnel explodes. Upon setting fire to the crates, the soldier tells you her commander is named &lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Festius\"&gt;Festius&lt;/a&gt;, and Glooredel promptly kills her. Talk to Herdor again and she will task you with heading on and causing havoc in the Colovian camp. \nHead on out of the cave and you will find yourself in the Colovian camp. Cause havoc here by burning all the tents and siege equipment you can find, then head into Nendaer's Tomb in the south of the area to seek out the enemy commander. He will be accompanied by soldiers named &lt;a href=\"Sabina\"&gt;Sabina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crispus\"&gt;Crispus&lt;/a&gt;, so take care.

Afterward, Jibhan challenged Dozzen to a race home. When a hillside trail narrowed, Jibhan got the better of Dozzen. Nearly home, Jibhan had victory in his sight, but looked back before the finish to see Dozzen was not behind him.\nDozzen had fallen down the hill, dashed against boulders. He was bleeding profusely. Pallid and breathing shallow, Dozzen said all he could remember was their triumphant musical competition.The townsfolk had declared no winner, but were inspired by the interwoven song.\nKnowing his end was near, he bade Jibhan vow to use his sinew to craft a new talharpa and use it to inspire the people to dance.

The letter is needed to locate the family members.\nContents.\nDear courier,\nI would like to thank you again for agreeing to assist me. I was so delighted when a friend recommended you, and will certainly employ your services again in the future if everything goes well with this round of purchases. You can imagine how difficult it is for an old woman such as myself to get around. My children, darlings that they are, deserve the best, and I'm afraid I haven't been able to properly show my love and appreciation for them in quite a few years. But all that is behind me now! Here is the list of gifts I think my family would most enjoy, as well each child's current place of residence, which should be used to for delivery.\n&lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Draconis\"&gt;Matthias&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Talos%20Plaza%20District\"&gt;Talos Plaza District&lt;/a&gt;, Imperial City (he has a home there): Matthias always was a rough and tumble lad. The last I'd heard, he'd fallen in with some pretty tough characters there in the Imperial City. I'd feel so much better if I knew he was well protected, so I'd like for you to find him a nice cuirass. Nothing too light -- iron or steel should be fine. And, if possible, I'd like it engraved with \"To my Dear Matty, I'll always be here to protect you, love Mum.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Andreas%20Draconis\"&gt;Andreas&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=\"The%20Drunken%20Dragon%20Inn\"&gt;The Drunken Dragon Inn&lt;/a&gt; (he owns the place and lives there as well): Andy has been brewing his own beer and spirits since he was six years old. The opening of that inn was the happiest day of his life. I'd like for you to get him some new tavern glasses. I'm sure there are craftsmen in the Imperial City who could make a fancy set from frosted ebony or &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt; crystal.\n&lt;a href=\"Sibylla%20Draconis\"&gt;Sibylla&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=\"Muck%20Valley%20Cavern%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Muck Valley Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, my daughter lives in a cave, and no, I'm not very happy about it. Sibby has always loved animals (almost as much as Andy loves beer) and a couple of years ago she apparently thought it a good idea to abandon the Empire and live as a savage with the rest of the animals. In that time, I'm afraid Sibby has kind of... cracked. She's basically as wild as the beasts she lives with. What can I do? I'm Sibby's mother and I'll always love her. She obviously doesn't want or need anything from civilized society, so what I'd like you to do is find a tanner and secure the largest fur blankets you can possibly find. The last time I saw Sibby she was nearly naked, and I can't imagine there's much in that cave to keep her warm. When you do bring them to Muck Valley Cavern, be careful!

By &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, not that! But she's settled into a more... practical kind of look. Even a bit boyish, I guess you could say. So what I'd like you to do is get my Cae as much pretty \"girl\" stuff as you can. Flowers, perfume, &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; chocolate, that sort of thing.\nYou've already received half your fee in advance, and will receive the remainder after the gifts have been purchased and delivered, as we originally agreed.

After many seasons of searching and investigation, I have come to the conclusion that the ancestor of my egg family led the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Ninth%20Legion\"&gt;Ninth Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Tsofeer%20Cavern\"&gt;Tsofeer Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s. That's where they all disappeared into history and became the Lost Legion.\nMany of the stories involving the Tsofeer Caverns mention a massive and powerful voriplasm known as the &lt;a href=\"Wuju-Ka\"&gt;Wuju-Ka&lt;/a&gt;. From what I could ascertain, this huge pool of malevolent slime behaves unlike other voriplasms. It creates extensions of itself, mobile puddles of ooze that remain connected to it in some manner, serving as its eyes, ears, and appendages\u2014its connection to the world outside its spawning pool. The elders I spoke to talked about the Wuju-Ka in reverent terms, but they were also clearly afraid of the creature. They said that in ancient seasons, elders from nearby tribes would go to the Tsofeer Caverns and perform a binding ritual to trap the massive voriplasm and its extensions inside the caves.\nThe binding ritual hasn't been performed in many, many seasons. Not since a rock slide sealed the entrance to the Tsofeer Caverns. I wonder if that was when the Ninth Legion was lost? Were they somehow trapped inside the caves?\nHere's what I learned about voriplasms. These slime creatures slither through the swamp, consuming whatever gets in their way. To spawn, they either split apart and form new voriplasms, or they turn consumed flesh into voriplasmic corpses. Voriplasmic corpses appear as skeletal bodies, the flesh melted from their bones and replaced with voriplasmic slime. These disgusting, shambling creatures have some connection to the voriplasm that spawned them, but not to the degree associated with the Wuju-Ka.\nOne elder was willing to teach me the binding ritual for the Wuju-Ka. At least, she taught me what the elders before her told her. I hope the Wuju-Ka no longer exists, but if it still occupies the Tsofeer Caverns, then I must perform the binding ritual before I leave the caves. I just hope I can also find proof of the Lost Legion and some evidence to exonerate my ancestor and clear the mark of traitor that has sullied my egg-family's name."}

They begin appearing in unscripted situations in the world once \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;\" is completed.\nAppearance.\nGeneric dragons are brown in color. They have yellow eyes and a pair of swept-back horns on their head, with a smaller pair where their ears would be. Their back is lined with small spikes, and their tails end in a diamond-shaped tip. Their wings are pale tan or white with frayed edges.\nGameplay.\nAerial.\nThis type of dragon will begin a fight by staying airborne, making sweeping dives or hovering in place to use its breath. A melee-focused character should find cover and stock up on healing items in case they get caught in a blast, as it can cut their health down quickly (&lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; is especially dangerous to melee fighters, as it cuts their stamina and slows their movement). When the dragon hovers or circles above, using a &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt; to chip away at its health can be effective.\nA magic-focused character may find combat with these dragons easier, as &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Ward%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lesser Ward&lt;/a&gt; can be sufficient to block or absorb a breath attack, if they have enough &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. Once it stops attacking, respond with spells: &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flames&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Firebolt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Firebolt&lt;/a&gt; for frost breath dragons, and &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Spike%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ice Spike&lt;/a&gt; for fire breath dragons, as they take more damage against the opposite type. This may not be effective at long range.\nGrounded.\nWhenever the dragon lands, either run up and use melee attacks, or attack it with spells from a distance. Stay away from its head, as it will continually bite or breathe fire or frost, which can easily be fatal. However, even when it is not facing the Dragonborn, the dragon can still beat its wings or swing its tail to deal substantial damage. \nOnce the dragon falls below half-health, it can no longer maintain flight and will crash to the ground. If one is a melee-focused character, strafe around it and keep attacking, dodging when necessary. Power attacks and shield bashes will stagger the dragon and cancel its attacks. It can also be easier to climb atop a high vantage point\nIf the Dragonborn is a mage, &lt;a href=\"Oakflesh\"&gt;Oakflesh&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stoneflesh\"&gt;Stoneflesh&lt;/a&gt; can be beneficial. Strafe around the dragon, continually firing the appropriate spell, and pausing when necessary to heal or let magicka regenerate. Wards can be very useful here, especially with the Ward Absorb perk, which will completely refill magicka with a single breath attack."}

The Ancient Dragonborn is capable of using multiple shouts such as &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Breath\"&gt;Frost Breath&lt;/a&gt; and is garbed in a full set of ethereal &lt;a href=\"Dragonplate%20Armor%20%28Armor%20Piece%29\"&gt;Dragonplate Armor&lt;/a&gt;.

The recharge time associated with this only affects the amount of time that must pass before another shout can be used. The effects of this shout last for 300 seconds."}

{"id": "5982", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=5982", "title": "Dragon Break", "text": "A Dragon Break, sometimes referred to as an un-time, is a temporal phenomenon that involves a splitting of the &lt;a href=\"Timeline\"&gt;natural timeline&lt;/a&gt; which results in branching parallel realities where the same events occur differently, or not at all. This results in a return to the non-linear timeline of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of a Dragon Break, the timeline reconnects making all possibilities and outcomes truth, though contradictory to each other. \"Dragon\" in the name refers to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon God of Time.\nDragon Breaks are utterly incomprehensible to all people they affect, save for a select few supernatural individuals such as the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Shezarrine\"&gt;Shezarrine&lt;/a&gt;. After being affected by a break, most people are prone to forget the event ever even occurred, dismissing it off as nonsensical, despite intense feelings of spiritual anguish they cannot account for. More recent records note entire days being lost without anyone taking notice. It is known, in some extreme cases, that even the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; were incapable of looking back on the events of the break. The Blue Star &lt;a href=\"Mnemoli\"&gt;Mnemoli&lt;/a&gt; is often associated with un-time events and, according to some sources, could be seen brightly in the daytime sky during the Middle Dawn. It is also known that every time the Brass God, &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, is activated, a Dragon Break ensues. Despite the believed effects Dragon Breaks have had on history, many scholars have been known to dismiss the Dragon Break phenomenon as a falsehood.\nOccurrences.\nThe Time-Wound.\nWhether or not the &lt;a href=\"Time-Wound\"&gt;Time-Wound&lt;/a&gt; should actually be considered a Dragon Break is arguable; due to the event being described as shattered time, it is normally speculated to have been a break of smaller proportion. The Time-Wound was formed in the later years of the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, during the legendary &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. At the peak of the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, the first of the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt; attempted to slay the Dragon-God, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of the mortal-made shout known as \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonrend\"&gt;Dragonrend&lt;/a&gt;.\" The three tongues were unable to defeat Alduin and instead turned to other means to end the World-Eater's reign of terror. The eldest of the three, &lt;a href=\"Felldir%20the%20Old\"&gt;Felldir the Old&lt;/a&gt;, had brought an &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Dragon%29\"&gt;Elder Scroll&lt;/a&gt; with him, and he utilized its mysterious powers alongside the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; to banish Alduin. The actions of Felldir created a small wound in time in the location where Alduin vanished, where it would remain until the present. This event has altered the Throat of the World in such a way that it has been said that its peak is no longer fully present within the world. It is possible that if the Time-Wound was indeed a Dragon Break, it may have been responsible for the lack of knowledge regarding the period in which the Dragon War took place.\nThe Red Moment.\nThe Red Moment was a possible Dragon Break that occurred sometime near the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20668\"&gt;1E 668&lt;/a&gt;, during the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The Red Moment is believed to be the first Dragon Break to be caused by the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, being the accepted date of the Brass God's first activation. Evidence of this Break's existence can be seen in the multiple conflicting accounts of what actually occurred during the time period in which the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt; took place. \nMost historical contradictions surrounding the event revolve around the people most involved in the war, such as &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voryn%20Dagoth\"&gt;Voryn Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;. Notable questionable events with inconsistent outcomes can be observed, such as whether or not &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; was loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; during the battle; whether Dagoth Ur was slain or dispelled by either the Tribunal or Nerevar; whether Nerevar, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, or Dagoth Ur were the ones to slay Dumac; and if the disappearance of the Dwemer were due to actions taken by &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, Dagoth Ur, Wulfharth, or the Tribunal. \nDid Nerevar die of his wounds or was he murdered by the Tribunal? Were the Nords and Orcs fighting for their own reasons, or were they aiding the Dwemer? Nordic accounts even seem to imply that the Dwemer and Chimer were working together, while others imply the Nords were never there to begin with. Due to the Dragon Break, no one account of what happened at Red Mountain holds more truth than the other.\nThe first known person said to recognize and acknowledge that the Battle of Red Mountain was taking place during a Dragon Break was the Ash-King Wulfharth. During this Break, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; utilized the Hurling Disk to legitimize the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;'s divinity through &lt;a href=\"Mantling\"&gt;Mantling&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon%23The%20Reclamations\"&gt;Three Good Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec states that he purposely kept the two main contradictory accounts of what happened at Red Mountain, that of the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;, for the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to make their own conclusion.\nThe Middle Dawn.\nThe Middle Dawn was the longest Dragon Break in all of Tamrielic history, lasting 1008 years from its beginning in &lt;a href=\"1E%201200\"&gt;1E 1200&lt;/a&gt; till its end in &lt;a href=\"1E%202208\"&gt;1E 2208&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragon Break began after a fanatical sect of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt; attempted to remove specific aspects of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; they did not approve of, most notably the god's connection to the Elven Time-God, &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. The Arch-Prelate of the Selective, &lt;a href=\"Fervidius%20Tharn\"&gt;Fervidius Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, and his subordinates, used the prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;'s teachings and the previously assembled &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Towers\"&gt;Staff of Towers&lt;/a&gt; to reach a state of \"monothought\" and recognize that the Wheel sideways is a &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;Tower&lt;/a&gt;. They proceeded to dance upon the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; until time was made unstable and created the Dragon Break known as Middle Dawn, which broke the Staff of Towers into eight pieces again.\nThe Middle Dawn was a much more extreme occurrence than any other Dragon Break. The world slept through the disaster. Had it not been for the Emperor souls held within the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the entire event may have been forgotten, as even the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; were unable to look back at the time period in which the Middle Dawn took place. Most stories and texts that survived the Middle Dawn vary quite heavily on the events of what actually transpired during the Middle Dawn, normally conflicting on regards to certain people, regions, and wars. More unorthodox accounts make claims that the sun had changed color, that people birthed their own parents, that gods walked amongst mortals, that the Empire spread its reaches into the stars, and even stating that &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; became an egg. Of all the texts collected by the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; there are no concurrences, save for one point. Every account from across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; coincides on the fall of eight stars, and this constant was used to keep track of time. However, some &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; claim that they kept track of their days by looking upon the constant moons, which the other races did not have the 'sugar' to see. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; claim that &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; was protected from the effects of the break by the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, believing the eight stars represented each iniquity Lorkhan made clear to the world. Mnemoli was said to have burned so bright during the Middle Dawn, that she could be seen even in the daylight sky; this could possibly mean that Mnemoli was the reason for the reported changes in the sun's color.\nMany dispute the Middle Dawn's existence, crediting it as a result of the rise of eschatological &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;ic Cults during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; that were obsessed with the concept of \"&lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;ism.\" However, the existence of multiple primary sources, predating the Third Era, that note the events surrounding the Dragon Break seem to prove otherwise, as well as the inability of the Elder Scrolls to look back to that time period. Another debatable instance involving the Middle Dawn was whether or not it actually lasted the 1008 years that the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; claims it did, a number some believe to be arbitrary and unreliable. The Khajiit claim the same duration as recorded from the moons, but also seem to believe the Elder Council stole the \"1008 years\" from them to begin with.\nWhile it is normally accepted that the reason the Selectives created the break was to remove the aspects of Akatosh they viewed to not complement the newly founded Cyrodilic Pantheon, some people, most notably the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt;, believe that the Selectives may have had greater ulterior motives in creating the break. The King of Worms is quoted as saying, \"The Maruhkati Selectives showed us all the glories of the Dawn so that we might learn, simply: as above, so below.\" Whether or not the Selectives were successful in their main goal is unknown, as almost all records regarding their existence were destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; members of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; claim that they were responsible for ending the Middle Dawn; whether or not this is true is not certain.\nThe Tiber Wars.\nWhen the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; formed his peace treaty with &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; during the ending years of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, one of the conditions of the treaty was that the remains of the Numidium were to be put into the possession of the Empire. Tiber Septim gave his battlemage, &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, the task of studying the Numidium, learning whatever he could from the massive automaton. In doing so, Zurin discovered the reason why the Dwemer had built the construct in the first place and of the great power it potentially held as a weapon. Tiber Septim tasked the Blades with using a secret testing warehouse/laboratory near Rimmen. The massive warehouse, named &lt;a href=\"The%20Halls%20of%20Colossus\"&gt;The Halls of Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, was used by a group of battlemages led by Zurin Arctus to rebuild and test the Numidium. Zurin crafted an item known as the &lt;a href=\"Totem%20of%20Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Totem of Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; in order to control the Numidium. When the Numidium was first activated by utilizing the trapped soul of the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; held in the &lt;a href=\"Mantella\"&gt;Mantella&lt;/a&gt;, it caused a Dragon Break that would result in large portions of the region becoming inhospitable, being heavily contaminated with what was only called \"poisoned glow-rock,\" much to the spite of the native population. During the Break, Tiber Septim utilized the power of the Numidium to conquer the rest of Tamriel and purge all the royal families who did not vehemently support Tiber's reign. Due to the memory altering effects of a Dragon Break, this event is remembered by the inhabitants of Tamriel only in obscure legend. How long this break lasted is not known exactly, but it most likely lasted throughout the entire period Numidium was active, ending only when the Underking temporarily destroyed the great golem. According to some sources, another heavily hit area by the Break was the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i city of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, which was subject to a siege by Numidium, resulting in the city surrendering within an hour of the attack, but a battle that lasted from the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; until long into the Fifth Era, due to the Numidium's time-wrecking capabilities.\nThe Warp in the West.\nThe Warp in the West, sometimes referred to as the Miracle of Peace, or the \"Second Numidium Effect,\" was the most recent and well known of the Dragon Breaks. The break's origins trace back to the events of &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, when an &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Daggerfall\"&gt;unknown affiliate of the Blades&lt;/a&gt; acquired the Totem of Tiber Septim and was given the choice as to who the totem would be delivered to. After the reassembled Numidium was reunited with the Mantella and walked again, a Dragon Break was created, centering around the Blades agent's choice and splitting the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region into six, seven, or possibly eight separate timelines, all occurring simultaneously. While the actions of the Blades agent are believed to have taken place in &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, the actual break apparently did not occur until twelve years later in &lt;a href=\"3E%20417\"&gt;3E 417&lt;/a&gt;, more specifically the 10th of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt;, a day completely unknown and lost to all those who did not participate in the Numidium's battles. Despite some claims that the Warp only lasted a day, other sources seem to imply that it may have subtly lasted much longer than it is said to have. When the break began, six Numidiums were created as well as six Totems, each being gifted to different kingdoms or individuals; each of the four great warring-kingdoms of the Iliac Bay, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; were gifted Totems and waged war on each other with their respective Numidiums creating battles of incomprehensibly epic proportions. The Empire also gained control of the Numidium, using it to subjugate the Bay-Kings. Both the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;King of Worms&lt;/a&gt; gained possession of the Totem and Mantella; the Underking using them to grant himself death, and the King of Worms using it to make himself into a god. Some sources state that the Blades agent, in which the Warp centered around, may have been killed by the Numidium, however, the true fate of the agent is completely unknown.\nThe Break probably ended after the six Numidiums were either demolished by each other or the Underking, and resulted with the region being heavily transformed. The area, which had once been made up of over forty-four petty kingdoms, now encompassed only four equal-footed and well organized kingdoms, with Wayrest controlling the eastern coast of the Iliac Bay, Orsinium controlling the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinel controlling the Southern coast, and Daggerfall controlling the west. The Bay-Kingdoms remained part of the Empire, and stability was brought to the Iliac Bay. While the King of Worms did temporarily become a god, this aspect of the Dragon Break was eventually fixed by the Jills of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; and the God of Worms was returned to his mortal state. Some claim that the Warp in the West heralded the fall of the Empire, and certain sources even seem to imply that in a separate timeline, the Septim Dynasty may have even collapsed during the Warp.\nScholarly interpretations.\nThe Dragon Break is a controversial subject amongst the scholars of Tamriel. Opponents to the theory, most notably the author &lt;a href=\"Fal%20Droon\"&gt;Fal Droon&lt;/a&gt;, attribute the creation of the Dragon Break to the varying cults and sects that cultivated throughout the Third Era, all centralizing their religious ferment around &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s rise to power. The Dragon Break is therefore explained away as an excessive rise in eschatology surrounding Tiber Septim's mysterious &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, aided by academic error and continued through tradition and scholarly inertia.\nFal Droon points to the famed &lt;a href=\"Encyclopedia%20Tamrielica\"&gt;Encyclopedia Tamrielica&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"3E%2012\"&gt;3E 12&lt;/a&gt; as the foundation of the creation of the \"Dragon Break,\" citing the supposed \"one thousand and eight\" year reign of the Alessian Order, recorded within the book, as the main rationale behind the phenomenon. The Alessian's fanatical dogma and zeal led them to purge practically every historical text of the time that their order did not approve of, and with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, nearly the entirety of their own historical accounts were destroyed as well. This caused the presumed millennia long governance of the Alessian Order to become a complete historical gap that no one could account for. According to scholarly critics, this mystery in how such a prolonged Dark Age could ever exist went unexplained until the Lorkhan Cults of the Third Era began spreading the concept of the Dragon Break as the focal cause. Fal Droon states that the thousand and eight-year reign of the Order is, itself, inherently flawed, and that the scholars of the time were completely unaware of the \"&lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order%23Calendar\"&gt;Alessian year&lt;/a&gt;,\" that the Order recorded its years by the duration of their High Priestess' long vision trances. By Droon's calculations, the Alessian Order could not have lasted longer than 150 years rather than the 1008 stated in the Encyclopedia Tamrielica. However, Fal Droon fails to realize that the \"1008 years\" is associated specifically with the Middle Dawn and the Alessian Order actually lasted as long as 1970 years, outlasting even the Dragon Break period.\nArielle Woodhouse, a proponent for the Dragon Break, argued using various sketches of tapestries and paintings dating back to the later &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, that depicted the stars and constellations in different locations than they normally appear. However, others questioned the authenticity of the sketches given the extremely minuscule amount of paintings and tapestries that survived that period, and the claim that many were based off from copies of original works. Other arguments against the theory state that old &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; metal plates found in Orreries, dating long before the Dragon Break, depict the stars in roughly the same location as they are seen in the present, strongly suggesting the stars do not move. It is also proposed that the people of the time were merely ignorant of astronomy or used artistic freedoms when depicting the stars.\nThe Hurling Disk.\nThe Hurling Disk is a conceptual state of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;, while in a Dragon Break, which mortals can utilize to manipulate Aurbical entities or apotheosize, said to be \"hurled to reach heaven by violence.\" The concept relies on the representation of the Aurbis as a \"wheel\" which is held together by eight equally split spokes of chaos solidified by time, the stated gifts of the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;. When said spokes are removed, the Wheel becomes an unstable void, returning the Aurbis to the turbulent and timeless Dawn Era. The Wheel therefore becomes an axis for the original spirits of the Dawn, creating a strange mingling of magic from the solar and lunar spheres of the Aurbis. From this point, the Aurbis becomes indefinite and uncongealed, which in certain circumstances can allow for the now malleable universe to be re-shaped as desired. If such actions are taken, a whole new universe will materialize to legitimize said desires, while the old universe warps itself to accept them. As time sees fit to heal itself, the break will eventually come to an end with the Aurbis reformed into a universe that contains the amendments."}

If you were to travel to &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt;, then you will have to go through Dragon Bridge before heading into town. The main road goes through town and because of this, houses and &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;s are located on this stretch of road. A lumber mill is located on the southern end of town, and it uses the waterfall to work the mill.\nHistory.\nEarly Years.\nIn the area near modern-day Dragon Bridge, the Ancient Nords built a bridge resembling a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and this became a significant landmark in the area. Many people decided to settle near the bridge, and it formed the town of Dragon Bridge. The &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; skulls used in the bridge are thought to be either carved from stone or in fact the petrified remains of real dragons.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragon Bridge township existed in Skyrim in between the towns of Solitude and &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Side\"&gt;Markarth Side&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; had visited the town on their quest for a piece of the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe town of Dragon Bridge was under the control of the city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. The town provided lumber to Solitude with its lumber mill. Whoever had control of Solitude, they had control of the Haafingar region and Dragon Bridge. When &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Skyrim, the &lt;a href=\"Penitus%20Oculatus\"&gt;Penitus Oculatus&lt;/a&gt; had an outpost in Dragon Bridge.\n&lt;a href=\"Varnius%20Junius\"&gt;Varnius Junius&lt;/a&gt; of Dragon Bridge reported strange occurrences in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;Wolfskull Cave&lt;/a&gt; that has scared off people in Dragon Bridge. &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Jarl Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt; in Solitude took note of the incident and sent the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the cave. It was revealed that a group of &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, possibly from the &lt;a href=\"Horme\"&gt;Horme&lt;/a&gt; group of rebels, were resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, the Wolf-Queen of Solitude. The Dragonborn defeated the Necromancers and saved Dragon Bridge.\nIn Solitude, &lt;a href=\"Vittoria%20Vici\"&gt;Vittoria Vici&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated during her wedding by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim resulting in the Penitus Oculatus upping the ante with their defense. The Brotherhood was tasked to frame &lt;a href=\"Gaius%20Maro\"&gt;Gaius Maro&lt;/a&gt; by killing him and leaving an incriminating letter from him supporting the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.

When one is encountered (all are listed in the &lt;a href=\"Atlas%20of%20Dragons\"&gt;atlas&lt;/a&gt;, and marked on the hold maps), it will be in one of four states. Over the course of the main quest, these mounds gradually open, releasing the dragons trapped within.\nState I: Dormant.\nEach dragon mound opens in response to a specific objective in the main quest. Before that point, the dragon mound is dormant. The ground is covered, and the site could easily be mistaken for an ancient Nordic burial mound, as the two are quite similar.\nState II: Deserted.\nAs the main quest develops, some mounds will have been opened, but with no dragon nearby. That is, Alduin has visited this site, resurrected a dragon from the mound, and both dragons have flown away.\nState III: Awakened.\nAs the main quest goes on, more and more mounds will be found in this state. Alduin has visited the site, resurrected the dragon from the mound, and flown away. Meanwhile, the reborn dragon remains here, gathering its strength and waiting for a chance to strike.\nState IV: Resurrection.\nIn a few cases, if the right mound is stumbled upon at just the right time, Alduin may be encountered himself. If watched, Alduin will resurrect the dragon, then fly off to his next destination. Attack, and Alduin roars into the skies before making his escape (he cannot be killed). Meanwhile, the resurrected dragon will turn and attack. If this opportunity is missed, the mound will change to State III, with the newly resurrected dragon remaining near its mound until the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; arrives to challenge it. Stage IV mounds can be seen and identified from a distance due to Alduin flying around it. Do not stand on top of these mounds before the dragon emerges, as it can cause it to become stuck in the ground."}

{"id": "59646", "revid": "24124884", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=59646", "title": "Dragon Claws (Skyrim)", "text": "Dragon Claws are special &lt;a href=\"Miscellaneous%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;miscellaneous items&lt;/a&gt; found in that are primarily used to open ancient &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nordic&lt;/a&gt; puzzle doors.\nCharacteristics.\nEach claw is unique. Each one is made of precious gems and/or materials and can be very valuable. Most dragon claws are found in ancient Nordic dungeons, and will open at least one puzzle door in that dungeon. The puzzle door combination can be found on the underside of its corresponding claw. Zooming in on the claw in the Miscellaneous category of the Items menu will make the solution easier to see.\nHall of Stories.\nThese are large, open hallways with a puzzle door at the end. The walls of these hallways tell many stories, as the name suggests. One image seems to depict many &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; bowing towards an almighty &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nClaws.\nCoral Dragon Claw.\nThe Coral Dragon Claw can be obtained in two ways:\nDiamond Dragon Claw.\nThe Diamond Dragon Claw can be found during the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20World-Eater%27s%20Eyrie\"&gt;The World-Eater's Eyrie&lt;/a&gt;\" quest on a leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skuldafn%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skuldafn&lt;/a&gt;. Since it is impossible to go back to Skuldafn after completing the main quest line, the item will become redundant and should be sold for coin or kept as decoration.\nEbony Dragon Claw.\nThe Ebony Dragon Claw is found at &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;Korvanjund&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\" Depending on which side of the war is supported, it is found in the Hall Of Stories near the dead bodies of either two &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Soldiers&lt;/a&gt; or two &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: Because of its jet-black coloration, it may be difficult to see at first glance.\nEmerald Dragon Claw.\nThe Emerald Dragon Claw opens the first Door Puzzle in &lt;a href=\"Reachwater%20Rock\"&gt;Reachwater Rock&lt;/a&gt;. It is found near the entrance, on a pedestal next to an &lt;a href=\"Adventurer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s dead body.\nIt is used in conjunction with the &lt;a href=\"%23Ivory%20Dragon%20Claw\"&gt;Ivory Dragon Claw&lt;/a&gt; in the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;\" to obtain &lt;a href=\"The%20Gauldur%20Amulet\"&gt;The Gauldur Amulet&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey can both become bugged, where even after completing the Gauldur quest they can't be removed from the inventory. It is also possible for the claws to randomly disappear if stored in a home.\nGlass Dragon Claw.\nThe Glass Dragon Claw is found in &lt;a href=\"Forelhost%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt; during the \"&lt;a href=\"Siege%20on%20the%20Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Siege on the Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;\" quest. It is in the Forelhost Refectory resting on a pedestal in the top room that resembles a library directly before the spear-gate. While taking the Glass Dragon Claw can cause the spear-gate to close, setting any other object on the pedestal can counteract the triggering of this trap.\nGolden Claw.\nThe Golden Dragon Claw is usually the first claw to be encountered, as it is part of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Claw%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;The Golden Claw&lt;/a&gt;\" side quest, which is obtained in &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riverwood&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Valerius\"&gt;Lucan Valerius&lt;/a&gt;. If not started by &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Valerius\"&gt;Lucan Valerius&lt;/a&gt;, it is started upon entering Bleak Falls Barrow. The claw is obtained from &lt;a href=\"Arvel%20the%20Swift\"&gt;Arvel the Swift&lt;/a&gt; during the \"&lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Falls%20Barrow%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Bleak Falls Barrow&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0A group of bandits led by a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Arvel%20the%20Swift\"&gt;Arvel the Swift&lt;/a&gt; came to Bleak Falls Barrow with the stolen Golden Dragon Claw hoping to find treasure behind the Nordic puzzle door. The robbery went awry, and Arvel was trapped in a &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spider&lt;/a&gt;'s web, leaving the rest of the group waiting at the entrance of the dungeon.\nRetrieving the Golden Dragon Claw, using it to reach the word wall then returning it to Lucan completes the quest. Thereafter, the Golden Claw is displayed on the counter of the &lt;a href=\"Riverwood%20Trader\"&gt;Riverwood Trader&lt;/a&gt;, which, for those inclined, makes it easy to steal. Additionally, if &lt;a href=\"Camilla%20Valerius\"&gt;Camilla Valerius&lt;/a&gt; is married by the individual wanting the claw, it can be taken, instead of stolen. Alternatively, finishing the side quest and giving Lucan Valerius back the claw allows one to kill him and the claw may then be stolen.\nIron Dragon Claw.\nThe Iron Dragon Claw is found and used during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Evil%20in%20Waiting\"&gt;Evil in Waiting&lt;/a&gt;\" inside an ancient Nordic tomb of Valthume. It is sitting atop a pedestal in the last room \u2013 Valthume Catacombs. Removing the claw activates a trap. Four statues around you will begin to breathe fire for a few seconds.\nIvory Dragon Claw.\nThe Ivory Dragon Claw is found in &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt; next to &lt;a href=\"Daynas%20Valen\"&gt;Daynas Valen&lt;/a&gt; along with his notes and a journal. It is used in &lt;a href=\"Folgunthur\"&gt;Folgunthur&lt;/a&gt; and again in &lt;a href=\"Reachwater%20Rock\"&gt;Reachwater Rock&lt;/a&gt;. Until the \"&lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Legend\"&gt;Forbidden Legend&lt;/a&gt;\" quest has been completed, it is considered a &lt;a href=\"Quest%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quest item&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be discarded.\nNote: This is the only claw that is used in more than one area. It is also the only claw that uses keyholes not located on Door Puzzles.\nRuby Dragon Claw.\nThe Ruby Dragon Claw is found and used during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Tending%20the%20Flames\"&gt;Tending the Flames&lt;/a&gt;\" inside &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Men%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Dead Men's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. It is sitting atop a pedestal in the first room. Removing the claw awakens a small number of &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ruby Dragon Claw will remain marked as a quest item and cannot be removed from inventory until after &lt;a href=\"Viarmo\"&gt;Viarmo&lt;/a&gt; receives &lt;a href=\"King%20Olaf%27s%20Verse\"&gt;King Olaf's Verse&lt;/a&gt; in the quest Tending the Flames.\nSapphire Dragon Claw.\nThe Sapphire Dragon Claw is obtained from\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wilhelm\"&gt;Wilhelm&lt;/a&gt;, the Inn keeper of the &lt;a href=\"Vilemyr%20Inn\"&gt;Vilemyr Inn&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Ivarstead%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ivarstead&lt;/a&gt;, as a reward for bringing him &lt;a href=\"Wyndelius%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Wyndelius's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the man who was \"haunting\" the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20Hearth%20Barrow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shroud Hearth Barrow&lt;/a&gt;. The claw is used to open the Puzzle door inside the Barrow to gain access to a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmethyst Dragon Claw.\nThe Amethyst Claw is found in &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Vahlok's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. The claw is split in two, with the dungeon's design suggesting it was made this way. The claw's two halves are found individually, and each unlocks a unique half-claw lock that opens the path to the dungeon's deepest areas."}

A prominent figure in the cult was &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of dragons.\nHistory.\nThe cultists were some of the first men to arrive on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from the continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. These cultists worshipped many animals as avatars of the gods, the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; among them. The dragons granted the cultists terrible power in exchange for complete obedience. The Dragon Priests demanded tribute from the populace and created laws to keep peace between men and the Dragons.\nBromjunaar.\nThe ruins of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Labyrinthian\"&gt;Labyrinthian&lt;/a&gt; were originally built as a temple to the Dragons. This grew into &lt;a href=\"Bromjunaar\"&gt;Bromjunaar&lt;/a&gt;, a great city of that era. Bromjunaar is believed by some to have been the capital of Skyrim at the height of the Dragon Cult's influence there. It was believed that the highest ranking Priests of the cult met at Labyrinthian to discuss matters of ruling.\nDownfall.\nEventually, men rebelled against the cruelty of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; and his Dragon Cult in what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20War\"&gt;Dragon War&lt;/a&gt;. A large number of the cultists were killed and the survivors were overthrown.\nThe survivors adapted and went into hiding. They built the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20mounds\"&gt;Dragon mounds&lt;/a&gt;, entombing the remains of the dragons that died during the war with the belief that Alduin would one day return and resurrect the faithful.\nOne of the last remnants of the cult was found by &lt;a href=\"Skorm%20Snow-Strider\"&gt;Skorm Snow-Strider&lt;/a&gt; in the secluded monastery of &lt;a href=\"Forelhost\"&gt;Forelhost&lt;/a&gt; high in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteractions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; faces &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cultist\"&gt;Dragon Cultist&lt;/a&gt;s as part of other quests or while revealing shouts from word walls. Dragon Priests yield &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest%20Masks\"&gt;Dragon Priest Masks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is presumed that the numerous &lt;a href=\"Draugr\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; found within Nordic ruins were members of the Dragon Cult, punished by the dragons to serve them for eternity."}

Esbern will then offer a unique &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt; to help in the fight against dragons, called &lt;a href=\"Esbern%27s%20Potion\"&gt;Esbern's Potion&lt;/a&gt;.\nCompleting all dragon lairs.\nThe \"Dragon Hunting\" quest can be repeated, for all ten dragon lairs present in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, by returning to Esbern and inquiring about another dragon location.\nOnce one of these \"Dragon Hunting\" quests is completed, after a few minutes, a sound will be heard (it is identical to the sound heard when a boss is defeated or a secret &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; is discovered). This sound indicates that Esbern has obtained a new dragon lair location and may now send the Blades and the Dragonborn to hunt the dragon therein. Until then, if questioned about hunting dragons, he will say: \"All is quiet now...\"\nEven if all ten lairs have been completed, Esbern will continue to provide the quest as the lairs will continue to respawn a dragon at them, even if they have already been visited and cleared previously."}

{"id": "7335", "revid": "35838578", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=7335", "title": "Dragon Language", "text": "The dragon language is the &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; used in by &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"shouts\"&gt;shouts&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"word%20walls\"&gt;word walls&lt;/a&gt;, in names, etc. It is provided by the Skyrim Game Guide and in-game dialogue translations by &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Odahviing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Odahviing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durnehviir\"&gt;Durnehviir&lt;/a&gt;. Some may also be found in the books, \"\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Songs%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Songs of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\". Additionally, each &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priest\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt;'s name is a word in the Dragon Language.\nWords of power.\nThe dragon language is an innate characteristic of dragons, who use it both to speak regularly and to cast &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; using words of power, known as the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;. Dragons use the Thu'um to 'shout' with one to three words of power in the dragon language, and the words used for a shout are expressive of the effects of that shout; for example, 'force,' 'balance,' and 'push' make up the three words of power of &lt;a href=\"unrelenting%20force\"&gt;unrelenting force&lt;/a&gt;. While dragons have a natural understanding of the dragon language and the Thu'um, any person can both learn to speak the language and shout using words of power if they are trained to do so. Unlike other mortals, &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; are able to learn and use words of power as soon as they learn it and unlock its potential after absorbing the soul of a deceased dragon.\nPronunciation.\nThe Dragon Language uses unique digraphs \u2013 two letters making a single sound \u2013 as part of its &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Alphabet\"&gt;alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, including \"aa,\" \"ah,\" \"ei,\" \"ey,\" \"ii,\" \"ir,\" \"uu,\" \"ur,\" and \"oo.\" However, assuming that the initial syllables heard in the musical pieces for the game are the standard form, then the language takes on a more Scandinavian sound. \"Aa\" and \"ah\" are both a long, open \"a\" /a\u02d0/; the latter, however, being formed more gutturally (sometimes becoming /\u0254\u02d0/). \"Oo\" is used in the instances where the normal \"o\" sound /o/ (English \"port\") needs to become long (/o\u02d0/), as in the English \"door.\" Only \"uu\" takes on the sound of an English double-\"o.\" \"Ii\" would tend to be longer (/\u026a\u02d0/), and \"ir\" and \"ur\" equate to /ir/ and /ur/, respectively. Finally, there is a difference between \"ei\" and \"ey\": \"ei\" is pronounced as in German, producing a vowel as in price. \"Ey,\" on the other hand, sounds as in face. Most dragons, in the game, do not roll their \"r\"s; however, both the main theme and the music in Sovngarde feature them exclusively.\nGrammar.\nThe language has basically the same grammar as English, with the exceptions that it does not have an equivalent to English's apostrophes. To create the plural possessive, \"our\", a \"u\" is added to the end of the word. Dragon language tends to place prepositional phrases earlier in sentences than in English, and does not have tense. To pluralize a word, the final letter is repeated and \"e\" is added (i.e. \"grohiik\": wolf; \"grohiikke\": wolves).\nWords are constructed in such a way that, when combined, they form new words. A known construction is \"Junnesejer,\" which means \"the kings of the east.\" \"Jun\" being king and \"Jer\" being east. Thus, combining words will allow one to convey an idea or another word. For Example: \"moon and eclipse\" are not present in the vocabulary, but sun (\"krein\") and night (\"vulon\") are. The word is based on which of the words is the first because the first word is prominent. If one were to say \"vulonkrein,\" the prominent word would be \"night\" while the secondary is \"sun,\" and there would be \"moon\" (i.e. a light in the night). Vice versa with \"kreinvulon,\" as \"sun\" is prominent and \"night\" is secondary, so there would be \"eclipse\" (darkness where the sun is). With Junnesejer, it means \"the kings of the east,\" but if one were to put it as Jersejun, it would be \"East King.\" \"Se\" is a conjunction between words that are combined to fill in the particles, but it's just as easily understood without it."}

Borkul will demand a &lt;a href=\"shiv\"&gt;shiv&lt;/a&gt; as toll. A shiv can be obtained from &lt;a href=\"Grisvar%20the%20Unlucky\"&gt;Grisvar the Unlucky&lt;/a&gt;, who is located in the south tunnel. He will demand a bottle of &lt;a href=\"Skooma%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skooma&lt;/a&gt;. This can be acquired from &lt;a href=\"Duach\"&gt;Duach&lt;/a&gt; or Braig, through &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;persuasion&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"brawl\"&gt;brawl&lt;/a&gt;. Trade the Skooma to Grisvar in exchange for a shiv, and give the shiv to Borkul to get the key to Madanach's cell.\nAlternatively, Borkul can be persuaded, given the Skooma directly, pickpocketed, or defeated in a brawl.\nAttacking Borkul outside of the brawl will cause all the prisoners to attack. Unless one is a strong &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; character, a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20Lord\"&gt;Vampire Lord&lt;/a&gt;, this is not recommended. If a prisoner is attacked, Madanach will attack on sight as well. Quest weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Alessandra%27s%20Dagger\"&gt;Alessandra's Dagger&lt;/a&gt; will be removed from the Dragonborn's inventory upon arrival in the mine, however spells such as &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bound Sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bound Bow&lt;/a&gt; are still available. There is a ledge above Borkul that can be reached from jumping from the raised wooden platform to allow one to shoot downwards from with ranged attacks. &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjured&lt;/a&gt; allies such as &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Storm%20Atronach\"&gt;Storm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s can assist in fighting.\nThe Forsworn option.\nMadanach will try to convince the Dragonborn that he and his &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; are justified in their actions and sends the Dragonborn to seek out the prisoner Braig and hear his story. After listening to Braig, return to Madanach and he will offer freedom, but he requires proof of loyalty. He requests the assassination of Grisvar the Unlucky, who has outlived his usefulness to the Forsworn Rebellion. After killing Grisvar, the Dragonborn must return to Madanach.\nUpon hearing news of Grisvar's death, Madanach gathers the remaining prisoners and leads them to an escape tunnel that runs through the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Ruins\"&gt;Markarth Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the tunnel, the Dragonborn's belongings are returned to them by &lt;a href=\"Kaie\"&gt;Kaie&lt;/a&gt;, one of Madanach's Forsworn agents that managed to slip into Markarth without being seen, and Madanach adds the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;Armor of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; as a reward. Once outside, there is a confrontation between &lt;a href=\"Thonar\"&gt;Thonar&lt;/a&gt; and Madanach, with Thonar having several of the corrupt Markarth city guards backing him up. The Forsworn and Madanach charge the city, killing Thonar and all guards (and citizens) in sight. After they leave the city, they will continue running to &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Redoubt%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Druadach Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; which will have several friendly Forsworn inside.\nTo lower the chances of the ensuing battle killing bystander citizens (such as &lt;a href=\"Ghorza%20gra-Bagol\"&gt;Ghorza gra-Bagol&lt;/a&gt;, the blacksmith), the Dragonborn can opt to &lt;a href=\"wait\"&gt;wait&lt;/a&gt; in the prison for late night or early morning before breaking out. This will ensure that the streets of Markarth only has guards.\nThe Silver-Blood option.\nKill Madanach in his cell. &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; so as not to be detected by the other prisoners and guards. It is unlikely that Madanach will be killed with a pickaxe in one sneak hit, however. If the Dragonborn has the &lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20Blade%20%28Perk%29\"&gt;Assassin's Blade&lt;/a&gt; perk in the Sneak skill tree, listen to Braig's story and return to Madanach. Madanach will instruct the Dragonborn to kill Grisvar the Unlucky. There is a dialogue option on Uraccen to obtain a shiv from Grisvar. While alive, Grisvar does not have any items to pickpocket. However, after dying, two shivs can be looted from his body. Once obtained, kill Madanach with a sneak attack with the shiv. The shiv counts as a dagger and thus the Assassin's Blade perk applies, doing 15 times normal damage. Madanach may survive the initial blow, but it will deliver a substantial hit.\nOnce Madanach is dead, read the note on his body and use his escape route. It is possible to run or sneak past the &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Frostbite Spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven Spheres&lt;/a&gt; in the Markarth Ruins, especially with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; Shout. If the Dragonborn opts to sneak through the ruins, the &lt;a href=\"Throw%20Voice\"&gt;Throw Voice&lt;/a&gt; Shout is indispensably useful. Alternatively, being a Werewolf, Vampire Lord, or Mage, makes fighting your way out significantly easier. Another option would be to use the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Servant\"&gt;Secret Servant&lt;/a&gt; power from the expansion to smuggle your equipment into the jail cell for you. Upon exiting, Thonar Silver-Blood will reward the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Family%20Ring\"&gt;Silver-Blood Family Ring&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragonborn's belongings. The ring is enchanted so that weapons and armor can be improved 15% better.\nPlaying both sides.\nSide with Madanach up until the Dragonborn is given the Armor of the Old Gods, which is at the end of the Markarth Ruins right before exiting to the city. After the dialogue and receiving the armor, attack Madanach, turning him hostile. Doing this while close to the door to &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; will cause his followers to re-enter and attack the Dragonborn. After Madanach and his followers are dead, loot his body and read his note. Then exit out to Markarth and speak to Thonar. It is best to attack Madanach close to the door to Markarth because if not, his followers may not re-enter and it can be difficult to get the Silver-Blood Family Ring from Thonar as Madanach's followers will be waiting outside to attack.\nIf done correctly, after killing Madanach and the rest of his Forsworn followers inside the Markarth Ruins, the Dragonborn will exit out to a peaceful Markarth with Thonar waiting with his guards to speak with them and reward them with the Silver-Blood Family Ring, as well as a pardon from the Jarl. If Jarl &lt;a href=\"Igmund\"&gt;Igmund&lt;/a&gt; is spoken to afterwards, he will apologize for the wrongful imprisonment. If upon exiting the tunnel there are Forsworn left, it helps to reenter the tunnel so that Thonar is not accidentally hit. This causes all characters to react as though Madanach escaped with the help of the Dragonborn.\nIf a skilled assassin, it is possible to break out with the other Forsworn, and stall Madanach before he exits to Markarth. Once alone with him, kill him and search his body. Madanach will be dead, but the Dragonborn will not be blamed for the kill. When exiting to the city, both the Guards and Forsworn will be peaceful towards the Dragonborn, although they will still fight each other\u2014either side can be assisted as both are friendly and will treat any attacks as accidental. Thonar will almost certainly be killed in the fighting before he can give the Dragonborn the ring, but this route still leaves the Dragonborn with the Armor of the Old Gods, an official pardon from the Jarl and a friendly Druadach Redoubt. Although if they are lucky, a conversation may be started up with Thonar when leaving the ruins, and, by quickly skipping through the lines, the Dragonborn may receive the ring. It may take several attempts to pull off properly and by reloading the autosave just outside the ruins, can yield different results. If playing as an imperial, using the Voice of the Emperor power will keep everyone calm long enough for the Dragonborn to obtain the ring.\nAnother way is to stall Madanach and pickpocket him. He turns aggressive and can be killed. A guard will run in but will not attack."}

I should bring it to someone knowledgeable in such goods for appraisal.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUnusual Gems can be found all over &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Once at least one is discovered, the quest will be eligible to be started. Once a gem is found, travel to &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;. There, the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; thief &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt; can be met. After speaking to him, he will tell the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; what he knows of the gem, and requests they speak to Vex in order to find out what the gem is worth. He will also state that Vex can only be spoken to if one is a member of the Thieves Guild. If the Dragonborn urges him for more information on the guild, he will direct them to &lt;a href=\"Brynjolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Brynjolf&lt;/a&gt; in the Riften Marketplace, or if the time is night, &lt;a href=\"the%20Bee%20and%20Barb\"&gt;the Bee and Barb&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking to Brynjolf will begin \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Chance%20Arrangement\"&gt;A Chance Arrangement&lt;/a&gt;.\" Once access to &lt;a href=\"The%20Ragged%20Flagon\"&gt;The Ragged Flagon&lt;/a&gt; has been gained, Vex can be spoken to. She will explain to the Dragonborn that the gem is one of twenty-four total stones that were pried from the crown of Queen Barenziah by a thief in an attempt to cover his tracks, and that only the complete set of the twenty-four stones would be worth anything. The new set of such information begins the objective to seek out the rest of the valuables.\nIf the Dragonborn is already a member of the Thieves Guild, Vex can be spoken to immediately. She can easily be found in The Ragged Flagon, and will tell them that it is one of twenty-four stones that were stolen from the crown of Queen Barenziah by a known thief in an effort to hide his tracks. She also mentions that only the complete set of the twenty-four stones would be worth anything notable. This explanation begins the objective to seek out the rest of the gems.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations for every Stone of Barenziah:\nRecovering the Crown of Barenziah.\nOnce Vex is shown the full set of the twenty-four stones, she tasks you with traveling to &lt;a href=\"Tolvald%27s%20Cave\"&gt;Tolvald's Cave&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the Crown of Barenziah. The cave has three levels and is filled with many &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;falmer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as various fungi. The location of the crown is normally &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Lock%20Outs\"&gt;inaccessible&lt;/a&gt; due to a cave collapse blocking the way, but is cleared upon reaching this point in the quest. Upon entering the cave, there is a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Troll%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost troll&lt;/a&gt; and an apprentice level &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt; behind the pillar to the left. One can go down the cave and face another two frost trolls. Go through the door at the end of the path. There is a trapped chest, coin purse, and &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Ore\"&gt;gold ore&lt;/a&gt; on the table directly ahead, and then three Falmer will appear. Follow the path to either direction, as both will lead the same way, and once one reaches the top, there will be another two Falmer in the room with an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;. Continue down the path until three Falmer are reached. A chest to the left of the shelters will also be present, but one will also proceed to fight a &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spider&lt;/a&gt;. Keep to the left to find and unlock an &lt;a href=\"Lock%20Level\"&gt;adept&lt;/a&gt; chest. Then, one will encounter another two Falmer near the fire. Open the gate to the hut to search another chest. Continue down the path to Tolvald's Gap.\nUpon entering, several Falmer and &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; will be faced in combat. Afterward, take the bridge to the right and inside a hut is another chest, while within the room is a bounty of fungi. Exit the room and follow the stream to the south. There will be a couple of frostbite spiders and Falmer. Follow the stream to the left and take a right up the path. If one decides to open the gate to the right, there will be a few &lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20Hunter%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;chaurus hunters&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, head up the left side of the next room to unlock an adept chest and continue down the path. Kill the Falmer and upon reaching the next room, but do not jump down, as the position will return one to a previous spot. Guide to the right, down the tunnel, and upstream to Tolvald's Crossing.\nUpon entrance, one will be greeted by a &lt;a href=\"falmer%20warmonger\"&gt;falmer warmonger&lt;/a&gt; on the bridge. Upon crossing the bridge, continuing forward will lead someone to a chest, but also to the crown. Turn back and take the first path to the right which is equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;trip wire&lt;/a&gt;. There is a chest ahead on the right, a coin purse directly ahead with a bunch of books, and a few falmer up the path to the left. Make a U-turn up the path to gain access to a master chest. Turn back and follow the path to a hut with a chest inside, and then continue through the gate. The next room will have a table with bones and random loot on top of it. As one continues upward, they ought to kill the Falmer, and search the chest to the right. The next room has chaurus hunters and Falmer warmongers. Open the gate on the other side of the bridge and continue forward. Keep left and cross the pipes to reach Tolvald's Cave. In the event that one did not get the crown, they can easily drop down the falls cautiously and retreat left. Down the pathway, there will be a pull chain to the left that will open the stone wall. Continue straight ahead and exit to Skyrim.\nAfter giving the Crown to Vex, it will be placed as a trophy alongside the rest of the &lt;a href=\"larceny%20targets\"&gt;larceny targets&lt;/a&gt; in the Cistern by the Guildmaster's desk, and the individual will be rewarded with the effect &lt;a href=\"Prowler%27s%20Profit\"&gt;Prowler's Profit&lt;/a&gt;."}

Who has not heard the many tales of Rajhin? But as the tales suggest, some treasures are difficult to move and are often worth more in trouble than the gold you'll get for them.\nCoin is best, of course. It's small and easy to move. Jewelry comes next, though you may have to melt pieces down if they are too closely filigreed.\nPotions can be just as valuable\u2014if not immediately useful to your trade. Look especially for those with restorative properties, for these can be priceless when properly plied.\nDon't overlook sundries, either! Frequently a treasure will be too well guarded or trapped with snares to justify the effort, but the mark is not always a lost cause. Only the most paranoid take precautions with the sugarcloset, for who would impede his own sweet-tooth? Much the same with the cupboards, for a hungry belly needs filling fast and tripwires only get in the way.\nDo not be too prideful to make off with these things. While they will rarely be missed, they can fill your belly and bring you fame to rival even the luckiest moonlighters!\nWhere Should You Flee?\nTake as much as you can carry! Fill your pockets and parcels with whatever you can fit, such that it overflows your waistband and bites into your back! Your bounty is as important to your escape as it is to your purse.\nWhen you are pursued \u2014as you often will be\u2014spoils secured properly about your vitals will throw off arrows raining down from the walls.\nIn the streets, cut release ties to spill out your treasures into the paths of your pursuers. Throw them to the crowds! Their scrambling for your riches will sow confusion, creating obstacles for your escape.\nNot only will these efforts delay your pursuers, news of your open hand will spread like wildfire through the streets. What is more valuable than your name? It will buy you safe haven in times of need, food for your belly in lean times, and more importantly will carry you through the darkest of life's troubles.\nAnd when you are old and can no longer leap between rooftops, you can rest easily among your childrens' children, assured that your legacy is as clean as a well-greased tumblecatch.\nGood luck in your exploits! When they are sung through the taverns and slums of the world, Zizar-dar will be sure to carry the tune."}

Regardless, the Cyrodiilic Thieves Guild venerates Nocturnal by ending talks with the saying \"Shadow hide you.\" The summoning date of Nocturnal is 3rd of Hearthfire.\nNocturnal and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; have been referred to as sisters, though whether in the literal or the metaphorical sense is unknown. Nocturnal is sometimes referred to as Ur-Dra, referencing her claim as part of the original &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; She is thought to be the \"eldest and most powerful of the Daedric Princes.\" The &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; know her as Noctra, who can bring shadows and luck when called upon.\nAppearance and personality.\nPhysical descriptions of Nocturnal are difficult to come by, as she is usually described as being hidden by darkness and shadow. Depictions of the Daedric Prince usually take the form of a nondescript human woman, draped in a hooded cloak that hides most of her features and body. She is depicted with both arms outstretched, and a pair of Nightingales (or similar bird) perched on each wrist.\nNocturnal claims to be an aspect of the void of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; itself, and takes such titles as Mother of Night or Night Mistress. Her very nature is such that humans cannot understand her, as she is the embodiment of the unfathomable and enigmatic. Worshipers of Nocturnal consist primarily of those who operate in darkness and night, such as thieves and spies. However, Nocturnal's deception is not usually meant to be harmful or violent in the manner of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, the unknowable nature of Nocturnal is the core of her being, and serves no real ulterior purposes beyond being mysterious. Thus, while thieves may consider Nocturnal their patron, assassins will typically lean towards a more violent deity, such as &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf Nocturnal, &lt;a href=\"Karliah\"&gt;Karliah&lt;/a&gt; says she is, \"like a scolding mother who pushes her child to do better,\" meaning she appears to care about mortals, unlike some other &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorship.\nAlthough Nocturnal has arguably one of the largest followings of all the Daedric Princes, she has no form of organized clergy. There are a few who call themselves priests of Nocturnal, though the Night Mistress does not herself seem to show them any particular favor. Indeed, Nocturnal seems to have no real interest in worship. A temple of Nocturnal does exist called the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt;, located in Skyrim, though this was built around the portal known as the &lt;a href=\"Ebonmere\"&gt;Ebonmere&lt;/a&gt;, the portal to Nocturnal's plane of Oblivion known as &lt;a href=\"Evergloam\"&gt;Evergloam&lt;/a&gt;. Supposedly, Nocturnal is the source of a thief's luck, which flows from the Ebonmere and plays a heavy role in the lives of any who use the shadows to do their work, though none know what price is paid in return.\nNightingales.\nThough Nocturnal has no truly organized clergy, she has three mortal servants upon &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; who are known as the &lt;a href=\"Nightingale%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nightingales&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightingales serve Nocturnal directly, granted the power over shadow, subterfuge and strife in exchange for their service. Once a Nightingale enters into their contract with Nocturnal, they are bound for life and beyond to serve the Night Mistress in guarding the Twilight Sepulcher and in Nocturnal's realm Evergloam until Nocturnal feels the Nightingale's contract with her has been fulfilled.\nWitches.\nLike most Daedric Princes, Nocturnal has female, magic-using worshipers known as &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es. In \"&lt;a href=\"Purloined%20Shadows\"&gt;Purloined Shadows&lt;/a&gt;\", a coven dedicated to Nocturnal is seen worshipping her. Nocturnal seems to enjoy the praise they give her, smiling as they sang of her great mystery.\nCultists.\nNocturnal has at least one cult dedicated to her, the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Shadows\"&gt;Whispering Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. They operated throughout the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt; she has only one known human follower, known as &lt;a href=\"Earl%20Tundilwen\"&gt;Earl Tundilwen&lt;/a&gt;.\nArtifacts.\nBow of Shadows.\nThe Bow of Shadows was forged by Nocturnal and granted to the ranger &lt;a href=\"Raerlas%20Ghile\"&gt;Raerlas Ghile&lt;/a&gt; for a sacred mission during which, scores of Raerlas' foes were taken down by him, with the aid of the bow. The mission ultimately failed and the Bow was lost. The Bow was also used by the Dunmer assassin &lt;a href=\"Dram\"&gt;Dram&lt;/a&gt; during the Second Era. The Bow of Shadows grants its wielder increased speed and invisibility.\nEye of Nocturnal.\nThe Eye of Nocturnal is an artifact through which Nocturnal can see into the world of Nirn. The Eye was stolen from Nocturnal during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, and was later retrieved by her champion.\nGray Cowl of Nocturnal.\nThe most famous feature of Nocturnal is the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal\"&gt;enchanted cowl she created&lt;/a&gt;. This headpiece possessed the ability to completely hide its wearer's identity from mortal knowledge, including magical forms of scrying and identification. The cowl's power was so great that people would be incapable of even remembering the name of whomever possessed the cowl, even while the cowl was not being worn. No one would be able to retain any long term memory of interacting with the cowl's wearer, and even removing the cowl in plain sight of others would not break its spell.\nThe cowl was reportedly stolen by the head of the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Emer%20Dareloth\"&gt;Emer Dareloth&lt;/a&gt;) during the Third Era, promptly removing any memory of the person in question from history. Henceforth, according to legend, the bearer of the cowl was known only as \"&lt;a href=\"Gray%20Fox\"&gt;Gray Fox&lt;/a&gt;,\" though it was not commonly known that the cowl was responsible for his infamy.\nThe cowl was also told stolen in a song called \"&lt;a href=\"Song%20of%20Hrormir\"&gt;Song of Hrormir&lt;/a&gt;.\" Nocturnal was tricked by Hrormir in order to save his old companion Darfang. She traded Darfang's soul for the service (by keeping his soul) of Hrormir, so that he would assist her followers dividing the kingdom of Aelfendor, but in the end the kingdom was left intact while Nocturnal's followers were divided. And the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal was also taken by Hrormir. To get the cowl back, Nocturnal was forced to release Hrormir's soul and left with nothing to gain.\nSkeleton Key.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; was reportedly owned by a mortal for the first time by an obscured person named &lt;a href=\"Arrovan\"&gt;Arrovan&lt;/a&gt;. Many years later, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; found a map in a dungeon in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; that pointed to the location of the Skeleton Key somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Using the map, the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; found and claimed the key. Then sometime in &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Azra%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Hero of Azra's Crossing&lt;/a&gt; found the Skeleton Key in one of the chests in the Citadel of Broken Wing. Indeed, the artifact travels between heroes and locations, as the legend says, it would never be the property of one thief for too long.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Skeleton Key was given a new level of importance and power. In the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; story-line, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; discovers that not only can the Key unlock physical barriers, but also metaphysical ones. As demonstrated by &lt;a href=\"Mercer%20Frey\"&gt;Mercer Frey&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Blindsighted\"&gt;Blindsighted&lt;/a&gt;\" quest, the Skeleton Key also unlocks human potential.\nFrey's theft of the Skeleton Key from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher's&lt;/a&gt; Inner Sanctum in the Fourth Era is said to be the reason for the hard times that have fallen on the Guild in Skyrim, since the Ebonmere, the gate to Nocturnal's plane of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;, was kept open by the Skeleton Key, allowing luck to grace the actions of thieves throughout &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. It also allows the owner to pick any lock without the Skeleton Key breaking.\nIn , Nocturnal attempts to steal the Skeleton Key from Sotha Sil in order to take over the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to potentially remake reality. She is stopped and cast out. Sotha Sil gives the key to &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping.\nFor the reasons aforementioned the Skeleton Key might very well be the most powerful, if underestimated, Daedric artifact known. The ability to overcome any obstacle regardless of it being physical or otherwise by its user. Plainly seen as it has no trouble opening a doorway to a plane of Oblivion."}

You can find a staggering amount of wildlife in these putrid depths! As an explorer and amateur naturalist, I find that extremely convenient for my work.\nI confess, I came to Orcrest in search of its sewer system with a specific goal in mind. I had heard rumors of a specimen of amorphous green slime transported from distant &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt; for the express goal of alchemical study in an Orcrest laboratory. It is said that the creature escaped captivity during the chaos and unrest at the height of the disease that ravaged the city. Supposedly, the blob of slime slithered down into the sewer, where it grew to an enormous size and more potent toxicity due to the disease-ridden detritus flowing down there for it to consume.\nSo, with notebook and quill in hand, I braved the perils of Orcrest and found an access to the sewer. I encountered a number of small blobs that were scavenging through the waste and debris, but no huge monstrosity. Disappointed, I decided to push on. That's when I discovered the great pit and the impressive mass of slime that ruled there. I named it &lt;a href=\"Noordigloop%20the%20Clog%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;Noordigloop the Clog&lt;/a&gt;!\nGazing upon the impressive creature, I assumed it would be slow and docile giving its size. Imagine my surprise when it rushed after me like a wave of angry ooze! How did it sense my presence? I have no idea! And the smaller voriplasms scattered throughout the area, were they separate creatures or simply extensions of might Noordigloop? Further study will be required. Unfortunately, I write this from a hiding spot that I am hesitant to vacate while the slimes continue to search for me. I am going to wait a little while longer, then attempt to get close enough to Noordigloop to perform a thorough examination.\nMaybe I can even acquire a sample of its vibrant slime to bring back to my alchemical workshop. Wouldn't that be grand?"}

Layered on top is &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Ingot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Online%29\"&gt;steel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Corundum%20Ingot\"&gt;corundum&lt;/a&gt; alloys. The result is a steel that holds tighter and bites sharper than weapons from other realms.\nWhen Nords refer to their blades as \"stinging,\" they mean more than its cutting power: superstitious Nord smiths are said to add a drop of wild &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Honey%20%28Online%29\"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; into everything they create. The whys and wherefores are misplaced in long-forgotten lore, but the practice is widespread. To this day, no Nord armorer would work a forge without first crumbling &lt;a href=\"Honeycomb\"&gt;Honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; into his quenching tub."}

Back in the First Age when the sons of Harald Hand-Free ruled the northern coasts of Tamriel, during the Skyrim Conquests? Well, I bet you didn't know Olmgerd the Outlaw, Harald's bastard, was buried as befits a Nord lord's son, in his ship, in a tomb deep in the mother rock.\"\n\"\"And of course they buried Stormkiss with him. Stormkiss was Olmgerd's enchanted battle-axe. And you see this old key? See what it says it on it? 'Stormkiss.' Here. Take it. Healer says the mazte is killing me. I'm going home to Skyrim to die. You, you got your life ahead of you. Go ahead. Take it.\"\n\"They say they buried Olmgerd in the bottom of an ancient Dunmer tomb. From the skald's telling, the burial was on a long finger of land on the southeast coast of Vvardenfell, on a little island close to shore on the west coast of the peninsula. Figure it's somewhere on the stretch between the Daedric ruins at Zaintiraris and Tel Branora. Gods be with you. And thank you for the mazte.\""}

Early &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic ancestors had given the land this name due to the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; that used to rule there.\nFor a time Atmoran settlers and Mer lived in peace with each other. This resulted in a population boom of the Atmorans in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Harsh weather and civil war ensured more Atmorans coming to Mereth. Thus, the first major settlement was built - &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is believed that the Atmorans' fast reproduction rate posed a demographic threat to the Snow Elves in Skyrim, and this was one cause of the Snow Elves' genocidal campaign against Men.\nAnother theory is that Atmoran settlers had found an unimaginably powerful\u00a0artifact - the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Eye of Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, that was said to be buried somewhere in Skyrim. Combination of greed and fear drove Elves to reclaim the artifact for themselves.\nWar.\nSnow Elves attacked the unsuspecting Atmoran settlement during the night and murdered nearly its entire population. Saarthal was in ruins and it is said that only three survivors were able to escape the carnage and sail back to Atmora:\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his two sons. This event is known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe seemingly successful plan, however, only fueled the wrath of the Atmorans in the form of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, who were\u00a0led by Ysgramor. A fleet of longboats left the port of &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; to avenge their slain brethren. The Atmoran return to Skyrim started the historic period known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;.\" During this period, Atmorans led bloody skirmishes to kill and enslave the Elven populace. This way, these Nordic ancestors quickly spread all over Skyrim and nearby areas, claiming land for themselves.\nThe last Snow Elven commander was said to have fallen on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt;. The\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;, was, perhaps, the only Elf that Atmorans honored. He proved to be a worthy enemy for many Atmoran warriors and was buried in a &lt;a href=\"Jolgeirr%20Barrow\"&gt;barrow&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in a show of respect, as Atmoran tradition demanded for brave foes.\nThe war was said to have ended during the reign of &lt;a href=\"King%20Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt;, thirteenth of Ysgramor's line. The last recorded skirmish against the Snow Elves, however, happened in &lt;a href=\"1E%20139\"&gt;1E 139&lt;/a&gt;, under the rule of Harald, at the time just a lord.\nOutcome.\nThe Nordic-Falmer War resulted in &lt;a href=\"humans\"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0becoming ascendant on the continent of Tamriel as a whole, as the &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; campaign of conquest against the Snow Elves not only broke the long dominion of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Mereth\"&gt;Mereth&lt;/a&gt;, but also freed much of the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt; populations of Men from &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; slavery. With the help of labor by the Elven prisoners of war, &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt and cities such as &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; were founded.\u00a0The\u00a0first human empire was born, led by the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. Using claimed Elven knowledge from the conflict, humans first developed writing.\nThe surviving Snow Elves pled with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; for aid and quarter. The Dwemer initially agreed to their plea, offering them refuge in the Dwarven cities, but later ended up betraying and enslaving them. The Dwemer are believed to have mass-poisoned the Snow Elves by forcing them to eat a fungi that would cause blindness, an act that affected their offspring as well. After the disappearance of the Dwemer, the Snow Elves gradually devolved into the cave-dwelling beasts known as the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nFew Snow Elves managed to escape the Nords and not make a deal with Dwemer, the only known case being with the &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, where hundreds took refuge. They were eventually slaughtered by their degenerated Falmer brethren, leaving only\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt; as the last known Snow Elf survivors."}

{"id": "855621", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=855621", "title": "Nordic Empire", "text": "The Nordic Empire, alternatively Nord Empire and First Nordic Empire, formally the First Empire of the Nords, sometimes referred to as the First Empire of Men, or the First Empire of Humankind, and sharing the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s simplified moniker of the First Empire, was the first known human &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire's founding is usually traced to the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20240\"&gt;1E 240&lt;/a&gt;, with the beginning of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vrage\"&gt;Vrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, the Empire would be plunged into a civil war known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, following the death of High King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;. The War of Succession would rage on for fifty years, and would bring about the complete collapse of the Empire in &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, with the loss of all of Skyrim's outlying territories.\nHistory.\nSkyrim Conquests.\nThe inception of the Skyrim Conquests began with the first Nordic discoveries of the proto-&lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; 'Manmeri' beyond the western border of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Khosey\"&gt;Khosey&lt;/a&gt;'s \"&lt;a href=\"Tamrilean%20Tractates\"&gt;Tamrilean Tractates&lt;/a&gt;\", the first sighting of Breton-Manmeri came from a group of Nordic hunters, who, at first, attacked the Bretons believing them some new, undiscovered, strand of &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. Recorded as being \"scarcely recognizable as humans,\" the hunting parties' slaughter only stopped when the oldest of the Manmeri began pleading for his life in some form of broken Nordic dialect. News of this discovery began to spread all across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, eventually to the capital city, &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. There, it was concluded that the Manmeri must have been remnants of human slaves taken from &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; during its fall and sacking, and that ten generations of forced intermingling with &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; had left them with their deformed, elven, appearance. With this verdict, the High King Vrage the Gifted saw no other choice than to invade the neighboring lands of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and liberate the Nord's long separated kinsmen from the tyranny of Elven rulership. Thus began the Skyrim Conquests in &lt;a href=\"1E%20240\"&gt;1E 240&lt;/a&gt;, which in the span of fifty years would carve out an Empire spanning almost the entirety of northern Tamriel. The success of the Skyrim conquests can be partially attributed to the &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;, who could easily breach the defenses of enemy strongholds with their powerful &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh Rock.\nVrage's initial onslaught drove through High Rock, quickly conquering the rolling hills and valleys of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Reach\"&gt;Western Reach&lt;/a&gt;, then moving up towards the banks of the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae River&lt;/a&gt;. Incursions beyond the Bjoulsae, however, were short-lived and were almost always halted due to Elven &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; ability and those Bretons who sided themselves with the Elves. Incidentally, the Nords did manage to dominate High Rock's coastal regions, establishing fortified raiding villages along the shoreline. The most recognizable of these such settlements being &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, established around &lt;a href=\"1E%20246\"&gt;1E 246&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually grow to become one of High Rock's most prominent cities.\nMorrowind.\nEarly on during the conquests, given Vrage's fruitful expansions into High Rock, the enthusiastic Nords of northern Skyrim began to leave their snowy valleys and mountain settlements to mount an incredible invasion into the eastern territory of present-day &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The conquest of Morrowind is often considered to be one of the most epic clashes of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, the Nords took on both the military might of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and the technologically advanced armies of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;. Nord sea raiders frequently harassed the land, dominating many of the scattered Chimer tribes. The long rivalry between the Dwemer and the Chimer played a significant role in the fall of the territory. Another notable factor that influenced the Chimer's poor resistance was the lack of unity between their own tribes. Many tribes of Chimer actually aided the invading forces, with the intent of defeating their opposing tribes. One of the unusual tactics employed by the Nords was the use of &lt;a href=\"the%20Voice\"&gt;the Voice&lt;/a&gt; to conjure up storms, which almost always routed their fearful enemies. While the whole of mainland Morrowind would fall, the deep-seated Dwemer kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; proved a formidable foe for the armies of the First Empire, and was never successfully conquered.\nNibenay.\nInspired by the success of the conquests of High Rock and Morrowind in the north, Nordic earls of Skyrim's southern highlands began scouting out the lands beyond the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to find their own opportunity. Unfortunately for the earls, northern &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the Jeralls proved a small prize for the Nords and was deemed unnecessary of conquest. However, in &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;, favorable circumstances arose for Nordic intervention in Cyrodiil. At the time, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; was spreading throughout the region, which had itself been partially inspired by the Nordic victories against the Elves in the north. In order to ensure her revolt's success, &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; began looking to foreign lands for aid, convincing large Breton and Nordic war bands to help her cause with promises of rich lands and trade concessions. This support would eventually evolve into fully committed military aid from the Nordic Empire, with the creation of a loose alliance between the two factions. The Nords would admit large expanses of the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; into their Empire, with the Nordic mercenaries who settled in the region contributing to the eventual development of the prosperous Nibenean culture.\nDwemer City-States of Skyrim.\nThe High King &lt;a href=\"Gellir\"&gt;Gellir&lt;/a&gt;, who is conventionally believed to have succeeded Vrage, was responsible for conquering the multiple independent &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%23Skyrim\"&gt;Dwemer city-states&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim within a span of three years. The Nords under Gellir's reign were surprised by the swift conquest, as the Dwemer had successfully resisted Nordic occupation for nearly a century. The abrupt collapse of the Dwemer city-states is normally attributed to Gellir's tactical prowess, bolstered by the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, however more recent discoveries suggest other components to the Nords' success. For years the Dwemer city-states had been exhausted from constant internal disputes and infighting over the rare material known as &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt;, discovered shorty after High King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;'s reign (circa &lt;a href=\"1E%20221\"&gt;1E 221&lt;/a&gt;). This period of disunity between the Dwemer, referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Wars\"&gt;Aetherium Wars&lt;/a&gt;, was brought about when an alliance designed to extract Aetherium collapsed, with each member-state attempting to claim the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Forge\"&gt;Aetherium Forge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bthalft\"&gt;Bthalft&lt;/a&gt; for themselves. Over the subsequent decades, the war diminished the power of the Dwemer city-states, allowing for Gellir's subsequent conquest. The only Dwemer freehold within traditional Nordic lands known to have remained completely independent from occupation was the city of &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, whose the inhabitants would submerge underwater until their would-be invaders left.\nBorgas' Reign.\nThe next known ruler of the Empire, the successor to Gellir, was the High King Borgas, who was one of the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;'s chief supporters. His reign saw increased flirtation with the Alessian Empire, to the south. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20358\"&gt;1E 358&lt;/a&gt;, during what is assumed to be Borgas' reign, the Nordic Empire began losing large amount of its territory in &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Bretony\"&gt;Greater Bretony&lt;/a&gt; to the growing power of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt;, being pushed back all the way to the Western Reach. The Alessian Emperor, &lt;a href=\"Ami-El\"&gt;Ami-El&lt;/a&gt;, sent armies to aid in the Nord's struggle, but the forces weren't enough.\nBorgas brought Marukh's great cultural and religious movement, the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reform\"&gt;Alessian Reform&lt;/a&gt;, to Skyrim. He did so by enforcing the strict Alessian's &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Doctrines\"&gt;doctrines&lt;/a&gt; which now governed the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and by outlawing the traditional Nordic Pantheon. Borgas' zeal saw him orchestrate many campaigns in the name of the Alessian faith. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; backed out of an important trade agreement with the Alessian Empire, High King Borgas traveled to Cyrodiil to propose a joint war against the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. To prevent this, the Bosmer initiated a &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of assassinating Borgas for the inequities of his Alessian faith, in which they were successful. Legend holds that his body was secretly returned to Skyrim, and buried in a &lt;a href=\"Korvanjund\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; in which particular location was lost to the ages, along with the Skyrim's ancient and symbolic &lt;a href=\"The%20Jagged%20Crown%20%28Item%29\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of Succession.\nAs Borgas died with no known heirs, a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was formed to determine who would be his successor. While &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hanse\"&gt;Hanse&lt;/a&gt; of Winterhold was believed by many to be the most capable ruler, the Moot failed to elect a legitimate successor, plunging Skyrim into a fifty-year period of widespread conflict and infighting referred to as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. With all of Skyrim's lords fighting to claim the throne, there was little trust to go around. Windhelm, the heart of the Empire, was sacked, showing just how far Nordic unity had collapsed. Even though the war raged on, the Nordic realm would continue to expand in some regions until the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20415\"&gt;1E 415&lt;/a&gt;.\nFall of the Empire.\nWith the armies of Skyrim fighting amongst themselves, the Empire was no longer able to effectively defend its outer territories, giving enemies of the Empire a great opportunity. The Western Reach quickly fell into the hands of the Direnni Hegemony, with the Elves of High Rock slaughtering the region's Nordic population. By the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20401\"&gt;1E 401&lt;/a&gt;, the Direnni Elves had completely removed Nordic influence from High Rock, and then continued pushing further into Skyrim's traditional borders. In the rainforests of Nibenay, the Cyro-Nordic Nibenese people, became culturally and economically self-reliant and separated themselves from the Nords of Skyrim. In the East, the Chimer general &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, once a humble caravan guard, united the bickering Chimer tribes of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, who had now consolidated into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;, and formed an alliance with the Dwemer King, &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;, with the shared goal of pushing the Nords out of their land. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20416\"&gt;1E 416&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwemer and Chimer struck the Nords during their period of weakness, and drove them out with great slaughter. Even the scattered Dwemer City-States of Skyrim began to break free of the Empire's hold. Some myths point to the alliance between the legendary King of Daggerfall, &lt;a href=\"Edward\"&gt;Edward&lt;/a&gt;, and his old friend and companion, the Dunmer King &lt;a href=\"Moraelyn\"&gt;Moraelyn&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the Nords with the help of the Horn of Summoning. Other Nordic tales attribute the rise and fall of the Empire to the prolonged presence and sudden departure of the God of Luck, &lt;a href=\"Sai\"&gt;Sai&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever the reason, with the Nords no longer holding any territories beyond the borders of Skyrim, the Empire was no more.\nEnd of the War of Succession.\nThe War of Succession would finally come to an end with the rise of &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Olaf%20One-Eye\"&gt;Olaf One-Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, who would successfully annex &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; into his domain. At some point, Olaf would also reconquer the Reach from the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;. However, Olaf is mostly remembered for having subdued and captured the great dragon, &lt;a href=\"Numinex\"&gt;Numinex&lt;/a&gt;, in which would remain in his newly built keep, &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, as a symbol of his power. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; was signed, officially ending the War of Succession. Here it was agreed that Olaf One-Eye was the true and rightful heir to the Kingdom of Skyrim. While, Skyrim had now recovered from its most costly war, it would never regain the power it held during the existence of the First Empire of the Nords.\nLegacy.\nWhile the First Empire of the Nords was not long-lasted, in its relatively short existence it upset the balance of power between Elves and Men so much that it is often credited with beginning the age of mannish dominance over Tamriel. Its expansions and military might would be of insurmountable assistance and inspiration to the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; rebellions to the south, and would help bring about the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;First Cyrodilic Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Nordic Empire had a resounding effect on the growing Cyrodilic cultures. Nordic expansion into the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay Valley&lt;/a&gt; contributed to the flourishing of an independent Nibenese identity and culture, while in &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;, the culture and religion can be seen to deeply reflect that of its Nordic counterpart. The mixture of Imperial and Nordic cultures during the beginning of the Cyrodilic Empire is often pointed out as a factor contributing to the development of the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt; faith. Some northern Cyrodilic cities, such as &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, remain almost entirely Nordic.\nThe Nords of the First Empire are also credited with being excellent architects. Masters of wood and timber, the Nords of the First Empire had built many large structures, capable of surviving for thousands of years. This grand form of architecture can be seen reflected in areas heavily influenced by Nordic culture, such as &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; and Bruma. The Nords used a method of lifting massive igneous rocks which were fitted together with no need for mortar. The results of this method of construction were often colossal, nearly impenetrable fortifications, which required very little time to build. Perhaps the most famous display of Nordic architectural achievement of the First Empire is the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Fort\"&gt;Old Fort&lt;/a&gt;, a massive royal bastion built to defend Skyrim's southern frontier. Its stature is so awe-inspiring that some claim that it appears to have been constructed by the mythical &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, rather than mere men. In later years, Nordic techniques were often used and expanded upon by Cyrodilic architects."}

The Dead Gods, &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, are the gods who fought and died to bring about the current world. The Hearth Gods; &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;; are the gods who watch over the present cycle. The Twilight God, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, is the god that ushers in the next cycle. There are also the Testing Gods; &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;; whom the Nords guard against in order to protect the hearth.\nDecline.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; the Nords were still devout followers of their own Pantheon, with the Nords of &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; even refusing to attend sermons of the Nine in favor of their own gods. On the isle of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated following to Kyne existed, known as the &lt;a href=\"Fryse%20Hag\"&gt;Fryse Hag&lt;/a&gt;s. These female Nords were unaccepting of anyone not part of their order, and would engage in combat with them. Most Nords were considered as followers of \"heathen gods\" by members of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, in reference to them keeping to the Nordic Pantheon as opposed to the Nine Divines.\nIn contrast to the Third Era, sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; worship of the Nordic Pantheon had begun to decline, with most of Skyrim instead worshipping the Imperial Divines by &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;. However, mention of the Nordic gods still formed a part of common Nord expressions. The only Nord known to have still worshipped one of the Nordic gods was &lt;a href=\"Froki%20Whetted-Blade\"&gt;Froki Whetted-Blade&lt;/a&gt;, a devout follower of Kyne.\nRevered and worshipped gods.\nShor.\nThe \"God of the Underworld\" and the King of the &lt;a href=\"Gods\"&gt;Gods&lt;/a&gt;, Shor is the Nordic variant of the god &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who took sides with &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; after the creation of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. He is the husband of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; and the creator and ruler of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic afterlife. &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior-king who leads the Nords to victory over their &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i oppressors time and again. Shor was the chief of the gods, until he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;elven gods&lt;/a&gt;. These gods ripped out his heart and flung it across the world, with &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; forming where it landed.\nIf Nords are slain in battle, their &lt;a href=\"souls\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt; find themselves in Sovngarde, the realm of Shor. There their spirits feast, sing and spar within the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt; at Shor's side in a state of self-contained euphoria. The souls of the heroes remain in Sovngarde until they ride out one last time with Shor during The Last War, where they will show their final, best worth.\nShor was not directly included in the pantheon of the Eight Divines, but was instead replaced by his &lt;a href=\"Cyrodilic\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; variant, &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;. As Shezarr, Shor was still represented in a way acceptable to some Nords as \"the spirit behind all human undertaking\" in the Cyrodilic pantheon. Shor, and Shezarr, are suspected to be the same entity as Lorkhan.\nTsun.\nThe Nordic god of trials against adversity. He is brother to &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;, and the shield-&lt;a href=\"Thane%20%28Title%29\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt; of Shor, who died defending Shor from the elven gods. Tsun was sent to Sovngarde and was ordered by Shor to guard the whalebone bridge that leads to entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Hall of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. From there, Tsun tests all who wish to gain entry to the hall by fighting them in a trial by combat; only those who succeed in defeating him are able to gain entry.\nStuhn.\nStuhn, also known as the \"God of Ransom,\" is the brother of &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt; and the Nordic precursor to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. Shield-thane of Shor, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.\nKyne.\nKyne, \"Kiss at the End,\" warrior-widow to Shor and the Goddess of the Storm, is the Nordic variant of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. Kyne is a prominent Divine in Nord culture and is considered by some to be the actual leader of the Nord pantheon. She is a favored god of warriors and hunters. Supporters of the Old Ways among the Nords dismiss Kynareth as a \"pale shadow\" of Kyne, and believe she is the one who leads souls of slain warriors to Sovngarde, the realm of her husband, Shor. She is often called the Mother of Men, as Nords believe that the sky exhaled onto the land at the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt; to form them. Nords still refer to themselves as the \"Sons and Daughters of Kyne\" because of this belief. She is also believed to be the mother of beasts, and she teaches hunters to respect the beasts they hunt. As the Goddess of Storm, Kyne is called upon to bring rain and snow in dry times. She protects her faithful from the raging gales and blizzards that regularly sweep across the Skyrim expanse.\nShe is also known for giving &lt;a href=\"Paarthurnax%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Paarthurnax&lt;/a&gt;, the lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the task of teaching mortalkind the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, thus turning him and other &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; against Alduin.\nKyne is said to be the mother of &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, who was also known as Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne (and also possibly &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;)\nwho was famously the consort of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and father to the first &lt;a href=\"Minotaur\"&gt;Minotaur&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Belharza\"&gt;Belharza&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Token\"&gt;Kyne's Token&lt;/a&gt; is given to warriors after completing &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials\"&gt;Kyne's Sacred Trials&lt;/a&gt;\nMara.\nIn the Nordic Pantheon, Mara is a handmaiden of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, worshipped as the Goddess of Love and &lt;a href=\"Marriage\"&gt;Marriage&lt;/a&gt;. Mara is the most universal goddess, as she is found in nearly every religion. In Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Mara\"&gt;a pendant honoring her&lt;/a&gt; is worn to court lovers. Citizens know that a man or woman wearing one is seeking a candidate for marriage.\nDibella.\nPopular god of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, Dibella is the Goddess of Beauty. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, she has nearly a dozen different forms of worship, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\nOrkey.\nAlso known as Old Knocker, is a Nordic god of mortality and the Nordic variation of &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, who was worshipped during the Aldmeri rule of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. In those days, the Nords believed that they once had a lifespan similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;'. \nNord legend states that Orkey, during the reign of &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Wulfharth\"&gt;High King Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, summoned Alduin the world-eater to shorten the Nords' lives. King Wulfharth, who had become a boy, pleaded to Shor for help. Shor's own ghost then fought Alduin on the spirit plane. Shor was victorious and Orkey's folk, the Orcs, were ruined. Wulfharth, by watching this battle in the sky, learned how to use the thu'um to save his people. His effort, while successful, cost him his life.\nAlduin.\nAlso known as the 'World Eater'. Scholars debate whether Alduin is the name the Nords gave to &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, or if Alduin and Akatosh are two completely different deities. Alduin proclaimed himself to be the \"Firstborn of Akatosh\"\nAlduin's sobriquet, the 'World Eater', comes from a myth that depicts him as a ravaging firestorm that entirely destroyed the previous world, which brought about the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. This would explain why the Nords see him as both creator and harbinger of total destruction.\nYsmir.\nYsmir, \"Dragon of the North,\" is one of the most important hero-gods of the Nords. Ysmir is the Nordic aspect of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;.\nYsmir is a title given to great heroes in Nord history, the first to be bestowed the title was &lt;a href=\"King%20Wulfharth\"&gt;King Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, who was said to have a Thu'um so powerful that he could not speak regularly. He was given the title Ysmir for his zealotry against the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. Wulfharth encountered the god Orkey whilst being &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;, and he died when he used the Thu'um to save his people.\nWulfharth was resurrected several times in history, the alleged first time was by Shor to lead the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, where he was killed at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; by either &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; (it is not known exactly what happened to Wulfharth due to the associated &lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Moment\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt;). He was resurrected again by &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-King\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-King&lt;/a&gt; to help defend Skyrim against an &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invasion, after the invasion was thwarted, he returned to Sovngarde.\nThe Emperor &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; was able to withstand the voice of &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; long enough to hear their prophecy and be named 'Ysmir' for his being &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Tiber Septim eventually founded the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; and ushered in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events that unfold in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, which can be seen in , after completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, the Greybeards greet the Dragonborn in the dragon tongue with the words: \"... Meyz nu Ysmir, Dovahsebrom...\" which translates to: \"... Come now Ysmir, Dragon of the North...\""}

{"id": "1440", "revid": "3262080", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1440", "title": "Nords", "text": "Nords, also known as Sons of Snow (&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Language\"&gt;Dragon Language&lt;/a&gt;: \"Kul-Do-Od\", \"Sons-Of-Snow\") are a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; from the province of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. The Nords have a natural resistance to the frost, which evolved due to their settlement in the northern, colder reaches of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and are known for their prowess as warriors. Some say that the Nords are famously hot-blooded in order to compensate for their freezing environment, and their political climate can be as shifting and dangerous as the winds. Eager to augment their martial skills beyond the traditional methods of Skyrim, they excel in all manner of traditional warfare. Nord culture centers on the quest for honor and glory, with emphasis also on the family and community. Nords see themselves as eternal outsiders and invaders, and even when they conquer and rule another people; they feel no kinship with them. Coming from a warlike culture, they believe that an honorable death in battle will grant them entrance into &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nSkyrim.\nSkyrim is the northernmost landmass of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and according to Nordic tradition, is the site of one of the earliest civilizations founded and governed by &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, many thousands of years ago. These early Men arrived on Tamriel by sailing south from the ancient continent of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;, the northern-most pinnacle of the world. In present day, Skyrim is home mainly to the direct descendants of these Atmorans, a people known as the Nords; large, hardy men and women who are notorious for their militancy and innate resistance to frost and frost magic, both a consequence of the cold, harsh climate of their homelands. Bordered by &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; to the west, Skyrim forms the uppermost province of the continent of Tamriel. To the northeast, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; borders the &lt;a href=\"Holds\"&gt;Holds&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, and far northeast lies the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. Skyrim has nine Holds, each is governed by a &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, who keeps civility and order in their designated Hold. Jarls are largely independent, but swear fealty to Skyrim's &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt;.\nPhysiology.\nThe Nords are a race of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; who typically are regarded as light-skinned, fair-haired which is often braided, and imposing in size and build. They are the direct descendants of the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;, who in ancient days sailed to Tamriel from the frozen continent of Atmora, and to a lesser extent of the &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; peoples, who were human natives of Tamriel that gradually interbred with the Atmorans over the centuries. The Nords, along with the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s, are on average more muscular and larger of size than the other races of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to have an innate resistance to the freezing cold as well as a fierce and uncompromising mindset in the face of adversity; physiological and psychological traits that are likely a consequence of countless generations having successfully endured the harsh, overcast northern climates of Atmora and Skyrim.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Nords were first known as the Atmorans, of the northern continent known as Atmora. It is unknown if the climate of Atmora was ever temperate enough to sustain anything other than a hunter-gatherer population, though there are some references to \"distant green summers\" and \"chilling green shores\" in literature.\nAt some point in Atmoran history, there was a great civil war. In the midst of this, &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, a revered Nordic hero, gathered all who would follow him and sailed south. They eventually came ashore at the northernmost point of Skyrim, at a place now known as &lt;a href=\"Hsaarik%20Head\"&gt;Hsaarik Head&lt;/a&gt;. As there was already an Elven, or &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;, population on the continent, the immigrants had dubbed it \"Mereth.\" Contrary to popular belief, Ysgramor was not the first human to create a settlement in Tamriel; he and his colonists were simply the latest of a long line of immigrants from Atmora. There was, in fact, already an indigenous human population upon their arrival.\nIn the early days, Men and Mer lived in relative peace with one another. Over time, it is said that racial tensions arose as the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; realized that the settlers would soon surpass their own numbers if left unchecked. The decision was made to halt the expansion of the human settlers, using any means necessary. This culminated in the &lt;a href=\"Night%20of%20Tears\"&gt;Night of Tears&lt;/a&gt;, when a Snow Elf army fell upon the unsuspecting human city of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt; and razed the settlement to the ground. The only remnants of the city in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; are the ruins found south of Winterhold.\nIt has also been speculated that the Snow Elves had an alternative motive to their actions. When the city was originally built, the Atmorans uncovered a source of &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;great power&lt;/a&gt; underneath Saarthal and attempted to keep it buried. The elves learned of this and coveted it for themselves.\nOnly Ysgramor and his two sons, Ylgar and &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, escaped the slaughter and returned to Atmora, vowing to avenge their people. Ysgramor returned to Skyrim, bringing with him the famous &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt;, a name later adopted by a &lt;a href=\"The%20Companions\"&gt;group of mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Whiterun\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their return to Tamriel, they slaughtered the Snow Elves living there and began a program to completely eliminate and destitute the Snow Elf population.\nAfter horrific losses to Ysgramor and his Companions, the Snow Elves retreated to their last haven on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. Led by the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Prince\"&gt;Snow Prince&lt;/a&gt;, the Snow Elves took a final stand against the Nords. The conflict between them ended at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Moesring\"&gt;Battle of the Moesring&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Snow Prince was unexpectedly killed by a &lt;a href=\"Finna%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;twelve-year-old girl&lt;/a&gt;. This death shattered the spirit of the remaining Snow Elf warriors. Many fled, and those that remained on the battlefield were killed.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the year &lt;a href=\"1E%20113\"&gt;1E 113&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Harald\"&gt;King Harald&lt;/a&gt;, of the Ysgramor dynasty, was the first man to unify Skyrim, and in 1E 143 the last of the elves (Snow Elves and Ayleids) were driven out of the province. After the 78-year reign of King Harald, a &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was created to establish the next High King from the royal family. This Moot was different from the Moots of Skyrim in the Fourth Era, as this Moot acquired power for itself, which was its ultimate downfall.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%20240\"&gt;1E 240&lt;/a&gt;, King Harald's son, &lt;a href=\"Vrage\"&gt;King Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt;, started the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Conquests\"&gt;Skyrim Conquests&lt;/a&gt;. He carved out the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;First Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the Nords and by 1E 290 ruled all the northern regions of Tamriel. These regions included &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, most of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, and some northern reaches of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The capital of the Empire was &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, a city built by Ysgramor after his conquest of the elves. His keep, the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt;, still stands, housing the Jarl of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;. It\u00b4s one of the few structures still intact from the First Era.\nBut after the rein of King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, who was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, the First Empire began to crumble. As there was no heir to the throne, the now ineffective &lt;a href=\"Moot\"&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt; was unable to establish a new &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;High King of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, beginning the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire lost all lands beyond Skyrim, and was never able to regain these provinces.\nThe War of Succession ended in &lt;a href=\"1E%20420\"&gt;1E 420&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Pact of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt;, which stated that a Moot would only be held when the High King died with no living heirs. After this, Skyrim's successions would not be disputed on the battlefield until the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Late First Era, there was an invasion from &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. These men, who came from the North, were the &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Akaviri Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, from whom the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; claim origin. The Nords, the warriors they were, were the first to challenge these invaders. However, the Nords were defeated and the Dragonguard carved a path through Skyrim. The Nords joined &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Pale%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Pale Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Accounts on the battle vary, but was ultimately a victory secured against the Akaviri, who swore loyalty to Reman Cyrodiil.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dawn of the Second Era saw even more conflict for the Nords. Led by the general &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Hjalti Early-Beard&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic Holds were locked in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; of High Rock over territory within Skyrim. Allying himself with the Colovian king &lt;a href=\"Cuhlecain\"&gt;Cuhlecain&lt;/a&gt;, Hjalti was able to push the Reachmen back into the nearly impregnable fortress at Old Hrol'dan. The two forces seemed at an impasse until the intervention of a Nord King specter, &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;. Ysmir came to Hjalti in the night, and taught him the &lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;. When the morning came, Hjalti led his army to the gates of the fortress and shouted down its walls, achieving victory. Hjalti was then given the name &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Stormcrown.\nHowever, the Nordic people resented the fact that Cuhlecain and Hjalti sought to reforge the old Empire. In the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20852\"&gt;2E 852&lt;/a&gt;, shortly after the two generals traveled to Cyrodiil, an allied force of Nords and Bretons marched south and conquered all major passes and settlements in the &lt;a href=\"Jerall%20Mountains\"&gt;Jerall Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Staging their forces at &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; for the winter, the allied invaders dared Talos to face them. Talos could only amass a small army to stand before the walls, so he resorted to subterfuge. Though the fort was surrounded by unscalable terrain, a Breton traitor showed the general a small mountain trail that would lead his forces into Sancre Tor from the rear. The Nord-Breton alliance only saw that the general had left a severely weakened force in the field and, leaving a small force to man the walls, they sallied forth to take the field. Meanwhile, Talos reclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; and led his forces from within the walls of Sancre Tor. Using his army and his Thu'um, he swept aside the defenders and took the keep. Seeing this, the Nords abandoned their alliance and swore fealty to Talos, claiming him heir to the Empire. Soon after, Hjalti took the name &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and declared a new &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which now included the Nords of Skyrim. Skyrim itself, however, still had to be conqeured. Though there aren't many details regarding the invasion, it is known that the of warchiefs of &lt;a href=\"Danstrar\"&gt;Danstrar&lt;/a&gt; fought against Imperial forces. It is also known that Skyrims conquest was a \"ballet\" compared to the conquest of Hammerfell.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third Era began with a royal wedding in Skyrim, between &lt;a href=\"Mantiarco\"&gt;Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; and young &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt;, later called the Wolf Queen. The already-widower Mantiarco married the young Septim daughter by accident of custom, as she stole the Promise of Marriage actually meant for her mother. However, the marriage proceeded and Mantiarco came to love Potema. She went on to bear him a son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, it was discovered that Mantiarco's first son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Bathorgh\"&gt;Bathorgh&lt;/a&gt;, was actually the love child of his first wife and his warchief &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thone\"&gt;Lord Thone&lt;/a&gt;. In his grief, Mantiarco expelled his son from the realm, never to be heard from again. Whether or not Bathorgh was actually born of this affair is still a matter of debate.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20121\"&gt;3E 121&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; was fought with the Wolf Queen's son, Uriel Septim III, who claimed &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt; was a bastard and her claim to the throne was therefore false. With the help of this mother, Uriel Septim gathered forces from &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, northern &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and Skyrim. With these, he was able to conquer enough of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to proclaim himself Emperor. But during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; his army was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, and Uriel himself was captured. He was on route to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; when the caravan was attacked by vigilantes, killing Uriel. The war ended when &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; was killed in the last siege of Solitude.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, a battlemage, posed as Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; old animosities between Skyrim and their neighbors in Hammerfell and High Rock were reignited, setting off the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt;. One of but many wars occurring during the Simulacrum, the conflict saw the reclamation of territory Nords had not claimed since the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;1st Era&lt;/a&gt;. Peace was finally restored when Uriel VII wrested the throne from his impersonator.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, Skyrim appeared relatively unscathed, moreover, its economy and society profited from the turmoil that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. More than a century later, in the year &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, a war broke out between the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;Empire of Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. This war was extremely devastating and both sides suffered heavy losses, a treaty was formed between both parties, and was known as the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. This agreement included many conditions, some of the main terms that 'affected the Nords' were the outlawing of the &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; worship and the disbandment of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. This enabled the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; to move freely throughout the entire Empire, thus allowing them to hunt down any Talos worshipers and slaughter the last of the Blades. As a result, many Nords began to favor Skyrim's secession from the Empire. Eventually &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, organized these rebels into the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, Ulfric challenged the &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Torygg\"&gt;High King of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; to a duel. Ulfric slew him with the legendary &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; which sparked the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt; between Ulfric's supporters and the citizens of Skyrim that stayed loyal to the Empire. The latter were backed by numerous outposts of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; across Skyrim.\nSociety and culture.\nThe Nords consider themselves to be the children of the sky, referring to Skyrim as the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;, because they believe it is where the sky exhaled the North Winds on the land and formed them. When they defeat great enemies they take their tongues as trophies. These are woven into ropes and can hold speech like an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Nords have a reputation of being fierce proud warriors. Nord warriors are said to value their fierce independence, are hardy in the thankless severity of their lands, and are comfortable with appalling violence as a daily occurrence. Their armor and weaponry reflects their boisterous fury, but may also be revered as part of a family's trappings. For the Nord is a warrior race, and all from the goat farmer to the High King own an armament of some kind. The typical Nord warrior holds his or her reputation in high regard and insulting a Nord's strength, bravery, or honor in any way almost inevitably leads to violence as the offended party attempts to prove otherwise. They are also known to revel in the imbibing of their drink of choice: &lt;a href=\"Mead\"&gt;Mead&lt;/a&gt;. Refusing a drink is seen as an admittance of weakness and is a sure way to alienate yourself from the Nords that invited you to their revelry. Though they may seem rude, insults are not always meant to offend and can be used as terms of endearment.\nAside from being warriors, Nords excel in blacksmithing and craftmanship. For the Nord, the creation of fine (if inelegant) weapons and armor is as important as proficiency with a blade, axe, or hammer. Such skills are learned from youth and are almost mandatory. Through the ages, the Nords have learned to manipulate steel the way a sculptor would clay. Most Nords are also literate and can both read and write. Those who value the art of speechcraft become &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt;s. Some of these bards become skalds, who use their talents in writing, music, and poetry to record tales of the sights they've seen and the battles they've fought.\nA spiritual relationship exists between the Nords and the life-force of breathing, which is associated with the Sky Goddess &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. Breathing is integral to Nordic society and culture. While the art of speech was usually associated with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, the art of breathing and the use of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, or Storm Voice, was associated with Kynareth. Kynareth was the goddess who gave Men the ability to speak. Breath and the voice were the vital essence of a Nord. Almost all Nords had the ability to speak, but some had the ability to use the Thu'um, or Storm Voice. Those Nords who could articulate their breath into a &lt;a href=\"Shout\"&gt;Shout&lt;/a&gt; were called &lt;a href=\"Tongues\"&gt;Tongues&lt;/a&gt;. The most powerful Tongues cannot speak without causing destruction. They must go gagged, and communicate through a sign language and through scribing runes. Wind was fundamental to the Nords and it is said that the further north one goes into Skyrim, the more powerful and elemental the people become. Those that live in the far wastes always carry a wind with them and thus require less shelter and dwellings. The expression \"Wind guide you\" was a common expression in Nordic culture. The use of the Thu'um as a weapon has not only been lost, but is forbidden by the Empire. Apart from the students of the discredited School of Thu'um in the Imperial City, Ulfric Stormcloak was reputedly the last man to wield this power. However, the ancient &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; still sit atop the many steps leading to the peak of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, where the Nordic race was born, meditating on the known Shouts.\nThe main religion of Skyrim is the Imperial faith of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, the hero god of Man, being their chief among them. This became a major point of contention between the Nords of Skyrim and the Empire in the 4th Era, due to a provision in the White Gold Concordat that outlawed Talos worship at the behest of their ancient enemies, the elves. This would quickly lead to the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, which the Nords saw as a War for Independence.\nDespite the Imperial Religion being the most common, there are still many Nords who keep the old gods of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. This pantheon closely resembles the Imperial Pantheon, which is natural since the latter was largely based on it. But there are stark differences in the aspects, with &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, being the chief among them. The Nords know Shor as the king of the gods, the champion of Men in their struggles against the elves. But since according to legend Shor, the Nordic name for &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, was killed by the elven gods, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, Shor's widow and the original Nordic version of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, is considered by many to be the most important and most revered in the pantheon. Her titles are numerous. She is called \"Shor's Blessed Warrior-Wife,\" the \"Mother of Men,\" and the \"Kiss at the End,\" for most Nords believe that it is Kyne who leads the heroic dead to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. She is revered as the Goddess of the Storm, the Blizzard, the Winds, and the Rain. It was she who gifted the Nords with innate resistance to the cold, and the Thu'um. Warriors favor Kyne, as they call upon her for strength in battle and victory in conflict. Nord hunters also acknowledge her as the mother of Men and beasts. &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Sacred%20Trials\"&gt;Kyne's Sacred Trials&lt;/a&gt; prove the worth of Nord hunters in Kyne's eyes. Kyne teaches Nords to respect the beasts and blesses the hunter who will face their champions. True Nord hunters are those who survive the Trials and consequently earn Kyne's blessing. She is also credited with sending her son &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; (and perhaps &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;) to the aid of the Cyro-Nordic slaves in their uprising.\nLike most other cultures, the Daedra are not widely revered or worshipped by the Nords. That being said, not all Daedra are considered equally disdainful or even evil. &lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of the Hunt, is particularly favored by many hunters and woodsmen who worship Kyne for the same reasons. But for the most part, Daedra worship is widely looked down upon. Yet despite this, one will find clandestine shrines and altars to these beings dotted throughout Skyrim.\nAn isolated tribe living on the island of Solstheim known as the &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; follow a different form of faith from their mainland cousins. Instead of the pantheistic religions more common throughout the continent, they worship the All-Maker, a benevolent, unknowable creator-deity and supreme god of nature. They do this through shamanistic rites and veneration of the All-Maker stones; giant monoliths dedicated to 6 key aspects of nature: Sun, Wind, Water, Wood, Earth, and Beast. These pillars of their god are no mere superstition, as they radiate powerful spiritual energies, and are sought after by both devotees as well as malignant forces. In this regard, wolves and bears are seen as sacred, and all of nature is to be respected. This is what gives the Skaal their shamanic powers.\nThe antithesis of the All-Maker is known only as The Adversary. This \"devil\" is purported to take many forms, including The Greedy Man, a demon who legend has it relishes in tormenting Men and mocking the All-Maker's creation.\nThe Skaal are also aware of some Daedric Princes, such as &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, whom they call \"Herma-Mora.\" Naturally, they do not worship them, but fear and even despise them."}

In the first room are several &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd stones&lt;/a&gt; along with skeletons on altars in small siderooms along the corridor.

Some are locked, usually average.\nTo reach the shrine on the ledge in the main chamber can be a little hard. One must go through the lost catacombs and most of the doors are blocked by ruins and there are enemies everywhere. But earlier explorers may have made large holes in the walls to move forward into the ruin.\nAs it is underwater, there are no &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"plants\"&gt;plants&lt;/a&gt; in the vicinity.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shrine%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;The Shrine of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; has completed their &lt;a href=\"Pilgrimage%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt;, they will receive a vision from &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;.

He founded the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; in response to the growing influence of the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and the failure of his former order to act against the threat. He and his followers eventually defeated Mannimarco's necromancer army. Galerion died in this last great battle. He is sometimes referred to as \"The Great Mage.\"\nHistory.\nTrechtus.\nDuring the early bloody years of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, Vanus Galerion was born under the name Trechtus, a servant on the estate of Lord Gyrnasse of Sollicich-on-Ker, a minor nobleman.\nTrechtus' father.\nHis father and mother were common laborers, but his father had secretly taught himself and then his son to read, against the law of Lord Gyrnasse. The lord had been advised that literate servants were an abomination of nature and dangerous to themselves and their lords, and had closed all bookstalls in Sollicich-on-Ker. All booksellers, poets, and teachers were forbidden, except those in Gyrnasse's keep. Nevertheless, a small scale smuggling operation kept a number of books and scrolls in circulation right under Gyrnasse's nose. However, when Trechtus was eight, the smugglers were found and imprisoned. It was said that Trechtus' mother, an ignorant and religious woman, fearful of her husband, had betrayed the smugglers, but there were other rumors as well. The trial of the smugglers was a farce, and the punishment came quickly. The body of Trechtus' father was kept hanging for weeks during the hottest summer Sollicich-on-Ker had seen in centuries.\nVanus Galerion.\nTrechtus fled from Lord Gyrnasse's estate three months later. He made it as far as &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, half-way across the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. A band of troubadours found him nearly dead, curled up in a ditch by the side of the road, nursed him to health, and employed him as an errand boy in return for food and shelter. One of the troubadours, a soothsayer named Heliand, began testing Trechtus' mind and found the boy, though shy, to be preternaturally intelligent and sophisticated given his circumstances. Heliand recognized in the boy a commonality, for Heliand had been trained on the Isle of Artaeum as a mystic.\nWhen the troupe was performing in the village of Potansa on the far eastern end of Summerset, Heliand took Trechtus, then a boy of eleven, to the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, the Magister of the Isle, recognized potential in Trechtus and took him on as pupil, giving him the name of Vanus Galerion. Vanus trained his mind, as well as his body, on the Isle of Artaeum.\nMannimarco.\nThe two best apprentices of Artaeum were Vanus Galerion and Mannimarco. While Galerion used his talents wisely and honorably in honor of the memory of his father, Mannimarco began an objective study of the dark arts. He became fascinated by the secrets of the necromancers, and was seduced into the practice of entrapping and enslaving souls. When Mannimarco experimented with a foul spell, he drew the attention of Galerion. Vanus confronted his fellow student beneath the Ceporah Tower, saying, \"Your wicked mysticism is no way to wield your power. Your studies must cease, because you only bring horror to the spirit world.\" Corrupted by his experiences, Mannimarco laughed, as he had come to hate the ways of life and peace. He returned to his studies and his experiments of death and decay.\nThen the Psijic Order sent Mannimarco, now a full necromancer, to the mainland to run an errand. In Tamriel, Mannimarco began to develop his own plans and started collecting corpses and souls, freed from the laws of the Order. Galerion told his masters they had made a mistake, stating, \"You have found a wolf, and sent the beast to flocks of sheep.\" All Tamriel was now threatened, since Mannimarco would be able to gather followers in Tamriel's mainland. \"A terror on Tamriel has set,\" Galerion said.\nThe masters ignored Galerion's warnings and took no action against the growing threat. \"Speak no more of him,\" the sage Cloaks of Gray said. They eventually forgot completely about their mistake, though Galerion did not forget.\nThe Mages Guild.\nVanus Galerion saw that the Psijics had become set in their ways and would not change. For things to change, a new order had to be created. The mage began collecting magic-users from around the Summerset Isles, from all social classes. Galerion operated out of the urban center of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, employing an attitude that magical experiments should be conducted only in unpopulated areas. Even more shocking, he proposed to make magical items, potions, and even spells available to any member of the general public who could afford to pay. No longer was magic to be limited only to the aristocracy and the intellectuals. It was because of his background, of \"want and injustice, that he received his philosophy of sharing knowledge.\"\nGalerion was brought before his former master Iachesis and the King of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rilis%20XII\"&gt;Rilis XII&lt;/a&gt;, to justify his intentions for the fraternity he was forming. The fact that Galerion's speech to Rilis and Iachesis was not recorded for posterity is doubtless a tragedy, though it does afford opportunity for historians to amuse one another with speculation about the lies and persuasions Galerion might have used to found the organization. However, the charter was approved.\nAlmost immediately after the Guild was formed, the question of security came up. The Isle of Artaeum did not require force of arms to shield it from invaders, because the Psijic Order had the power to prevent anyone from landing by making the Isle and all its inhabitants become insubstantial. The new Mages Guild had to hire guards. Galerion soon discovered what the Tamrielic nobility had known for thousands of years: Money alone does not buy loyalty. So in order to protect his order, or \"Guild,\" Vanus created another order to be their guardians. The knights of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Lamp\"&gt;Order of the Lamp&lt;/a&gt; followed their own local Palatinus, or leader, who was under direct orders from the &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt;. The knights were given appropriate rights to certain services at the Mages Guild and one's rank within the Order approximated one's rank within the Guild, in terms of rights and privileges. Only those who had already demonstrated fighting skills and were on good terms with the Mages Guild were accepted as guardians.\nVanus Galerion decided that the Mages Guild would be ruled by a supreme council of six mages. Each Guildhall was to be given a guildhead, assisted by the counsel of a Master of Incunabula and a Master at Arms. The Master of Incunabula presided over an additional counsel of two mages, the Master of Academia and the Master of the Scrye. The Master at Arms also had a counsel of two, the Master of Initiates and the Palatinus, the leader of the local chapter of the Order of the Lamp.\nThe Mages Guild grew branches all over Summerset Isle and gradually the mainland of Tamriel. There were numerous records of superstitious or sensibly fearful rulers forbidding the Guild in their domains, but their heirs or heirs' heirs eventually recognized the wisdom of allowing the Guild free rein. The Mages Guild has become a powerful force in Tamriel. There have been only a few rare incidents of the Mages Guild actually becoming involved in local political struggles. On these occasions, the Guild's participation had been the ultimate decider in the conflict. One need not be a member of the Mages Guild to know that this carefully contrived hierarchy was often nothing more than a chimera. As Vanus Galerion himself said bitterly, leaving Tamriel to travel to other lands, \"The Guild has become nothing more than an intricate morass of political infighting.\".\nThe King of Worms.\nMeanwhile, during the rise of the Mages Guild and its descent into decadence, Mannimarco established a base of operations and stretched his dark grip through Tamriel's deserts, forests, towns, mountains, and seas. Mannimarco had dabbled deeper and deeper into secrets long forgotten until the rot of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; sunk to his very core. He gathered many followers and servants, and corrupted wizards and witches from all over Tamriel came to him with cursed artifacts and gifts. The Order of the Black Worm was born.\nMages who joined him brought him tomes, enchanted weapons and armor, blood-tainted herbs and oils, &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; poison, bonemeal of dead saints, human skin, toadstools, roots and other alchemical ingredients. Mannimarco absorbed the dark energy out of these objects, and as a result life-energy was sucked out of him. His body became that of a corpse and his blood poison and acid. His power and the duration of his life grew along with his arsenal.\nThe Great Battle.\nVanus Galerion had never forgotten his nemesis Mannimarco. He had always searched for clues of the necromancer's presence but did not find him. When Mannimarco resurfaced, Galerion amassed an army of his most loyal mages and Lampknights and traveled north to a cursed mountain path to settle his business with Mannimarco. \"Before my last breath, I must face the tyranny of worms, and kill the undeath at last.\"\nGalerion and his army were met by an equally powerful army of necromancers on the mountain, and both sides were ready to do battle. Galerion cried to Mannimarco, \"Surrender, Worm King. Hand over your artifacts and their power to me, and you shall live until dead sees fit.\" Mannimarco answered with a hollow laugh, \"You die first.\" The two armies then clashed, lightning and frost cascading around them. The necromancers summoned various undead creatures to their sides which were slain by streams of light forged by the battlemages. Galerion discovered before the end of the battle that Mannimarco was no longer alive, but had turned himself into the first &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; ever and thus gained immortality. Galerion's army won the battle and managed to crush the remaining necromancers. Mannimarco disappeared from the scene and was not seen again for ages.\nUnfortunately, Galerion died in the great battle along with a thousand other battlemages and necromancers, though his legacy lived on in Tamriel's history and literature. The practice of necromancy would live on."}

Speak with it and it will reveal that Vanus has entered the forge in an attempt to destroy the daedric machinery here, including &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Shackle\"&gt;The Great Shackle&lt;/a&gt; which is key to the invasion of Tamriel. \nHead into the Black Forge. You will find the entrance by island hopping across the pool of lava in front of you. Head along the hallway into the first big room. there, cross the bridge and you will find something called Galerion's Health, an essence of Vanus Galerion. Talk to it and it will tell you that the Daedra captured Vanus and planned to use him to power the Great Shackle, so he split his essence into three fragments to prevent this. the essence of health will then tell you that the vampires in the room are feeding on its energy, and that you should kill them and recover the energy to free it. \nKill five of the vampires, then return to the essence. It will now be free of its shackles, and will guide you toward the Essence of Stamina, in the slave quarters. Head down the hallway to the south. Take care to avoid the fire traps on the floor. The first room you come across should hold Galerion's Stamina. It will tell you that it has been used to give the soul shriven here energy to continue their labour. There are two ways to retrieve the energy; you can convince the workers to give it up willingly, or you can use a device to extract it from a distance, killing the worker. The device can be found in the room to the north. Either way, once you have the energy, return to Galerion's Stamina and set it free. It will tell you that the last essence is in the foundry, and show you the way there. \nHead east. You will have to make your way through several daedra-infested rooms, so take care. The last essence will be in the second square room. Beware the traps on the floor as you approach it. It will tell you that it is being used by Molag Bal to power the machines here for the construction of the Great Shackle, which is a more powerful &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; that will considerably speed up Bal's invasion of Nirn. He will ask you to unlock the seals of binding that keep him trapped. Each of these is guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Cold-Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Cold-Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt;, so take care. Once the seals are unlocked, talk to the essence again and you will have freed all of Vanus Galerion's essences. \nAll that remains is to free Vanus's physical body. Head throught the passage to the south, into the tunnels. You will run into the dremora &lt;a href=\"Kothutuilk\"&gt;Kothutuilk&lt;/a&gt;, who is guarding the door to the room where Vanus's body is. Kill her, then head on. You will find yourself in a room with Vanus's body three pillars, each a conduit for one of Vanus's essences. Activate them, and the essences will return to Vanus. Vanus will tell you to follow him outside; head outside, then talk to him there to finish the quest and start the next one, &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20the%20Shackle\"&gt;Breaking the Shackle&lt;/a&gt;."}

This enraged &lt;a href=\"Tanval%20Indoril\"&gt;Tanval Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, the Grandmaster of House Indoril, and he took an ancient artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Coral%20Heart\"&gt;Coral Heart&lt;/a&gt; from the Pact. His plan was to travel to the Tormented Spire and to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Sadal\"&gt;Sadal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20of%20Strife%20%28Daedra%29\"&gt;Brothers of Strife&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the remnants of the Covenant and whoever stepped in his way. He fled with his Vanguard to &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, to gain entrance into the Tormented Spire.\nTanval kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Sen%20Dres\"&gt;Sen Dres&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Grandmaster%20Omin%20Dres\"&gt;Grandmaster Omin Dres&lt;/a&gt; to use as leverage to getting into the Tormented Spire with his Vanguard.

Using the information given to them by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige was able to infiltrate the Dres Crypts and rescue Sen. The Vestige along with the Ebonheart Pact gained access into the Tormented Spire and fought their way to the top.\nBattle atop of the Tormented Spire.\nTanval Indoril had already reached in the inner caldera of the Tormented Spire, but the Ebonheart Pact was able to follow suit and defeat the Vanguard. Tanval Indoril began to realize his mistakes and began to aid the Pact into re-sealing Sadal. Tanval's ritual had angered the spirits guarding Sadal and another battle was fought with the Ancient Mages of &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i. The Vestige along with Holgunn One-Eye, &lt;a href=\"Walks-in-Ash\"&gt;Walks-in-Ash&lt;/a&gt;, and Tanval Indoril entered the inner sanctum and subdued Sadal inside the Tormented Spire. Tanval died in the act but was able to help in spirit form.

The war broke out as a result of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20worship\"&gt;Daedra worship&lt;/a&gt; becoming legal in the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Under the council of &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the revolt began.\nHistory.\nThe war started in &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, and began with the construction of a great wall, which would be known as &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. This wall served as a division between the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of Cyrodiil, in order to protect the people of the region from a possible Imperial retaliation under the command of Emperor Leovic. With the aid of numerous volunteers, as well as paid workers, the Wall was being built by all materials the people could find, including scavenged materials from the countryside. In a year's time, construction of the Wall was completed, stretching from the Abecean Sea to the Strid River. Within the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, Varen had kept a &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt%20Forge%20Yard\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt; burning, so that his Legions could resupply and rearm themselves if they needed to.\nWhen the wall was completed in &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;, Varen left the Gold Coast with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Legion\"&gt;Second Legion&lt;/a&gt; to push his rebellion into the heartlands of Cyrodiil. Varen left his nephew, &lt;a href=\"Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, behind so he could rule &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; while Varen advanced towards the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Upon Varen's advances into the rest of Cyrodiil, the Imperial Prefect of &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; alongside its &lt;a href=\"Count\"&gt;Count&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ephrem%20Benirus\"&gt;Ephrem Benirus&lt;/a&gt;, sent out Imperial forces in an attempted to retake the lands from the rebels. The attempt failed, with the cohort left behind by Varen as well as the Kvatch Warders severely reducing the strength of the Legionnaires sent by Anvil. Three more attempts would be made by Anvil to retake Kvatch, and all three would fail.\nIn the Heartlands itself, Varen's rebellion suffered a defeat at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Ash\"&gt;Fort Ash&lt;/a&gt;, after which he took command of the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20Chorrol\"&gt;Legion of Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, with which he pushed the Longhouse Legions back. With the news spreading throughout the province, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Estates\"&gt;Colovian Estates&lt;/a&gt; rose behind Varen, and aided him in defeating the Longhouse Emperor. In the battle to liberate &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; from Longhouse control, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt; set out with mercenaries, who betrayed him upon arrival at the city, attempting to kill him, but failing to do so. Sahan ended up liberating the city on his own, killing both the mercenaries as well as Leovic's defenders. He would return to the base of operations of the rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Bruma\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; to report the news.\nThe rest of the war would consist of many a bloody battle, with the Longhouse Legions being bolstered by &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; auxiliaries and Daedric magic, both sides found victories and defeats, until the rebels managed to fight their way to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; itself. With the aid of council obtained from &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, Varen's Legions advanced into the city.\nUpon arriving at the Imperial City, Varen's legions would fight against the Longhouse Legions, meeting their last stand in what was then the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt;. The Longhouse Legions fought for a week until they were defeated, after which the bodies were buried in mass graves. The rebellion was over, and the district was named the &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20District\"&gt;Memorial District&lt;/a&gt; by Emperor Varen. With the Longhouse Legions defeated, Varen's army advanced to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;, killing Leovic at the site."}

Allow me to elucidate the wall and its importance to the region, the rebellion, and the ongoing strife personified by the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly after the start of &lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Rebellion\"&gt;Varen's Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, Aquilarios ordered his followers to begin construction of a wall to protect &lt;a href=\"Kvatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the Gold Coast from retaliation by the Longhouse Emperor and his troops. Aquilarios, determined to take the battle to the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, didn't want to leave his home and original seat of power open to retribution by his enemies in his absence. He enlisted the famed engineer &lt;a href=\"Jaros%20Truptor\"&gt;Jaros Truptor&lt;/a&gt; to design and oversee the project, ordering him to build a strong, tall defense in record time.\nWith a cadre of paid workers and an ever-growing army of eager volunteers, Jaros set about the task at hand. Deciding that speed and solid construction were more important than any aesthetic values, Jaros designed a relatively simple plan that allowed for the use of whatever building materials his workers were able to scavenge from the surrounding countryside. Natural rock and stone, pieces of ruined structures, purchased building supplies - even parts scavenged from the estates dotting the countryside - all were gathered for use in raising Varen's Wall.\nJaros's design of the wall itself was simple, utilitarian, and not anywhere near as visually appealing as the other projects he's know for. The wall was a mic of rough-hewn stone, mismatched rocks, blocks commandeered from the estates of willing and unwilling donors, and even the natural contours of the land itself. Towers rose from the wall in a more of less regular pattern, breaking up the expanse of stone and providing locations for guards, watchmen, or even garrisons of soldiers to congregate along the defended border.\nDue to Varen's popularity among the common folk of Kvatch and &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; Counties, Jaros was able to form a volunteer work crew that provided him with more than enough workers to keep construction going day and night. But popularity alone didn't inspire the people to donate their time and effort. It was Varen's words and deeds that accomplished that. He convinced the people that his rebellion was not only just, it was necessary to stop the &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Leovic\"&gt;Emperor Leovic&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, he rallied the people to help defend themselves and their land, and within a year Varen's Wall stretched from the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, winding its way thought the countryside southwest of the Colovian Highlands, eventually terminating at the &lt;a href=\"Strid%20River\"&gt;Strid River&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd important as Varen's Wall was to protecting the region during Varen's Rebellion, it has played an even greater role since the fall of the Empire and the start of the Three Banners War. As the war for &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; rages on, Varen's Wall has protected the counties of Kvatch and Anvil from the worst fallout of the ongoing battles taking place at what was once the heart of the shattered Empire. It has created a kind of safe harbor in which the people of the Gold Coast have thrived. In some ways, it has become a sort of political experiment to see whether the law and order typified by Kvatch and the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Akatosh\"&gt;Cathedral of Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; of the more chaotic nature of Anvil and it's collection of pirates and smugglers will win out as the ultimate power in the area."}

He became Emperor when he overthrew &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt; during an uprising after Leovic made &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship legal in Cyrodiil. After becoming Emperor, he married Leovic's wife, &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nVaren was born in &lt;a href=\"2E%20536\"&gt;2E 536&lt;/a&gt; as the son of a &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; Duke, and later became the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. He had an unknown sibling whose son, &lt;a href=\"Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, in turn being Varen's nephew, viewed him as a role model. When &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, third of the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; dynasty known as the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, assumed the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, he legalized &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship across the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This outraged much of the population, and prompted Varen to spark a rebellion.\nHe left his homefront, the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, in the hands of his nephew Carolus. Using large amounts of stone, Varen constructed a wall spanning around the Gold Coast, later dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;\", in order to protect the region should Leovic's forces arrive.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren summoned the military forces of the Colovian Highlands. Secretly, he also contacted &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, who would later become one of his Five Companions, for assistance to \"\"depose those &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;foul strangers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;the north&lt;/a&gt;\"\". Varen based his rebellion out of the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently won many victories across &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, Varen and his army stormed the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, before breaking into the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; and driving his sword into Leovic's heart at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, thus instantly killing him, and immediately declaring himself Emperor. For Abnur's loyalty and assistance in the rebellion, Varen agreed to take Leovic's widow, &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, as his bride. Due to the mass amount of casualties during the uprising, Varen converted the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial City into the &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20District\"&gt;Memorial District&lt;/a&gt;, filling it with mass graves.\nEmperor.\n&lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;The Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren's rule went mostly without problems, but he was constantly worrying about him being an illegitimate ruler as he was not &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelieving that only a Dragonborn can rightfully take the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;, he formed the Five Companions to find the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer Mannimarco convinced him that he knew a ritual that would allow Varen to become Dragonborn. After hearing of this, he set out on a two-year quest to find the Amulet with his Five Companions: Varen himself, the half-giant warrior &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; blademaster and the captain of his personal &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, and Elder Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five were able to recover the Amulet and begin the ritual in &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt;. They gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City and began to perform the ritual. While Tharn held the Amulet, Varen asked Akatosh to rightfully grant his claim as emperor by making him a Dragonborn. At that moment, Mannimarco immobilized everyone present and revealed his true intentions; he was an agent of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and the ritual did not reignite the Dragonfires, but in fact did the exact opposite, destroying the ancient barriers shielding Mundus from the forces of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and thus allowing Molag Bal to begin the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, a forceful attempt to drag Nirn out of Mundus and into his own realm of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. This event was known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, and it shook every corner of Tamriel.\nSubsequently, Lyris was captured and brought into Coldharbour. Sai Sahan fled with the Amulet and managed to hide it in &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; before also being captured later on. Mannimarco summoned his &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; and turned the Temple of the One into a sacrificial ground where dozens of souls were harvested and brought to Coldharbour, and Abnur joined him in order to gain his trust and spy on him. Varen, however, disappeared.\nStudying &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;the Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Soulburst, Varen woke up weak and near death at the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Abbey of the Moth Priests&lt;/a&gt;, with as Emperor. The Moth priests took pity on him, assuming he was a lost vagabond, and gave him shelter within their establishment.\nIt was there where he set his eyes on the Elder Scrolls, mysterious artifacts of immense knowledge and power. He began to study and read the scrolls in order to learn the events of Tamriel which have happened and have yet to happen, including his life as Emperor and his destiny with the Vestige. The priests were shocked to discover how quickly he managed to read the scrolls, believing it to be a prophetic sign from the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of continuously reading the scrolls, Varen gradually lost his eyesight. He carved himself &lt;a href=\"The%20Emperor%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;a staff&lt;/a&gt; which he also used as a walking stick.

When Mannimarco discovered this, he arrested the Prophet under the grounds of rumor-mongering and treason. The King of Worms had the abbey and its contents burned to the ground, and transferred Varen into the custody of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. Bal then initiated the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; upon &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and had Varen imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;The Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a mortal was captured and sacrificed by Mannimarco. Their soul was brought to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour. After being transported to Coldharbour, a projection of Varen, using the pseudonym \"The Prophet\", appeared before them, giving the mortal the name of Vestige and telling them to find &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Lyris was unaware that The Prophet was her fellow Five Companions member Varen.\nThe Vestige journeyed through the prison with Lyris after she freed them.

Lyris then chants for her to take Varen's place in the cell, freeing Varen but imprisoning Lyris. Varen, still concealing his identity, and the Vestige journey to a portal out of Coldharbour. They strike down the Guardian of the portal, and Varen restores the Vestige's corporeal form before they both return to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in different locations."}

He is the founding member of the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;, and plays a crucial role in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt; of .\nBackground.\nVaren was born in &lt;a href=\"2E%20536\"&gt;2E 536&lt;/a&gt; as the son of a &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt; Duke, and later became the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. He had an unknown sibling whose son, &lt;a href=\"Carolus%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Carolus Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt;, in turn being Varen's nephew, viewed him as a role model. When &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt;, third of the short-lived &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; dynasty known as the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, assumed the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, he legalized &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; worship across the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. This outraged much of the population, and prompted Varen to spark a rebellion.\nHe left his homefront, the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Dark%20Brotherhood%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, in the hands of his nephew Carolus. Using large amounts of stone, Varen constructed a wall spanning around the Gold Coast, later dubbed \"&lt;a href=\"Varen%27s%20Wall%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Varen's Wall&lt;/a&gt;\", in order to protect the region should Leovic's forces arrive.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Revolt\"&gt;Colovian Revolt&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren summoned the military forces of the Colovian Highlands. Secretly, he also contacted &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, who would later become one of his Five Companions, for assistance to \"\"depose those &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;foul strangers&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;the north&lt;/a&gt;\"\". Varen based his rebellion out of the city of &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequently won many victories across &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, Varen and his army stormed the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, before breaking into the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; and driving his sword into Leovic's heart at the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, thus instantly killing him, and immediately declaring himself Emperor. For Abnur's loyalty and assistance in the rebellion, Varen agreed to take Leovic's widow, &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, as his bride. Due to the mass amount of casualties during the uprising, Varen converted the &lt;a href=\"Market%20District\"&gt;Market District&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial City into the &lt;a href=\"Memorial%20District\"&gt;Memorial District&lt;/a&gt;, filling it with mass graves.\n&lt;a href=\"Five%20Companions\"&gt;The Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren's rule went mostly without problems, but he was constantly worrying about him being an illegitimate ruler as he was not &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBelieving that only a Dragonborn can rightfully take the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"2E%20577\"&gt;2E 577&lt;/a&gt;, he formed the Five Companions to find the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer Mannimarco convinced him that he knew a ritual that would allow Varen to become Dragonborn. After hearing of this, he set out on a two-year quest to find the Amulet with his Five Companions: Varen himself, the half-giant warrior &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;, the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sai%20Sahan%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sai Sahan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; blademaster and the captain of his personal &lt;a href=\"Dragonguard\"&gt;Dragonguard&lt;/a&gt;, and Elder Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Five were able to recover the Amulet and begin the ritual in &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt;. They gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in the Imperial City and began to perform the ritual. While Tharn held the Amulet, Varen asked Akatosh to rightfully grant his claim as emperor by making him a Dragonborn. At that moment, Mannimarco immobilized everyone present and revealed his true intentions; he was an agent of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, and the ritual did not reignite the Dragonfires, but in fact did the exact opposite, destroying the ancient barriers shielding Mundus from the forces of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and thus allowing Molag Bal to begin the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, a forceful attempt to drag Nirn out of Mundus and into his own realm of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;. This event was known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, and it shook every corner of Tamriel.\nSubsequently, Lyris was captured and brought into Coldharbour. Sai Sahan fled with the Amulet and managed to hide it in &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt; before also being captured later on. Mannimarco summoned his &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; and turned the Temple of the One into a sacrificial ground where dozens of souls were harvested and brought to Coldharbour, and Abnur joined him in order to gain his trust and spy on him. Varen, however, disappeared.\nStudying &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scrolls\"&gt;the Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Soulburst, Varen woke up weak and near death at the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Abbey of the Moth Priests&lt;/a&gt;, with as Emperor. The Moth priests took pity on him, assuming he was a lost vagabond, and gave him shelter within their establishment.\nIt was there where he set his eyes on the Elder Scrolls, mysterious artifacts of immense knowledge and power. He began to study and read the scrolls in order to learn the events of Tamriel which have happened and have yet to happen, including his life as Emperor and his destiny with the Vestige. The priests were shocked to discover how quickly he managed to read the scrolls, believing it to be a prophetic sign from the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of continuously reading the scrolls, Varen gradually lost his eyesight. He carved himself &lt;a href=\"The%20Emperor%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;a staff&lt;/a&gt; which he also used as a walking stick. Blinded, Varen still continued to study the scrolls in his mind's eye, and foresaw the events to come in Tamriel's future.\nCapture.\nWord of Varen's prophecies began spreading across the land, eventually reaching the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. When Mannimarco discovered this, he arrested the Prophet under the grounds of rumor-mongering and treason. The King of Worms had the abbey and its contents burned to the ground, and transferred Varen into the custody of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;. Bal then initiated the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; upon &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and had Varen imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;The Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vestige.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a mortal was captured and sacrificed by Mannimarco. Their soul was brought to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Prison\"&gt;Wailing Prison&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour. After being transported to Coldharbour, a projection of Varen, using the pseudonym \"The Prophet\", appeared before them, giving the mortal the name of Vestige and telling them to find &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, Lyris was unaware that The Prophet was her fellow Five Companions member Varen.\nThe Vestige journeyed through the prison with Lyris after she freed them. They struck down several of Molag Bal's minions before arriving at the courtyard and destroying a Sentinel, a minion made to stop prisoners from escaping. They find that Varen's cell is warded off, so they seek &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt; for help, whom directed the two to the Undercroft.\nOnce Lyris and the Vestige reach Varen's cell, Lyris tells the Vestige that the only way to free Varen is for Lyris to take his place. Lyris then chants for her to take Varen's place in the cell, freeing Varen but imprisoning Lyris. Varen, still concealing his identity, and the Vestige journey to a portal out of Coldharbour. They strike down the Guardian of the portal, and Varen restores the Vestige's corporeal form before they both return to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in different locations.\nPersonality.\nDuring his reign as Emperor, Varen was considered a good leader, doing what was right for his people. The fact that he was not of &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon's blood&lt;/a&gt; continuously pestered him, often causing him to believe he was not a legitimate ruler, and even married Leovic's widow, Clivia, in an attempt to solidify his title, just as his predecessor had done. Varen founded the Five Companions in order to find the Amulet of Kings for two long years, and during the ritual in which Varen would become a Dragonborn, he was betrayed by Mannimarco, whom he had blindingly put his trust in. Varen later remarked that his decisions were foolish and taken out of desperation.\nVaren later lost his memory following the Soulburst, and was found outside the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Ancestor%20Moth\"&gt;Abbey of the Moth Priests&lt;/a&gt;. He began to study the Elder Scrolls, and slowly began to encompass their knowledge by reading them, regaining memories of his past life. However, due to his consistent readings of the Elder Scrolls, he became blind, having to rely on his cane/staff in order to be aware of surroundings. The Prophet became a considerably wise man, aware of events that have occurred and events which are yet to occur. He occasionally speaks in riddles, and initially keeps his origins a secret. Inside, Varen does not consider himself to be very grand or accomplished, referring to himself as simply \"a blind old man\". He still does what he considers best for the people of Tamriel, ensuring that every step he takes is done to stop Molag Bal from merging &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; with his own realm, which he considers mainly his fault.\nInteractions.\nColdharbour quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven%20in%20Coldharbour\"&gt;Soul Shriven in Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren, initially introduced as \"The Prophet,\" contacts the Vestige at their cell in Coldharbour. &lt;a href=\"Lyris%20Titanborn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lyris Titanborn&lt;/a&gt; later travels with the Vestige to free him, and the Prophet speaks to them again on their way to &lt;a href=\"Cadwell\"&gt;Cadwell&lt;/a&gt;. Later on in his cell, Lyris takes the Prophet's place as a prisoner, so that he and the Vestige could escape. Once Varen is freed, he will say \"Freedom. I remember this feeling. It will be fleeting though, if Molag Bal has his way.\"\nYou are then tasked with escorting him to the Dark Anchor Mooring. At the Mooring, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; will appear and summon the &lt;a href=\"Child%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Child of Bones&lt;/a&gt;. Once it is defeated, he summons a &lt;a href=\"Skyshards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyshard&lt;/a&gt; for you to absorb, then calls upon the &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; to open the Mooring to Tamriel:\nThe Prophet: \"Great Akatosh, Dragon God of Time! I require your strength!\"\n\"Let the way be opened! Let these wandering souls return home! Let the will of Molag Bal be denied!\"\n\"Hurry, we must go now!\"\nAfter going through the anchor, you will arrive in either &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Bleakrock%20Isle\"&gt;Bleakrock Isle&lt;/a&gt; depending on your &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt;. When you regain consciousness, he will say \"The Vestige awakens, once again. Come here, we must speak.\" He will then recommend you explore your surroundings as he organizes a plan to rescue Lyris, and will contact you in time. He will then give you a Sealed Urn and answer questions you may have, before departing.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;The Harborage&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you reach level 5, The Prophet will contact you at the nearest opens a portal to a realm depicting past events. He briefly explains his story, and tells the tale of the Five Companions, concealing the information that he is the then Emperor Varen Aquilarios. The visions in the realm show the events leading up to the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Soulburst\"&gt;Soulburst&lt;/a&gt;, the crisis which in turn ended up costing the Vestige their soul.\n&lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20Giants\"&gt;Daughter of Giants&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prophet tells the Vestige that after Lyris took his place, she was moved to &lt;a href=\"The%20Foundry%20of%20Woe\"&gt;The Foundry of Woe&lt;/a&gt;, a location of Coldharbour dedicated to torture and despair. After Lyris is returned to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the Prophet is informed that Sai Sahan is still alive. The Prophet then begins his search for his captured friend.\n&lt;a href=\"Chasing%20Shadows\"&gt;Chasing Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Prophet asks the Vestige to investigate the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt;'s activity in the nearby city (&lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Davon%27s%20Watch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Davon's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;). After speaking to &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Worm%27s%20Retreat\"&gt;The Worm's Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige must give the Orb of Discourse to Varen.\n&lt;a href=\"Castle%20of%20the%20Worm%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Castle of the Worm&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren asks the Vestige to come to &lt;a href=\"The%20Harborage%20%28Location%29\"&gt;the Harborage&lt;/a&gt;, where Abnur Tharn would like to speak with them. He requests asylum in return for Sai Sahan's location, and Varen tasks Lyris and the Vestige with retrieving him. After Abnur comes to the Harborage, an argument will begin with him and Lyris, since he does not currently know where Sai is. Varen puts an end to the fight, and reveals the truth to the Vestige that he is Varen Aquilarios, the previous Emperor of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Tharn%20Speaks\"&gt;The Tharn Speaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter informing Varen that Abnur has located Sai in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt;, he will agree to help Tharn look for a safe to break him out.\n&lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Torment%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Halls of Torment&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering the Harborage, Lyris and Varen will be found arguing about her travelling to the Halls of Torment in order to save Sai. Varen informs the Vestige that they have found the Halls, and asks the Vestige to pick either Lyris or Abnur to accompany them. Once a companion is picked, he will open a portal to the Halls and say \"Go with ! Save Sai Sahan from the Halls of Torment!\"\nAfter reaching the final location where Sai is being held prisoner, doppelgangers of Varen appear, asking Sai why he didn't trust him. Once all the enemies are defeated, Sai will be informed Varen is alive, much to his relief. A projection of Varen will appear saying \"You have done it, Vestige! Bring him through the portal, quickly!\" and open a portal back to the Harborage. After returning to it, Varen will reveal he knew that the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; is hidden in &lt;a href=\"Sancre%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Valley of Blades&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren will appear to the Vestige later, saying that Sai's strength has returned. At the Harborage, Varen can be spoken to regarding the key needed to access Sancre Tor. He will reveal that the key is actually a ring bearing the sigil of &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;. After retrieving it from the &lt;a href=\"The%20Valley%20of%20Blades\"&gt;The Valley of Blades&lt;/a&gt;, it must be given to Varen.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20of%20Sancre%20Tor\"&gt;Shadow of Sancre Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Harborage, Varen will say that the Amulet of Kings was hidden in Sancre Tor, and opens a portal leading to the fortress. The Vestige will be acquainted by Lyris, Abnur, and Sai, in the quest to retrieve the amulet. Once it is obtained, it must be returned to Varen back at the Harborage.\n&lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Five%20Companions\"&gt;Council of the Five Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren confirms that Mannimarco has been defeated, and is now being punished by Molag Bal. He gives the Vestige the option of seeing it in a vision, where the King of Worms is being whipped by skeletons as Bal watches. Sai Sahan then speaks to the Vestige, offering them a place as the fifth companion, as the replacement for the traitor Mannimarco. Abnur Tharn says for the ritual required to stop the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;, he requires a sacrifice. Varen, along with Lyris and Sai, offer their services for this task.\n&lt;a href=\"God%20of%20Schemes\"&gt;God of Schemes&lt;/a&gt;.\nVaren is one the candidates eligible to be sacrificed in order to power the Amulet of Kings. They can all be chosen to be spoken to. After the ritual is completed, the Vestige will be granted with the imbued with the power of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. After Molag Bal is defeated and &lt;a href=\"Meridia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; is spoken to, the Vestige will be returned to the Harborage.\nIf Varen is sacrificed, the Vestige will receive his restoration staff: &lt;a href=\"The%20Emperor%27s%20Blessing\"&gt;The Emperor's Blessing&lt;/a&gt;. If Varen is spared, he will decide to leave and fades into the unknown.\nWrothgar quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Long%20Live%20the%20King\"&gt;Long Live the King&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegardless of whether he died or not, a vision of Varen will appear to the Vestige at the end of the DLC if they have completed the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Main questline&lt;/a&gt;. He will warn them that the Daedric Princes are planning another attack on Tamriel, specifically \"the great deceiver, the sower of discord, and the matron of darkness.\" This is a hint towards the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20War\"&gt;Daedric War&lt;/a&gt; story arc involving &lt;a href=\"Clavicus%20Vile%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Clavicus Vile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. He says the war will begin \"\"when the gates of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;'s lost &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; are re-opened.\"\"\nConversations.\nVaren Aquilarios: \"There it is. The Dragonfire brazier. Mannimarco, you're certain this will work?\"\nMannimarco: \"It will work, my liege. The Amulet of Kings will rekindle the Dragonfires, and ensure your rightful place as Emperor. You have my word.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"It better work, Mannimarco, or you'll find your neck at the business end of my axe.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"My Lord, I wonder if you'd muzzle your half-giant pet? She really is annoying.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Enough, both of you! We are here to ensure My Lord's rightful claim to the Ruby Throne.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"\"Abnur, begin the ritual. I have a destiny to fulfill.\"\n[The Brazier gets lit]\nVaren Aquilarios: \"By the lighting of the Dragonfires, I claim my rightful lineage! By the fires of creation, let me be reborn! By the will of Akatosh, I proclaim myself ... Dragonborn!\"\nMannimarco: \"Varen Aquilarios, you are no heir to Alessia! You will pay for your sacrilege! The veil between Tamriel and Oblivion tears and splits asunder!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"What's happening? The sky is opening up! This is bad! This is very bad!\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"This isn't supposed to happen! What's the meaning of this? Mannimarco, what have you done?\"\nMannimarco: \"Gullible fools! The veil between Oblivion and this world has been torn! My master, Molag Bal, is free to claim Tamriel for his own!\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Akatosh! Forgive me! Have mercy on our souls!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Lyris, child. Are you all right?\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Yes, Prophet. I'm fine. The Vestige freed my mind from the Daedra's control.\"\nThe Prophet: \"Thank the Divines. Your loss would have thrown all into chaos.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"They won't take me again. Not alive, at least. Prophet, Mannimarco captured Sai Sahan! He's torturing him to find out where the Amulet of Kings is hidden. We have to rescue him!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Tharn is quite correct. We have little choice in the matter.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"You can't be serious! How can we possibly trust him?\"\nThe Prophet: \"As our visitor so eloquently pointed out, we cannot. But if we are to locate Sai Sahan, we must do this. Go with the Vestige, Lyris. Rescue Tharn. Give him a chance to redeem himself. He may surprise you.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"What? You son of a bitch!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Gah! Are you insane? Get away from me, you brutish she-troll!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Lyris! Stand down!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"He's done nothing but lie to us from the beginning! I don't care what he says, he'll always be Mannimarco's toady!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Please. Mannimarco wants me dead! Did I pretend to capitulate to him? Yes, I did. Do you have any idea how many lives I saved by doing so?\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"The only thing you saved was your holdings and your own hide, you pompous ass!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Enough! Abnur had no choice, Lyris. And we are guilty of our own deceit, are we not? The time has come for the Vestige to know the truth!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"What's this? The Vestige doesn't know? Oh, this is rich!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sire, don't ...!\"\nThe Prophet: \"Vestige. Until now, you have only known me as the Prophet. But that is not my true name. I ... am Varen Aquilarios!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Our fallen Emperor, in the tattered robes of a Moth Priest, blind as a newborn kitten!\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"I am sorry I deceived you, Vestige.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Behold the fate of the King of Worms.\"\nMannimarco: \"Please! No more! It was a misunderstanding, great one! Let me serve you. Let me prove my loyalty. No more, I beg of you!\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Mannimarco's torment will be endless. The God of Schemes will use him to set an example. All who follow him will know, you cannot hope to betray the greatest of betrayers. I cannot help but pity him, despite all he has done. But, that is not why you were called here, Vestige. Come. Sai Sahan would speak with you first.\"\nSai Sahan: \"My lord, with your permission.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"You needn't call me that anymore, Sai Sahan. We are equals now.\"\nSai Sahan: \"All those years ago, when we fought beneath our lord's banner to free the Empire from the Longhouse Emperors, we did so with a dream of freedom and peace in mind\u2015not just for the Empire, but for all of Tamriel. Together we forged a fellowship stronger than any blade, only to see it shattered upon the rocks of deceit by one of our own. That fellowship is no more, yet we four have assembled here, united by a single purpose. It is not vengeance that drives us, but truth and loyalty and justice. I, Sai Sahan, steward of the Abbey of Blades, call for the Five Companions to be reforged this day. By the light of Stendarr, and the heart of Lorkhan, may our blade fellowship be forged anew. And may the Vestige, our mutual friend and ally, become its tip, that we may thrust it straigt into the heart of a Daedric Prince.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sai Sahan is right. You are the member that we should have had all those years ago.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"It is as the Scrolls foretold. The soulless one will become the brightest of five stars, and they shall guide us to the coming dawn.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Oh, please. You melodramatic sots! Fine, fine. If seeing one of your foolish prophecies come true will help to ensure the safety of the Empire, I'll play along.\"\nSai Sahan: \"We stand united once more\u2015the Five Companions are reforged, and together we will strike down the God of Schemes!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Come here, my friend. I've got a few things I want to say before you go.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Of course it is. The fact of the matter stands, however. One of the Five will need to give their life to fuel this attack, when the time comes.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"So you said before the Vestige arrived. And I've already thought over it. I'll do it.\"\nSai Sahan: \"Snow Lily, no! You should not need to give your life this way. This is my duty\u2015penance for my numerous failures. This is my chance to make things right.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"The Scrolls said nothing of this moment, and so I am not bound to their dictates. Vestige, I ask that you let me do this one thing. All that has happened was because of my hubris. I shall be the one.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Sire, you've done enough. This was Mannimarco's doing, not yours.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"As the one who will fight the Daedric Prince, the Vestige should decide.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"I don't see you leaping to volunteer, Tharn. Saving your own backside again?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Hard as it may be, Lyris, don't be an idiot. I am the only one who knows the ritual and we don't have time to teach anyone else.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"That's enough. It won't be decided here and now. Vestige, come here. I have some final words for you.\"\nThe Prophet: \"This place is alive with pain and suffering. This must be where Molag Bal torments those who displease him.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Look there! Is that Mannimarco?\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Mannimarco! He was a back-stabbing hypocrite with delusions of godhood. The fool got precisely what he deserved!\"\nIf Mannimarco is released:\nMannimarco: \"You actually released me? Naive fool! Future generations will pay for your weakness!\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Are you insane? That worm didn't deserve your mercy!\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"Why do I get the feeling we're going to regret this?\"\nThe Prophet: \"Molag Bal is here. I can feel his presence. Sense his foul breath upon the wind.\"\nThe Prophet: \"There. That place should serve us well. Let us assemble and prepare the ritual.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"What do you suppose this place was?\"\nSai Sahan: \"A temple of some kind. The Dark Anchors may have pulled it into Coldharbour. Or, perhaps it was created by the Daedra to mock the Divines.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"What does it matter? We can't wait any longer. We must perform the ritual. Vestige, it is time for you to make your decision.\"\nAbnur Tharn: \"Position yourself over there, Vestige. And brace yourself.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"We'll never forget you Sire, or your sacrifice.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Great Akatosh, Dragon God of Time, forgive me for my hubris. Grant your divine power to the Vestige and restore your protection to Tamriel, that my sacrifice might not be in vain.\"\nIf Sai Sahan was sacrificed:\nVaren Aquilarios: \"The scents of the Harborage fill the air. But what happened? How did we return? Lyris? Lyris, are you there?\"\nCadwell: \"Not to worry, not to worry! Lyris is fit as a fiddle, and you all seem quite intact, as well.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"I'm here, sire. But where's Tharn?\"\nCadwell: \"He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him.\"\nLyris Titanborn: \"That bastard! Sai died for that Amulet!\"\nCadwell: \"The Amulet's power is expended for generations to come. It will be of no use to him, now.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Things feel different. Molag Bal's hold on my mind has been lifted. I am finally free of him!\"\nIf Lyris Titanborn was sacrificed:\nSai Sahan: \"How have we returned? The last thing I remember was being overwhelmed!\"\nCadwell: \"Right. Sorry about that. I called in a bit of help to pull you out of there. I do hope I didn't overstep my bounds.\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"He is gone! Molag Bal no longer touches my mind! I am finally free of him!\"\nSai Sahan: \"My Lord Varen, are you injured?\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"I'm fine, Sai. But where is Tharn? I do not hear his steps nor his breath.\"\nCadwell: \"He vanished. Ran off, I think. And he took the amulet you chaps found, with him.\"\nSai Sahan: \"I cannot believe Snow Lily is gone. Why did she do it, My Lord?\"\nCadwell: \"Here now, my good man! Lyris Titanborn is a good hero! She gave her life for a noble cause!\"\nVaren Aquilarios: \"Sir Cadwell is right, Sai. We will all mourn her, but it was her choice. her sacrifice to make.\""}

Of the varieties of Daedra that appear in our world, and the varieties of their relationships to their fellows and their Daedra patrons, there is no end. In one place and time they are seen to be this, and in another place and time they are seen to be the opposite, and in another place and time they are seen to be both this and that, in completely contradictory terms.\nWhat Daedra serves this Prince? What Daedra gives orders, and what Daedra serves, and in what hierarchy, and under what circumstances? What Daedra exist in fellowship with one another, and what Daedra have eternal enmity to one another, and what Daedra are solitary, or social, and by turns solitary or social? There are no limits to the varieties of behaviors that may be observed, and in one place they may be this, and in another place they may that, and all rules describing them are always found to be contradictory and in exception to others.\nFurther, from whom may we seek answers to our questions about these orders? From mortals, who know little but what they may observe of another world? From the gods, who speak in riddles, of enigmas wrapped in mysteries, and who keep things from us, the better to preserve their dominion over us? From the Daedra themselves, who are never the models of straightforwardness or truthtelling, but rather are famous for misstatements and obfuscations?\nAnd even were the Daedra to speak the truth, how can we know if they know themselves, or that there is any truth about them that is to be known, or are all arrangements among the Daedra protean and ever subject to change?\nIn short, what is to be known is little, and what is to be trusted is nothing.\nThese things being said, I shall venture to relate what I have observed and heard of the relationships of the servants of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt; in my brief service to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; Wizard &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, when I sought him out and offered to bring peace to the victims of &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; in his sanitarium, once the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Prophecies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; had been fulfilled, and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed, and the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; had been banished from the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; forever.\nDivayth Fyr told me that he, by choice, trafficked only with two Daedra Powers\u2014Mehrunes Dagon and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.\nMehrunes Dagon, on the other hand, out of pride, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood.\nDivayth Fyr said that Dagon's chief servants, the &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, were like him in pride, fixed purpose, and lack of subtlety, with the addition of the peculiar traits of honor and loyalty, both within their class and within their relationship to Lord Dagon.\nAnd Divayth Fyr said that the Dremora were ordered into clans and castes, and these clans and castes were well-defined. Individual Dremora might rise or fall in ranks, or move back and forth among clans, but only when regulated by complex oaths, and only at the will and pleasure of their Lord Dagon.\nThe Dremora refer to themselves as 'The Kyn' ('the People'), contrasting themselves to other Daedra, whom they consider unthinking animals. The term 'kynaz' refers to a member of the Dremora race ('he of the Kyn').\nThe least of kyn castes are the &lt;a href=\"Churl\"&gt;Churl&lt;/a&gt;s, the undistinguished rabble of the lowest rank of Dremora. Churls are obsequeous to superiors but ferociously cruel to humans and other Daedra.\nNext in rank are the &lt;a href=\"Caitiff\"&gt;Caitiff&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures of uncalculating zeal, energy without discrimination. Caitiffs are used as irregulars in the faction wars of the Daedra, as berserkers and shock troops, undisciplined and unreliable, but eager and willing.\nThe highest of the regular rank-and file of Dremora troops are the &lt;a href=\"Kynval\"&gt;Kynval&lt;/a&gt;s, warrior-knights who have distinguished themselves in battle, and shown the deliberate steadiness of potential war leaders.\nAbove the rank and file warriors of the Churl, Caitiff, and Kynval castes are the officer castes.\nA &lt;a href=\"Kynreeve\"&gt;Kynreeve&lt;/a&gt; is a clan sheriff or clan officer. Kynreeves are typically associated either with a clan fighting unit or an administrative office in the order of battle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kynmarcher\"&gt;Kynmarcher&lt;/a&gt; is the lord and high officer of a Daedric citadel, outpost, or gate. A Kymarcher's command is usually associated both with a unit and with a 'fief' -- a location or territory for which he is responsible.\nAbove the Kymarcher is the &lt;a href=\"Markynaz\"&gt;Markynaz&lt;/a&gt;, or 'grand duke'. A Markynaz is a lord of lords, and member of the Markyn, Mehrunes Dagon's Council of Lords.\nThe highest rank of Dremora is the &lt;a href=\"Valkynaz\"&gt;Valkynaz&lt;/a&gt;, or 'prince'. This warrior duke is a member of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal guard. The Valkynaz are rarely encountered on Tamriel; normally they remain by Mehrunes Dagon's side, or serve as commanders of operations of particular importance or interest to Dagon.\nOf the varieties of other Daedra I encountered while I served in Divayth Fyr's &lt;a href=\"Corprusarium\"&gt;Corprusarium&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=\"Ogrim\"&gt;Ogrim&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint\"&gt;Golden Saint&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight\"&gt;Winged Twilight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Scamp\"&gt;Scamp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Clannfear\"&gt;Clannfear&lt;/a&gt; -- there is much that might be said, but little that is helpful or reliable.\nI did note, however, that when Divayth Fyr sought a Daedra of a character like unto the Dremora, but of greater power, and greater inclination for independence and initiative, or solely as a master, he summoned &lt;a href=\"Xivilai\"&gt;Xivilai&lt;/a&gt;, who are like the Dremora in personality and temperament, except that they hate subordination, and are liable to disloyalty and betrayal when they feel they have not been treated with the proper deference and respect.\nThe feral, beastlike Daedra like the Clannfear and the Daedroth appear in the service of many different Daedric Powers, and may represent common creatures existing like wild animals in the wildernesses of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Other savage, semi-intelligent creatures like Scamps and &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Daedra\"&gt;Spider Daedra&lt;/a&gt; may also be found in the realms of various Daedra Lords.\nThe case of the Elemental Atronachs, on the other hand, is less certain. &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach\"&gt;Frost Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, for example, appear to be highly intelligent, but not all varieties of Elemental Atronachs seem to be social or to have the power of speech. Divayth Fyr preferred not to summon or deal with these creatures, had little experience with them, and showed no inclination to speculate upon their nature, so I learned little about them during my time at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Fyr%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Tel Fyr&lt;/a&gt;."}

Of the varieties of Daedra that appear in our world, and the varieties of their relationships to their fellows and their Daedra patrons, there is no end. In one place and time they are seen to be this, and in another place and time they are seen to be the opposite, and in another place and time they are seen to be both this and that, in completely contradictory terms.\nWhat Daedra serves this Prince? What Daedra gives orders, and what Daedra serves, and in what hierarchy, and under what circumstances? What Daedra exist in fellowship with one another, and what Daedra have eternal enmity to one another, and what Daedra are solitary, or social, and by turns solitary or social? There are no limits to the varieties of behaviors that may be observed, and in one place they may be this, and in another place they may that, and all rules describing them are always found to be contradictory and in exception to others.\nFurther, from whom may we seek answers to our questions about these orders? From mortals, who know little but what they may observe of another world? From the gods, who speak in riddles, of enigmas wrapped in mysteries, and who keep things from us, the better to preserve their dominion over us? From the Daedra themselves, who are never the models of straightforwardness or truthtelling, but rather are famous for misstatements and obfuscations?\nAnd even were the Daedra to speak the truth, how can we know if they know themselves, or that there is any truth about them that is to be known, or are all arrangements among the Daedra protean and ever subject to change?\nIn short, what is to be known is little, and what is to be trusted is nothing.\nThese things being said, I shall venture to relate what I have observed and heard of the relationships of the servants of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Lord Dagon&lt;/a&gt; in my brief service to the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; Wizard &lt;a href=\"Divayth%20Fyr\"&gt;Divayth Fyr&lt;/a&gt;, when I sought him out and offered to bring peace to the victims of &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; in his sanitarium, once the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Prophecies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Incarnate&lt;/a&gt; had been fulfilled, and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; had been destroyed, and the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; had been banished from the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; forever.\nDivayth Fyr told me that he, by choice, trafficked only with two Daedra Powers\u2014Mehrunes Dagon and &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.\nMehrunes Dagon, on the other hand, out of pride, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood.\nDivayth Fyr said that Dagon's chief servants, the &lt;a href=\"Dremora\"&gt;Dremora&lt;/a&gt;, were like him in pride, fixed purpose, and lack of subtlety, with the addition of the peculiar traits of honor and loyalty, both within their class and within their relationship to Lord Dagon.\nAnd Divayth Fyr said that the Dremora were ordered into clans and castes, and these clans and castes were well-defined. Individual Dremora might rise or fall in ranks, or move back and forth among clans, but only when regulated by complex oaths, and only at the will and pleasure of their Lord Dagon.\nThe Dremora refer to themselves as 'The Kyn' ('the People'), contrasting themselves to other Daedra, whom they consider unthinking animals. The term 'kynaz' refers to a member of the Dremora race ('he of the Kyn').\nThe least of kyn castes are the &lt;a href=\"Churl\"&gt;Churl&lt;/a&gt;s, the undistinguished rabble of the lowest rank of Dremora. Churls are obsequeous to superiors but ferociously cruel to humans and other Daedra.\nNext in rank are the &lt;a href=\"Caitiff\"&gt;Caitiff&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures of uncalculating zeal, energy without discrimination. Caitiffs are used as irregulars in the faction wars of the Daedra, as berserkers and shock troops, undisciplined and unreliable, but eager and willing.\nThe highest of the regular rank-and file of Dremora troops are the &lt;a href=\"Kynval\"&gt;Kynval&lt;/a&gt;s, warrior-knights who have distinguished themselves in battle, and shown the deliberate steadiness of potential war leaders.\nAbove the rank and file warriors of the Churl, Caitiff, and Kynval castes are the officer castes.\nA &lt;a href=\"Kynreeve\"&gt;Kynreeve&lt;/a&gt; is a clan sheriff or clan officer. Kynreeves are typically associated either with a clan fighting unit or an administrative office in the order of battle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kynmarcher\"&gt;Kynmarcher&lt;/a&gt; is the lord and high officer of a Daedric citadel, outpost, or gate. A Kymarcher's command is usually associated both with a unit and with a 'fief' -- a location or territory for which he is responsible.\nAbove the Kymarcher is the &lt;a href=\"Markynaz\"&gt;Markynaz&lt;/a&gt;, or 'grand duke'. A Markynaz is a lord of lords, and member of the Markyn, Mehrunes Dagon's Council of Lords.\nThe highest rank of Dremora is the &lt;a href=\"Valkynaz\"&gt;Valkynaz&lt;/a&gt;, or 'prince'. This warrior duke is a member of the Valkyn, Mehrunes Dagon's personal guard. The Valkynaz are rarely encountered on Tamriel; normally they remain by Mehrunes Dagon's side, or serve as commanders of operations of particular importance or interest to Dagon."}

Basically, Satakal is much like the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god among the Crowns of the Alik'r nomads.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; (Tall Papa):\nChief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly \"Tall Papa,\" was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the \"Walkabout,\" or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is &lt;a href=\"%23Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.\n&lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; (Tricky God):\nYokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; find their way into the afterlife.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt; (God of Farms):\nYokudan god of agriculture who renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.\n&lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; (Teat God):\nYokudan fertility goddess, fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshiped in various areas of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;, Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can \"grab more husbands.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt; (Bird God):\nYokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.\n&lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt; (War God; Boneshaver):\nNotable warrior god of the Yokudan &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, Onsi taught &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt;kind how to pull their knives into swords.\n&lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt; (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade):\nHoary thuggish cult of the Redguards that originated in Yokuda during the Twenty-Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the &lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt; (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lefthanded%20Elves\"&gt;Lefthanded Elves&lt;/a&gt;, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight-knit group of followers against the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; during the height of their ancient power.\nAdditional Deities with Significant Redguard Cults:\n&lt;a href=\"Leki\"&gt;Leki&lt;/a&gt; (Saint of the Spirit Sword):\nDaughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship.

Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; began.\n&lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt; (The Make Way God):\nYokudan spirit of \"perseverance over infidels.\" The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to \"make way\" for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened twice, in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; during the Ra Gada invasion.\n&lt;a href=\"Malooc\"&gt;Malooc&lt;/a&gt; (Horde King):\nAn enemy god of the Ra Gada who led the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; against the Redguards during the First Era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his Goblin hordes.\n&lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; (The Snake):\nYokudan version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a \"non-space\" that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores."}

They are known to venerate the &lt;a href=\"Hist%20Trees\"&gt;Hist Trees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, but they do not appear to have prayers, priests, or temples.\nArgonians also venerate &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, the primordial Shadow/Chaos that existed before the gods were born. Unlike most citizens of Tamriel, they do not regard Sithis as \"evil.\" In fact, Argonians &lt;a href=\"Shadowscale\"&gt;born&lt;/a&gt; under the sign of &lt;a href=\"the%20Shadow\"&gt;the Shadow&lt;/a&gt; are taken at birth and presented to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, which in Black Marsh is considered an integral part of society.\nVarieties of Faith, Crown Redguards.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Forebears\"&gt;The Forebears&lt;/a&gt;, who have been longest in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and had the stronger relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, worship substantially the same pantheon as the &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the more conservative &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; still revere the ancient &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n gods.\nThe Eight of the Crowns:\n&lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; (The Worldskin):\nYokudan god of everything, a fusion of the concepts of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, Satakal is much like the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god among the Crowns of the Alik'r nomads.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; (Tall Papa):\nChief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly \"Tall Papa,\" was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the \"Walkabout,\" or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is &lt;a href=\"%23Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.\n&lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; (Tricky God):\nYokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; find their way into the afterlife.\n&lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt; (God of Farms):\nYokudan god of agriculture who renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.\n&lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; (Teat God):\nYokudan fertility goddess, fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshiped in various areas of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can \"grab more husbands.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt; (Bird God):\nYokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.\n&lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt; (War God; Boneshaver):\nNotable warrior god of the Yokudan &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, Onsi taught &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt;kind how to pull their knives into swords.\n&lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt; (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade):\nHoary thuggish cult of the Redguards that originated in Yokuda during the Twenty-Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the &lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt; (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lefthanded%20Elves\"&gt;Lefthanded Elves&lt;/a&gt;, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight-knit group of followers against the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; during the height of their ancient power.\nAdditional Deities with Significant Redguard Cults:\n&lt;a href=\"Leki\"&gt;Leki&lt;/a&gt; (Saint of the Spirit Sword):\nDaughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu\"&gt;Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt; of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the &lt;a href=\"mythic%20era\"&gt;mythic era&lt;/a&gt; to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; began.\n&lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt; (The Make Way God):\nYokudan spirit of \"perseverance over infidels.\" The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to \"make way\" for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened twice, in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; during the Ra Gada invasion.\n&lt;a href=\"Malooc\"&gt;Malooc&lt;/a&gt; (Horde King):\nAn enemy god of the Ra Gada who led the &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s against the Redguards during the First Era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his Goblin hordes.\n&lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; (The Snake):\nYokudan version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a \"non-space\" that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.\nVarieties of Faith: The Bretons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; (Dragon God of Time):\nAkatosh is the chief deity of the Eight Divines (the major religious cult of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and its provinces) and one of two deities found in every &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic religion (the other is &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;). He is generally considered to be the first of the gods to form in the Beginning Place. After his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier, and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy.\n&lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Air):\nKynareth is a member of the Eight Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits, patron of sailors and travelers. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and she provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.\n&lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; (God of Wisdom and Logic):\nOften associated with &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the god of literature, law, history, and contradiction, and the favorite deity of most &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; mages.\n&lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Beauty):\nPopular god of the Eight Divines, Dibella has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\n&lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Cycle of Life and Death):\nMember of the Eight Divines pantheon and popular elsewhere, as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the common folk. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.\n&lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God):\nMember of the Eight Divines, Zenithar is understandably associated with the &lt;a href=\"Bosmeri\"&gt;Bosmeri&lt;/a&gt; Z'en. In &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants, artisans, and the middle nobility. His worshipers say, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god \"that will always win.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Love):\nNearly universal goddess. Her origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess; in High Rock, she is the Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Bretons, she is married to Akatosh.\n&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; (God of Mercy):\nGod of the Eight Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nord origins into a deity of compassion, or sometimes, righteous rule. Stendarr is the patron of magistrates, rulers, and knights errant.\nAdditional Deities with Significant Breton Cults:\n&lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; (Magus):\nThe god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What remains of him is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by a golden eye, an astrolabe, a telescope, or more commonly, a staff. Legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power.\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Forest):\nWhile Akatosh Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, Y'ffre is revered as the spirit of \"the now.\" According to the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, after the creation of the mortal plane, everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Earth Bones.\" After the laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheor\"&gt;Sheor&lt;/a&gt; (Bad Man):\nIn High Rock, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; or Aldmeri Lorkhan, born during the dark years after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;:\nHero-god who taught the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride. Patron deity and \"teacher\" of the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt;. Often worshiped by those Breton mages who emphasize their Elven blood.\nVarieties of Faith: The Dark Elves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; are descended from the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, who were apostates of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i's &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; worship. As the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reforms\"&gt;Alessian Reforms&lt;/a&gt; never took hold in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;pantheon&lt;/a&gt; bears little resemblance to the rest of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Elves' original religion was worship of several &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, the so-called \"Good Daedra,\" but that has been largely superseded by reverence for the \"Living Gods\" of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;The Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; (Mother Morrowind):\nMost traces of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called \"exodus,\" primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmeri&lt;/a&gt;. However, most aspects of Auri-El that seem so important to the mortal races\u2014namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy\u2014have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; (Master of Morrowind):\nWarrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;dark gods&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;the Volcano&lt;/a&gt;. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions.\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; (Mystery of Morrowind):\nGod of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;clockwork city&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Good\" Daedra\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; (Prince of Plots):\nHeralded by the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his/her illuminations, the eventual \"Chimer,\" or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural \"advances\" are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to \"responsible\" architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, serving as foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; (Androgyne):\nMephala is the Webspinner or Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor who taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or murder them in secret. Enemies were numerous in those days, since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt;. He/she founded the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn):\nAzura was the god-ancestor who taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil.\nThe Missing God\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (The Missing God):\nThis Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane. This upset the status quo, much like his father, &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and eventually wanders the creation of the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, he is a being related to the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them.\nFour Corners of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Troubles\"&gt;House of Troubles&lt;/a&gt;, \"Testing Gods\"\nEnemy gods, more to be placated and appeased than worshiped.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; (God of Schemes, Lord of Brutality):\nDaedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Great Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri \"purity.\" A race of supermonsters, said to live in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; (God of Curses):\nIn Dunmer myth, Boethiah swallowed Aldmer hero-god &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; and excreted him as Malacath. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; (The Mad God):\nThe fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and it is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is \"born\" when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the \"&lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;-shaped hole\" of the world. He tests the Dunmer for mental weakness and tempts the Great Houses into treachery against each other.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; (God of Destruction):\nPopular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain.\nVarieties of Faith: The High Elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;The Eight&lt;/a&gt;\n(though few &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; outside the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; accept the limitation of Divines to eight):\n&lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; (King of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;)\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who, in turn, is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in mythic times, vanquishing the tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Old Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\n&lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; (Magus):\nThe god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff.\n&lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;:\nStrong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of original Elven tribes, that lef armies against the &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i conversion, Trinimac vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i influence).\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Forest):\nWhile Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of gods, Y'ffre is revered as the spirit of \"the now\". According to the Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Earth Bones\". After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it.\n&lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;:\nXarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, &lt;a href=\"Oghma\"&gt;Oghma&lt;/a&gt;, from his favorite moments in history.\n&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Love):\nNearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. She is sometimes associated with &lt;a href=\"Nir\"&gt;Nir&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Annotated%20Anuad\"&gt;Anuad&lt;/a&gt;\", the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Altmer, she is the wife of Auri-El.\n&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; (God of Mercy):\nGod of compassion and righteous rule. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\n&lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt; (Walrock's God):\nAn Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"All%20Flags%20Navy\"&gt;Fall of the Sload&lt;/a&gt;. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\n- Adittional Dieties with Significant Altmer Cults -\n&lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;:\nHero-god of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using another walking stride.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (The Missing God):\nThis Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan\", or Doom Drum. He convinced of contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo - much like his father &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;divine center&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.\nVarieties of Faith: The Khajiit.\nAs fits their heterodoxy of form, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; worship many gods, and few confine themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;eight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eight: \n&lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty &lt;a href=\"Anequinine\"&gt;Anequinine&lt;/a&gt; deity. A variation on the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiit. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, and he still enjoys immense popularity in &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;'s wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say \"is just a real big cat.\" He repelled an early &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i pogrom of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; during mythic times.\n&lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt; (Two-Moons Dance):\nThe cosmic order deity of the Khajiit, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet &lt;a href=\"Rid-Thar-ri%27Datta\"&gt;Rid-Thar-ri'Datta&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.\n&lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; (Little Moon God and Big Moon God):\nTogether, the moons represent duality, fate, and luck. In Khajiiti religion, Jone and Jode are aspects of the Lunar Lattice, or &lt;a href=\"Ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;Ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; (Mother Cat):\nNearly universal goddess. Originally a fertility goddess, the Khajiit associate her with &lt;a href=\"Nir\"&gt;Nir&lt;/a&gt; of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos. She is the lover of Alkosh.\n&lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt; (The Runt; God of Mercy):\nS'rendarr's sphere includes compassion, charity, and justice. In early Aldmeri legends, S'rendarr is the apologist of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt; (God of Winds):\nKhenarthi is the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, he is the first to agree to Lorkhaj's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. He is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhaj's divine spark.\n&lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt; (The Bandit God):\nIn most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal deity, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last-minute plans always upset the machinations of their (&lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; or Human) enemies. He has also lent his name to the Baandari Pedlars, the traveling Khajiiti merchant tribe.\nAdditional Deities with Significant Khajiiti Cults:\n&lt;a href=\"Magrus\"&gt;Magrus&lt;/a&gt; (Cat's Eye, Sun God):\nKhajiiti version of Magnus, the god of the sun and sorcery, popular with Khajiiti magicians (though less so than &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt; (The Footpad):\nThief and trickster god, the Purring Liar, much beloved of Khajiiti storytellers. Rajhin grew up in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Kiergo\"&gt;Black Kiergo&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim\"&gt;Empress Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; as she slept.\n&lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Patron of Khajiiti magicians, respected rather than feared for her sometime trickery. In myth she is tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Aldmeri stock.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; (Skooma Cat, the Mad God):\nThe King of Insanity appeals to the darker side of the Cat-Men, who chafe at the strictures of sanity and responsibility.\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; (Hungry Cat):\nGod of hunting and skinchanging, revered for his fierceness and cunning.\n&lt;a href=\"Sangiin\"&gt;Sangiin&lt;/a&gt; (Blood Cat):\nGod of Death and Secret Murder, Sangiin's worship is hidden from Cat's Eye. \"For who can control the urges of blood?\"\n&lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt; (The Great Darkness):\nAn enemy of the living, to be placated rather than worshiped.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; (Moon Beast):\nPre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anequinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan. This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic mythic tradition. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo\u2014much like his father &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhaj is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;Et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.\nVarieties of Faith: The Nords.\n&lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;The Eight&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; (Kiss at the End):\n&lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; Goddess of the Storm. Widow of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; and favored god of &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;, she is often called the Mother of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;. Her daughters taught the first &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; the use of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; or \"Storm Voice.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Love):\nFor the Nords, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne and concubine of Shor. As the goddess of fertility and agriculture, she's sometimes associated with &lt;a href=\"Nir\"&gt;Nir&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Anuad%20Paraphrased\"&gt;Anuad&lt;/a&gt;,\" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation.\n&lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Beauty):\nPopular god of the Eight Divines. She has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\n&lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt; (God of Ransom):\nNord precursor to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, shield-thane of Shor. Stuhn was a warrior god who fought against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. He showed Men how to take (and the benefits of taking) prisoners of war.\n&lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt; (Rune God):\nGod of knowledge and hermetic orders, precursor of &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;. Never very popular among the mercurial and warlike Nords, his worship is fading.\n&lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Underworld):\nThe Nord version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, Shor allied with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (that is, &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; ones) conspired against him and brought about his defeat, dooming him to the afterlife, &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who led the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. He is sometimes called the Children's God (see \"Orkey.\") Considered a \"dead god,\" Shor has no priesthood and is not actively worshiped, but he is frequently sworn by.\n&lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt; (Old Knocker):\nGod of mortality, Orkey combines aspects of Mauloch and &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;. He is a \"loan-god\" for the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that \"bound them to the count of winters.\" At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Then Shor showed up and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; (The World-Eater):\nAlduin is the Nord variation of &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. He only superficially resembles his counterpart in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; Eight Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, \"the World Eater,\" comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nord pantheon (in fact, this pantheon has no chief; see \"Shor\") but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.\nAlduin destroyed the last world to enable the creation of this one, and he will destroy this one to enable the next. Alduin was once worshiped by the long-dead &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Cult\"&gt;Dragon Cult&lt;/a&gt;, but that has been outlawed for centuries, so Alduin has no admitted worshipers.\nTesting Gods\n&lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt; (The Woodland Man):\nAncient Atmoran \"Demon of Knowledge\" who nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Unlike his &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i adherents, the Nords don't deny his &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; nature.\n&lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; (God of Orcs, \"Mountain Fart\"):\nClearly identified for the Nords with the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, Mauloch tests them through warfare. Mauloch troubled the heirs of King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. Fleeing east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. &lt;a href=\"1E%20660\"&gt;1E 660&lt;/a&gt;, his rage was said to fill the sky with his sulfurous hatred, earning that year the sobriquet \"Year of Winter in Summer.\"\nDead God\n&lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;:\nExtinct Nord god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods.\nVarieties of Faith: The Orcs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s acknowledge the existence of many other gods, but they worship only one:\n&lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; (Orc-Father, The Great Chief):\nAn aspect of &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, Orcs revere Mauloch as the First Orc, and live by the Code of Mauloch, which dictates such matters as honor and vengeance.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Code%20of%20Mauloch\"&gt;The Code of Mauloch&lt;/a&gt;\nThe Code is more often tacit than explicit, but includes the following:\n- Respect for forging and &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;.\n- The traditional roles of a clan's chief and his wives.\n- The tradition of selection of a new chief through challenge and combat.\n- The custom that one who commits a crime must pay \"Blood Price\" to the victim (or victim's relatives).\n- The requirement that insults to honor must be avenged.\n- Recognition that to die in combat pleases Mauloch.\nThe Cult of &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;\nMany Orcs believe the origin myth in which the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; god Trinimac was eaten by &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and when he was excreted he was transformed into Malacath, and all his followers into Orcs. Those who believe in this Elven origin of Orc-kind often call them \"Orsimer.\"\nSome Orcs therefore venerate Trinimac as their god-ancestor rather than Malacath. Orcs of the Trinimac cult insist that Trinimac fooled Boethiah into believing he was corrupted by his passage through Boethiah, when in fact he absorbed some of Boethiah's strength and passed it on to his followers. In this way the Orsimer can be seen as \"improved Elves.\"\nVarieties of Faith: The Wood Elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;The Eight&lt;/a&gt;\n(though few &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"the%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt; accept the limitation of Divines to eight):\n&lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; (King of the Aldmer):\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who, in turn, is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri &lt;a href=\"Pantheons%20of%20Tamriel\"&gt;pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Most &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Aldmer, &lt;a href=\"Aldmeris\"&gt;Aldmeris&lt;/a&gt; [sic] and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Forest):\nMost important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While Auri-El the Time &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of \"the now.\" According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Earth Bones.\" After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Cycle of Life and Death):\nArkay is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.\n&lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;:\nXarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, &lt;a href=\"Oghma\"&gt;Oghma&lt;/a&gt;, from his favorite moments in history.\n&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Love):\nNearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the \"Anuad,\" the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Bosmer, she is the wife of Auri-El.\n&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; (God of Mercy):\nGod of compassion and righteous rule. In early Aldmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt; (God of Toil):\nBosmeri god of payment in kind, which includes both just remuneration and retribution. Studies indicate origins in both &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; mythologies, perhaps introduced into &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order.\n&lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt; (The Bandit God): Trickster spirit of thieves and beggars borrowed from the Khajiit.\nAdditional Deities with Significant Bosmeri Cults:\n&lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; (The Woodland Man):\nMalicious trickster spirit (another one!) whose Bosmeri cultists say is not to be confused with the Daedra Hermaeus Mora. (Others deride this assertion.)\n&lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; (Little Moon God and Big Moon God):\nAldmeri gods of the Moons, they are spirits of fortune, both good and bad.\n&lt;a href=\"Hircine\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt; (The Huntsman, Father of Manbeasts):\nMaster of the Great Hunt and lord of all &lt;a href=\"Lycanthropes\"&gt;Lycanthropes&lt;/a&gt;. Worshipers of Hircine are not as ruthless as those who worship other Daedra; they always give their prey at least a small chance to escape.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (The Missing God):\nThis Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;ic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"Lorkhan,\" or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo\u2014much like his father &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;. He and his metaphysical placement in the \"scheme of things\" is interpreted a variety of ways. To the Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind."}

: &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;SKYRIM&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maloch\"&gt;Maloch&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;ALTMER&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Bosmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;BOSMER&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Dunmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;DUNMER&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Redguard%20Pantheon\"&gt;YOKUDA&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malooc\"&gt;Malooc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leki\"&gt;Leki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt;,\n&lt;a href=\"Bretony%20Pantheon\"&gt;BRETONY&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheor\"&gt;Sheor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Khajiiti%20Pantheon\"&gt;ELSWEYR&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi\"&gt;Khenarthi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"S%27rendarr\"&gt;S'rendarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azurah\"&gt;Azurah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sheggorath\"&gt;Sheggorath&lt;/a&gt;\nNotes on the Divine Spirits of the Pantheons.\n&lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; (Dragon God of Time): Akatosh is the chief deity of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces), and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;). He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He is the ultimate God of the Cyrodilic Empire, where he embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy.\n&lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; (World Eater): Alduin is the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic variation of Akatosh, and only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Nine Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, 'the world eater', comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nordic pantheon (in fact, that pantheon has no chief; see Shor, below) but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.\n&lt;a href=\"Alkosh\"&gt;Alkosh&lt;/a&gt; (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anaquine&lt;/a&gt; deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle-T'har, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say 'is just a real big cat'. He repelled an early &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i pogrom of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; during mythic times.\n&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; (Mother &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;): Most traces of Akatosh disappeared from ancient &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; legends during their so-called 'exodus', primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Arkay\"&gt;Arkay&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Cycle of Life and Death): Member of the Nine Divines pantheon, and popular elsewhere as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the layman. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God.\n&lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; (King of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-El&lt;/a&gt;, who, in turn, is the soul of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;i and &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Altmora&lt;/a&gt; and Old &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\n&lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Azura was the god-ancestor that taught the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. In Elsweyr, Azurah is nearly a wholly separate entity, yet she is still tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Altmeri stock.\n&lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt; (The Bandit God): In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal diety, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; (Prince of Plots): Heralded by the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual '&lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt; (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade): Hoary thuggish cult of the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;. Originated in &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; during the Twenty Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the HoonDing (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the Lefthanded Elves, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; during the height of their ancient power, but then faded into obscurity. He is now little more than a local power spirit of the Dragontail Mountains.\n&lt;a href=\"Dibella\"&gt;Dibella&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Beauty): Popular god of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, she has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction.\n&lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt; (The Woodland Man): Ancient Atmoran demon who, at one time, nearly seduced the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; into becoming &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;. Most &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; ('Foresters Guild'), if only by association with his brother/sister, &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"HoonDing\"&gt;HoonDing&lt;/a&gt; (The Make Way God): Yokudan spirit of 'perseverance over infidels'. The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to 'make way' for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened three times -- twice in the first era during the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada%20invasion\"&gt;Ra Gada invasion&lt;/a&gt; and once during the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber War&lt;/a&gt;. In this last incarnation, the HoonDing was said to have been either a sword or a crown, or both.\n&lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt; (Rune God): The Nordic god of hermetic orders. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is absent in modern &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; mythology.\n&lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt; (Big Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Big Moon. Also called &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; or Mara's Tear. In &lt;a href=\"Khajiti\"&gt;Khajiti&lt;/a&gt; religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or &lt;a href=\"ja-Kha%27jay\"&gt;ja-Kha'jay&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; (Little Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Little Moon. Also called &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; or Stendarr's Sorrow. In Khajiti religion, Jone is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.\n&lt;a href=\"Julianos\"&gt;Julianos&lt;/a&gt; (God of Wisdom and Logic): Often associated with &lt;a href=\"Jhunal\"&gt;Jhunal&lt;/a&gt;, the Nordic father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. Monastic orders founded by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and dedicated to Julianos are the keepers of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Scroll%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; (Kiss At the End): &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic Goddess of the Storm. Widow of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; and favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the &lt;a href=\"thu%27um\"&gt;thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, or Storm Voice.\n&lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Air): Kynareth is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, she is the first to agree to &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.\n&lt;a href=\"Leki\"&gt;Leki&lt;/a&gt; (Saint of the Spirit Sword): Goddess daughter of &lt;a href=\"Tall%20Papa\"&gt;Tall Papa&lt;/a&gt; (Ruptga). Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The &lt;a href=\"Na-Totambu\"&gt;Na-Totambu&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the &lt;a href=\"Lefthanded%20Elves\"&gt;Lefthanded Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; (The Missing God): This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri 'Lorkhan', or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo -- much like his father &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt; had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the 'scheme of things' is interpreted a variety of ways. In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, for example, he is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt; (Moon Beast): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan.\n&lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; (Magus): The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Cyrodilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power. Associated with &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Zurin Arctus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Underking\"&gt;Underking&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; (God of Curses): Malacath is the reanimated dung that was &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;. A somewhat weak but vengeful &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He always tests the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; for physical weakness.\n&lt;a href=\"Malooc\"&gt;Malooc&lt;/a&gt; (Horde King): An enemy god of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;. Led the goblins against the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.\n&lt;a href=\"Mauloch\"&gt;Mauloch&lt;/a&gt; (Malacath): An &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish god, Mauloch troubled the heirs of King &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. Fled east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. &lt;a href=\"1E%20660\"&gt;1E660&lt;/a&gt;. His rage was said to fill the sky with his sulphurous hatred, later called the \"Year of Winter in Summer\".\n&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; (Goddess of Love): Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. In &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, Mara is a handmaiden of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;. In the Empire, she is Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the 'Anuad', the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. Depending on the religion, she is either married to Akatosh or Lorkhan, or the concubine of both.\n&lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; (God of Destruction): Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, though, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain.\n&lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt; (Androgyne): Mephala is the Webspinner, or the Spider God. In &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, he/she was the ancestor that taught the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;. Also called the Anticipation of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; (God of Schemes, King of Rape): Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity'. A race of supermonsters, said to live in &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt;, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.\n&lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; (First Breath of Man): Ancient cultural hero god of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Rebellion\"&gt;Taker of the Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, an act of mythic times that established Human control over the Valley Heartland. He is often associated with the Nordic powers of thu'um, and therefore with &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Morwha\"&gt;Morwha&lt;/a&gt; (Teat God): &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can 'grab more husbands'.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; (Godkiller): The Chimeri king of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, the Golden Age of old &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;. Slain during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart.\n&lt;a href=\"Onsi\"&gt;Onsi&lt;/a&gt; (Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.\n&lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt; (Old Knocker): A loan-god of the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that 'bound them to the count of winters'. At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; showed up, though, and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.\n&lt;a href=\"Phynaster\"&gt;Phynaster&lt;/a&gt;: Hero-god of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.\n&lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt; (Footpad): Thief god of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i, who grew up in the Black Kiergo section of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Kintyra\"&gt;Empress Kintyra&lt;/a&gt; as she slept.\n&lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; (The Cyrodiil): Culture god-hero of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Reman was the greatest hero of the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri%20Trouble\"&gt;Akaviri Trouble&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, he convinced the invaders to help him build his own empire, and conquered all of Tamriel except for &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He instituted the rites of becoming Emperor, which included the ritual geas to the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, a soulgem of immense power. His Dynasty was ended by the Dunmeri &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the first era. Also called the Worldly God.\n&lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt; (Two-Moons Dance): The cosmic order deity of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruptga\"&gt;Ruptga&lt;/a&gt; (Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.\n&lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt; (The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padomay&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt; nomads.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; (The Mad God): The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i creation stories; therein, he is 'born' when &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the '&lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;-shaped hole' of the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Sheor\"&gt;Sheor&lt;/a&gt; (Bad Man): In &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;y, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, born during the dark years after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sep\"&gt;Sep&lt;/a&gt; (The Snake): Yokudan version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Sep is born when &lt;a href=\"Tall%20Papa\"&gt;Tall Papa&lt;/a&gt; creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of &lt;a href=\"Satakal\"&gt;Satakal&lt;/a&gt;, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.\n&lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt; (God of Man): Cyrodilic version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, whose importance suffers when Akatosh comes to the fore of &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; (really, &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;n) religion. Shezarr was the spirit behind all human undertaking, especially against Aldmeri aggression. He is sometimes associated with the founding of the first &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Cyrodilic battlemages&lt;/a&gt;. In the present age of racial tolerance, Shezarr is all but forgotten.\n&lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Underworld): Nordic version of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who takes sides with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (i.e., Elven ones) conspire against him and bring about his defeat, dooming him to the underworld. &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;n myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who leads the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Sometimes also called Children's God (see &lt;a href=\"Orkey\"&gt;Orkey&lt;/a&gt;, above).\n&lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; (Mystery of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;): God of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;clockwork city&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; (God of Mercy): God of the Nine Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nordic origins into a deity of compassion or, sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; in his later years. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.\n&lt;a href=\"Stuhn\"&gt;Stuhn&lt;/a&gt; (God of Ransom): Nordic precursor to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;. Shield-thane of &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt;, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.\n&lt;a href=\"Syrabane\"&gt;Syrabane&lt;/a&gt; (Warlock's God): An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt; (Bird God): &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;isle of Herne&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;): Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, Tiber Septim is the most important hero-god of Mankind. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; (and the Third Empire). Also called &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;, 'Dragon of the North'.\n&lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;: Strong god of the early &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;, in some places more popular than &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;i conversion. He vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).\n&lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;: Extinct Nordic god of trials against adversity. Died defending &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; from foreign gods.\n&lt;a href=\"Tu%27whacca\"&gt;Tu'whacca&lt;/a&gt; (Tricky God): &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; (Master of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;): Warrior-poet god of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;dark gods&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Volcano&lt;/a&gt;. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he/she taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he/she could flood Morrowind and kill the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; invaders, ca. &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;: Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, &lt;a href=\"Oghma\"&gt;Oghma&lt;/a&gt;, from his favorite moments in history.\n&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; (God of the Forest): Most important deity of the &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i pantheon. While &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of 'the now'. According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt;, or 'Earth Bones'. After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;).\n&lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; (Dragon of the North): The Nordic aspect of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;. He withstood the power of the Greybeards' voices long enough to hear their prophecy. Later, many Nords could not look on him without seeing a dragon.\n&lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt; (God of Toil): &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; mythologies, perhaps introduced into &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the .\n&lt;a href=\"Zeht\"&gt;Zeht&lt;/a&gt; (God of Farms): &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n god of agriculture. Renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.\n&lt;a href=\"Zenithar\"&gt;Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God): Member of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt;, Zenithar is understandably associated with &lt;a href=\"Z%27en\"&gt;Z'en&lt;/a&gt;. In the Empire, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants and middle nobility. His worshippers say, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god 'that will always win'."}

For so long, all was at peace. My husband and I had spurned the tenets of the great &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; so we might live in peace. We wanted our magic to benefit all people of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, not bend them to our will.\nBut to my Lord, our family tragedy was too great to bear. He has it in his thick Skull that he can somehow overcome death\u2014not for the sake of knowledge, or to command fearless forces to defend our home\u2014but to tear the once-living back into this realm and imbue them in flesh. To give them life once more.\nYes, &lt;a href=\"Calion\"&gt;Calion&lt;/a&gt; died an untimely death. But where I grieve for what we did lose, &lt;a href=\"Telacar\"&gt;Telacar&lt;/a&gt; weeps for what might have been. He wished for an Apprentice to help us master our craft, to surpass our discoveries. He cannot bear our son's very Essence being gone forever.\nAnd so my husband created a golem of the boy's corpse\u2014an &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Atronach, made of flesh&lt;/a&gt;, but with eyes as cold and empty as a Gemstone. He hid his plans until the rituals had completed, and then presented that slurring abomination to me, as though I could ever forgive him. He seemed truly shocked when I rent the pale echo of Calion's spirit from its husk.\nNow I've imprisoned my husband, who I love more than life itself, because I cannot bring myself to truly punish him. Perhaps a decade will give him time to contemplate the abhorrence of his actions."}

Ria Silmane also discovered the locations where the Seventh Piece of the Staff of Chaos remains: a dense, foggy and large forest known as &lt;a href=\"Murkwood%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Murkwood&lt;/a&gt;. The sorceress recommends the Eternal Champion starts looking in the two last provinces, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormhold.\nAsking people about Murkwood will eventually lead the Eternal Champion to the city of &lt;a href=\"Stormhold%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, located in the province of Black Marsh. The citizens of the city will direct the Eternal Champion to the temple Conclave of Baal, where the Priest should help to discover the location of Murkwood.\nInside the temple, the leader of the Conclave of Baal Idolan Lancaster will greet the Eternal Champion. The Priest tells that an apprentice of his temple used a spell of massive destruction potential in a location known as &lt;a href=\"Vaults%20of%20Gemin%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Vaults of Gemin&lt;/a&gt; to impress his masters. Due to its strength, the priests could not dispel the effect and were forced to destroy Vaults of Genim and bury the ruins. Idolan explains that a Tablet which would decipher the location of Murkwood was buried with the Vaults, and he then promises to reveal the Murkwood forest to the Eternal Champion if they recover the Tablet from the remains of the Vaults of Gemin.\nAfter his deal is accepted, the priest will mark the location of the Vaults on the map.\nVaults of Genim.\nRecommended effects:\nVaults of Genim is a dungeon which includes two levels. Creatures encountered in the ruins include &lt;a href=\"Wraith%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Wraiths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hell%20Hound\"&gt;Hell Hound&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Homonculi\"&gt;Homonculi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Golem\"&gt;Stone Golem&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Daemon\"&gt;Fire Daemon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFirst Level.\nThe First Level is the greater one, it is composed by numerous rooms and corridors. Without a map it is very easy to get lost among the dark corners of the Vaults. The passage to the Second Level is located almost exactly south of the entrance. Observing the two greater corridors which are close to the entrance, it is visible that the correct path to reach it is the eastern corridor. Taking the western corridor will result in getting nowhere. Alternatively, a magic user can employ the spell &lt;a href=\"Passwall%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Passwall&lt;/a&gt; to break the walls and reach the Second Level more safely. All the creatures reported before will appear in the First Level, with the exception of Stone Golems and Fire Daemons.\nSecond Level.\nThe Second Level is by far smaller than the other. Like the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Grove%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Elden Grove&lt;/a&gt;, it is flooded, with water surrounding its soil. Its terrestrial components are composed of blocks linked to each other and smaller platforms. The Tablet which will reveal the location of Murkwood lies inside a small room which is guarded by two Fire Daemons. Using the effect Levitate will help to make the way shorter, however it is necessary to remember that Homunculi and Stone Golems will be standing above the platforms, and will attack the Eternal Champion with offensive &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Shock spells&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bridges which connect the blocks can be used to sleep without being interrupted by enemies.\nWhen reaching the room, its door will provide a riddle to be opened.\n\"\"Answer this, and pass-\"\n\"I come out of the earth,\"\n\"I am sold in the market.\"\n\"He who buys me cuts off my tail,\"\n\"Takes off my suit of silk,\"\n\"And weeps beside me when I am\"\n\"dead...\"\"\"\nThe answer is \"Onion.\"\nAfter the door is opened, two Fire Daemons will attack the Eternal Champion (the effect Resist Fire should be used now if it was brought along). This creature uses fireballs at long range and its fiery pickaxe in melee. Caution should be exercised, for Fire Daemons are indeed some of the strongest creatures in .\nThe Tablet must be given to Idolan Lancaster, who will fulfill his promise and mark the deciphered location of Murkwood on the map."}

No one talks about what happened here before the Two Kingdoms set their roots, but it is on everyone's mind all the time. It's like there is a great big &lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger%20%28Online%29\"&gt;senche-tiger&lt;/a&gt; eating our dinner, but we're forbidden to slap its nose. We all know that some Moon Bishop stirred up the Darks here and let the &lt;a href=\"dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;i. But why? How? No one will say. Vazshara has heard all the rumors of course\u2014the paddy-tales ja'khajiit laugh over when they think no one is listening. Most &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; laugh along, but this one knows that silly stories often hide darker truths. This one has to find out what really happened here.\nVazshara claws are cramped from writing! This one has spoken to many, many monks and committed their stories to paper. Vazshara has to admit, these tales are much darker than the ones she learned as ja'khajiit. The players are always the same: crazy monks and a Moon Bishop called the \"Stone-Tapper.\" Apparently, this bishop carried a magic stick that spoke secrets when he tapped it on the floor. No one knows where this magic stick came from, or where it went after the Moon Bishop died, so it might be Senche dung. But one mystery at a time, yes?\nDay and night, this Moon Bishop tapped the floor, learning all of Nirni's secrets. But eventually the magic stick ran out of Nirni-secrets, so it started telling darker secrets. &lt;a href=\"Namiira\"&gt;Namiira&lt;/a&gt;-secrets. The Tapper listened and listened, growing old and crazy. The monks of the temple went crazy too, because the tapping never stopped. It was a loud and steady sound\u2014tap-tap, tap-tap, tap-tap. Like a heartbeat, yes? Eventually, the monks hatched a plot to kill the Stone-Tapper. They lured him into the High Lunarium and stabbed him with their curved knives until he died. All the blood and secrets drained out of the Tapper's body and broke open the temple, revealing the Maw of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhaj\"&gt;Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;, and the Darks beyond.\nThis is where the tale starts to fray. In some versions of the story, The Tapper wakes up after his blood is drained and kills all the monks with lightning. In others, a great winged beast bursts out of Lorkhaj's throat and rips the monks apart with claws and fangs. But this makes no sense. The seals scattered throughout the temple clearly show the Moon Bishop flanked by monks and summoning bent spirits. And this one has seen what looks like a door in the High Lunarium. So he must have survived, and he must have pushed at least some of the monks into the Bent Dance, right? Bah. This one thinks it might be a guilty conscience. The Doubting Monks have a sour reputation. Many Khajiit think the order played a role in freeing the dro-m'Athra. This one is starting to think they may be right. Vazshara should have listened to her papa and become a fisherman. Var var var.\nZiss on this place! Abbot &lt;a href=\"Kulan-dro\"&gt;Kulan-dro&lt;/a&gt; summoned Vazshara to the High Lunarium today and gave her the worst tongue-lashing of her life. \"No more loose talk! No more questions!\" Bah! As if anything in this place was loose. This temple is a tomb. No one laughs, or sings, or dances. It's nothing but chanting, and whispers, and tail-tucked prayer. This alone would be enough to make Vazshara run away, but there is more. There was something in the Abbot's eyes. It wasn't rage\u2014no, it wasn't that. It was like ... nothing. Like a dull black nothing. Like a dead cat's eyes. It made this one's tail knot up. Vazshara has had enough. This one makes for the sea at first light. Moons curse this place, and its Abbot!"}

{"id": "799549", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=799549", "title": "Vehk's Teaching", "text": "In the waning years of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, after the coming of the Nerevarine and the deaths of two members of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vivec\"&gt;Lord Vivec&lt;/a&gt; decided to go to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; on a personal matter. Along the way, he had interesting discussions with scholars. They spoke about several topics, from The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; to the mystery of the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;.\nVehk's Book of Hours, concerning the Dragon Break.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break%23The%20Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;middle dawn&lt;/a&gt; is an axis for the spirits of the Foretime. As such, many of the beliefs of the primitive &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;psijiics&lt;/a&gt; cannot be discounted; here, in this place, are proofs within proofs...\n\"...Of special note is the Blue Star, which the Alesstics call \u2018&lt;a href=\"Mnemoli\"&gt;Mnemoli&lt;/a&gt;', that runs through this part of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt; every untime. The psijiics hold it in much reverence, and many of their folk make pilgrimages to &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; when it appears because a mountain there catches fire at its passing. This mountain is reputed to be one of the last refuges of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; before they departed from this world...\n\"...and so to most , the middle dawn is little more than undisputable and grandiose display of mystic power, which is to say nonsense, and few regard it as the numinous gateway that it really signifies. Like many things they cannot explain, the middle dawn is merely another excuse to declare good omens and portents, but unto you it should be known as the Hurling Disk, numbered seventeen...\n\"...according to the texts, Mnemoli is a wayward child of &lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;ANU&lt;/a&gt;, one of a pantheon of forgotten deities known as the \u2018Star Orphans'... a tribe of gods and goddesses that apparently felt abandoned when the Sun Withdrew from the World-Making. Like many of her siblings, Mnemoli is both confused and delighted with the Aurbis, and explores its five quarters as best she can without the help and regulation of worship, which are not needed (by which I mean, always there) during breakings of the sideways wheel...\n\"...the Hurling Disk, it is conjectured, contains a strange mingling of magic from both the Solar and Lunar spheres. That singular rarity, coupled with the rarity of its presence within the world, has kept it from gaining a strong foothold in the schools of known sorcery. The &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Selectives&lt;/a&gt; claim a similar source of power in their depictions of the Right Reaching, but that has not deterred those magicians which still try to fathom the meaning of the middle dawn and what benefits they may derive from that understanding. Perhaps it is the association of Mnemoli with the vanishing of sequential sensation (and, by extension, the teeth-filled stare of the &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Alinor Dragon&lt;/a&gt; that comes thereafter) that drives seekers of arcane knowledge to pledge their scholarship to the &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; rather than dealing with the esoteric teachings of my murder-brother &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;SEHT&lt;/a&gt; or her many aspects, who loves the secret tower so much that she trucks with folk that first gave it legs, head, and sexual recepticle...\n\"...one last note regarding the phenomenon of the middle dawn: it should be mentioned that at least one myth (\u2018The Blue Bone-Ring of &lt;a href=\"Jyggalag\"&gt;Jyg&lt;/a&gt;') suggests a relationship between Mnemolic sorcery and the Void Ghost Eaters, the magic practiced in the countless Trickster cults scattered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamri-El&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nVehk's Book of the Last Hour.\n\"And in those waning days, I decided to go to Cyrodiil with my Water Face, so that I might tell all I met along the way the truth and the truth only. I was then the Thief of the world, and my charges were three (and that being a very significant number to me), one of which was the Tower.\n\"And it was of the Tower that my emperor wanted to hear. He was dying and I loved him yet. He, too, was a Master and so I knew that he realized just how big a realm that the Tower encompassed. I am sure that when I meet the &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zurin%20Arctus\"&gt;Arctus&lt;/a&gt; again, they will have brought similar burdens. My guesses are the &lt;a href=\"The%20Lord\"&gt;Lord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ritual\"&gt;Ritual&lt;/a&gt;, but I do not know and would be delighted to be wrong.\n\"Naturally, many of my acolytes and lovers and assassins want to come with me, and I will not tell them no; the way to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; is long, and I have not taken so long a physical sojourn as this since lending my hands to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;. I will enjoy their company and answer their questions, too, and no doubt I will put many to bed with song with the borrowed voice of my sister. Further still, my coming is known and the manner of my coming, and I understand that there are lorekeepers that want my counsel, my explanations, the light of my heaven-seen face. I sent warnings that no riddles will come of it. The lawyers are pouting now.\n\"Understand that I am a Master and make my own way. For me, Mystery is dead. That is so hard to write. You cannot feel the pause. My brother is dead.\n\"Anyway.\n\"So for all these reasons and more, and mostly because there are more mysteries in the Capital that I do not know and shall take the place of those I own, this pilgrimage shall be filled with nothing but untangled truth about the Tower. I can hear him now: what of &lt;a href=\"Auriel\"&gt;Auriel&lt;/a&gt;'s breaking? What of my twinned antecedent? What is the meaning of the endeavor that &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; refuses to admit? What, indeed, said the Thief to the Master that mostly knew.\n\"For my part, I know my own first question: What do you want to hear first?\"\n--Book of the Last Hour, Vehk and Vehk\n...the Tower.\n&lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"Vehk is it? Well well. Perhaps you better start with a smaller bite than the \"true nature of the Psijiics\" if we hope to have a complete answer before the Dragon Breaks once and for all. Unless my readings on Dwemer numerology are mistaken, the Psijiic Endeavor touches the heart of most of the mysteries of this world. Ha ha, thankfully I am under no self-imposed obligation to speak clearly!\"\n\"So, Thief, let us begin with something smaller, but still large enough for those of us still within Time. Tell us of the Psijiics and their relation to the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;s (and, by extension, to the Tower).\"\n\"\"By extension, to the Tower...\"?\"\n\"It extends the other way, I'm afraid. But yes, let's go that way, spinning. I have spoken of this in an earlier life [21].\"\nWhat is the Tower?\nThe Tower is an ideal, which, in our world of myth and magic, means that it is so real that it becomes dangerous. It is the existence of the True Self within the Universal Self, and is embodied by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tower%20%28Constellation%29\"&gt;fourth constellation&lt;/a&gt;, and is guarded by the &lt;a href=\"The%20Thief\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, the third. The Thief is another metaphorical absolute; in this case, he represents the \u201ctaking of the Tower\u201d or, and sometimes more importantly, the \u201ctaking\u201d of the Tower\u2019s secret.\nWhat is the Tower\u2019s secret?\nHow to permanently exist beyond duplexity, antithesis, or trouble. This is not an easy concept, I know. Imagine being able to feel with all of your senses the relentless alien terror that is God and your place in it, which is everywhere and therefore nowhere, and realizing that it means the total dissolution of your individuality into boundless being. Imagine that and then still being able to say \u201cI\u201d. The \u201cI\u201d is the Tower.\nWhat created the Tower?\nThe Wheel created it. The Wheel is the structure of this universe, and it is easiest to see it that way: rim, spokes, hub, and all the spaces within and without. I shall take each in turn.\nWhat created the Wheel?\n&lt;a href=\"Anu\"&gt;Anu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;Padhome&lt;/a&gt;, stasis and change, both vast realms sitting in the &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;, they created it. Not vast, infinite, as the void was infinite. Imagine an infinity enclosed by another; you come away with a bubble. Now watch as the two bubbles touch. Their intersection is a perfect circle of pattern and possibility that we shall call the Aurbis. The Aurbis is the foundation of the Wheel.\nWhat are the spaces within and without of the Wheel?\nOutside the wheel is the void, bereft of anything. It cannot be named. If it has more aspects than stasis and change, they are outside of true language. Inside of the Wheel is the Aurbis, as I have explained.\nWhat is the rim of the Wheel?\nAs the process of subcreation continued, both Anu and Padhome awakened. For to see your antithesis is to finally awaken. Each gave birth to their souls, Auriel and &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, and these souls regarded the Aurbis each in their own part, and from this came the etada, the original patterns. These etada eventually congealed.\nAnu\u2019s firstborn, for he mostly desired order, was time, anon &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;. Padhome\u2019s firstborn went wandering from the start, changing as he went, and wanted no name but was branded with &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. As time allowed more and more patterns to individualize, Lorkhan watched the Aurbis shape itself and grew equally delighted and tired with each new shaping. As the gods and demons of the Aurbis erupted, the get of Padhome tried to leave it all behind for he wanted all of it and none of it all at once. It was then that he came to the border of the Aurbis.\nHe saw the Tower, for a circle turned sideways is an \u201cI\u201d. This was the first word of Lorkhan and he would never, ever forget it.\nWhat are the spokes of the Wheel?\nFor ages the &lt;a href=\"Et%27ada\"&gt;etada&lt;/a&gt; grew and shaped and destroyed each other and destroyed each other\u2019s creations. Some were like Lorkhan and discovered the void outside of the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;, though if some saw the Tower I do not know, but I know that, if they did, none held it in such high esteem. In any case, some of those that did see the void created its like inside the Aurbis, but each of these smaller voids sought each other out. Void shall follow void; the etada called it &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. What was left of the Aurbis was solid change, otherwise known as magic. The etada called this &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow Lorkhan had by at this point seen everything there was to see, and could accept none of it. Here were the etada with their magic and their voids and everything in between and he yearned for the return to flux but at the same time he could not bear to lose his identity. He did not know what he wanted, but he knew how to build it. Through trickery (\u201cWe have made the Aurbis unstable with the voids\u201d) and wisdom (\u201cWe are of two minds and so should make a perfect gem of compromise\u201d) and force (\u201cDo what I say, rude spirit\u201d), he bound some of the strongest etada to create the &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;World&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe spokes of the Wheel are the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;eight gifts of the Aedra&lt;/a&gt;, sons and daughters of Aetherius. The &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;voids between each spoke number sixteen&lt;/a&gt;, and their masters are the sons and daughters of Oblivion. The center of the Wheel was another circle, the hub, which held everything together. The etada called this &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat is the hub of the Wheel?\nWe are the hub, the Mundus that goes by many names. We are the heart of all creation. What does this mean? Why should we care? Lorkhan created it so that we could find what he did. In fact, and here is the secret: the hub is the reflection of its creators, the circle within the circle, only the border to ours is so much easier to see. Stand in its flux and remain whole of mind. Look at it sideways and see the \u201cI\u201d.\nThis is the Tower.\n\"Now then, yes, that's a good place to start, I think. Where shall we go from here, endeavor or break or the endeavor to break?\"\nConcerning the Psijic Order and the Psijic Endeavor.\nWhat is the relationship between the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;?\nNothing but a namesake, I am sorry to say. Now we can end that mystery. The Endeavor is a method of achieving the Tower and then what to do after. The Order is not, and does not really care for the idea of the Endeavor at all, thinking it wrong-headed nearly from the start.\nSo what is the Psijic Order?\nA monastic order of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, impressive with age, and obsessed with a kind of mythic genealogy, made famous by their monomythism. Theirs was mostly the study of reverse-ancestry as a means to combat spiritual and material degradation. Or at least it was, I should say, as I do not know what they do now and do not much care. They were wrong-headed nearly from the start.\nIt is interesting to note that their original views were very unorthodox for Altmer, and thus their exile from &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. These views included the suggestion that Anu\u2019s son, the Time Dragon, was formed in reaction to Padhome\u2019s influence. In effect, \"Anu had finally done something\". This inconceivable effect gave rise to an equally inconceivable cause, and so &lt;a href=\"Padomay\"&gt;PSJJJJ&lt;/a&gt; was named and the Order eventually took his name.\n&lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt; was not a member of these exiles, no. Some of the Order\u2019s precepts and ideas do (or did) flourish in the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil, most Maruhkati sects (including the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Selectives&lt;/a&gt;, though they would deny it), Ancestral-Mothism, and, most famous of all, the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Now we can move on safely to the Endeavor. Any questions up to this point?\"\nMore about Aedra - Daedra.\n\"Sons and daughters of\" should be read as associates of/associated with, especially insofar as this association was a conscious choice.\nToday the common parlance is that only the eight that followed Lorkhan and created the Mundus are truly \"&lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;,\" but this is folly. Some were not even the strongest of the Aetherius-aligned etada at the time, but were made as such by their creation of the dawn.\nRemember, even the word \"&lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\" started as a youthful rebellion.\nI promised no riddles, but we speak here of the family-trees of the earliest divine planets, thrones, and seekers. Aurbis was created from the two, its energies coalesced into first forms, and these in turn made of the Aurbis what they could; keep sons and daughters in that context and it becomes easier to see them.\nOn Aldmeri Ancestor Worship.\nAncestor worship is the common center of all &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i religions. The application of that worship is an entirely different thing, and the designs of the Order have nothing to do with the Endeavor, though they may have inspired some to take that road.\nThe arbitrary and the motivated in regarding one's divine ancestors: ignoring a manifest concern for belief in them as us, instead we concern ourselves with intensity and its relationship with action, valorizing \u2018little narratives\u2019 and proliferation of narratives in our native cultures to the point that there is no perch from extraneous content. Pure subjectivity is no longer possible; instead it becomes akin to sensory deprivation, yet without the fear, for we sense things that remind us of the dawn: the sacrifice into the stabilizing bones, new-built towers with broken intentions, and first metals gone blue from exposure to the long sun. The quest toward the ur-you for certainty and foundations is not innocent. However, it is an honest vindication for truth and superhuman ideals, which means it should be regarded as such by our own sense of fault: we made this, we dreamed this, we made it viable by voting with our seductions, we will live again to show our genuine applause.\nMore on the Psijic Endeavor.\nWhat is the Psijic Endeavor?\nThe basis for the teachings of the Prophet Veloth, founder of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and father of Dunmeri culture. Veloth describes the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Endeavor\"&gt;Psijic Endeavor&lt;/a&gt; as a process of glorious apotheosis, where time itself is bent inward and outward into 'a shape that is always new'. Those who can attain this state, called &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;chim&lt;/a&gt;, experience an ineffable sense of the godhead, and escape the strictures of the world-egg.\nIt should be noted that, while Veloth is given credit for establishing the anti-laws that govern the Endeavor, this process has its antecedents in the teachings of the Black Hands &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, through that lord's association with PSJJJJ.\nWhat is \"chim\"?\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofex\"&gt;Ehlnofex&lt;/a&gt;: an ancient sigil connoting 'royalty', 'starlight', and 'high splendor'. As with most characters of that dangerous language, the sigil CHIM constantly distorts itself. Those scholars that can perceive its shape regard it as a Crowned Tower that threatens to break apart at the slightest break in concentration.\nRepresentations of the chim, and by extension the Psijic Endeavor, are always protean values, such as the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;anumidi models&lt;/a&gt; renowned by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarab of contemporary astrolothurges, and the Striking (\"exact egg-cracking\") of old &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. All of these representations possess an innate and constant aspect of transformation.\nWhat is the purpose of the Psijic Endeavor?\nTo transcend mortal boundaries set in place by immortal rulers. At its simplest, the state of chim provides an escape from all known laws of the divine worlds and the corruptions of the black sea of Oblivion. It is a return to the first brush of Anu-Padomay, where stasis and change created possibility. Moreso, it the essence needed to hold that 'dawning' together without disaster. One that knows CHIM observes the Tower without fear. Moreso: he resides within.\nI am confused. What is the relationship of the Psijic Endeavor and the Tower?\nAh. Because from within one, you may regard the other.\nThat helps little. What examples of the Psijic Endeavor exist today?\nThe world you stand on is said to be the first attempt at chim. It is also admittedly the most famous. That it was choreographed by Lorkhan and ultimately failed is well-documented, but whether or not this failure was intentional is still disputed.\nWait. Why would anyone want to purposely fail the process of CHIM?\nAnd this is the most-reached destination of all that embark upon this road. Why would Lorkhan and his (unwitting?) agents sabotage their experiments with the Tower? Why would he crumble that which he esteems?\nPerhaps he failed so you might know how not to."}

It works, but Razum-dar is too burned to stop &lt;a href=\"Asteril\"&gt;Asteril&lt;/a&gt;. He sends the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; into the tunnels to track her down while he recovers.\nIt looks like the Veiled Heritance is gathering large forces.

He will direct you to go speak with &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt; on the matter. \nRazum-dar can be found in the Thalmor Headquarters, between the Fighters Guild and the Mages Guild. Speak with him there and he will tell you he has a plan to flush out the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt; members in the city; he is going to magically disguise himself as &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; to bait out an assasination attempt. In the meantime, he will direct you to go speak with &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Fariel\"&gt;Treethane Fariel&lt;/a&gt; so that she can tell you what she knows about the Heritance activity in the city. Fariel is right here in the room; talk to her and she will explain the plan.

Speak with Raz afterwards and he will say that Asteril cannot have gone far, as she did not use any form of portal magic. Raz is hurt though and cannot join you in hunting her down, so you must proceed on your own. \nProceed through the tunnels and fight your way through the Heritance members. You will not find Asteril, but you will find her commander, a man named &lt;a href=\"Eldecil\"&gt;Eldecil&lt;/a&gt;. Kill him, then read \"&lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil's Orders&lt;/a&gt;\", which is lying on the bench here. You will learn from this note that the Heritance are preparing for something. Take this information back to Razum-dar, and he will speculate that the Heritance are amassing a force to attack Valenwood. He will tell you to bring this information back to Treethane Fariel. \nSpeak with Fariel to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"Double%20Jeopardy\"&gt;Double Jeopardy&lt;/a&gt;.\""}
