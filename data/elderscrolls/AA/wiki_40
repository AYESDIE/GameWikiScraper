It is stated that the only way to fully escape the devastation of Landfall is to &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;know love&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that while Landfall involves the destruction of Nirn, it is not the end of the &lt;a href=\"kalpa\"&gt;kalpa&lt;/a&gt;; Mundus still exists after Landfall, during the events of &lt;a href=\"C0DA\"&gt;C0DA&lt;/a&gt;. This indicates that the next world has not yet begun, as it would at the beginning of a new kalpa.\nBackground.\nThe origins of the event can be traced back to the ending days of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s conquests in which the Numidium was used. During the final battle of the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, the siege of Alinor, the Numidium was caught in a time warp. While the siege of Alinor only lasted around an hour in perceivable time, the warp caused the Numidium to remain in battle with the forces of the Dominion from some point in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; all the way to the late Fifth Era.\nAfter the Numidium's eventual return to Tamriel in the Fifth Era, it resumed its war against the elves, taking on the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, a strange insect-like prophet who foretold the return of Numidium traveled to Morrowind in order to save its inhabitants from the coming apocalypse, but would be crushed by the Numidium before he could achieve his goals.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; tried to fight off the Numidium their resistance was proven to be futile when the Numidium used its \"ancestroscythe\" abilities to effectively erase the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; race from existence. As the Numidium was about to annihilate a large group of &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; refugees attempting to escape the destruction in a ship known as the Wonderweir, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; appeared, piloting the &lt;a href=\"Akulakhan\"&gt;Akulakhan&lt;/a&gt; and began to battle the Numidium. With the Numidium distracted, the Wonderweir was able to leave Nirn, reaching the moon &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; where the passengers would take refuge and eventually create colonies under its surface. However, the Nerevarine was unable to stop the Numidium which would continue its destruction of Nirn and, after some time, would move on to Masser where it would be verbally defeated by a Dunmer known as Jubal-lun-Sul who would later go on to end the Landfall by creating the first of the \"New Men\" with &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;."}

It better be! For all the headaches and delays\u2014not to mention having to constantly fend off the advances of a dozen drunken warriors\u2014this run has been one problem after another.\nTake, for example, the incident that occurred after we left the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Belkarth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Belkarth&lt;/a&gt; behind us. One of my wagon drivers, Gortho, must have joined our \"passengers\" for a few too many celebratory drinks around the campfire last night. He was practically asleep at the reins when he drove the wagon wheels over the gaping holes in the road. Now two wheels are cracked and an axel has broken, forcing us to set up this temporary waystation in the middle of nowhere.\nThe crafting stations are up and operational. Repairs are now underway on the wagon. Gortho feels terrible, but that's probably got more to do with his hangover than with any feelings of guilt over falling down on his job. I'm a bit worried about the strange &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; that we've heard live in this forsaken wilderness. I'm not sure how defensible this spot actually is. But so far, we haven't seen hide nor hair of the creatures.\nI wish the warriors would stop drinking and help us keep watch while repairs on the wagon continue. I have the uncomfortable feeling that someone or something has been watching us for the past hour. I'm sure it's nothing, but I'd feel better if these so-called warriors were actually in a condition to help us fight\u2014if it comes down to that.\n&lt;a href=\"Iron%20Orcs\"&gt;Iron Orcs&lt;/a&gt;! They appeared out of nowhere and surrounded us! Gods, look how many of them there are! I'll write more after we drive the marauders off. Provided I survive this battle."}

When called upon by the Greybeards after killing &lt;a href=\"Mirmulnir\"&gt;Mirmulnir&lt;/a&gt;, Dov-Ah-Kiin is stressed as three separate words. This could signal that the real translation of \"Dov-ah-kiin\" is \"Born Hunter of Dragonkind,\" when the traditional naming convention of dragons is held.\nProphecy.\nThe appearance of the Last Dragonborn was prophesied upon &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20the%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Alduin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, a large edifice found within &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Haven%20Temple\"&gt;Sky Haven Temple&lt;/a&gt;. It depicts several events that would preface the return of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;Nordic god&lt;/a&gt; of time, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;. The prophecy itself is dire, but scholars believed that its omens had been fulfilled and that a single individual, gifted with the same powers of the &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt; held by the dragons themselves, may rise to fight against Alduin and assure &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;'s survival. Alduin finally returned in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, during the midst of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. Raising an army of dragons from the dead, he attempted to resume his path of destruction. However, he was eventually defeated in a battle by the Last Dragonborn and three ancient &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic heroes in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nMuch like previous &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; individuals who existed throughout history, such as &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, the Last Dragonborn has the ability to consume a slain dragon's soul and absorb its knowledge and power, allowing them to learn &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;words of power&lt;/a&gt; almost instantaneously, though reportedly neither Reman nor Tiber have ever killed a dragon and absorbed its soul. It is said that the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; have always guided, protected, and served the Dragonborn, whom they consider \"The Ultimate Dragon Slayer.\"\nAt the beginning of , 7 AM of the 17th of &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; 4E 201, the Dragonborn is a prisoner, who had been captured by members of the Imperial Legion after crossing the border from &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. While being transported to the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn discovers that &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, is a fellow prisoner. Upon reaching Helgen, the local &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Captain\"&gt;Imperial Captain&lt;/a&gt; sentences all the prisoners to death. Seconds before the Dragonborn's execution, &lt;a href=\"Alduin\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; attacks, providing a chance for escape. Regardless of race, the Dragonborn starts with both &lt;a href=\"Flames%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;flames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; spells, indicating that they studied the arcane arts before traveling to Skyrim.\nDuring the events of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"No%20One%20Escapes%20Cidhna%20Mine\"&gt;No One Escapes Cidhna Mine&lt;/a&gt;,\" the Dragonborn can choose to remark on whether they have a family or not. When talking with &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn may comment on what type of relationship the Dragonborn had with their parents as well as hinting at their fate. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Eola\"&gt;Eola&lt;/a&gt; may claim that they may have tasted the flesh of a dead sibling when they were young, during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Taste%20of%20Death\"&gt;The Taste of Death&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWhen formally greeting the Last Dragonborn, the &lt;a href=\"Greybeards\"&gt;Greybeards&lt;/a&gt; name them \"&lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt;,\" Dragon of the North. The same title was held by &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, and supposedly all Dragonborns before that have visited the Greybeards.\nPhysical appearance.\n\"Skyrim's\" trailers and concept art depict the Dragonborn as a male &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; with brownish blonde hair and light blue eyes. He wears a &lt;a href=\"Studded%20Armor\"&gt;studded cuirass&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Gauntlets%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Boots%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;iron boots&lt;/a&gt;. In one trailer, the Dragonborn uses a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel sword&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Banded%20Iron%20Shield\"&gt;banded iron shield&lt;/a&gt;, while in a screenshot he &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wielding\"&gt;dual wields&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Sword%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel sword&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel dagger&lt;/a&gt;. In \"Skyrim\", as with all \"Elder Scrolls\" games, race, gender, appearance, and equipment are left to the player's discretion."}

The locals decided that she was young and pretty by her figure and her poise, though no one ever saw her face. She and the &lt;a href=\"armorer\"&gt;armorer&lt;/a&gt; would retire to the back of his shop, and he would close down his business and dismiss his apprentices for a few hours. Then, at mid-afternoon, she would leave, only to return at precisely the same time the next day. As gossip goes, it was fairly meager stuff, though what the old man was doing with such a well dressed and attractively proportioned woman was the source of several crude jokes. After several weeks, the visits stopped, and life returned to normal in the slums of Tear.\nIt was not until a month or two after the visits had stopped, that in one of the many &lt;a href=\"tavern\"&gt;tavern&lt;/a&gt;s in the neighborhood, a young local tailor, having imbibed too much sauce, asked the armorer, \u201cSo whatever happened to your lady friend? You break her heart?\u201d\nThe armorer, well aware of the rumors, simply replied, \u201cShe is a proper young lady of quality. There was nothing between her and the likes of me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was she doing at your shop every day for?\u201d asked the tavern wench, who had been dying to get the subject open.\n\u201cIf you must know,\u201d said the armorer. \u201cI was teaching her the craft.\u201d\n\u201cYou're putting us on,\u201d laughed the tailor.\n\u201cNo, the young lady had a particular fascination with my particular kind of artistry,\u201d the armorer said, with a hint of pride before getting lost in the reverie. \u201cI taught her how to mend &lt;a href=\"swords\"&gt;swords&lt;/a&gt; specifically, from all kinds of nicks and breaks, hairline fissures, cracked pommels, quillons, and grips. When she first started, she had no idea how to secure the grips to the tang of the blade... Well, of course she was green to start off with, why wouldn't she be? But she weren't afraid to get her hands dirty. I taught her how to patch the little inlaid silver and gold filigree you find on really fine blades, and how to polish it all to a mirror sheen so the sword looks like the gods just pulled it from their celestial anvil.\u201d\nThe tavern wench and the tailor laughed out loud. No matter what he alleged, the armorer was speaking of the young lady's training as another man speaks of a long lost love.\nMore of the locals in the tavern would have listened to the armorer's pathetic tale, but more important gossip had taken precedence. There was another murdered slave-trader found in the center of town, gutted from fore to aft. That made six of them total in barely a fortnight. Some called the killer \u201cThe Liberator,\u201d but that sort of anti-slavery zeal was rare among the common folk. They preferred calling him \u201cThe Lopper,\u201d as several of the earlier victims had been completely beheaded. Others had been simply perforated, sliced, or gutted, but \u201cThe Lopper\u201d still kept his original sobriquet.\nWhile the enthusiastic hooligans made bets about the condition of the next slave-trader's corpse, several dozen of the surviving members of that trade were meeting at the manor house of Serjo Dres Minegaur. Minegaur was a minor houseman of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, but a major member of the slave-trading fraternity. Perhaps his best years were behind him, but his associates still counted on him for wisdom.\n\u201cWe need to take what we know of this Lopper and search accordingly,\u201d said Minegaur, seated in front of his opulent hearth. \u201cWe know he has an unreasonable hatred of slavery and slave-traders. We know he is skilled with a blade. We know he has the stealth and finesse to execute our most well-secured brethren in their most secure abodes. It sounds to me to be an adventurer, an Outlander. Surely no citizen of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; would strike at us like this.\u201d\nThe slave-traders nodded in agreement. An Outlander seemed most likely for their troubles. It was always true.\n\u201cWere I fifty years younger, I would take down my blade Akrash from the hearth,\u201d Minegaur made an expansive gesture to the shimmering &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. \u201cAnd join you in seeking out this terror. Search him out where adventurers meet -- taverns and guildhalls. Then show him a little lopping of my own.\u201d\nThe slave-traders laughed politely.\n\u201cYou wouldn't let us borrow your blade for the execution, I suppose, would you, Serjo?\u201d asked Soron Jeles, a young toadying slaver enthusiastically.\n\u201cIt would be an excellent use for Akrash,\u201d sighed Minegaur. \u201cBut I vowed to retire her when I retired.\u201d\nMinegaur called for his daughter Peliah to bring the slavers more &lt;a href=\"Flin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;flin&lt;/a&gt;, but they waved the girl away. It was to be a night for hunting the Lopper, not drinking away their troubles. Minegaur heartily approved of their devotion, particular as expensive as the liquor was getting to be.\nWhen the last of the slavers had left, the old man kissed his daughter on the head, took one last admiring look at Akrash, and toddled off to his bed. No sooner had he done so then Peliah had the blade off the mantle, and was flying with it across the field behind the manor house. She knew Kazagh had been waiting for her for hours in the stables.\nHe sprung out at her from the shadows, and wrapping his strong, furry arms around her, kissed her long and sweet. Holding him as long as she dared to, she finally broke away and handed him the blade. He tested its edge.\n\u201cThe finest &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i swordsmith couldn't hone an edge this keen,\u201d he said, looking at his beloved with pride. \u201cAnd I know I nicked it up good last night.\u201d\n\u201cThat you did,\u201d said Peliah. \u201cYou must have cut through an iron cuirass.\u201d\n\u201cThe slavers are taking precautions now,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhat did they say during their meeting?\u201d\n\u201cThey think it's an Outlander adventurer,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt didn't occur to any of them that a Khajiiti slave would possess the skill to commit all these 'loppings.'\u201d\n\u201cAnd your father doesn't suspect that it's his dear Akrash that is striking into the heart of oppression?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would he, when every day he finds it fresh as the day before? Now I must go before anyone notices I'm gone. My nurse sometimes comes in to ask me some detail about the wedding, as if I had any choice in the matter at all.\u201d\n\u201cI promise you,\u201d said Kazagh very seriously. \u201cYou will not be forced into any marriage to cement your family's slave-dealing dynasty. The last scabbard Akrash will be sheathed into will be your father's heart. And when you are an orphan, you can free the slaves, move to a more enlightened province, and marry who you like.\u201d\n\u201cI wonder who that will be,\u201d Peliah teased, and raced out of the stables.\nJust before dawn, Peliah awoke and crept out to the garden, where she found Akrash hidden in the &lt;a href=\"bittergreen\"&gt;bittergreen&lt;/a&gt; vines. The edge was still relatively keen, but there were scratches vertically across the blade's surface. Another beheading, she thought, as she took pumice stone and patiently rubbed out the marks, finally polishing it with a solution of salt and vinegar. It was up on the mantle in pristine condition when her father came into the sitting room for his breakfast.\nWhen the news came that Kemillith Torom, Peliah's husband-to-be, had been found outside of a canton, his head on a spike some feet away, she did not have to pretend to grieve. Her father knew she did not want to marry him.\n\u201cIt is a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lad was a good slaver. But there are plenty of other young men who would appreciate an alliance with our family. What about young Soron Jeles?\u201d\nTwo days nights later, Soron Jeles was visited by the Lopper. The struggle did not take long, but Soron had had armed himself with one small defense\u2014a needle dipped in the ichor of poisonplant, hidden up his sleeve. After the mortal blow, he collapsed forward and stuck Kazagh in the calf with the pin. By the time he made it back to the Minegaur manorhouse, he was dying.\nVision blurring, he climbed up to the eaves of the house to Peliah's window and rapped. Peliah did not answer immediately, as she was in a deep, wonderful sleep, dreaming about her future with her Khajiiti lover. He rapped louder, which woke up not only Peliah, but also her father in the next room.\n\u201cKazagh!\u201d she cried, opening up the window. The next person in the bedroom was Minegaur himself.\nAs he saw it, this slave, his property, was about to lop off the head of his daughter, his property, with his sword, his property. Suddenly, with the energy of a young man, Minegaur rushed at the dying Khajiit, knocking the sword out of his hand. Before Peliah could stop him, her father had thrust the blade into her lover's heart.\nThe excitement over, the old man dropped the sword and turned to the door to call the Guard. As an after thought, it occurred to him to make certain that his daughter hadn't been injured and might require a Healer. Minegaur turned to her. For a moment, he felt simply disoriented, feeling the force of the blow, but not the blade itself. Then he saw the blood and then felt the pain. Before he fully realized that his daughter had stabbed him with Akrash, he was dead. The blade, at last, found its scabbard.\nA week later, after the official investigations, the slave was buried in an unmarked grave in the manor field, and Serjo Dres Minegaur found his resting place in a modest corner of the family's opulent mausoleum. A larger crowd of curious onlookers came to view the funeral of the noble slaver whose secret life was as the savage Lopper of his competitors. The audience was respectfully quiet, though there was not a person there not imagining the final moments of the man's life. Attacking his own daughter in his madness, luckily defended by the loyal, hapless slave, before turning the blade on himself.\nAmong the viewers was an old armorer who saw for one last time the veiled young lady before she disappeared forever from &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;."}

Where they came from, none could say. After a time they faded and vanished, all gone away to the lost corners of the world. All save one.\nA great beast made entirely of bones did burrow a writhing path through the ground, named the &lt;a href=\"Dringoth\"&gt;Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; by those who survived its passage. Through none could say where it went or what drove it, all knew the barren swaths of land in its wake.\nIt is said the Destroyer's coming could be felt as a quailing of the sod a full day before its arrival. When it arrived in a place, the great beast would writhe about, shattering walls and toppling buildings. Cliffs would turn slurry in the great quakes brought by its pursuit, and many a pod home burst beneath its bones. It did so until it found &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Men&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; who could answer its question.\nFor the Destroyer would always question its victims. The oldest accounts of these questions were all variations on, \"Where can I find the old bones?\" The canniest of those asked would point in a direction deemed most expediently away from, and least destructive to, their remaining homes.\nAs the Destroyer searched - evidently in vain - its questions changed. As it neared the end of its rampage it was known to ask, \"May I sleep here? It has been so long since I slept.\"\nThe only one known to answer \"yes\" to this question was the &lt;a href=\"treethane\"&gt;treethane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;, the Walking City. Knowing Falinesti would soon move on from where it wintered in &lt;a href=\"Southpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;, she convinced the Destroyer to sleep in the boughs of &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Orchard\"&gt;Arborfell&lt;/a&gt;, an orchard known for its abundance of bats.\nThere, the &lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; priesthood planted a blessed seed in the skull of the great beast as it slept. This seed soon grew into a sapling, the sapling into a great tree, and the great tree into the &lt;a href=\"Barrowbough\"&gt;Barrowbough&lt;/a&gt;. The bones have not stirred since.\nIn the ages following the Destroyer's final rest, ancient bones have sometimes been unearthed throughout &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. Though silent, these remains are brought to Arborfell - now the \"&lt;a href=\"Bone%20Orchard\"&gt;Bone Orchard&lt;/a&gt;\" - in hopes that they will always remain so.\nThis tradition has spread throughout Valenwood. &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; far and wide have taken to burying the bones of their loved ones in the shade of the Barrowbough. Here they believe Y'ffre will grant his blessing, a final sleep for the lost."}

Afterwards, they must travel to Ebonheart and dance inside The Ebony Flask in the east of the town, and in the basement of the great Hlaalu House.

The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; need to 'make way' for their people.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nHoonDing is first known to have represented himself as an avatar by &lt;a href=\"Diagna\"&gt;Diagna&lt;/a&gt;. Diagna was instrumental to the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Sinistral%20Elves\"&gt;Sinistral Elves&lt;/a&gt;, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In a tale about The &lt;a href=\"HoonDing%20Gong\"&gt;HoonDing Gong&lt;/a&gt;, Diagna allegedly crashed his fist against it and swords fell from the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Orichalc%20Tower\"&gt;Orichalc Tower&lt;/a&gt; like \"needles from a dry pine\". In &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the Orcs of Orsinium during the height of their ancient power. This was presumably the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Siege of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. He then faded into obscurity, and is now little more than a local power spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Dragontail%20Mountains\"&gt;Dragontail Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Frandar%20Hunding\"&gt;Frandar Hunding&lt;/a&gt; was also an aspect of HoonDing. During the arrival of the Yokudan people to Tamriel, he led them against &lt;a href=\"Malooc\"&gt;Malooc&lt;/a&gt; the Horde King, the enemy god of Ra Gada who led an army of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s against the Redguards in the First Era. Then HoonDing appeared to drive out the goblin force all the way to the east.\nSecond Era.\nDuring the Tiber Wars, HoonDing was said to have been a sword or a crown, or both. This refers to either &lt;a href=\"A%27Tor\"&gt;Prince A'Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crown&lt;/a&gt; who was transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Sword\"&gt;Soul Sword&lt;/a&gt;; or &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20%28Redguard%29\"&gt;Cyrus the Restless&lt;/a&gt;, a Crown who wielded the Soul Sword. It is also possible that both Cyrus and A'Tor together were an aspect of HoonDing. Cyrus was able to defeat the dragon &lt;a href=\"Nafaalilargus\"&gt;Nafaalilargus&lt;/a&gt; as he was more than a regular man.\nMultiplicity of Aspects.\nThe HoonDing has had many other manifestations over the course of time; for example, &lt;a href=\"Reymon%20Ebonarm\"&gt;Reymon Ebonarm&lt;/a&gt; may be another aspect of the HoonDing that has manifested on Tamriel as an adversary of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; powers."}

She saw some of them head to the barn in the distance, so she will send you there to check on them. \nHead to the barn in the east of town. When you enter, Adusa will just have arrived, and you will hear a conversation between her and a townsperson where he questions why he should trust a vampire like her. On the top floor of the barn, you will find a copy of the lorebook \"&lt;a href=\"Antecedents%20of%20Dwemer%20Law%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Antecedents of Dwemer Law&lt;/a&gt;\", so be sure to pick that up.

She will tell you to go into town and look for more survivors while she guards the people in the barn. \nThere are four townsfolk for you to save. &lt;a href=\"Celeste\"&gt;Celeste&lt;/a&gt; will be in a house in the south of town, hiding behind a table on its side. She will tell you of a woman who came into town and turned everyone into bloodfiends. Across the road from here is the Esmery House; the building with a door. On the top floor, you will find &lt;a href=\"Corwyn\"&gt;Corwyn&lt;/a&gt;. He will tell you that the woman Celeste mentioned is called &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Lleraya%20Montclair\"&gt;Lleraya&lt;/a&gt;. After talking to him, head outside and to the house to your right. You will find the body of &lt;a href=\"Federic\"&gt;Federic&lt;/a&gt;; his body will display little blood for his violent death. Finally, head for the house behind the Esmery House, where you will find that &lt;a href=\"Thibierry\"&gt;Thibierry&lt;/a&gt; has barricaded the door. \nOnce you have found all the survivors, bring them back to the barn and speak with Adusa there. While you were gone, she discovered that the bloodfiends here have a commander. She will task you with taking out said commander while she takes the survivors to safety. The commander is in the Mayor's house atop the hill; head in there and take out &lt;a href=\"Maldred%20Gagnon\"&gt;Maldred Gagnon&lt;/a&gt;.

Horkers will not necessarily attack on sight, instead bellowing loudly to ward off those coming too close. If the threat does not back off, they will attack by slashing with their three large tusks. This can be a fatal problem at lower levels if surrounded.\nHabitats.\nUsually, horkers are found near cold water.

When approached, horkers will turn to face the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; and will roar at them until they return to a far enough distance not to\u00a0alert them. If one is harassed or attacked, the entire group will become aggressive.\nAlthough resilient and fast in deep water, they are slow and easy to avoid on land. This makes them easy targets, especially for ranged attacks. When badly injured, horkers often flee. Although they lie next to cold waters and are quite fleshy, they are not resistant to &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrophies.\nWith the addition of , Horker trophies can be made for the &lt;a href=\"Trophy%20Room\"&gt;Trophy Room&lt;/a&gt; in one's &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;Homestead&lt;/a&gt;:"}

The stories are varied, ranging from deadly attacks to a girl who claims she was saved from drowning.\nI have taken it upon myself to compile some of these for those who journey along the frozen coast.\nOur first tale is of a hunter named &lt;a href=\"Gromm\"&gt;Gromm&lt;/a&gt;. He claims that one night while turning in after a long day of trapping, he saw a great shadow cast on the wall of his tent. Did he get the horker or did the horker get him?\nGromm was a great trapper working in the frozen tundra collecting &lt;a href=\"Fox%20Pelt\"&gt;fox pelts&lt;/a&gt; but as he was about to fall asleep one night, he heard some noises coming from outside of his tent.\nHis first instinct was to remain calm and see if the beast would pass, but after some threatening roars, Gromm slowly made for his axe. The creature detected his movement and began to thrash around using its &lt;a href=\"Horker%20Tusk%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;great tusks&lt;/a&gt; to shred the hunter's tent and knocking the hunter off balance.\nAs he stumbled Gromm was able to use a frost spell scroll but the &lt;a href=\"Frost\"&gt;ice magic&lt;/a&gt; seemed to have diminished effect on the horker. That tidbit may be of use to someone out there.\nAfter recovering from the stagger, Gromm was able to steady himself and with a few great cleaves killed the horker. Though his camp was in ruins, Gromm was lucky to walk away with only a slight goring to his left thigh.\nGromm's parting comment was that if you do encounter a horker, remain calm and remember that if you survive, the meat and tusks will fetch a nice bit of gold at market"}

{"id": "6040", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6040", "title": "Horse (Oblivion)", "text": "The horse is the only rideable &lt;a href=\"Travel%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; in . A character cannot fight from horseback and must dismount. Some types of creatures will often choose to attack a horse instead of the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; if the horse is nearby. If care is not taken, horses may be lost this way on a regular basis. It is also possible to climb almost any slope while on a horse, by zigzagging the horse left and right while jumping it.\nHorses are very poor at swimming. Horses cannot jump while standing still, however they are able to jump while galloping. The last horse the Hero got on will fast travel with them, including the &lt;a href=\"Unicorn%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;. Horses tend to fight back if attacked first, except &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt; who attacks immediately. With a high enough &lt;a href=\"Speed%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athletics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Athletics&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible to outrun any horse.\nIt is believed that anyone with over 60 speed is faster than the black horse. There are also thoughts that Shadowmere is faster than even black horses, with a speed of around 70. Horses appear in , , , and , but were absent in .\nHorses are the main forms of exploring/traveling in \"Oblivion\". Horses can be purchased outside of any major town or they can be stolen. The type of horses in Oblivion are light Thoroughbred or Hanoverian types, unlike the heavier types seen in and . They cannot be ridden inside of cities. Unique horses include &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt; and the unicorn.\nSome characters can also use horses. For instance, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; soldiers can be seen patrolling, as well as &lt;a href=\"Courier%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;couriers&lt;/a&gt; riding black horses.\nObtaining a horse.\nHorses can be purchased at stables outside major &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt;, except for the Imperial City, which has a stable, but no horses can be purchased there. If the Hero brings the Amulet of Kings to Weynon Priory as part of the main quest one of the monks there (&lt;a href=\"Prior%20Maborel\"&gt;Prior Maborel&lt;/a&gt;) will offer to lend them his horse, free of charge. When the Knights of the Nine questline is completed and the priory is restored, a chestnut and a bay horse become available at the stables.\nOnly one horse can be owned from each stable, so the maximum that can be owned at any one time is seven plus Shadowmere. If a horse dies or is lost, it will appear next to the stable it was purchased from.\nBreeds of horses.\nThere are several breeds, each with differing abilities. Not counting the unicorn, there are five types of horses in Oblivion:\nHorse Armor.\nHorses are hardy and tough, but can be killed. In early April 2006, &lt;a href=\"Bethesda%20Softworks\"&gt;Bethesda Softworks&lt;/a&gt; released an official &lt;a href=\"Official%20Plug-ins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;plug-in&lt;/a&gt; that allows &lt;a href=\"Horse%20Armor\"&gt;horses to wear armor&lt;/a&gt;. There are two typed - Steel and Elven. It is $1.99 on the PC and $2.49 on the &lt;a href=\"Xbox%20360\"&gt;Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt;. The Horse Armor pack is incompatible with other horse armor modifications.\nWayshrine Blessings.\nHorses can be blessed at &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; by riding them on top of a wayshrine altar, dismounting, then activating the altar."}

{"id": "57851", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=57851", "title": "Horse (Skyrim)", "text": "Horses are mammals that ease the burden of &lt;a href=\"Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;travel&lt;/a&gt; in .\nBiology.\nAll horses are a type of draft horse which are native to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Though horses can be obtained in five colors. Horses can be rented from &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt; outside of each &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%23Hold%20Capital%20Cities\"&gt;major city&lt;/a&gt;. \"Rented\" means only that the horses live in the stable from which they were purchased. The horse belongs to the Dragonborn after its purchase. Special horses are available by completing &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;.\nEndurance.\nAll horses have the ability to rear and jump. Of the quest-obtained horses, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt; possesses higher health than a non-unique horse, &lt;a href=\"Arvak\"&gt;Arvak&lt;/a&gt; () possesses several unique traits as a summoned creature, and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20%28Horse%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; possesses higher stamina than a non-unique horse. &lt;a href=\"Patches%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Patch 1.6&lt;/a&gt; introduced mounted combat.\nPurchasing.\nWith the exception of the three unique horses Shadowmere, Arvak (), and Frost, horses are available for purchase at any of the stables listed below for 1000 regardless of one's &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;Speech&lt;/a&gt; skill. All non-unique horses differ in appearance only, and are otherwise identical in performance. Only one of the non-unique horses has a name mentioned, which is Queen Alfsigr or Allie for short, in Whiterun. However the horse is not named in the game.\nOnce purchased, a horse is considered owned and can be identified by the \"Player's horse\" label on the HUD. One can own multiple types of horses and multiple horses of the same type. The horse last ridden or &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fast traveled&lt;/a&gt; with is the one that accompanies the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;. Any other owned horses return to the stable where they were purchased.\nStables can be built for manors in the DLC. A horse can then be purchased from the chosen Steward.\nTypes of horses.\nShadowmere.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadowmere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Shadowmere&lt;/a&gt;, who makes a reappearance in the game during the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29%23Dark%20Brotherhood%20quests\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood questline&lt;/a&gt;, is a unique horse. Shadowmere has a breast collar and fancier saddle than the other horses, as well as a different bridle. It appears to be the same speed and build as the other horses, but is extremely tough and can hold its own against Skyrim's hardiest foes, though it is worth noting that Shadowmere can be killed in extreme cases of combat or during falls. Even with Shadowmere being able to die like any other horse in Skyrim, Shadowmere will respawn after 10 days in-game at the location of death or at the pool where he was first acquired.\nFrost.\nAnother unique horse is a palomino stallion called &lt;a href=\"Frost%20%28Horse%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, obtained during the Riften quest &lt;a href=\"Promises%20to%20Keep\"&gt;Promises to Keep&lt;/a&gt;, if the Dragonborn is able to pass the Speech check. Frost can gallop for the same length of time as Shadowmere, but lacks Shadowmere's strength, having the same stats as other palominos.\nArvak.\n&lt;a href=\"Arvak\"&gt;Arvak&lt;/a&gt; is added with . Arvak can be summoned with the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Arvak\"&gt;Summon Arvak&lt;/a&gt; spell unlocked after completing the quest &lt;a href=\"Find%20Arvak%27s%20Skull\"&gt;Find Arvak's Skull&lt;/a&gt;. Arvak is an undead horse, with purple flames as the tail and mane. If killed, Arvak will simply return to the Soul Cairn, and can be resummoned.\nBorrowing and stealing.\nStealing horses is considered theft and is a crime against the owner. Mounting a horse that is labeled \"Steal horse\" is a crime and generates a bounty. Common places to find horses to steal include military camps (both &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;), or forts, as well as being located within war encounters. Each time a stolen horse is mounted, 50 gold is added to the Dragonborn's bounty, making horse theft an expensive crime. However, it is possible to mount a stolen horse and not incur a bounty if not witnessed by anyone, including the horse, as in previous games. Even if ridden away right in front of the stable/camp guards, there will be no bounty.\nOccasionally, the opportunity to borrow a horse is given. A horse that is available to borrow is indicated in the HUD by the simultaneous lack of the \"Steal horse\" label and the \"Player's horse\" label. Arguably, the easiest horse to borrow is from the &lt;a href=\"Katla%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Katla's Farm&lt;/a&gt;. After selling a single piece of produce to &lt;a href=\"Katla\"&gt;Katla&lt;/a&gt;, you will be allowed to borrow either horse from the stables. However, this horse will walk away after dismounting, as stolen horses do.\nBandits dressed as a faction may be encountered. They say that this is none of the Dragonborn's business and will attack. Once they are dead one will find a horse that can be ridden. This does not count as stolen but it will leave when dismounted as stolen horses do.\nDuring the Civil war quests the Dragonborn has the opportunity to attack a broken down cart with weapons and gold. After the guards are dispatched, the horse that would have been attached to the cart can be ridden. It has no saddle so it will be ridden bareback, and once dismounted it will wander off. &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fast traveling&lt;/a&gt; puts the horse back at the Dragonborn's position and then it can be remounted.\nRiding and mounting.\nWhile riding, a horse can walk (by toggling run off), canter, run, and gallop (sprint), at the Dragonborn's unmounted walk, run and sprint speeds. While mounted, the Dragonborn will possess greater stamina and strength, which allows for greater load capacity and sprint time. This increased load capacity while mounted allows for fast traveling while overburdened. In addition to their increased strength and stamina, horses can also charge through and leap over obstacles with similar restrictions as the unmounted Dragonborn.\nAs with unmounted navigation, larger obstacles will pose similar problems. If the jump button is pressed while the horse is walking or standing still, the horse will rear and neigh. This has no effect except to slide the horse backward a little. Horses can also swim, although they are slightly slower than the Dragonborn. Horses can easily die from fall damage, so care should be exercised when riding in mountainous terrain.\nHorses cannot be ridden inside houses, tombs, or other marked locations that require going through a door. They can be ridden into Orc Strongholds. When approaching the gate, simply pressing the button will open the door, though no prompt will appear, and the gate will open for the horse. When fast traveling into a city, the horse will be found at the stable outside the city. For cities without stables, the Dragonborn will remain on the horse and will be able to ride it around the area.\nHorses are usually non-aggressive and will often flee when dismounted in combat situations. However, horses sometimes attack aggressors or even defend the Dragonborn which can lead to their death. Horses often pursue targets and are sometimes hard to find after doing so. It is not advised to let a horse go anywhere near a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; as even the weakest Dragon will be able to kill the strongest horse in one breath.\nFollowers cannot ride horseback and will quickly fall behind the mounted Dragonborn. To compensate for this discrepancy in traveling speed, the Dragonborn should \"wait\" for the follower(s) to catch up.\nMounted combat.\nAs of patch 1.6, mounted combat is available. When wielding a melee weapon the Dragonborn can swing on either side of the horse using either the primary or secondary attack buttons. Note that since the attack buttons are used to decide the direction the swing is unleashed, it is impossible to block or attack with a secondary weapon, although power attacks are still possible. Some two-handed weapons (e.g. Warhammer) can be wielded with one hand.\nThe Dragonborn may also use a ranged weapon when mounted, however, as the camera is locked to 3rd person perspective whilst riding, it may be difficult to hit a target accurately. It helps if the Dragonborn has the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; perks &lt;a href=\"Eagle%20Eye%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eagle Eye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Steady%20Hand\"&gt;Steady Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpells and shouts (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt;) cannot be initiated from horseback, but it is possible to dismount, cast the spell, then remount, and the effect will be sustained for its normal duration. Similarly, spells that normally can be toggled on or off (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Night%20Eye%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Night-Eye&lt;/a&gt;) cannot be used while mounted.\nPurchasing a new horse after it dies.\nSome horses in Skyrim will spawn at a Hold's stable after waiting some time at a different location. It will usually take 1\u20132 days for a horse to spawn and be available for purchase after the one of the horses at the stable dies. The time for a new horse to spawn for purchase depends on the actions at the stable, for example, if the player returns to the stable at which the old horse was bought, and steals an unsaddled horse before waiting a day and killing it, it will take at least one extra day waiting in-game for a new horse to spawn for purchase. The original horse will re-spawn in about 10 days waiting in-game, making 1 or more horses available for purchase at a Hold's stable. It is also possible, after the previous horse dies, for a new saddled horse to spawn at a stable. Allowing it to be purchased for 1,000 , and still making it so the old horse will re-spawn without having to repurchase it. This will make it so that 1 or more horses can be owned at a stable at once.\nHorses that re-spawn after they die.\nHorses that will be able for purchase after the previous one dies are at\nOther smaller holds.\nThese are all the smaller Holds, which do not have their own horse stables. A &lt;a href=\"Carriage\"&gt;carriage&lt;/a&gt; can be ridden to their capitals, but because one is not stationed there, the Dragonborn can not travel back out via a carriage.\nUnsaddled horses.\nBesides the saddled horses there are also unsaddled horses not for sale in most of the stables. As most things in Skyrim, they will also take 10 days to re-spawn. Here are the locations they re-spawn"}

They survive mainly by breeding and trading &lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Online%29\"&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt; in nearby &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; settlements. The tribe is lead by an elder.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nHorsemen lack written historical records of their own and are not documented or examined by modern &lt;a href=\"Tamrielic\"&gt;Tamrielic&lt;/a&gt; scholars. Some records might have existed in their ancestral homeland on &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;, but have undoubtedly been destroyed during the great Yokudan cataclysm. However, the Horsemen poses a very strong oral tradition, tales of their elders make the task of piecing together their history difficult, but possible.\nIt is not entirely wrong to consider the Horsemen a lost &lt;a href=\"Yokudan\"&gt;Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; colony. It is believed that they might have descended from the northern herding clans of the &lt;a href=\"Akos%20Kasaz\"&gt;Akos Kasaz&lt;/a&gt; steppes on the lost continent of Yokuda. Some nuances in their language are surprisingly similar to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Yokudan\"&gt;Old Yokudan&lt;/a&gt; spoken by the clans.\nThe tales of Horsemen tell a story of great journey over \"seventeen seas\" on their \"swimming horse-ships.\" While their tales could be open for interpretation, it is entirely possible that the clans took their horses with them. This is supported by the fact that the horses bred by the Horsemen are remarkably close to the &lt;a href=\"Yokudan%20Chargers\"&gt;Yokudan Chargers&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe clans are said to have begun their migration to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in order to preserve their worship of the &lt;a href=\"Herd%20Mother\"&gt;Herd Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Who endangered this unique belief remains unknown. But Horsemen came ashore sometime in early sixth century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, nearly two hundred years before the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt; came to Hammerfell. The timing of their arrival was very fortunate - &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Hegemony\"&gt;Direnni Hegemony&lt;/a&gt; was already dying and the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms were still to young to drive the colonists out. This allowed the Horsemen to find their niche in the Silverhoof Vale and safeguard their ways for at least the next three thousand years.\nSecond Era.\nLife among &lt;a href=\"Nedic\"&gt;Nedic&lt;/a&gt; cultures had left its influence on the tribe and it had become \"Bretonized.\" While the majority of the Horsemen still remained similar to the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, many different races could be found among their kind - Breton, &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region of Rivenspire had been left unstable after the fall the Breton &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt;. This escalated into a great power struggle between the local noble houses during the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Banners%20War\"&gt;Three Banners War&lt;/a&gt;. Trade became difficult and so the way of life Horsemen were used to became endangered.\n&lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Harpies&lt;/a&gt; infesting the cliffs above the Silverhoof Vale had begun to raid the herds. This was seen as a very bad omen among the tribe and caused much unrest. &lt;a href=\"Makar%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Makar the Elder&lt;/a&gt; seeking to prevent further chaos and preserve the tribe hired a group of mercenaries known to be experts on harpies - &lt;a href=\"The%20Daggers\"&gt;The Daggers&lt;/a&gt;, who with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; dealt with the situation.\nReligion.\nHorsemen seem to follow a unique religion to all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. They worship an animistic spirit known as the Herd Mother. She serves as both their guiding and protective deity and woven throughout their traditions and history.\nSimilar to the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; tradition of &lt;a href=\"Walkabout\"&gt;Walkabout&lt;/a&gt;, young members or the tribe must go though a vision journey as an rite of passage to adulthood.\nTo some outsiders this belief seems odd and is dismissed upon hearing of \"talking horses.\"\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Rusty%20Daggers\"&gt;Rusty Daggers&lt;/a&gt;.\nA crew I once helped in &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt; was hired to hunt harpies in Silverhoof Vale. They may need my help to complete the job."}

The Nerevarine is then given two keys, one for the door to his office, the other for the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20Vivec\"&gt;Palace of Vivec&lt;/a&gt; door. Then, Saryoni explains that the Ordinators are still not entirely under his control.\nVivec.\nUpon entering the doors at the top of the Palace, the Nerevarine must then speak to Vivec.

He was appointed as Jarl in &lt;a href=\"4E%2098\"&gt;4E 98&lt;/a&gt; after the death of the previous Jarl during the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;. He ruled for 31 years with an iron fist, taxing its citizens mercilessly. It was not until &lt;a href=\"4E%20129\"&gt;4E 129&lt;/a&gt; when the citizens rose up against him. They succeeded, in a short war which left much of Riften in ruins.\nBiography.\nHosgunn was appointed Jarl of Riften in 4E 98 during the Void Nights, following the assassination of his predecessor. Many of &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;'s citizens believed that Hosgunn was responsible for the assassination. He was nevertheless appointed Jarl despite public outcry about this.\nUnder Hosgunn, protests were broken up by the guard and a curfew was established in Riften. This curfew was ruthlessly enforced \u2014 anyone breaking the curfew was jailed without trial, and executed if they were repeat offenders.\nHe imposed crippling taxes on the city, causing commerce to slowly dry up. He hoarded almost all of the tax money and invested it into creating a wooden palace which was so extravagant, large, and excruciatingly embellished that it took 7 years to build.\nThis palace would become a symbol of the oppression that the people of Riften suffered, and was dubbed \"Hosgunn's Folly\" by the populace. Meanwhile, as Hosgunn's reign continued, refuse began to accumulate on the streets, and the people descended into disease, poverty and hunger.\nIn 4E 129, the people, languishing under this oppression, rose up in large enough numbers to overwhelm the city guard long enough for them to set Hosgunn's Folly on fire while the Jarl was still inside, thus killing him."}

Ruled by &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, known as Voryn Dagoth in ancient times, the crest of the house is an insect.\nMembers.\nGeneric members of the Great House were the following.\nBeliefs.\nLittle is known of the beliefs of House Dagoth. In terms of tradition, it is House custom for the &lt;a href=\"Dagoth\"&gt;Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;s to allow a challenger to strike the first blow during combat. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the House welcomed all \"true &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;\", and aimed to \"drive the n'wah\" from Morrowind. The &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; was created by Lord Dagoth Ur, and aimed to kill foreigners in Morrowind. The ones opposing Lord Dagoth would die from the disease, while those who would follow him, would instead find strength and healing. The Great House also opposed the usage of necromancy, as well as vampires.\nFurther aims of the House was removing all individuals of inferior and mongrel races from the province, driving the Empire out, and reclaim lands lost to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;. Followers of House Dagoth believed that the House was falsely denounced as the house of traitors, and the other Houses attempted to destroy the House for eternity.\nReligion.\nThe goal of the Sixth House during the Third Era was to establish a theocracy under worship of Akulakhan, the Second &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;. The god-priests of this new religion would be the ancient heirs of House Dagoth, with the House itself becoming the new dominant power in the province. With the rise of this new religion, House Dagoth also aimed to remove the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; from power. The worship of Akulakhan was meant to be extended to every nation of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Within the shrines of the Sixth House, &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Statue\"&gt;Ash Statue&lt;/a&gt;s could often be found, alongside various offerings, as well as bells of the Sixth House, including the &lt;a href=\"Sixth%20House%20Bell%20Hammer\"&gt;Sixth House Bell Hammer&lt;/a&gt; used to ring them.\nAkulakhan would serve a number of purposes, primarily it would serve as the champion of the armies of House Dagoth, first liberating &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, and then Morrowind, with possibly the rest of Tamriel following afterward. It would also serve as a sower and cultivator of the divine power obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;. Its final purpose was to serve as the banner and symbol of the cause of House Dagoth\u2014defying the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, liberating mortals from ancient superstitions, and to glorify the crusade against the gods.\nAfter having taken control, the plan for the Sixth House was to form the elite cadre of Dagoth Ur's movement. Cultists would expand depending on their enlightenment, becoming either holy warriors or priests. The duty of these warriors and priests would be to prepare themselves for service, while their joy and liberation would be learning more of the divine dreamworld.\nRecruitment.\nThe Sixth House recruited their followers during the Third Era through dreams. One of the major bases of operation for this ordeal were the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Kogoruhn\"&gt;Kogoruhn&lt;/a&gt;, with smaller bases being in port villages and the waterfront districts in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;. Other recruitment aimed to go through smuggling syndicates, but also willing recruitment from disaffected populations, such as the poor and people with anti-&lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; sympathies.\nThis form of recruitment would continue to expand, with new bases in regular towns and villages, as well as abandoned structures such as ruins or towers. Corrupted cultists would also be trained as raiders and irregular troops for the House, while political resistance was fought back as much as possible. Through assassinations and terror, the House also aimed to weaken, distract, and disrupt the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s stationed within Morrowind, as well as their &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; allies. In doing so, inspiring uprisings by the native poor against rich and powerful foreigners, all the while &lt;a href=\"Sleepers\"&gt;Sleepers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreamers\"&gt;Dreamers&lt;/a&gt; would work on Akulakhan.\nWith new cultists, the House gained new followers, with corprus beasts being created from weaker cultists, whereas the stronger ones became Ascended Sleepers.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nDuring the First Era, House Dagoth, specifically Dagoth Ur, provided &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; proof that lord &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; had discovered the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, and was tapping into its power. With this power, Kagrenac was creating a new God which was a powerful and fearsome weapon of its own. Nerevar would then travel to &lt;a href=\"Holamayan\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt;, asking &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; for guidance, he learned that what Dagoth Ur said was the truth. As a result, Nerevar opted for war.\nDuring their battle with the Dwemer, Dagoth Ur, Nerevar, and a number of soldiers fought against the Dwemer in &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, until the Dwemer disappeared. Dagoth Ur proposed destroying Kagrenac's Tools, hoping to prevent the tools from falling in the wrong hands. After changing words with the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;, it was decided to keep the Tools by Nerevar and the Tribunal. However, when Azura was being summoned, the Tribunal murdered Nerevar. When the Tribunal entered Red Mountain, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; had changed into Dunmer, and Dagoth Ur had noticed this change. Seeking to avenge the death of Nerevar, he fought back, but to no avail. Dagoth Ur was driven off and presumed dead, though it has also been said that Nerevar himself struck down Dagoth Ur.\nOther accounts state that House Dagoth was allied with the Dwemer, and were instead defeated for their treachery by the other Great Houses. The remaining members of the House were either slain or adopted into the other Great Houses.\nSecond Era.\nEver since &lt;a href=\"2E%20882\"&gt;2E 882&lt;/a&gt; Dagoth Ur and his kin have been awake, moving into the Heart Chamber of Red Mountain. Dagoth Ur uses a ritual to bind himself, as well as high brethren as heartwight, in a ritual of his own devising. Construction of Akulakhan also begins, with the heartwights and atronachs creating a chamber near the Heart of Lorkhan. When the Tribunal arrived that same year for their annual ritual to use the Heart's power, the Sixth House ambushed them, and drove them away.\nThe awakening of Dagoth Ur and his kin is said to have played a role in the signing of the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt;, as Tiber Septim was hesitant to fight the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; and having to deal with Dagoth Ur.\nThird Era.\nEver since 2E 882, several Tribunal campaigns assault the Red Mountain, seeking to force access into the Heart Chamber, however, the Sixth House successfully bested them back at every assault. \nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20400\"&gt;3E 400&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Uthol\"&gt;Dagoth Uthol&lt;/a&gt; successfully reoccupies Kogoruhn and fortifies it as an advance base for the Sixth House. The Blight storms becoming more frequent, and soul sickness spreads in the regions close to the Red Mountain. Ten years later the village of &lt;a href=\"Gnaar%20Mok\"&gt;Gnaar Mok&lt;/a&gt; and the waterfront districts of Vivec housed Sixth House bases, with operatives from the House also exploiting smugglers to spread their influence.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"3E%20415\"&gt;3E 415&lt;/a&gt;, every town in Vvardenfell had small cells of followers of the Sixth House, with the larger operations being centralized in remote dungeons, where creatures are bred and the followers are trained. A mere two years later, &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Odros\"&gt;Dagoth Odros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Vemyn\"&gt;Dagoth Vemyn&lt;/a&gt; manage to take the artifacts of &lt;a href=\"Sunder\"&gt;Sunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keening\"&gt;Keening&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, with both the Tribunes being rescued by Vivec. While the Temple and Buoyant Armigers are aware that Almalexia and Sotha Sil were forced to retreat, nobody was certain what damage had been done to them. The Temple recognizes something has happened, but does not take the problem seriously. In the years &lt;a href=\"3E%20426\"&gt;3E 426&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;427&lt;/a&gt;, Sixth House assassinations occurred against prominent Imperial citizens and members of House Hlaalu. The House itself becoming more aggressive, starting attacks by both cultists and victims from soul sickness.\nDuring the late-Third Era, followers of House Dagoth believed that Morrowind had grown weak, and the Dunmer were no more than slaves ruled by foreigners. They aimed to create a Morrowind for the \"free and proud Dunmer.\" Within Vivec, the &lt;a href=\"Dreamer%20Prophet\"&gt;Dreamer Prophet&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for the killings of a number of foreigners, as well as two &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s for the House. The people of Vvardenfell suffered from the sleepers, who would often engage with non-Dunmer in combat, wielding clubs. When arrested, they provided nothing of value, only mumbling about Dagoth Ur and the Sixth House.\nThe Tribunal Temple attempted to fight back against the Sixth House, but suffered numerous defeats, and lost artifacts. Ordinator &lt;a href=\"Feril%20Salmyn\"&gt;Feril Salmyn&lt;/a&gt; aimed to discover the location of Kogoruhn, but was killed there while wearing the &lt;a href=\"Hair%20Shirt%20of%20Saint%20Aralor\"&gt;Hair Shirt of Saint Aralor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Cleaver%20of%20St.%20Felms%20%28Weapon%29\"&gt;Cleaver of St. Felms&lt;/a&gt; would also be lost by a &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armiger\"&gt;Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt; at the Sixth House base of &lt;a href=\"Tureynulal\"&gt;Tureynulal&lt;/a&gt;. Another Buoyant Armiger would lose the &lt;a href=\"Crosier%20of%20St.%20Llothis\"&gt;Crosier of St. Llothis&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; itself. The Ordinators also failed in retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20St.%20Roris\"&gt;Robe of St. Roris&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Assemanu\"&gt;Assemanu&lt;/a&gt;, a Sixth House base. The Temple did launch one successful raid on a Sixth House base, namely at &lt;a href=\"Hassour\"&gt;Hassour&lt;/a&gt;. The Imperial Legion was also involved in fighting the Sixth House, though their only recorded event, the raid on the shrine at &lt;a href=\"Ilunibi\"&gt;Ilunibi&lt;/a&gt;, failed.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the journey to defeat Dagoth Ur, the Nerevarine was asked on several occasions to join Dagoth Ur and the Sixth House by the members of the House. They also attempted to make the Nerevarine question the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; Azura's &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tribunal had proposed a five-step plan to defeat Dagoth Ur. First, there would be a series of aggressive raids in order to scout within the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armiger\"&gt;Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s providing the Nerevarine with aid. After the scouting and raiding, there would be raids on the Heartwights of House Dagoth, while also recovering powerful enchanted items from their bodies. Having successfully done so, raids on &lt;a href=\"Vemynal\"&gt;Vemynal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Odrosal\"&gt;Odrosal&lt;/a&gt; would take place to take back Sunder and Keening. At last, a main assault would take place on Red Mountain itself.\nThe Nerevarine would work with the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the Great Houses of Hlaalu, &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; to complete the Nerevarine Prophecies. Troubles would arise in being named &lt;a href=\"Hortator\"&gt;Hortator&lt;/a&gt; of each of the three Houses. House Redoran originally refused to accept the Nerevarine as Hortator due to believing him to be an Imperial spy, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvyn%20Venim\"&gt;Bolvyn Venim&lt;/a&gt;'s dislike of outlanders. House Telvanni was largely indifferent, but Archmagister &lt;a href=\"Gothren\"&gt;Gothren&lt;/a&gt; refused to name the Nerevarine Hortator, as he believed the Nerevarine was not the true incarnate. Within House Hlaalu, &lt;a href=\"Orvas%20Dren\"&gt;Orvas Dren&lt;/a&gt; was a follower of the Sixth House, and held the authority over two other Hlaalu Councillors, blocking the Nerevarine from easily being named Hortator. After having completed all the steps, and obtaining Sunder, Keening, and &lt;a href=\"Wraithguard\"&gt;Wraithguard&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine had to face Dagoth Ur within Red Mountain itself. Here the two would originally fight, until Dagoth Ur was defeated. However, Dagoth Ur regained his lifeforce due to the power of the Heart of Lorkhan, posing a threat to the Nerevarine in the Heart Chamber. Eventually the Nerevarine would destroy the Heart of Lorkhan, and destroy Dagoth Ur and the Sixth House."}

For additional profit, Alain decided to also capture the harpies.\nLarge amounts of special elixir was bought and fed to the harpies. It was done by hiring a local fisherman - &lt;a href=\"Halvire%20Mitrin\"&gt;Halvire Mitrin&lt;/a&gt; - to poison the fish he caught and leave them out for the harpies taking. Over time this made the harpies increasingly aggressive.\nLord Alain then hired a newly founded group of mercenaries by the name of &lt;a href=\"The%20Daggers\"&gt;Daggers&lt;/a&gt; and set out to build a camp. The mercenaries were instructed to capture harpies alive and bring Alain their eggs. The Daggers were told that this was for the investigation, however many of the mercenaries had started having doubts and seeing ulterior motive.\nThe leader of the Daggers, &lt;a href=\"Gelvin%20Feldrin\"&gt;Gelvin Feldrin&lt;/a&gt; searched the &lt;a href=\"Miltrin%27s%20Fishing%20Cabin\"&gt;Miltrin's Fishing Cabin&lt;/a&gt; and with the help of &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; found the \"&lt;a href=\"Contract%20with%20House%20Diel\"&gt;Contract with House Diel&lt;/a&gt;\" exposing Alain's plan. When Alain was confronted he threatened to throw the mercenaries in the dungeons of Daggerfall and was sure that his status as a noble would certainly protect him. But to make sure nothing could go wrong, Alain decided to get rid of his accusers. This resulted in the death of Lord Alain himself.\nThe Daggers later exposed the unsuccessful plans of Lord Alain to the people of Daggerfall and gained some renown for themselves.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Dagger%27s%20Edge\"&gt;The Dagger's Edge&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord Diel of Daggerfall and his sons are investigating the recent harpy attacks along the coast.

It focuses itself on agriculture and, up until the late-Third Era, on slavery. Their position with agriculture provided them with both a steady source of income, as well as political influence. House Hlaalu notes that House Dres knows how to make money, but also points out how it does not know how not to make enemies. They are a member of the Grand Council of Morrowind, alongside House &lt;a href=\"Sadras\"&gt;Sadras&lt;/a&gt;, Telvanni, Redoran and Indoril. The warriors of House Dres are noted as being amoral, and expendable thugs. They are known to use &lt;a href=\"Parrapton\"&gt;Parrapton&lt;/a&gt;s as mounts, especially on plantations.\nReligion.\nHouse Dres always kept a traditional following of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and ancestor worship, even during the times of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. The patron Saint of House Dres is &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Llothis\"&gt;Saint Llothis&lt;/a&gt; the Pious. Even so, the Dres were still noted as being firm Temple supporters.\nTerritory.\nThe territory of Great House Dres consists of southeastern Morrowind, as well as pieces of central Morrowind. It borders the swamps and marshes of Black Marsh.\nSlavery.\nGreat House Dres was largely fueled by the slaves providing labor on their large &lt;a href=\"saltrice\"&gt;saltrice&lt;/a&gt; plantations. In contrast to the slaves in the rest of Morrowind, who were given special bracers, slaves in Dres territory were shackled. Within the city of Stormhold, slave sales were officiated through the usage of an auctioneer's gavel made from fist bones of an Argonian.\nHistory.\nFounding.\nWhen Great House Dres was formed is unknown. What is known, however, is that it was formed following a successful slave raid on &lt;a href=\"Thorn\"&gt;Thorn&lt;/a&gt;, which turned House Dres into the primary supplier of slaves for Morrowind.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot many records exist of House Dres during the First Era. However, they are noted to have fought during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, when they, alongside House Hlaalu, &lt;a href=\"Telvanni\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, Indoril, and &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; fought against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;. The orthodox Dunmeri forces were originally outmatched, suffering heavy defeats from the Dwemer and the Sixth House, backed by Orcs and Nord warriors. It was only when lord &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; was given full authority over the armies of the Houses that they were able to push back and achieve victory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2E 559, a House War broke out between House Hlaalu and House Dres due to the Hlaalu establishing a trading post in disputed territory. The Dres, heavily outnumbering the Hlaalu, engaged with their Hlaalu opponents, and were gaining the upper hand, until the Hlaalu opened a portal leading to Narsis, from which numerous Hlaalu soldier turned the tide. The Hlaalu were victorious, and the Dres were beaten.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt; of the Second Era, Great House Dres opposed &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s advances on Morrowind, and were willing to resists the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the death. The situation became complicated when House Redoran, one of the Houses opposing the Empire, was left to fight for itself due to House Indoril and Dres being in favor of a guerilla war. After Vivec himself appeared and announced a &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; would ensure relative independence for Morrowind, House Redoran joined House Hlaalu in supporting accommodation, with now House Telvanni also showing their support. House Indoril still refused, and House Dres stood by them. The Lord High Councilor of the Grand Council of Morrowind was an Indoril, and refused to accept the treaty, and so he was assassinated and replaced by a Hlaalu, resulting in the treaty being accepted.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20396\"&gt;3E 396&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt; broke out between Black Marsh and Morrowind. The war was provoked by the Argonians, who tortured a Dunmer for not giving up his faith. Upon his death, this Dunmer would be known as &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Roris\"&gt;Saint Roris&lt;/a&gt;, and his death was used as a rallying cry by the Dunmer during the war. The war started as a slave revolt in the land of House Dres, and ended with a victory for Morrowind with bits of Black Marsh being seceded to the province.\nThe Dres heavily opposed Imperial Law and culture during the late-Third Era, with particular attention on any attempts to outlaw the practice of slavery, even going so far as to ignore Imperial Law by continuing with illegal slave raiding in Black Marsh.\nOblivion Crisis.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis, Great House &lt;a href=\"Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; was in ruins. Through an alliance with Great House &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, the Dres and Hlaalu alike picked at the weakened Indoril. Notably, both House Hlaalu and House Dres renounced the slave trade at the same time, giving freedom to the beastfolk in their service, after King &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Helseth\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; had outlawed the practice. House Hlaalu and Dres alike were on the rise within the province, willing to embrace new customs, while also welcoming the old.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost cities within Morrowind were destroyed by the eruption of Red Mountain. The cities of House Dres were included in this event. The Dres capital of Tear was hit hard. Within hours after the eruption, the ground which the city was built upon began to sink, similar to the swamp-like terrain of Black Marsh, causing cracks to form in buildings, and even causing the southern city wall to collapse, sending numerous laborers and Dres guardsmen to their deaths. Even so, many farmers of the surrounding countryside came to the aid of those in need.\nAfter the Red Year, Morrowind was invaded from the south by the An-Xileel, powered by the Hist, devastating what remained of the Great Houses, killing and driving out many Dunmer, and even settling within southern Morrowind itself.\nIt is unknown how much the flying city of &lt;a href=\"Umbriel\"&gt;Umbriel&lt;/a&gt; affected House Dres, nor is it known how much power the House holds as of 4E 201. What is known that there are still a number of Argonian clans living within the southern borders of Morrowind."}

The patron Saint of House Hlaalu is Saint &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;. The symbol of House Hlaalu is a scale, which represents balance, trade, and compromise. The House is led by traders and merchant princes, and prefers to use &lt;a href=\"Imperials\"&gt;Imperials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; as mercenaries. &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt; considers the Hlaalu to be liars and untrustworthy.\nTerritory.\nThe capital of House Hlaalu is the city of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;. House Hlaalu territory focuses itself on central Morrowind. On Vvardenfell, the territory of House Hlaalu was primarily in the west.\nPhilosophy.\nHouse Hlaalu considers itself the most open and progressive of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;i Great Houses, having openly embraced &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20law\"&gt;Imperial law&lt;/a&gt; and custom, which for a long time, gave them power. House Hlaalu's strong economy enables them to hold influence over the Redoran and the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt;, due to them requiring coin for wars or donations. &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;, like the Hlaalu, knows how to make money, but does not know how to avoid making enemies. House Hlaalu cares about reputation like they care about opportunity, balancing the two in order to get the best outcome. House Hlaalu has experience with &lt;a href=\"Kwama%20Egg\"&gt;Kwama Egg&lt;/a&gt; mines, knowing its produce and how to make them profitable.\nDue to House Hlaalu not having large armies or many holdings, they focus on diplomacy and negotiating. Their skill at talking also resulted in many becoming blackmailers and backstabbers. House Hlaalu always wants to live in peace with their neighbors, believing that peace is the only way to get sustainable growth. While many members are corrupt to some extent, the Hlaalu are not overly concerned about this, as they generally do not harm the House, and sometimes still serve the common good.\nThe Hlaalu aim to strive for balance in their dealings. When one side gets a favor too large, the other side becomes unpredictable, and can cause strife. In order to get a fair deal, all parties involved must be rid of their greed, wants, and strife. The weapon of House Hlaalu comes in the form of trade, and when supply and demand compliment each other, the Hlaalu are strong. As such, the House is willing to trade with anyone who would desire honest trade with the Hlaalu. The Hlaalu are an aggressive mercantile culture, influenced by Imperial values such as progress, tolerant polytheism, and free enterprise. Through their support of the Empire and its principles, House Hlaalu saw itself favored by many Imperial factions, such as the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nArms and armor.\nFor the House Hlaalu guards and marines, the Hlaalu make use of various materials. Armor generally makes use of &lt;a href=\"guar%20hide\"&gt;guar hide&lt;/a&gt;s, steel, or bonemold. Bows are made from imported ash or yew wood, quivers being made of guar leather.\nArchitecture.\nHlaalu architecture is divided into three categories. The public buildings, private dwellings, and plantations. Public buildings are multi-storied, rectangular, and feature arched entranceways and decorated exteriors. Private dwellings are similar, though with less decorations. Plantations are similar to Temple compounds, having the plantation itself walled around, with a grand manor taking the spot of where normally a Temple would be.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike the other Great Houses, House Hlaalu was involved in the conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of Lord Indoril &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Houses united and achieved victory over their enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20559\"&gt;2E 559&lt;/a&gt;, House Hlaalu and House Dres waged a house war over a territorial dispute. House Hlaalu desired to expand its territory by creating a trading post near the border of Black Marsh. The Dres however, were determined to prevent this from coming true. During construction, Dres mercenaries engaged with the Hlaalu, and came close to coming out victorious, but Hlaalu reinforcements were called upon via a portal, resulting in victory.\n&lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Hlaalu openly supported the Ebonheart Pact during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, openly embracing their ancient enemies as friends. This decision was due to them using the opportunity to gain power in Deshaan. Both Narsis and Mournhold having been cities with great Hlaalu influence. On Vvardenfell, House Hlaalu was attempting to gain full control over &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, and aimed to undermine the House Redoran trade routes. Within the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;, House Hlaalu was in good relations with the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Gold Coast Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;. The Company used this in order to sell items that had been stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; after it had fallen.\n&lt;a href=\"Llodos%20Plague\"&gt;Llodos Plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance War, the Llodos Plague broke out in the &lt;a href=\"Deshaan\"&gt;Deshaan&lt;/a&gt; region of Morrowind. While at first the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Serkamora\"&gt;Serkamora&lt;/a&gt; was struck, the &lt;a href=\"Maulborn\"&gt;Maulborn&lt;/a&gt;, in command of the plague, chose to continue to Narsis. The Hlaalu capital of Narsis was struck by the plague, resulting in many of its residents fleeing to Mournhold. The nearby lake of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Lake Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; was also monitored and secured by the maulborn. In order to provide aid to the sick in Narsis, House Hlaalu organized a caravan with supplies in Mournhold, however, this caravan was ambushed by Dres mercenaries under the command of the Maulborn. The Maulborn were eventually defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Tiber Wars, House Hlaalu was the smallest and weakest of the Great Houses, barely holding their status in their ancient capital of &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, they were considered traditional enemies of the Great &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, who had controlled Morrowind's government for some 3000 years. House Hlaalu had limited trade with the Empire at the time. When Tiber Septim's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s invaded Morrowind, House Hlaalu was eager to propose accommodation. When eventually &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; and Redoran followed suit, the Lord High Chancellor of the Grand Council, an Indoril, refused to accept the treaty. As such, he was assassinated, and a Hlaalu took his place. The Hlaalu used this opportunity to deal with old conflicts they had with House Indoril, and a number of local councils changed hands in coups. Hlaalu influence further increased as many of House Indoril's nobility chose to commit suicide rather than submit to the Empire, as a result of which, House Hlaalu took most of their power.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"3E%20368\"&gt;3E 368&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt;, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; used the Hlaalu in Morrowind to support Imperial interests. Through House Hlaalu, Imperial culture spread into Morrowind, and the province started to develop its economy. Later on, Uriel would also use his power to draw power from the Great Houses to the court of King Hlaalu Helseth, in order to gain a stronger foothold in the province. He also took advantage of the weakening of the Tribunal Temple to promote the Imperial Cult, which later succeeded in becoming the dominant faith in the districts of House Hlaalu and Vvardenfell.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"3E%20383\"&gt;3E 383&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt;, many Dunmer migrated to &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil in order to escape persecution by the Tribunal Temple within Morrowind. One of these Dunmer was a Hlaalu named &lt;a href=\"Andel%20Indarys\"&gt;Andel Indarys&lt;/a&gt;, who migrated to Cheydinhal looking for opportunity. He succeeded, eventually becoming Count of the city.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%20414\"&gt;3E 414&lt;/a&gt; Vvardenfell was opened up for settlement by the King of Morrowind. House Hlaalu, alongside Imperial colonists, started expanding and developing parts of the land, taking hold over areas of Vvardenfell. They expanded the council city of &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt; and created the settlements of &lt;a href=\"Pelagiad\"&gt;Pelagiad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their cooperation with the Empire, House Hlaalu had a great political and economical standing in Morrowind, openly welcoming Imperial law, the Legions, Imperial bureaucracy and freedom of trade and religion. The Hlaalu still honored the ancestors, Temple, and ways of the Great Houses, but also adapted to the progress in the rest of the Empire. In contrast to the other Houses, House Hlaalu did not dislike non-Dunmer, and desired to live in prosperity with the other races, as well as contribute to the grownth of the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, however, was planning to use his power to weaken both the Legions as well as the Hlaalu. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20426\"&gt;3E 426&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt; the Sixth House started with assassinating prominent members of House Hlaalu and the Empire. Dagoth Ur was eventually defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, local unrest in Hlaalu Districts was decreased due to collaboration with the Legion, though a tax revolt did break out in Balmora. House Hlaalu did not openly support the Nerevarine, but did not oppose him either, due to their virtue of freedom of religion, so long as public order was not threatened.\nAt the time, the &lt;a href=\"Camonna%20Tong\"&gt;Camonna Tong&lt;/a&gt; held a great deal of power over House Hlaalu. It was said that Orvas Dren and his Camonna Tong would try to push out the Empire the moment it showed signs of weakness, such as due to a recalling of the Legions. The influence of the Camonna Tong, specifically, &lt;a href=\"Orvas%20Dren\"&gt;Orvas Dren&lt;/a&gt; became apparent when the Nerevarine desired to be named Hlaalu Hortator. Due to &lt;a href=\"Velanda%20Omani\"&gt;Velanda Omani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nevena%20Ules\"&gt;Nevena Ules&lt;/a&gt; being under the service of Orvas Dren, neither would name the Nerevarine Hortator until Orvas Dren did. Dren himself, having had xenophobic visions of Dagoth Ur, was hesitant to accept the Nerevarine as Hortator, and may have outright refused him. Orvas, despite being the brother of &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Vedam%20Dren\"&gt;Duke Vedam Dren&lt;/a&gt;, did consider having him killed due to interference in Camonna Tong business. In contrast, House Hlaalu itself sought to damage the power that the Camonna Tong held over its policies, attempting to make Orvas give up his leading role in the Tong. At the same time, attempts were made to blackmail Orvas through helping one of his slaves escape. In contast to the Camonna Tong, the Hlaalu themselves were generally proud citizens of the Empire, and friends of Imperial factions in the land. \nThe Camonna Tong was not the only faction that the Hlaalu had a conflict with. House Redoran and the Hlaalu were at odds, due to the valuable ebony mines of Caldera, which the Hlaalu used to their advantage. The Hlaalu themselves did not own the charter to Caldera, which was instead owned by the Imperial Caldera Mining Company. The Hlaalu actively tried to gain an advantage over the Redoran, sending out spies to learn their orders, but also trying to cut off their guar hides from being sold in Vivec City. The Hlaalu also considered shutting down the sole ebony mine held by the Redoran on Vvardenfell, due to the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; threatening to buy ebony from the Redoran due to the Hlaalu prices. House Hlaalu also attempted to convince the &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Camp\"&gt;Zainab&lt;/a&gt; Ashlanders to solely sell their ebony to the Hlaalu. The House also watched for people who smuggled ebony.\nThe Hlaalu also had problems with the Telvanni due to their illegal settlements outside of Telvanni territory.\nThe corruption by the councilors of House Hlaalu was prevalent among some of its members. &lt;a href=\"Yngling%20Half-Troll\"&gt;Yngling Half-Troll&lt;/a&gt; abused the faith of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; by using the funds meant for the restoration of the Hlaalu Temple for other affairs. Likewise, Hlaalu Councillor &lt;a href=\"Velanda%20Omani\"&gt;Velanda Omani&lt;/a&gt; attempted to gain land through a forged land deed. &lt;a href=\"Odral%20Helvi\"&gt;Odral Helvi&lt;/a&gt;, a House Hlaalu official working at Caldera, was also known for smuggling ebony from the Caldera ebony mines, though it is unknown if he was caught and trialed for this illegal act. Odral was not the only corrupt member of House Hlaalu in Caldera, however. &lt;a href=\"Cunius%20Pelelius\"&gt;Cunius Pelelius&lt;/a&gt;, a lawman of House Hlaalu, had gotten into some trouble in terms of coin. As a result of this, he started stealing ebony from the ebony mines in order to pay for his debts.\nMournhold.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt; returned to &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; with her son, &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Helseth\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt;, the previous Hlaalu King, known as &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt; suddenly died. With Helseth being crowned shortly afterwards, much discussion arose. One of his first acts was the outlawing of &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt; within Morrowind, which resulted in a bloody conflict, with the Hlaalu and Dres both releasing their slaves and forming an alliance against the Indoril. His behavior resulted in many proclaiming Helseth to be a mere Imperial figurehead, however, some of his other actions did return more traditional ways. The Grand Council was reformed under Helseth's rule, and now included all the heads of the Great Houses. Within Mournhold itself, some Hlaalu nobles disliked the notion of King Helseth being the ruler of Morrowind, and were attempting to overthrow him, though they ultimately failed in this attempt.\nUnder Helseth's rule, the power of the Great Houses was changing. House Dres and Hlaalu increased in their power due to embracing the changes. In contrast, Indoril and Redoran were on the decline, being unable to change with the times. Under the circumstances, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; stated that House Hlaalu represented the future of Morrowind, integrated into the culture of the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecline of House Hlaalu.\nThe aftermath of both the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; had a devastating effect on the position of House Hlaalu. During the Oblivion Crisis, Morrowind's Legion garrisons were unable to properly defend Morrowind, which had been predicted by Duke Vedam Dren years before. Even so, they were fully committed in the province to fight the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; threat. Because of their low forces however, Morrowind was unable to properly defend itself against the Daedra horde until House Redoran took up arms and directed Morrowind's resistance against the Daedra. Five years later &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted, which cut off what little remained of the Imperial garrisons at the border with &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. After the eruption, the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; invaded Morrowind, and House Redoran was called upon to stop them. The Argonians cut through southern Morrowind, and even continued to occupy some of the border regions as late as &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, but House Redoran managed to prevent them from cutting through the entire province.\nBecause of how poorly the Empire had been able to protect Morrowind, many Dunmer took out their anger on the Hlaalu, due to them having the closest ties with the Empire. House Redoran claimed that the Empire had recalled its Legions to defend Cyrodiil, which left Morrowind defenseless. Regardless of the truth of the matter, House Hlaalu was turned into the scapegoat of the suffering of the Dunmer. They were no longer recognized as a Great House, and were removed from the Grand Council. Their seat on the Grand Council was now filled by the new &lt;a href=\"House%20Sadras\"&gt;House Sadras&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the years, House Hlaalu grew resentful of House Redoran, whom they held responsible for their fall from power. As such, they attempted both an assassination of the Redoran Councilor &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; and a coup on the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2095\"&gt;4E 95&lt;/a&gt;, to show that the Redoran were not as powerful as they claimed to be. Both the assassination and the coup failed, however, being thwarted by the Redoran Guard stationed in the settlement. \nYears later, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, House Hlaalu would attempt another assassination on the councilor. Being led by &lt;a href=\"Vendil%20Ulen\"&gt;Vendil Ulen&lt;/a&gt;, a descendant of the Vilur Ulen, who attempted the original coup and assassination in 4E 95. Vendil took on a fake last name, becoming known as Vendil Severin instead, and lived with a fake family of other members of House Hlaalu, those being &lt;a href=\"Tilisu%20Severin\"&gt;Tilisu Severin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mirri%20Severin\"&gt;Mirri Severin&lt;/a&gt;. They arrived in Raven Rock in 4E 191, and were a great benefit to the settlement in the 10 years that they lived in the settlement, providing food, coin, supplies and even repairworks for the settlement. Through usage of Morrowind's legal assassins guild, known as the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;, they attempted to kill Councilor Morvayn. Their attempts were stopped by the Last Dragonborn, however, who met the assassins and the Ulen family at &lt;a href=\"Ashfallow%20Citadel\"&gt;Ashfallow Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, defeating them. Because of this, Morag Tong assassins kept being sent out in attempts to get rid of the Dragonborn afterwards."}

Behold the scale: it represents balance, trade, and compromise. These essential concepts influence everything the House seeks to accomplish and directs its activities.\nStrive for balance in all things. When the scale tips to one side or the other, someone or something gets short-changed. When someone gets short-changed, unpredictability and strife unbalance the world around us. This idea must be embraced by every member of the House. To achieve freedom from greed, from want, and from strife, all parties in any exchange must find balance.\nTrade is the House's weapon, its tool, and its way. The House thrives when value and profit between supply and demand. House Hlaalu seeks to maintain open trade with anyone who would engage in honest business. Not even a lowly &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; with gold or goods in hand would be turned away. This policy protects and empowers the House. The greatest defense remains a wall built of gold, and many foes have broken against the profitable walls of House Hlaalu.\nThe most honorable conclusion to any conflict is compromise. When two parties seeking balance come together in any exchange, compromise becomes the natural conclusion. Anything can be achieved if both the left hand and the right hand work together. Not everyone is reasonable, however. Sometimes others must be coaxed into compromise. For that, the &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20Guard\"&gt;House Hlaalu Guard&lt;/a&gt; stands ready."}

Each of the pieces of armor, as well as most weapons, hold some connection to the Tribunal.\nHouse Indoril holds a strong connection to the Temple of Morrowind. The Dunmer of House Indoril provide the vast majority of the forces for the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s. The influence of the Indoril can be seen in the armor worn by the Ordinators, and in its members proudly serving the Tribunal.\nBeliefs.\nHouse Indoril saw itself as a political powerhouse in Morrowind since its founding in the First Era, and gained support from the Dunmer by their many gifts and donations. The House is conservative and Orthodox in their ways, and always in support of traditional Dunmer customs and practices. Believing that change weakens the Dunmer, the Indoril believe that the culture of Morrowind must be preserved at all costs. House Indoril cherishes the religion of Morrowind, and greatly revere their ancestors, while also making up the majority of the priesthood of the Temple. The &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt; was built from the bones of many devout Dunmer, including those of House Redoran and Indoril, as well as the bones from the catacombs from &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;.

During the War of the First Council, House Indoril, as well as the other Great Houses, were rallied by Lord Indoril Nerevar, and eventually found victory in their war against the Dwemer. Ever since 1E 784, House Indoril has dominated the government in Morrowind, and would not lose this power until the Tiber Wars, where their traditional rivals of House Hlaalu took most of their power.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Alliance War of the Second Era, House Indoril controlled most of the southern shore of the Inner Sea, holding authority in both the Deshaan and Stonefalls region. House Indoril, as well as House Redoran and House Hlaalu, temporarily abolished slavery in their lands, accepting everyone within their territory as free people.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; invaded Morrowind with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s, House Indoril, alongside the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, were willing to resist the Imperial forces. Being on the frontier, House Redoran requested aid from the Indoril and Dres to fight back the Legions. Both Dres and Indoril refused, preferring to wage a guerilla war instead. When Lord Vivec appeared with a proposed &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt;, House Redoran joined &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; in attempting accomodation with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; followed suit. Being supported by a majority of the Grand Council, the treaty had to be accepted. House Indoril, however, strongly disagreed with the notion. The Lord High Councilor of the Grand Council, who was an Indoril, refused to sign it, and was assassinated shortly afterwards and replaced by a member of the Hlaalu. Rather than submit to the Empire, many Indoril officials committed suicide, greatly weakening the House. Further weakening the House were coups staged by House Hlaalu, resulting in the power and influence lost by the Indoril to go towards the Hlaalu.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of Morrowind and the Indoril, was also located within the Indoril District. The Indoril at the time were seen as conservative and orthodox supporters of the Tribunal. During the late-Third Era, the Indoril were openly hostile to Imperial Culture, religion, and openly opposed Imperial law.\nWithin Indoril territory slavery was considered common during the late-Third Era, however, the power of the Indoril and the Redoran was waning, being unable to change with the time. Indoril itself was considered to be in ruins. It is unknown if the Indoril released their slaves after &lt;a href=\"Hlaalu%20Helseth\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth&lt;/a&gt; outlawed the practice. What is known is that the response to the outlawing was bloody, and an unlikely alliance formed, with House Hlaalu and House Dres both releasing their slaves, and forming an alliance to pick apart the ruined Indoril.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Indoril suffered during the Fourth Era. Due to their close connection to the Tribunal, the collapse of the Tribunal Temple also saw a great weakening of House Indoril. While still existing, House Indoril was weakened politically, with its members now being the priests of the New Temple, resulting in the Temple and Indoril being considered the same entity. As such, the political power that the Indoril had is now under the hands of the Temple, of which the old-Indoril are overrepresented in its priesthood.\n&lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; is said to not have affected the Indoril capital of Mournhold itself, with relief efforts even being organized by a member of House Redoran within the city at the time, the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; did. When they invaded Morrowind, Mournhold was sacked, and southern Morrowind suffered from the invading &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this, the capital of Morrowind was moved to &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;. Because of this weakness &lt;a href=\"House%20Sathil\"&gt;House Sathil&lt;/a&gt;, a Dunmeri House on Solstheim, also declared independence from House Indoril in 4E 16, as the Great Houses couldn't stop the wrack of Morrowind.\nAround &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, House Indoril had redesigned Mournhold in some capacity, with the &lt;a href=\"Plaza%20Brindisi%20Dorom\"&gt;Plaza Brindisi Dorom&lt;/a&gt; having a new building meant for all the pilgrims and priests who have come to the city to pay their respects. Almalexia's Temple in Mournhold had also been altered, with most of her marks being removed by the Redoran.\nTrivia.\nHouse Indoril architecture mirrors ."}

{"id": "974065", "revid": "32911304", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=974065", "title": "House Redoran", "text": "House Redoran is one of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;Great Houses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and is led by an aristocracy of noble warriors. It considers itself the \"hereditary defenders of Morrowind\", and reveres both the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. House Redoran holds the western portion of Morrowind, and are famous for their skill as warriors. The Patron Saint of House Redoran is &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Nerevar\"&gt;Saint Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the \"Captain\".\nRanks.\nUpon achieving the rank of Councilman, members of House Redoran are rewarded with a &lt;a href=\"Redoran%20Master%20Helm\"&gt;Redoran Master Helm&lt;/a&gt;, which are worn for rituals and public appearance.\nFounding and beliefs.\nWhen House Redoran was founded is unknown. What is known that, since its founding, they have deeply cared for duty, gravity, and piety. The Redoran do not believe that a soft life is a life which is worth living. The House focuses itself on preserving the cultural traditions of the civilized Dunmer, and holding fast to the way of the warrior. Because of the latter, the military of House Redoran generally outperforms the militaries of the other Great Houses, with &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; itself acknowledging as such. Its warriors are stated to be humorless, but also greedy, making them potential targets for corruption. In terms of mercenaries, House Redoran relies mainly on &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; to aid their cause.\nThe driving goal of the Redoran is fulfilling their duty and maintaining their honor, anything less is seen as disrespect to not only the person themselves, but also House Redoran as a whole. Their duty is to personal honor, family, and clan. Ironically, while the Redoran themselves are not fond of Imperial organizations, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; respects House Redoran for its high moral principles.\nRules.\nBy the customs of House Redoran, killing is permitted in war, self-defense, defense of property, affairs of honor, and during House Wars. Any other form of killing is considered to be foul murder. Justified but unnecessary or cruel killings considered a scandal, and can result in the Redoran member being sanctioned or expelled from the Great House. Opponents who yield may not be slain by members of House Redoran.\nFactions.\n&lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Redoran accepts the Temple's will to allow the Morag Tong to exist and operate within Dunmer territory, but they still consider them murderers and criminals in the Redoran House Law. This is doubly the case due to the other Houses using the Tong against House Redoran to undermine their interests. House Redoran refuses to use the guild, and does not allow the Morag Tong their lawful right to kill their members.\n&lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Tribunal Temple was still in place in Morrowind, the Redoran held a close relationship with it. They supplied the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armiger\"&gt;Buoyant Armiger&lt;/a&gt;s with Dunmer to fill their ranks, serving the lord Vivec in doing so.\nArchitecture, arms, and armor.\nThe houses of House Redoran are built from local materials. The exteriors are largely undecorated and are inspired by shells of the native giant insects. Both the exterior and the interior feature organic curves. The settlements of House Redoran are typically centered on compounds of the Temple and their courtyards, with huts and tradehouses on a central plaza. The weapons and armor used by House Redoran are, much like their houses, constructed from local materials. Primarily chitin and leather are used in its construction.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt;, House Redoran, alongside the other Great Houses, fought against the combined forces of &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, alongside their &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; and Nord supporters. House Redoran originally suffered greatly during this war, as these forces occupied a large portion of their territory. A counterattack was planned and executed under the command of Lord &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, who successfully united the Great Houses to defeat their enemies. \n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAside from their participation in the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, during which they proclaimed themselves the main figures of the Pact military, House Redoran has not performed a lot during the Second Era, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Morrowind.\nDuring the invasion, House Redoran, alongside the &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt;, aimed to completely oppose the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; invasion. When the Legions approached the Redoran cities of &lt;a href=\"Kragenmoor\"&gt;Kragenmoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cormar%20View\"&gt;Cormar View&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silgrad%20Tower\"&gt;Silgrad Tower&lt;/a&gt;, the defenses of these locations were poor. Only local militia, supported by Redoran mercenaries, some &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s, were meant to hold back the invading Legionnaires. Indoril and Dres proposed that, rather than face the Legions in the field, they would wage a guerrilla war. Due to House Hlaalu supporting a peaceful integration into the Empire, House Redoran faced the reality of standing alone against the Legion forces. Shortly after this, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; had arranged a &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;treaty&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which would provide Morrowind with the means to keep most of their own customs while being a part of the Empire. Whereas the Indoril and Dres still opposed this, House Redoran was grateful for an excuse to avoid fighting the Legions in the field. Because of this, House Hlaalu and House Redoran both supported joining the Empire, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt; followed suit. Not long afterwards, the treaty was made official, and Morrowind became a part of the Empire. \n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the late-Third Era, Morrowind was ruled by a Council consisting of Five Great Houses, namely House Redoran, Hlaalu, Telvanni, Indoril, and Dres. House Redoran was one of the Great Houses with interests on Vvardenfell, and colonized the region when it was opened for settling in &lt;a href=\"3E%20414\"&gt;3E 414&lt;/a&gt;. On Vvardenfell, the Redoran's council seat was the city of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt;. The Councilors had settled in the remains of a giant Emperor Crab, which they called Skar. House Redoran followed the Temple's desires to prevent expansion of the other Houses in their territory. In doing so, the Redoran and the Temple alike put themselves in the danger of being exploited both militarily and economically by the interests of House Hlaalu and House Telvanni. At the same time, due to the aggressive stance of House Telvanni, Redoran Mercenaries were no longer employed to defend Telvanni territory.\nAn aggressive stance was made against House Telvanni due to their illegal settlements, with the Redoran sending out their forces in unsuccessful attempts to defeat the Telvanni. The House was also angry about House Hlaalu due to the &lt;a href=\"Caldera\"&gt;Caldera&lt;/a&gt; charter, due to Caldera being traditionally Redoran territory. At the same time, people were questioning the honor of House Redoran due to a Redoran member refusing to participate in a duel. The Great House did attempt to restore this reputation, by convincing the refused party to still attend the duel.\nOther deeds that the Great House performed during this time was fighting against worshippers of the House of Troubles, smugglers, bandits, and mudcrabs. The Great House also actively fought against &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; attempts to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Sarethi\"&gt;Athyn Sarethi&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, House Hlaalu was attempting to weaken the Redoran economically by taking their share of the guar hide trade in Vivec, and by attempting to get the East Empire Company to only buy Hlaalu &lt;a href=\"Raw%20Ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt;. The Hlaalu also attempted to get rid of House Redoran's sole Ebony mine on Vvardenfell.\nHouse Redoran was not enthusiastic in regards to being part of the Empire at the time. This dislike of the Empire became clear when the Nerevarine attempted to be named Hortator by House Redoran. Its members openly called them out as a liar and deceiver and an agent of the Emperor, and if the Nerevarine attempted to join the House, they were refused for the same reason. The archmaster of the Great House, &lt;a href=\"Bolvyn%20Venim\"&gt;Bolvyn Venim&lt;/a&gt; also refused to accept the Nerevarine as hortator due to his xenophobia.\nDuring the closing days of the Third Era, the power of the Great House was waning alongside that of House Indoril due to their refusal to change with the times. In contrast, House Dres and Hlaalu were on the rise. It is unknown if House Redoran released its slaves when slavery was outlawed. However, slavery of itself was largely uncommon in House Redoran territory.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Oblivion Crisis, House Redoran was hit hard. Their lands on mainland Morrowind were invaded by the Nords of Skyrim, and, during the Daedric invasion itself, House Redoran lost the city of &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn\"&gt;Ald'ruhn&lt;/a&gt; to the Daedric invaders. Not just House Redoran, but all of Morrowind suffered during the crisis. The local defense was poor, and House Redoran took it upon itself to form up and defend the Dunmer people. House Redoran claimed that during the Oblivion Crisis the Empire had recalled its forces from Morrowind, a claim which holds little evidence. The Legion garrisons in Morrowind were already too small before the crisis had started, and during the crisis itself, the Legion was too focused on the provinces of the Empire, being fully committed in the provinces, neglecting Cyrodiil and leaving it to fend for itself. The only exception being Legionnaires from Fort Swampmoth in Black Marsh, who were recalled to &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%201\"&gt;4E 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Brara%20Morvayn\"&gt;Mistress Brara Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, alongside with a group of House Redoran members, settled on Solstheim after making some arrangements with the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Red%20Year\"&gt;The Red Year&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2005\"&gt;4E 05&lt;/a&gt;, the Red Mountain erupted, which heavily damaged the settlement of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. With most of the Legion garrison at &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Frostmoth\"&gt;Fort Frostmoth&lt;/a&gt; killed by the eruption, House Redoran was permitted to bring over the Redoran Guard for guard duties in the settlement. In mainland Morrowind, specifically, in Mournhold, a Redoran Councilor started relief efforts nearly instantly after the eruption. He sent soldiers, supplies, and people for the rebuilding of settlements which were hit the hardest, such as Balmora, which was rebuilt within a couple of months.\nOn the mainland of Morrowind, the &lt;a href=\"An-Xileel\"&gt;An-Xileel&lt;/a&gt; invaded the province. The Legion garrisons on the border were cut off by the eruption, and so it fell to the Redoran army, having formed up a force over the years, to stand up against the Argonian threat. They successfully prevented the An-Xileel from completely invading Morrowind, and may have saved the Dunmer people from being exterminated. The insufficient Legion forces in Morrowind during both the Oblivion Crisis and the Red Year greatly damaged the standing of House Hlaalu, who had traditionally been supportive of the Empire. With House Redoran having defended the province during both the Oblivion Crisis and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, public favor shifted to the Redoran. House Hlaalu was no longer recognized as a Great House. Since then, House Redoran is the mightiest of the Great Houses, and leads the Grand Council. House Sadras took House Hlaalu's place on the Grand Council. With Mournhold having been sacked by the An-Xileel, the capital of Morrowind was also moved to the city of Blacklight.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Sathil\"&gt;House Sathil&lt;/a&gt;, a Dunmeri House of Solstheim, declared independence from House Indoril in 4E 16 due to the poor performace of the Great Houses within the province, as they couldn't stop the wrack of Morrowind. In the same year, Skyrim offered the island of Solstheim to Morrowind, and House Redoran gained authority over the town of Raven Rock. This provided the Great House with a boost to their economy, as the ebony mines of Raven Rock produced large quantities of ebony for decades to come. The situation between the Hlaalu and Redoran escalated in &lt;a href=\"4E%2095\"&gt;4E 95&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vilur%20Ulen\"&gt;Vilur Ulen&lt;/a&gt; of House Hlaalu had attempted to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt;, due to the Hlaalu believing the Redoran were primarily responsible for them losing their position on the Grand Council. The attempt was meant to signify that House Redoran was not as strong as it boasted to be, but rather, that it was vulnerable and weak. Upon further investigation, the Redoran Guard discovered that Vilur had been organizing a coup for Raven Rock. Upon having discovered this, all members involved were executed.\nFrom 4E 130 to 4E 181, Raven Rock saw increasing problems. The Bulwark, a large wall protecting the city, had to be repaired due to it threatening to crumble. In 4E 150, an Argonian force landed on the island, aiming to do damage to it, and in 4E 170 the ebony mines dried up, with the mine being shut down completely in 4E 181.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt; the town of Raven Rock was under attack by creatures known as &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt;, who were commanded by the undead &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt;. House Redoran enlisted the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to help them in dealing with the ash spawn. Not long afterwards, House Hlaalu attempted yet again to assassinate Councilor Morvayn of House Redoran. This time making use of the Morag Tong. Through an investigation and the aid of the same foreigner, this plan was thwarted, however. House Redoran is considered the most powerful Great House of Morrowind at the time."}

Their capital is the city of &lt;a href=\"Port%20Telvannis\"&gt;Port Telvannis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Northeast%20Archipelago\"&gt;northeast archipelago&lt;/a&gt; of the province. During the late Third Era, Vivec described the Telvanni as being similar to &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; in that they are \"iconoclastic, profane, [and] unconventional.\" The Telvanni are the only known people with the power to raise life from ash, and are considered masters of &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind. The patron &lt;a href=\"saint\"&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt; of House Telvanni is &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Vorys\"&gt;Saint Vorys&lt;/a&gt;. They are ruled by the Parliament of Bugs, a group of High Telvanni wizards.\nArms and armor.\nA lot of the Telvanni arms and armor have some form of influence based on the &lt;a href=\"fungi\"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; used by the Telvanni. In the absence of metal, Telvanni axes are even crafted from forge-hardened ferrofungus, and while generally not using bows in the House, the House thralls of the Telvanni are used as archers.\nBeliefs.\nThe Telvanni are known as being the most xenophobic of the Dunmer, shunning contact with outsiders, and instead focusing themselves on their herds of giant insects in the rocky hills and islands of the northeast of Morrowind. The Telvanni produce &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Bug%20Musk\"&gt;Telvanni Bug Musk&lt;/a&gt;, a highly prized perfume among the Dunmer, and the riding insects bred by the Telvanni claim the highest prices on the markets of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Narsis\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt;. They strongly defend their right to own slaves, keeping many &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;s as possession. Despite this, the Telvanni will accept anyone, regardless of race or birthplace, to join their ranks, having to meet representatives known as \"Mouths\" of the Councilors of House Telvanni. Some fear that the Telvanni only accept people with high intelligence and willpower, but even this is exaggerated, as even modest folk are accepted.\nAdvancement in the House does depend on an increased intelligence and willpower, as well as proficiency in the magical arts. Even so, promotion remains difficult for outsiders, due to House Telvanni openly accepting murder and assassination as legitimate means of advancement. The Telvanni Wizard-Lords depend on loyal, well-paid, skilled retainers for services. Though recruitment of the Telvanni does occur within the House itself, the House often needs to venture beyond their own to hire the required craftsmen and specialists.\nHouse Telvanni does not place constraint on the ambitions and enterprise of its members, according to ancient laws and customs of the Telvanni. As such, the Telvanni were permitted by their own House to settle on regions where they held no authority. The Telvanni Council did openly acknowledge that these individuals were at the mercy of other factions in the region, but that the Telvanni themselves would not get involved.\nRules.\nThe rules of the Telvanni follow a pattern of might makes right. Any Telvanni who successfully steals from another is permitted by House law to keep the item. Likewise, murdering an opponent by magic or treachery is also permitted, as it's the traditional way of settling disputes in the House. Members of House Telvanni can still be expelled, however most members of the House will either not know, or care, about the expulsion.\nFactions.\nThe following are the beliefs of House Hlaalu, Redoran, and the Imperial Cult on the Great House Telvanni.\nThe practices of House Telvanni were considered to be impious and inhumane by the members of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt;, House Redoran considerings House Telvanni to be a house of scheming, and while House Hlaalu recognizes the Telvanni for their extensive knowledge of the arcane arts, they also point out how the House fights among itself more than others.\nMushroom towers.\nCertain members of the Telvanni live in elaborate mushroom towers, the reasoning as to why they live this way is kept from outsiders. What is known is that the Telvanni grow the towers themselves through secret means, and that the Master Wizards of the House traditionally live in them.\nTelvanni members of the rank of Spellwright seeking further advancement in the House are required to construct a mushroom tower in order to advance to the rank of Wizard. The foundations of the mushroom towers are formed from the souls of two powerful Daedra, most commonly &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach\"&gt;Storm Atronach&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Winged%20Twilight\"&gt;Winged Twilight&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Saint\"&gt;Golden Saint&lt;/a&gt;s. These souls are stored in &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Grand Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and placed at the base of the mushroom tower. The strong souls from these Daedra form the foundation of the tower, and help it to grow. Telvanni towers commonly had some form of levitation magic required to gain full access to the tower.\nRanks.\nWithin House Telvanni, advancing beyond the rank of Lawman requires a patron who a person can be the Mouth of. The Mouths of House Telvanni represent their patrons on the Telvanni Council and do chores for their master. Traditionally, the new Mouth is awarded a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Staff%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Silver Staff of Peace&lt;/a&gt; by their patron. Another traditonal reward by a patron for good service is the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Staff%20of%20War\"&gt;Silver Staff of War&lt;/a&gt;. Favored magical skills of the Telvanni are &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Destruction\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mysticism\"&gt;Mysticism&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile those of the rank of Wizard and above have the right to participate on the Council, members are not obligated to actually participate in the Telvanni politics. Those who join the Council can also leave again at a later date if they so choose.\nThe highest achievable ranks of Master, Magister, and Archmagister are related to one another. The Archmagister is the head of House Telvanni, and those wishing to replace them are advanced to the rank of Magister. In contrast, Wizards seeking advancement without a desire to lead the House, can instead be promoted to Master. Those who accept the advancement to Magister publicy announce their belief that they have the right to rule the House, and must defeat the ruling Archmagister to take their spot, while also needing the support of the other Councilors of the House.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the First Era, House Telvanni, like the other Great Houses, was involved in a conflict against the &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;Sixth House&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; in Morrowind. The Dwemer and the Sixth House, alongside their Orc and Nord allies, were initially greatly successful, taking up most of the Redoran, Telvanni, and Vvardenfell territories. The Great Houses suffered numerous defeats, until &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Lord Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; was appointed Hortator, and united the Houses to fight back, eventually finding victory.\nOne Telvanni retainer is the author of the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Real%20Nerevar\"&gt;The Real Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;\", detailing the creation of Resdayn, and a short history of the land up until the death of Nerevar. The book claims that the &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt; could only be worn by Nerevar himself, and that anyone else who tried to wear it would find death.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Second Akaviri Invasions, the Great House Telvanni had their peninsula ignored by the Akaviri hordes, who landed in Skyrim instead. Because their lands weren't threatened by the invasion, the Telvanni didn't care about the forming of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; either, and chose not to join it, being friends of neither the Argonians or the Nords. When the Pact formed, the Telvanni were said to have released every other House trooper they had in their employ.\n&lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Wars\"&gt;Tiber Wars&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Tiber Septim's &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s invaded Morrowind, House Telvanni was neutral in how to respond to the threat. House Hlaalu proposed accommodation, whereas the Indoril, Dres, and Redoran proposed opposition. When House Redoran had to face the brunt of the Legion forces on its own, it was eager for an excuse to leave the opposition. When Vivec announced a proposed treaty, House Redoran changed sides, now supporting accommodation instead. House Telvanni, seeing the situation, decided to follow suit. Eventually, Morrowind joined the Empire as one of the last provinces, having officially joined it through treaty.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Vvardenfell Crisis, House Telvanni harbored two major slavery posts on Vvardenfell, one at &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Aruhn\"&gt;Tel Aruhn&lt;/a&gt; and one at &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;. The Telvanni themselves refused to join in discussions on the outlawing of slavery, insisting that the right to own slaves was gauranteed through the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Armistice&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Telvanni was also attempting rapid illegal expansion of their land, starting with &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;. In response, both the Hlaalu and the Redoran sent out forces in attempts to fight back against the illegal settlements, though the Redoran were generally unsuccessful. House Telvanni publicly denied supporting these settlements, though in reality, they supported their endeavors. During these times, House Telvanni relied on &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; for mercenary work. Within Telvanni politics, certain members such as Master &lt;a href=\"Aryon\"&gt;Aryon&lt;/a&gt; attempted to limit the power held by the old Telvanni members such as Gothren and Neloth. With the aid of the Councilors of &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, the Telvanni also managed to invalidate the Mages Guild monopoly on the teachings of magic in Morrowind.\nIn regards to the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; himself, the Telvanni Councillors were all not too concerned regarding the position, and most accepted without an issue. The only problem was with Archmagister &lt;a href=\"Gothren\"&gt;Gothren&lt;/a&gt;, who refused to name the Nerevarine Hortator, and had to be killed instead.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile little is known of how the Telvanni themselves fared during the Crisis, it is known that the Telvanni on Vvardenfell tried their best to close the Oblivion Gates, but to no avail.\nIt is also known that one of the Telvanni intended to take over the Empire. &lt;a href=\"Frathen%20Drothan\"&gt;Frathen Drothan&lt;/a&gt; had raised a private army, known as the &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Army\"&gt;Drothmeri Army&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to overthrow the Empire. In an attempt to hinder this attempt, someone had hired the &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong\"&gt;Morag Tong&lt;/a&gt; to take out the commander of the army, known as &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Telani%20Adrethi\"&gt;Commander Telani Adrethi&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe loyalty of the men serving under Frathen was not great, with some considering him a madman. Most of the army only supported the cause of Frathen due to his high payments, and were planning on deserting his force as soon as he would actually go to battle. Eventually, the Drothmeri army was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Champion of Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and Frathen Drothan's plans were stopped.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Fourth Era saw Morrowind, and the Telvanni, suffer under both the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Invasion\"&gt;Argonian Invasion&lt;/a&gt;. Primarily the latter, with Argonians having successfully raided Telvanni settlements, implied to have gone as far as &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Vos\"&gt;Tel Vos&lt;/a&gt;. Their losses to the An-Xileel invaders even led some of the House to believe that the entire Great House had fallen.\nSometime after these events, House Telvanni no longer had holdings on mainland Morrowind, only having possessions on Vvardenfell instead. While lacking in possessions, there were still several Wizard Lords within the House. In contrast to the other Wizard Lords, Master Neloth had &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt; on Solstheim as opposed to Vvardenfell.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Crisis\"&gt;Dragon Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Telvanni saw some developments during the Dragon Crisis of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, primarily on the isle of Solstheim under the command of Master &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt;. Within Skyrim, &lt;a href=\"Brelyna%20Maryon\"&gt;Brelyna Maryon&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first Telvanni to have left Morrowind in a long time, choosing to settle at the College of Winterhold to study conjuration magic. Ironically, Master Neloth proclaimed that &lt;a href=\"Savos%20Aren\"&gt;Savos Aren&lt;/a&gt;, the Arch-Mage at Winterhold wouldn't be fit to be his apprentice, though Neloth did admit that Savos knew decent ward spells.\nOn Solstheim itself, Neloth experimented on the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stone\"&gt;Heart Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, which he believed arrived on the island with the eruption of Red Mountain. Neloth sought to experiment with the Stones on living subjects, and because of it, required knowledge in regards to the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt;s. Other research from Neloth allowed him to learn that heart stones located near ash will allow the ash to animate. These ash spawn ended up attacking Tel Mithryn, and it would turn out that their reanimation was the work of &lt;a href=\"Ildari%20Sarothril\"&gt;Ildari Sarothril&lt;/a&gt;, a former apprentice of Master Neloth. Ildari felt betrayed by Neloth due to her suffering during the Heart Stone experiment, and became increasingly paranoid afterwards, eventually even resurrecting the long-dead &lt;a href=\"General%20Falx%20Carius\"&gt;General Falx Carius&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeloth would also come in contact with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; during their quest to defeat &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;. Neloth, in research on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;s, discovered the location of a Black Book hidden in a Dwemer ruin, which he was unable to obtain on his own. Through successful teamwork, the Dragonborn was able to read the Black Book, and learn its secrets. Following this, Neloth learned what the secrets the Black Book held, and returned to Tel Mithryn, believing he had learned a new way to locate Black Books."}

{"id": "181962", "revid": "3218612", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=181962", "title": "House Tharn", "text": "House Tharn was a distinguished noble family from &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;, well known throughout all of &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, where it has held a large amount of holdings since the early &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The family often claims that they are as old as the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nHistory.\nFirst Era.\nThe family apparently traces its lineage back to a man by the name of \"Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand\" who was mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Tamrilean%20Tractates\"&gt;Tamrilean Tractates&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%20200\"&gt;1E 200&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Tractates, Tharanus was a slave overseer for the &lt;a href=\"Ayleids\"&gt;Ayleids&lt;/a&gt; of the mining hold &lt;a href=\"Fanacas%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fanacas&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the fact that the Ayleids wrote their business records in red ink, Tharanus's name implies that he was literate. Some theorists, such as Lady Euphemia Glaber, believe that Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand was also the brutal \"Tharhan the Mutilant\" who was notorious for having a role in the &lt;a href=\"Gradual%20Massacre\"&gt;Gradual Massacre&lt;/a&gt; which occurred in &lt;a href=\"1E%20227\"&gt;1E 227&lt;/a&gt;. However, this theory was supposedly disproved by a document discovered by &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;'s vaults known as the \"Scroll of Precursor Saints.\"\nDespite Tharanus being a slave overseer, the Tharn family is believed to have supported the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%20242\"&gt;1E 242&lt;/a&gt;. One such family member, &lt;a href=\"Vilius%20Tharn\"&gt;Vilius Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, served as \"the Blade-Serrator and Master of the Abbatoir\" of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;. The next most notable member of the Tharn family was &lt;a href=\"Fervidius%20Tharn\"&gt;Fervidius Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent member of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. In the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201188\"&gt;1E 1188&lt;/a&gt; Fervidius rose to the rank of Arch-Prelate in the secret society known as the &lt;a href=\"Marukhati%20Selective\"&gt;Marukhati Selective&lt;/a&gt;, and is often believed to have been responsible for creating the &lt;a href=\"Middle%20Dawn\"&gt;Middle Dawn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Break\"&gt;Dragon Break&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%201200\"&gt;1E 1200&lt;/a&gt; that lasted 1008 years. Fervidius was also known to have written the book \"\"Sermons Denouncing the Seventeen Leniencies\".\"\nMembers of the Tharn family were later known to have fought on both sides of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; which occurred in &lt;a href=\"1E%202321\"&gt;1E 2321&lt;/a&gt;. When the War of Righteousness ended, the Tharn family was greatly strengthened, beginning its reign in Cheydinhal and gaining wide tracts of land in Nibenay. &lt;a href=\"Turpis%20Tharn\"&gt;Turpis Tharn&lt;/a&gt; was known to have married the niece of the hero-king &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; strengthening the Tharn bloodline. When the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence, the Tharns were known to have served the Emperor loyally, with Regulus Tharn reviving the tradition of having &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s, and Excoraeus Tharn becoming the \"Minister of Punition\" for Emperor &lt;a href=\"Kastav%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Kastav Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond Era.\nThe next most noteworthy generation of Tharns would be the family who lived during the middle-&lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; period, the patriarch being &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime Chancellor of the &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Council\"&gt;Elder Council&lt;/a&gt; who held his position for over a hundred and seventeen years, beginning his service in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20465\"&gt;2E 465&lt;/a&gt; at the age of forty-seven. Abnur begrudgingly served the \"longhouse clan\" of &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; during their occupation of the Empire for over thirty years. Abnur would eventually aid &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen Aquilarios&lt;/a&gt; in deposing the Reachmen Dynasty in a long and bloody war, and later betray Varen, letting &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; gain temporary control of the Empire in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn had at least sixteen daughters, though only one, Clivia, grew to prominence. Clivia was the Empress-Regent of the then-fractured Cyrodiilic Empire, and the widowed consort of both the Reachman Emperor Leovic and Varen Aquilarios. &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Euraxia&lt;/a&gt;, Abnur's younger half-sister, was a Queen of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; who gained her position after the Frostfall Coup of &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;, and the mother of &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird Era.\nPossibly the most known member of the Tharn family (and perhaps the last member) was the infamous &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar was responsible for causing the ten year &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; when he temporarily overthrew the Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; by locking him in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and impersonating him with &lt;a href=\"Illusion\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; magic. During the period in which Jagar ruled, many of the provinces went to war with each other creating bloody conflicts such as the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian War&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Bend%27r-Mahk\"&gt;War of Bend'r-Mahk&lt;/a&gt; between the armies of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; was hit especially hard, having to fight the &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Five Year War&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; against its old ally, the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar Tharn also played a part in the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Battlespire\"&gt;Battlespire&lt;/a&gt; and the releasing of the monster, &lt;a href=\"Umbra%27%20Keth\"&gt;Umbra' Keth&lt;/a&gt;. Jagar's reign of terror would not end until the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt; slew him."}

The family may, as they claim, be as old as the First Era itself: as house historians like to point out, there is a \"Tharanus Ye Redde-Hand\" mentioned in the &lt;a href=\"Tamrilean%20Tractates\"&gt;Tamrilean Tractates&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%20200\"&gt;1E 200&lt;/a&gt;. In those days before &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, this proto-Tharn was apparently a slave overseer employed by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; Elves of &lt;a href=\"Fanacas%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fanacas&lt;/a&gt;, a mining hold in the hills north of modern-day &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. Based upon the fact that the Ayleids were known to have kept business records in red ink, the Tharn historians posit that this \"Redde-Hand\" was probably literate and employed in some clerical capacity. To be thorough, I will mention Lady Euphemia Glaber's theory that identified this Tharanus with the notorious \"Tharhan the Mutilant\" of the &lt;a href=\"Gradual%20Massacre\"&gt;Gradual Massacre&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20227\"&gt;1E 227&lt;/a&gt;, but this was completely disproved by the text of the \"Scroll of Precursor Saints\" discovered the in the vaults below &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; by Chancellor &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse tradition holds that the Tharn family was active in St. Alessia's slave uprising, with one Vilius Tharn serving &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; as \"Blade-Serrator and Master of the Abbatoir.\" But the next Tharn who can definitely be identified in the historical record is &lt;a href=\"Fervidius%20Tharn\"&gt;Fervidius Tharn&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;, who was Arch-Prelate of the &lt;a href=\"Maruhkati%20Selective\"&gt;Maruhkati Selective&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1E%201188\"&gt;1E 1188&lt;/a&gt; until his death (exact date indeterminate). Fervidius is best-remembered today as the author of the \"Sermons Denouncing the Seventeen Leniencies.\"\nNoble Tharn captains led mercenary companies that fought on both sides in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; in the 2300s, and when the dust settled General Turpis \"Volte-Face\" Tharn was in possession of the broad holdings that the family today calls home. Taking the title Earl of Outer Cheydinhal, Turpis married a niece of Admiral &lt;a href=\"Bendu%20Olo\"&gt;Bendu Olo&lt;/a&gt; and set about fathering numerous descendants.\nSeveral generations of Tharns served nobly and well during the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Reman Empire&lt;/a&gt;, including Regulus Tharn, who revived the tradition of &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;s, and Excoraeus Tharn, Emperor &lt;a href=\"Kastav\"&gt;Kastav&lt;/a&gt;'s Minister of Punition.\nWhich brings us to the members of the Tharn family of our own, current day. First and foremost, of course, is the head of the house and longtime Chancellor of the Elder Council, Abnur Tharn. Through times of trouble and the change of emperors, the Chancellor has always been there to provide the continuity and consistency our Imperial civilization needs.\nSecond only out of respect for her elder is Her Majesty &lt;a href=\"Clivia%20Tharn\"&gt;Clivia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, Empress-Regent of Cyrodiil, and daughter of Abnur Tharn by his seventh wife, Pulasia. Empress Clivia, it need hardly be said, is the widow of two emperors, having been the consort of both Leovic and &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios\"&gt;Varen&lt;/a&gt;.\nScarcely less powerful is the Chancellor's younger half-sister, Euraxia Tharn, who has been Queen of &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href=\"Frostfall%20Coup\"&gt;Frostfall Coup&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20576\"&gt;2E 576&lt;/a&gt;. And what would social events in the Imperial City be like without the presence of her son, the droll and charming &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt;?\nTruly, House Tharn has come to epitomize the modern Nibenese nobility. We can only hope that they will continue to be with us through the future, whatever it may bring."}

False light obscures the conviction we once shared. I pray this missive finds you cocooned in the shell of will and spirit, despite the news it carries.\nOur fate, once an intricately woven tapestry of divine and mortal existence, is being unraveled by a new force as inexorable as the march of the Make Way gods. The Concurrent Three, &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt;, a mere cult once but a flicker in our collective consciousness, has ignited in a blaze of glory and zeal. They are a consuming fire upon our world. And, my sisters, I fear they are inevitable.\nThese zealots hail not one, not two, but three newly ascended entities, a triumvirate cloaked in robes of divinity. Their rise is fueled not by the fateful dance of faith and love, but by the mechanistic gears of manipulation and force. They hope we shall remain blind to it.\nTheir will exerts itself like a black void, an inescapable pull towards a future where our goddesses are mere Anticipations. Their adherents are systematically snuffing out the shapes of our kin, obliterating our ephemeral signatures from the grand tapestry of existence. This insidious drama is played out behind the sheen of politicking and deceit, their actions obscured from the eye of &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boet-hi-Ah&lt;/a&gt;. They are false, and yet they prove difficult to deny.\nThese so-called Anticipations, our spiritual anchors unfailing, have guided our voyages for as long as memory exists. The thought of a Resdayn devoid of their foundational virtues is inconceivable. A thing unable to pass, for the sake of what is and will be.\nI beseech you, Resdaynia: The fate-bound hymns of the Three Sisters must not be forgotten. We must rally our kin and stand against this faith-invasive force. We must preserve the ancestral harmonies for the sake of our children yet to be born.\nI implore you to cloak yourself in cherished nostalgia. Share these revelations only with those whose loyalty is certain. This dance must remain a secret kept under a shroud of silence, since those who dare to raise their voices are swiftly consumed by the black hole of As Yet Oblivion.\nIn these interminable times, we must channel the cunning of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, the ferocity of Boethiah, and the wisdom of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;. Let their blessed teachings be our guiding star, our protective shell, and our eternal sustenance.\nMay the Sisters guide your journey and cast their darkened light upon your path during these falsified cycles. Stay strong, my kin, until the threads converge upon us once more. There we will meet again as ourselves, no longer in need of false skins and shadows.\""}

They can be found and read in , and . The books increase various skills, depending on the volume read.\nContents.\nA Dance in Fire, Book I.\nScene: The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;Date: 7 &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frost Fall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;\nIt seemed as if the palace had always housed the &lt;a href=\"Atrius%20Building%20Commission\"&gt;Atrius Building Commission&lt;/a&gt;, the company of clerks and estate agents who authored and notarized nearly every construction of any note in the Empire. It had stood for two hundred and fifty years, since the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Emperor Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, a plain-fronted and austere hall on a minor but respectable plaza in the Imperial City. Energetic and ambitious middle-class lads and ladies worked there, as well as complacent middle-aged ones like &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt;. No one could imagine a world without the Commission, least of all Scotti. To be accurate, he could not imagine a world without himself in the Commission.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Atrius\"&gt;Lord Atrius&lt;/a&gt; is perfectly aware of your contributions,\" said the managing clerk, closing the shutter that demarcated Scotti's office behind him. \"But you know that things have been difficult.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Scotti, stiffly.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vanech\"&gt;Lord Vanech's&lt;/a&gt; men have been giving us a lot of competition lately, and we must be more efficient if we are to survive. Unfortunately, that means releasing some of our historically best but presently underachieving senior clerks.\"\n\"I understand. Can't be helped.\"\n\"I'm glad that you understand,\" smiled the managing clerk, smiling thinly and withdrawing. \"Please have your room cleared immediately.\"\nScotti began the task of organizing all his work to pass on to his successor. It would probably be young Imbrallius who would take most of it on, which was as it should be, he considered philosophically. The lad knew how to find business. Scotti wondered idly what the fellow would do with the contracts for the new statue of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;St Alessia&lt;/a&gt; for which the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; had applied. Probably invent a clerical error, blame it on his old predecessor Decumus Scotti, and require an additional cost to rectify.\n\"I have correspondence for Decumus Scotti of the &lt;a href=\"Atrius%20Building%20Commission\"&gt;Atrius Building Commission&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti looked up. A fat-faced courier had entered his office and was thrusting forth a sealed scroll. He handed the boy a gold piece, and opened it up. By the poor penmanship, atrocious spelling and grammar, and overall unprofessional tone, it was manifestly evident who the writer was. &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow clerk some years before, who had left the Commission after being accused of unethical business practices.\n\"Dear Sckotti,\nI emagine you alway wondered what happened to me, and the last plase you would have expected to find me is out in the woods. But thats exactly where I am. Ha ha. If your'e smart and want to make lot of extra gold for Lord Atrius (and yourself, ha ha), youll come down to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Vallinwood&lt;/a&gt; too. If you have'nt or have been following the politics hear lately, you may or may not know that ther's bin a war between the Boshmer and there neighbors &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elswere&lt;/a&gt; over the past two years. Things have only just calm down, and ther's a lot that needs to be rebuilt.\nNow Ive got more business than I can handle, but I need somone with some clout, someone representing a respected agencie to get the quill in the ink. That somone is you, my fiend. Come &amp; meat me at the M'ther Paskos &lt;a href=\"Tavern\"&gt;Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinnesti&lt;/a&gt;, Vallinwood. Ill be here 2 weeks and you wont be sorrie.\n-- Jurus\nP.S.: Bring a wagenload of timber if you can.\"\n\"What do you have there, Scotti?\" asked a voice.\nScotti started. It was Imbrallius, his damnably handsome face peeking through the shutters, smiling in that way that melted the hearts of the stingiest of patrons and the roughest of stonemasons. Scotti shoved the letter in his jacket pocket.\n\"Personal correspondence,\" he sniffed. \"I'll be cleared up here in a just a moment.\"\n\"I don't want to hurry you,\" said Imbrallius, grabbing a few sheets of blank contracts from Scotti's desk. \"I've just gone through a stack, and the junior scribes hands are all cramping up, so I thought you wouldn't miss a few.\"\nThe lad vanished. Scotti retrieved the letter and read it again. He thought about his life, something he rarely did. It seemed a sea of gray with a black insurmountable wall looming. There was only one narrow passage he could see in that wall. Quickly, before he had a moment to reconsider it, he grabbed a dozen of the blank contracts with the shimmering gold leaf ATRIUS BUILDING COMMISSION BY APPOINTMENT OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY and hid them in the satchel with his personal effects.\nThe next day he began his adventure with a giddy lack of hesitation. He arranged for a seat in a caravan bound for Valenwood, the single escorted conveyance to the southeast leaving the Imperial City that week. He had scarcely hours to pack, but he remembered to purchase a wagonload of timber.\n\"It will be extra gold to pay for a horse to pull that,\" frowned the convoy head.\n\"So I anticipated,\" smiled Scotti with his best Imbrallius grin.\nTen wagons in all set off that afternoon through the familiar Cyrodilic countryside. Past fields of wildflowers, gently rolling woodlands, friendly hamlets. The clop of the horses' hooves against the sound stone road reminded Scotti that the Atrius Building Commission constructed it. Five of the eighteen necessary contracts for its completion were drafted by his own hand.\n\"Very smart of you to bring that wood along,\" said a gray-whiskered &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; man next to him on his wagon. \"You must be in Commerce.\"\n\"Of a sort,\" said Scotti, in a way he hoped was mysterious, before introducing himself: \"Decumus Scotti.\"\n\"Gryf Mallon,\" said the man. \"I'm a poet, actually a translator of old Bosmer literature. I was researching some newly discovered tracts of the Mnoriad Pley Bar two years ago when the war broke out and I had to leave. You are no doubt familiar with the Mnoriad, if you're aware of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti thought the man might be speaking perfect gibberish, but he nodded his head.\n\"Naturally, I don't pretend that the Mnoriad is as renowned as the &lt;a href=\"Meh%20Ayleidion\"&gt;Meh Ayleidion&lt;/a&gt;, or as ancient as the Dansir Gol, but I think it has a remarkable significance to understanding the nature of the merelithic &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; mind. The origin of the Wood Elf aversion to cutting their own wood or eating any plant material at all, yet paradoxically their willingness to import plantstuff from other cultures, I feel can be linked to a passage in the Mnoriad,\" Mallon shuffled through some of his papers, searching for the appropriate text.\nTo Scotti's vast relief, the carriage soon stopped to camp for the night. They were high on a bluff over a gray stream, and before them was the great valley of Valenwood. Only the cry of seabirds declared the presence of the ocean to the bay to the west: here the timber was so tall and wide, twisting around itself like an impossible knot begun eons ago, to be impenetrable. A few more modest trees, only fifty feet to the lowest branches, stood on the cliff at the edge of camp. The sight was so alien to Scotti and he found himself so anxious about the proposition of entering the wilderness that he could not imagine sleeping.\nFortunately, Mallon had supposed he had found another academic with a passion for the riddles of ancient cultures. Long into the night, he recited Bosmer verse in the original and in his own translation, sobbing and bellowing and whispering wherever appropriate. Gradually, Scotti began to feel drowsy, but a sudden crack of wood snapping made him sit straight up.\n\"What was that?\"\nMallon smiled: \"I like it too. 'Convocation in the malignity of the moonless speculum, a dance of fire --'\"\n\"There are some enormous birds up in the trees moving around,\" whispered Scotti, pointing in the direction of the dark shapes above.\n\"I wouldn't worry about that,\" said Mallon, irritated with his audience. \"Now listen to how the poet characterizes &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;'s invocation in the eighteenth stanza of the fourth book.\"\nThe dark shapes in the trees were some of them perched like birds, others slithered like snakes, and still others stood up straight like men. As Mallon recited his verse, Scotti watched the figures softly leap from branch to branch, half-gliding across impossible distances for anything without wings. They gathered in groups and then reorganized until they had spread to every tree around the camp. Suddenly they plummeted from the heights.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;!\" cried Scotti. \"They're falling like rain!\"\n\"Probably seed pods,\" Mallon shrugged, not turning around. \"Some of the trees have remarkable --\"\nThe camp erupted into chaos. Fires burst out in the wagons, the horses wailed from mortal blows, casks of wine, fresh water, and liquor gushed their contents to the ground. A nimble shadow dashed past Scotti and Mallon, gathering sacks of grain and gold with impossible agility and grace. Scotti had only one glance at it, lit up by a sudden nearby burst of flame. It was a sleek creature with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur and a tail like a whip.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;,\" he whimpered, shrinking back.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt;,\" groaned Mallon. \"Much worse. &lt;a href=\"Khajit\"&gt;Khajit&lt;/a&gt;i cousins or some such thing, come to plunder.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\nAs quickly as they struck, the creatures retreated, diving off the bluff before the battlemage and knight, the caravan's escorts, had fully opened their eyes. Mallon and Scotti ran to the precipice and saw a hundred feet below the tiny figures dash out of the water, shake themselves, and disappear into the wood.\n\"Werewolves aren't acrobats like that,\" said Mallon. \"They were definitely Cathay-raht. Bastard thieves. Thank &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; they didn't realize the value of my notebooks. It wasn't a complete loss.\"\nA Dance in Fire, Book II.\nIt was a complete loss. The &lt;a href=\"Cathay-Raht\"&gt;Cathay-Raht&lt;/a&gt; had stolen or destroyed almost every item of value in the caravan in just a few minutes' time. &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti's&lt;/a&gt; wagonload of wood he had hoped to trade with the Bosmer had been set on fire and then toppled off the bluff. His clothing and contracts were tattered and ground into the mud of dirt mixed with spilt wine. All the pilgrims, merchants, and adventurers in the group moaned and wept as they gathered the remnants of their belongings by the rising sun of the dawn.\n\"I best not tell anyone that I managed to hold onto my notes for my translation of the Mnoriad Pley Bar,\" whispered the poet Gryf Mallon. \"They'd probably turn on me.\"\nScotti politely declined the opportunity of telling Mallon just how little value he himself placed on the man's property. Instead, he counted the coins in his purse. Thirty-four gold pieces. Very little indeed for an entrepreneur beginning a new business.\n\"Hoy!\" came a cry from the wood. A small party of &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the thicket, clad in leather mail and bearing arms. \"Friend or foe?\"\n\"Neither,\" growled the convoy head.\n\"You must be the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;s,\" laughed the leader of the group, a tall skeleton-thin youth with a sharp vulpine face. \"We heard you were en route. Evidently, so did our enemies.\"\n\"I thought the war was over,\" muttered one of the caravan's now ruined merchants.\nThe Bosmer laughed again: \"No act of war. Just a little border enterprise. You are going on to &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"I'm not,\" the convoy head shook his head. \"As far as I'm concerned, my duty is done. No more horses, no more caravan. Just a fat profit loss to me.\"\nThe men and women crowded around the man, protesting, threatening, begging, but he refused to step foot in Valenwood. If these were the new times of peace, he said, he'd rather come back for the next war.\nScotti tried a different route and approached the Bosmer. He spoke with an authoritative but friendly voice, the kind he used in negotiations with peevish carpenters: \"I don't suppose you'd consider escorting me to Falinesti. I'm a representative for an important Imperial agency, the Atrius Building Commission, here to help repair and alleviate some of the problems the war with the Khajiit brought to your province. Patriotism --\"\n\"Twenty gold pieces, and you must carry your own gear if you have any left,\" replied the Bosmer.\nScotti reflected that negotiations with peevish carpenters rarely went his way either.\nSix eager people had enough gold on them for payment. Among those without funds was the poet, who appealed to Scotti for assistance.\n\"I'm sorry, Gryf, I only have fourteen gold left over. Not even enough for a decent room when I get to Falinesti. I really would help you if I could,\" said Scotti, persuading himself that it was true.\nThe band of six and their Bosmer escorts began the descent down a rocky path along the bluff. Within an hour's time, they were deep in the jungles of Valenwood. A never-ending canopy of hues of browns and greens obscured the sky. A millennia's worth of fallen leaves formed a deep, wormy sea of putrefaction beneath their feet. Several miles were crossed wading through the slime. For several more, they took a labyrinthian path across fallen branches and the low-hanging boughs of giant trees.\nAll the while, hour after hour, the inexhaustible Bosmer host moved so fast, the Cyrodiils struggled to keep from being left behind. A red-faced little merchant with short legs took a bad step on a rotten branch and nearly fell. His fellow provincials had to help him up. The Bosmer paused only a moment, their eyes continually darting to the shadows in the trees above before moving on at their usual expeditious pace.\n\"What are they so nervous about?\" wheezed the merchant irritably. \"More Cathay-Raht?\"\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" laughed the Bosmer unconvincingly. \"&lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i this far into Valenwood? In times of peace? They'd never dare.\"\nWhen the group passed high enough above the swamp that the smell was somewhat dissipated, Scotti felt a sudden pang of hunger. He was used to four meals a day in the Cyrodilic custom. Hours of nonstop exertion without food was not part of his regimen as a comfortably paid clerk. He pondered, feeling somewhat delirious, how long they had been trotting through the jungle. Twelve hours? Twenty? A week? Time was meaningless. Sunlight was only sporadic through the vegetative ceiling. Phosphorescent molds on the trees and in the muck below provided the only regular illumination.\n\"Is it at all possible for us to rest and eat?\" he hollered to his host up ahead.\n\"We're near to Falinesti,\" came the echoing reply. \"Lots of food there.\"\nThe path continued upward for several hours more across a clot of fallen logs, rising up to the first and then the second boughs of the tree line. As they rounded a long corner, the travelers found themselves midway up a waterfall that fell a hundred feet or more. No one had the energy to complain as they began pulling up the stacks of rock, agonizing foot by foot. The Bosmer escorts disappeared into the mist, but Scotti kept climbing until there was no more rock left. He wiped the sweat and river water from his eyes.\nFalinesti spread across the horizon before him. Sprawling across both banks of the river stood the mighty &lt;a href=\"graht-oak\"&gt;graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; city, with groves and orchards of lesser trees crowding it like supplicants before their king. At a lesser scale, the tree that formed the moving city would have been extraordinary: gnarled and twisted with a gorgeous crown of gold and green, dripping with vines and shining with sap. At a mile tall and half as wide, it was the most magnificent thing Scotti had ever seen. If he had not been a starving man with the soul of a clerk, he would have sung.\n\"There you are,\" said the leader of the escorts. \"Not too far a walk. You should be glad it's wintertide. In summertide, the city's on the far south end of the province.\"\nScotti was lost as to how to proceed. The sight of the vertical metropolis where people moved about like ants disoriented all his sensibilities.\n\"You wouldn't know of an inn called,\" he paused for a moment, and then pulled Jurus's letter from his pocket. \"Something like 'Mother Paskos Tavern'?\"\n\"Mother Pascost?\" the lead Bosmer laughed his familiar contemptuous laugh. \"You won't want to stay there? Visitors always prefer the &lt;a href=\"Aysia%20Hall\"&gt;Aysia Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the top boughs. It's expensive, but very nice.\"\n\"I'm meeting someone at Mother Pascost's Tavern.\"\n\"If you've made up your mind to go, take a lift to &lt;a href=\"Havel%20Slump\"&gt;Havel Slump&lt;/a&gt; and ask for directions there. Just don't get lost and fall asleep in the western cross.\"\nThis apparently struck the youth's friends as a very witty jest, and so it was with their laughter echoing behind him that Scotti crossed the writhing root system to the base of Falinesti. The ground was littered with leaves and refuse, and from moment to moment a glass or a bone would plummet from far above, so he walked with his neck crooked to have warning. An intricate network of platforms anchored to thick vines slipped up and down the slick trunk of the city with perfect grace, manned by operators with arms as thick as an ox's belly. Scotti approaches the nearest fellow at one of the platforms, who was idly smoking from a glass pipe.\n\"I was wondering if you might take me to Havel Slump.\"\nThe mer nodded and within a few minutes time, Scotti was two hundred feet in the air at a crook between two mighty branches. Curled webs of moss stretched unevenly across the fork, forming a sharing roof for several dozen small buildings. There were only a few souls in the alley, but around the bend ahead, he could hear the sound of music and people. Scotti tipped the Falinesti Platform Ferryman a gold piece and asked for the location of Mother Pascost's Tavern.\n\"Straight ahead of you, sir, but you won't find anyone there,\" the Ferryman explained, pointing in the direction of the noise. \"Morndas everyone in Havel Slump has revelry.\"\nScotti walked carefully along the narrow street. Though the ground felt as solid as the marble avenues of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, there were slick cracks in the bark that exposed fatal drops into the river. He took a moment to sit down, to rest and get used to the view from the heights. It was a beautiful day for certain, but it took Scotti only a few minutes of contemplation to rise up in alarm. A jolly little raft anchored down stream below him had distinctly moved several inches while he watched it. But it hadn't moved at all. He had. Together with everything around him. It was no metaphor: the city of Falinesti walked. And, considering its size, it moved quickly.\nScotti rose to his feet and into a cloud of smoke that drifted out from around the bend. It was the most delicious roast he had ever smelled. The clerk forgot his fear and ran.\nThe \"revelry\" as the Ferryman had termed it took place on an enormous platform tied to the tree, wide enough to be a plaza in any other city. A fantastic assortment of the most amazing people Scotti had ever seen were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder together, many eating, many more drinking, and some dancing to a lutist and singer perched on an offshoot above the crowd. They were largely Bosmer, true natives clad in colorful leather and bones, with a close minority of orcs. Whirling through the throng, dancing and bellowing at one another were a hideous ape people. A few heads bobbing over the tops of the crowd belonged not, as Scotti first assumed, to very tall people, but to a family of centaurs.\n\"Care for some mutton?\" queried a wizened old mer who roasted an enormous beast on some red-hot rocks.\nScotti quickly paid him a gold piece and devoured the leg he was given. And then another gold piece and another leg. The fellow chuckled when Scotti began choking on a piece of gristle, and handed him a mug of a frothing white drink. He drank it and felt a quiver run through his body as if he were being tickled.\n\"What is that?\" Scotti asked.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Jagga\"&gt;Jagga&lt;/a&gt;. Fermented pig's milk. I can let you have a flagon of it and a bit more mutton for another gold.\"\nScotti agreed, paid, gobbled down the meat, and took the flagon with him as he slipped into the crowd. His co-worker Liodes Jurus, the man who had told him to come to Valenwood, was nowhere to be seen. When the flagon was a quarter empty, Scotti stopped looking for Jurus. When it was half empty, he was dancing with the group, oblivious to the broken planks and gaps in the fencework. At three quarters empty, he was trading jokes with a group of creatures whose language was completely alien to him. By the time the flagon was completely drained, he was asleep, snoring, while the revelry continued on all around his supine body.\nThe next morning, still asleep, Scotti had the sensation of someone kissing him. He made a face to return the favor, but a pain like fire spread through his chest and forced him to open his eyes. There was an insect the size of a large calf sitting on him, crushing him, its spiky legs holding him down while a central spiral-bladed vortex of a mouth tore through his shirt. He screamed and thrashed but the beast was too strong. It had found its meal and it was going to finish it.\nIt's over, thought Scotti wildly, I should have never left home. I could have stayed in the City, and perhaps found work with Lord Vanech. I could have begun again as a junior clerk and worked my way back up.\nSuddenly the mouth released itself. The creature shivered once, expelled a burst of yellow bile, and died.\n\"Got one!\" cried a voice, not too distantly.\nFor a moment, Scotti lay still. His head throbbed and his chest burned. Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement. Another of the horrible monsters was scurried towards him. He scrambled, trying to push himself free, but before he could come out, there was a sound of a bow cracking and an arrow pierced the second insect.\n\"Good shot!\" cried another voice. \"Get the first one again! I just saw it move a little!\"\nThis time, Scotti felt the impact of the bolt hit the carcass. He cried out, but he could hear how muffled his voice was by the beetle's body. Cautiously, he tried sliding a foot out and rolling under, but the movement apparently had the effect of convincing the archers that the creature still lived. A volley of arrows was launched forth. Now the beast was sufficiently perforated so pools of its blood, and likely the blood of its victims, began to seep out onto Scotti's body.\nWhen Scotti was a lad, before he grew too sophisticated for such sports, he had often gone to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Imperial Arena&lt;/a&gt; for the competitions of war. He recalled a great veteran of the fights, when asked, telling him his secret, \"Whenever I'm in doubt of what to do, and I have a shield, I stay behind it.\"\nScotti followed that advice. After an hour, when he no longer heard arrows being fired, he threw aside the remains of the bug and leapt as quickly as he could to a stand. It was not a moment too soon. A gang of eight archers had their bows pointing his direction, ready to fire. When they saw him, they laughed.\n\"Didn't anyone ever tell you not to sleep in the western cross? How're we going to exterminate all the &lt;a href=\"hoarvor\"&gt;hoarvor&lt;/a&gt;s if you drunks keep feeding 'em?\"\nScotti shook his head and walked back along the platform, round the bend, to Havel Slump. He was bloodied and torn and tired and he had far too much fermented pig's milk. All he wanted was a proper place to lie down. He stepped into Mother Pascost's Tavern, a dank place, wet with sap, smelling of mildew.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti,\" he said. \"I was hoping you have someone named Jurus staying here.\"\n\"Decumus Scotti?\" pondered the fleshy proprietress, Mother Pascost herself. \"I've heard that name. Oh, you must be the fellow he left the note for. Let me go see if I can find it.\"\nA Dance in Fire, Book III.\n&lt;a href=\"Mother%20Pascost\"&gt;Mother Pascost&lt;/a&gt; disappeared into the sordid hole that was her tavern, and emerged a moment later with a scrap of paper with &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;'s familiar scrawl. &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt; held it up before a patch of sunlight that had found its way through the massive boughs of the tree city, and read.\nSckotti,\nSo you made it to Falinnesti, Vallinwood! Congradulatens! Im sure you had quit a adventure getting here. Unfortunately, Im not here anymore as you probaby guess. Theres a town down rivver called Athie Im at. Git a bote and join me! Its ideal! I hope you brot a lot of contracks, cause these peple need a lot of building done. They wer close to the war, you see, but not so close they don't have any mony left to pay. Ha ha. Meat me down here as son as you can.\n-- Jurus\nSo, Scotti pondered, Jurus had left Falinesti and gone to some place called Athie. Given his poor penmanship and ghastly spelling, it could equally well be Athy, Aphy, Othry, Imthri, Urtha, or Krakamaka. The sensible thing to do, Scotti knew, was to call this adventure over and try to find some way to get back home to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. He was no mercenary devoted to a life of thrills: he was, or at least had been, a senior clerk at a successful private building commission. Over the last few weeks, he had been robbed by the &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-Raht&lt;/a&gt;, taken on a death march through the jungle by a gang of giggling Bosmeri, half-starved to death, drugged with fermented pig's milk, nearly slain by some kind of giant tick, and attacked by archers. He was filthy, exhausted, and had, he counted, ten gold pieces to his name. Now the man whose proposal brought him to the depths of misery was not even there. It was both judicious and seemly to abandon the enterprise entirely.\nAnd yet, a small but distinct voice in his head told him: You have been chosen. You have no other choice but to see this through.\nScotti turned to the stout old woman, Mother Pascost, who had been watching him curiously: \"I was wondering if you knew of a village that was at the edge of the recent conflict with Elsweyr. It's called something like Ath-ie?\"\n\"You must mean &lt;a href=\"Athay\"&gt;Athay&lt;/a&gt;,\" she grinned. \"My middle lad, Viglil, he manages a dairy down there. Beautiful country, right on the river. Is that where your friend went?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Scotti. \"Do you know the fastest way to get there?\"\nAfter a short conversation, an even shorter ride to Falinesti's roots by way of the platforms, and a jog to the river bank, Scotti was negotiating transport with a huge fair-haired Bosmer with a face like a pickled carp. He called himself Captain Balfix, but even Scotti with his sheltered life could recognize him for what he was. A retired pirate for hire, a smuggler for certain, and probably much worse. His ship, which had clearly been stolen in the distant past, was a bent old Imperial sloop.\n\"Fifty gold and we'll be in Athay in two days time,\" boomed Captain Balfix expansively.\n\"I have ten, no, sorry, nine gold pieces,\" replied Scotti, and feeling the need for explanation, added, \"I had ten, but I gave one to the Platform Ferryman to get me down here.\"\n\"Nine is just as fine,\" said the captain agreeably. \"Truth be told, I was going to Athay whether you paid me or not. Make yourself comfortable on the boat, we'll be leaving in just a few minutes.\"\nDecumus Scotti boarded the vessel, which sat low in the water of the river, stacked high with crates and sacks that spilled out of the hold and galley and onto the deck. Each was marked with stamps advertising the most innocuous substances: copper scraps, lard, ink, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; meal (marked \"For Cattle\"), tar, fish jelly. Scotti's imagination reeled picturing what sorts of illicit imports were truly aboard.\nIt took more than those few minutes for Captain Balfix to haul in the rest of his cargo, but in an hour, the anchor was up and they were sailing downriver towards Athay. The green gray water barely rippled, only touched by the fingers of the breeze. Lush plant life crowded the banks, obscuring from sight all the animals that sang and roared at one another. Lulled by the serene surroundings, Scotti drifted to sleep.\nAt night, he awoke and gratefully accepted some clean clothes and food from Captain Balfix.\n\"Why are you going to Athay, if I may ask?\" queried the Bosmer.\n\"I'm meeting a former colleague there. He asked me to come down from the Imperial City where I worked for the Atrius Building Commission to negotiate some contracts,\" Scotti took another bite of the dried sausages they were sharing for dinner. \"We're going to try to repair and refurbish whatever bridges, roads, and other structures that got damaged in the recent war with the Khajiiti.\"\n\"It's been a hard two years,\" the captain nodded his head. \"Though I suppose good for me and the likes of you and your friend. Trade routes cut off. Now they think there's going to be war with the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, you heard that?\"\nScotti shook his head.\n\"I've done my share of smuggling &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; down the coast, even helping some revolutionary types escape the Mane's wrath, but now the wars've made me a legitimate trader, a business-man. The first casualties of war is always the corrupted.\"\nScotti said he was sorry to hear that, and they lapsed into silence, watching the stars and moons' reflection on the still water. The next day, Scotti awoke to find the captain wrapped up in his sail, torpid from alcohol, singing in a low, slurred voice. When he saw Scotti rise, he offered his flagon of jagga.\n\"I learned my lesson during revelry at western cross.\"\nThe captain laughed, and then burst into tears, \"I don't want to be legitimate. Other pirates I used to know are still raping and stealing and smuggling and selling nice folk like you into slavery. I swear to you, I never thought the first time that I ran a real shipment of legal goods that my life would turn out like this. Oh, I know, I could go back to it, but &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt; knows not after all I've seen. I'm a ruined man.\"\nScotti helped the weeping &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; out of the sail, murmuring words of reassurance. Then he added, \"Forgive me for changing the subject, but where are we?\"\n\"Oh,\" moaned Captain Balfix miserably. \"We made good time. Athay's right around the bend in the river.\"\n\"Then it looks like Athay's on fire,\" said Scotti, pointing.\nA great plume of smoke black as pitch was rising above the trees. As they drifted around the bend, they next saw the flames, and then the blackened skeletal remains of the village. Dying, blazing villagers leapt from rocks into the river. A cacophony of wailing met their ears, and they could see, roaming along the edges of the town, the figures of Khajiiti soldiers bearing torches.\n\"Baan Dar bless me!\" slurred the captain. \"The war's back on!\"\n\"Oh, no,\" whimpered Scotti.\nThe sloop drifted with the current toward the opposite shore away from the fiery town. Scotti turned his attention there, and the sanctuary it offered. Just a peaceful arbor, away from the horror. There was a shudder of leaves in two of the trees and a dozen lithe Khajiit dropped to the ground, armed with bows.\n\"They see us,\" hissed Scotti. \"And they've got bows!\"\n\"Well, of course they have bows,\" snarled Captain Balfix. \"We Bosmer may have invented the bloody things, but we didn't think to keep them secret, you bloody bureaucrat.\"\n\"Now, they're setting their arrows on fire!\"\n\"Yes, they do that sometimes.\"\n\"Captain, they're shooting at us! They're shooting at us with flaming arrows!\"\n\"Ah, so they are,\" the captain agreed. \"The aim here is to avoid being hit.\"\nBut hit they were, and very shortly thereafter. Even worse, the second volley of arrows hit the supply of pitch, which ignited in a tremendous blue blaze. Scotti grabbed Captain Balfix and they leapt overboard just before the ship and all its cargo disintegrated. The shock of the cold water brought the Bosmer into temporary sobriety. He called to Scotti, who was already swimming as fast as he could toward the bend.\n\"Master Decumus, where do you think you're swimming to?\"\n\"Back to Falinesti!\" cried Scotti.\n\"It will take you days, and by the time you get there, everyone will know about the attack on Athay! They'll never let anyone they don't know in! The closest village downriver is &lt;a href=\"Grenos\"&gt;Grenos&lt;/a&gt;, maybe they'll give us shelter!\"\nScotti swam back to the captain and side-by-side they began paddling in the middle of the river, past the burning residuum of the village. He thanked &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; that he had learned to swim. Many a Cyrodiil did not, as largely land-locked as the Imperial Province was. Had he been raised in &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup\"&gt;Mir Corrup&lt;/a&gt; or Artemon, he might have been doomed, but the Imperial City itself was encircled by water, and every lad and lass there knew how to cross without a boat. Even those who grew up to be clerks and not adventurers.\nCaptain Balfix's sobriety faded as he grew used to the water's temperature. Even in wintertide, the &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River\"&gt;Xylo River&lt;/a&gt; was fairly temperate and after a fashion, even comfortable. The Bosmer's strokes were uneven, and he'd stray closer to Scotti and then further away, pushing ahead and then falling behind.\nScotti looked to the shore to his right: the flames had caught the trees like tinder. Behind them was an inferno, with which they were barely keeping pace. To the shore on their left, all looked fair, until he saw a tremble in the river-reeds, and then what caused it. A pride of the largest cats he had ever seen. They were auburn-haired, green-eyed beasts with jaws and teeth to match his wildest nightmares. And they were watching the two swimmers, and keeping pace.\n\"Captain Balfix, we can't go to either that shore or the other one, or we'll be parboiled or eaten,\" Scotti whispered. \"Try to even your kicking and your strokes. Breath like you would normally. If you're feeling tired, tell me, and we'll float on our backs for a while.\"\nAnyone who has had the experience of giving rational advice to a drunkard would understand the hopelessness. Scotti kept pace with the captain, slowing himself, quickening, drifting left and right, while the Bosmer moaned old ditties from his pirate days. When he wasn't watching his companion, he watched the cats on the shore. After a stretch, he turned to his right. Another village had caught fire. Undoubtedly, it was Grenos. Scotti stared at the blazing fury, awed by the sight of the destruction, and did not hear that the captain had ceased to sing.\nWhen he turned back, Captain Balfix was gone.\nScotti dove into the murky depths of the river over and over again. There was nothing to be done. When he surfaced after his final search, he saw that the giant cats had moved on, perhaps assuming that he too had drowned. He continued his lonely swim downriver. A tributary, he noted, had formed a final barrier, keeping the flames from spreading further. But there were no more towns. After several hours, he began to ponder the wisdom of going ashore. Which shore was the question.\nHe was spared the decision. Ahead of him was a rocky island with a bonfire. He did not know if he were intruding on a party of Bosmeri or Khajiiti, only that he could swim no more. With straining, aching muscles, he pulled himself onto the rocks.\nThey were Bosmer refugees he gathered, even before they told him. Roasting over the fire was the remains of one of the giant cats that had been stalking him through the jungle on the opposite shore.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger\"&gt;Senche-Tiger&lt;/a&gt;,\" said one of the young warriors ravenously. \"It's no animal -- it's as smart as any Cathay-Raht or &lt;a href=\"Ohmes\"&gt;Ohmes&lt;/a&gt; or any other bleeding Khajiiti. Pity this one drowned. I would have gladly killed it. You'll like the meat, though. Sweet, from all the sugar these asses eat.\"\nScotti did not know if he was capable of eating a creature as intelligent as a man or mer, but he surprised himself, as he had done several times over the last days. It was rich, succulent, and sweet, like sugared pork, but no seasonings had been added. He surveyed the crowd as he ate. A sad lot, some still weeping for lost family members. They were the survivors of both the villages of Grenos and Athay, and war was on every person's lips. Why had the Khajiiti attacked again? Why\u2014specifically directed at Scotti, as a Cyrodiil\u2014why was the Emperor not enforcing peace in his provinces?\n\"I was to meet another Cyrodiil,\" he said to a Bosmer maiden who he understood to be from Athay. \"His name was Liodes Jurus. I don't suppose you know what might have happened to him.\"\n\"I don't know your friend, but there were many Cyrodiils in Athay when the fire came,\" said the girl. \"Some of them, I think, left quickly. They were going to Vindisi, inland, in the jungle. I am going there tomorrow, so are many of us. If you wish, you may come as well.\"\nDecumus Scotti nodded solemnly. He made himself as comfortable as he could in the stony ground of the river island, and somehow, after much effort, he fell asleep. But he did not sleep well.\nA Dance in Fire, Book IV.\nEighteen &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;i and one &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; former senior clerk for an &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; building commission trudged through the jungle westward from the &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River\"&gt;Xylo River&lt;/a&gt; to the ancient village of &lt;a href=\"Vindisi\"&gt;Vindisi&lt;/a&gt;. For &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt;, the jungle was hostile, unfamiliar ground. The enormous vermiculated trees filled the bright morning with darkness, and resembled nothing so much as grasping claws, bent on impeding their progress. Even the fronds of the low plants quivered with malevolent energy. What was worse, he was not alone in his anxiety. His fellow travelers, the natives who had survived the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; attacks on the villages of &lt;a href=\"Grenos\"&gt;Grenos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athay\"&gt;Athay&lt;/a&gt;, wore faces of undisguised fear.\nThere was something sentient in the jungle, and not merely the mad but benevolent indigenous spirits. In his peripheral vision, Scotti could see the shadows of the Khajiiti following the refugees, leaping from tree to tree. When he turned to face them, the lithe forms vanished into the gloom as if they had never been there. But he knew he had seen them. And the Bosmeri saw them too, and quickened their pace.\nAfter eighteen hours, bitten raw by insects, scratched by a thousand thorns, they emerged into a valley clearing. It was night, but a row of blazing &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es greeted them, illuminating the leather-wrought tents and jumbled stones of the hamlet of Vindisi. At the end of the valley, the torches marked a sacred site, a gnarled bower of trees pressed closed together to form a temple. Wordlessly, the Bosmeri walked the torch arcade toward the trees. Scotti followed them. When they reached the solid mass of living wood with only one gaping portal, Scotti could see a dim blue light glowing within. A low sonorous moan from a hundred voices echoed within. The Bosmeri maiden he had been following held out her hand, stopping him.\n\"You do not understand, but no outsider, not even a friend may enter,\" she said. \"This is a holy place.\"\nScotti nodded, and watched the refugees march into the temple, heads bowed. Their voices joined with the ones within. When the last wood elf had gone inside, Scotti turned his attention back to the village. There must be food to be had somewhere. A tendril of smoke and a faint whiff of roasting venison beyond the torchlight led him.\nThey were five Cyrodiils, two &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, the group gathered around a campfire of glowing white stones, pulling steaming strips of meat from the cadaver of a great stag. At Scotti's approach, they rose up, all but the Nord who was distracted by his hunk of animal flesh.\n\"Good evening, sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering if I might have a little something to eat. I'm afraid I'm rather hungry, after walking all day with some refugees from Grenos and Athay.\"\nThey bade him to sit down and eat, and introduced themselves.\n\"So the war's back on, it seems,\" said Scotti amiably.\n\"Best thing for these effete do-nothings,\" replied the Nord in between bites. \"I've never seen such a lazy culture. Now they've got the Khajiiti striking them on land, and the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; at sea. If there's any province that deserves a little distress, it's damnable &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"I don't see how they're so offensive to you,\" laughed one of the Bretons.\n\"They're congenital thieves, even worse than the Khajiiti because they are so blessed meek in their aggression,\" the Nord spat out a gob of fat which sizzled on the hot stones of the fire. \"They spread their forests into territory that doesn't belong to them, slowly infiltrating their neighbors, and they're puzzled when &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; shoves back at them. They're all villains of the worst order.\"\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Scotti.\n\"I'm a diplomat from the court of &lt;a href=\"Jehenna\"&gt;Jehenna&lt;/a&gt;,\" muttered the Nord, returning to his food.\n\"What about you, what are you doing here?\" asked one of the Cyrodiils.\n\"I work for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Atrius\"&gt;Lord Atrius&lt;/a&gt; building commission in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Scotti. \"One of my former colleagues suggested that I come down to Valenwood. He said the war was over, and I could contract a great deal of business for my firm rebuilding what was lost. One disaster after another, and I've lost all my money, I'm in the middle of a rekindling of war, and I cannot find my former colleague.\"\n\"Your former colleague,\" murmured another of the Cyrodiils, who had introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Reglius\"&gt;Reglius&lt;/a&gt;. \"He wasn't by any chance named &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, was he?\"\n\"You know him?\"\n\"He lured me down to Valenwood in nearly the exact same circumstances,\" smiled Reglius, grimly. \"I worked for your employer's competitor, Lord Vanech's men, where Liodes Jurus also formerly worked. He wrote to me, asking that I represent an Imperial building commission and contract some post-war construction. I had just been released from my employment, and I thought that if I brought some new business, I could have my job back. Jurus and I met in Athay, and he said he was going to arrange a very lucrative meeting with &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti was stunned: \"Where is he now?\"\n\"I'm no theologian, so I couldn't say,\" Reglius shrugged. \"He's dead. When the Khajiiti attacked Athay, they began by torching the harbor where Jurus was readying his boat. Or, I should say, my boat since it was purchased with the gold I brought. By the time we were even aware of what was happening enough to flee, everything by the water was ash. The Khajiiti may be animals, but they know how to arrange an attack.\"\n\"I think they followed us through the jungle to Vindisi,\" said Scotti nervously. \"There was definitely a group of something jumping along the treetops.\"\n\"Probably one of the monkey folk,\" snorted the Nord. \"Nothing to be concerned about.\"\n\"When we first came to Vindisi and the Bosmeri all entered that tree, they were furious, whispering something about unleashing an ancient terror on their enemies,\" the Breton shivered, remembering. \"They've been there ever since, for over a day and a half now. If you want something to be afraid of, that's the direction to look.\"\nThe other Breton, who was a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, was staring off into the darkness while his fellow provincial spoke. \"Maybe. But there's something in the jungle too, right on the edge of the village, looking in.\"\n\"More refugees maybe?\" asked Scotti, trying to keep the alarm out his voice.\n\"Not unless they're traveling through the trees now,\" whispered the wizard. The Nord and one of the Cyrodiils grabbed a long tarp of wet leather and pulled it across the fire, instantly extinguishing it without so much as a sizzle. Now Scotti could see the intruders, their elliptical yellow eyes and long cruel blades catching the torchlight. He froze with fear, praying that he too was not so visible to them.\nHe felt something bump against his back, and gasped.\nReglius's voice hissed from up above: \"Be quiet for &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara's&lt;/a&gt; sake and climb up here.\"\nScotti grabbed hold of the knotted double-vine that hung down from a tall tree at the edge of the dead campfire. He scrambled up it as quickly as he could, holding his breath lest any grunt of exertion escape him. At the top of the vine, high above the village, was an abandoned nest from some great bird in a trident-shaped branch. As soon as Scotti had pulled himself into the soft, fragrant straw, Reglius pulled up the vine. No one else was there, and when Scotti looked down, he could see no one below. No one, that is except the Khajiiti, slowly moving toward the glow of the temple tree.\n\"Thank you,\" whispered Scotti, deeply touched that a competitor had helped him. He turned away from the village, and saw that the tree's upper branches brushed against the mossy rock walls that surrounded the valley below. \"How are you at climbing?\"\n\"You're mad,\" said Reglius under his breath. \"We should stay here until they leave.\"\n\"If they burn Vindisi like they did Athay and Grenos, we'll be dead sure as if we were on the ground,\" Scotti began the slow careful climb up the tree, testing each branch. \"Can you see what they're doing?\"\n\"I can't really tell,\" Reglius stared down into the gloom. \"They're at the front of the temple. I think they also have ... it looks like long ropes, trailing off behind them, off into the pass.\"\nScotti crawled onto the strongest branch that pointed toward the wet, rocky face of the cliff. It was not a far jump at all. So close, in fact, that he could smell the moisture and feel the coolness of the stone. But it was a jump nevertheless, and in his history as a clerk, he had never before leapt from a tree a hundred feet off the ground to a sheer rock. He pictured in his mind's eye the shadows that had pursued him through the jungle from the heights above. How their legs coiled to spring, how their arms snapped forward in an elegant fluid motion to grasp. He leapt.\nHis hands grappled for rock, but long thick cords of moss were more accessible. He held hard, but when he tried to plant his feet forward, they slipped up skyward. For a few seconds, he found himself upside down before he managed to pull himself into a more conventional position. There was a narrow outcropping jutting out of the cliff where he could stand and finally exhale.\n\"Reglius. Reglius. Reglius,\" Scotti did not dare to call out. In a minute, there was a shaking of branches, and Lord Vanech's man emerged. First his satchel, then his head, then the rest of him. Scotti started to whisper something, but Reglius shook his head violently and pointed downward. One of the Khajiiti was at the base of the tree, peering at the remains of the campfire.\nReglius awkwardly tried to balance himself on the branch, but as strong as it was it was exceedingly difficult with only one free hand. Scotti cupped his palms and then pointed at the satchel. It seemed to pain Reglius to let it out of his grasp, but he relented and tossed it to Scotti.\nThere was a small, almost invisible hole in the bag, and when Scotti caught it, a single gold coin dropped out. It rang as it bounced against the rock wall on the descent, a high soft sound that seemed like the loudest alarm Scotti had ever heard.\nThen many things happened very quickly.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-Raht&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the tree looked up and gave a loud wail. The other Khajiiti followed in chorus, as the cat below crouched down and then sprung up into the lower branches. Reglius saw it below him, climbing up with impossible dexterity, and panicked. Even before he jumped, Scotti could tell that he was going to fall. With a cry, Reglius the Clerk plunged to the ground, breaking his neck on impact.\nA flash of white fire erupted from every crevice of the temple, and the moan of the Bosmeri prayer changed into something terrible and otherworldly. The climbing Cathay-Raht stopped and stared.\n\"Keirgo,\" it gasped. \"The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIt was as if a crack in reality had opened wide. A flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous beings with the face of gods, all poured forth from the great hollow tree, blind with fury. They tore the Khajiiti in front of the temple to pieces. All the other cats fled for the jungle, but as they did so, they began pulling on the ropes they carried. In a few seconds time, the entire village of Vindisi was boiling with the lunatic apparitions of the Wild Hunt.\nOver the babbling, barking, howling horde, Scotti heard the Cyrodiils in hiding cry out as they were devoured. The Nord too was found and eaten, and both Bretons. The wizard had turned himself invisible, but the swarm did not rely on their sight. The tree the Cathay-Raht was in began to sway and rock from the impossible violence beneath it. Scotti looked at the Khajiiti's fear-struck eyes, and held out one of the cords of moss.\nThe cat's face showed its pitiful gratitude as it leapt for the vine. It didn't have time to entirely replace that expression when Scotti pulled back the cord, and watched it fall. The Hunt consumed it to the bone before it struck the ground.\nScotti's own jump up to the next outcropping of rock was immeasurably more successful. From there, he pulled himself to the top of the cliff and was able to look down into the chaos that had been the village of Vindisi. The Hunt's mass had grown and began to spill out through the pass out of the valley, pursuing the fleeing Khajiiti. It was then that the madness truly began.\nIn the moons' light, from Scotti's vantage, he could see where the Khajiiti had attached their ropes. With a thunderous boom, an avalanche of boulders poured over the pass. When the dust cleared, he saw that the valley had been sealed. The Wild Hunt had nowhere to turn but on itself.\nScotti turned his head, unable to bear to look at the cannibalistic orgy. The night jungle stood before him, a web of wood. He slung Reglius's satchel over his shoulder, and entered.\nA Dance in Fire, Book V.\n\"Soap! The forest will eat love! Straight ahead! Stupid and a stupid cow!\"\nThe voice boomed out so suddenly that &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt; jumped. He stared off into the dim jungle glade from which he only heard animal and insect calls, and the low whistling of wind moments before. It was a queer, oddly accented voice of indiscriminate gender, tremulous in its modulations, but unmistakably human. Or, at very least, elven. An isolated Bosmer perhaps with a poor grasp of the Cyrodilic language. After countless hours of plodding through the dense knot of Valenwood jungle, any voice of slight familiarity sounded wondrous.\n\"Hello?\" he cried.\n\"Beetles on any names? Certainly yesterday yes!\" the voice called back. \"Who, what, and when, and mice!\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand,\" replied Scotti, turning toward the brambled tree, thick as a wagon, where the voice had issued. \"But you needn't be afraid of me. My name is Decumus Scotti. I'm a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. I came here to help rebuild &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost.\"\n\"Gemstones and grilled slaves ... The war,\" moaned the voice and broke down into sobs.\n\"You know about the war? I wasn't sure, I wasn't even sure how far away from the border I am now,\" Scotti began slowly walking toward the tree. He dropped Reglius's satchel to the ground, and held out his empty hands. \"I'm unarmed. I only want to know the way to the closest town. I'm trying to meet my friend, &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Silvenar!\" the voice laughed. It laughed even louder as Scotti circled the tree. \"Worms and wine! Worms and wine! Silvenar sings for worms and wine!\"\nThere was nothing to be found anywhere around the tree. \"I don't see you. Why are you hiding?\"\nIn frustration born of hunger and exhaustion, he struck the tree trunk. A sudden shiver of gold and red erupted from a hollow nook above, and Scotti was surrounded by six winged creatures scarcely more than a few inches long. Bright crimson eyes were set on either side of tunnel-like protuberances, the animals' always open mouths. They were legless, and their thin, rapidly beating, aureate wings seemed poorly constructed to transport their fat, swollen bellies. And yet, they darted through the air like sparks from a fire. Whirling about the poor clerk, they began chattering what he now understood to be perfect nonsense.\n\"Wines and worms, how far from the border am I! Academic garnishments, and alas, Liodes Jurus!\"\n\"Hello, I'm afraid I'm unarmed? Smoken flames and the closest town is dear &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Swollen on bad meat, an indigo nimbus, but you needn't be afraid of me!\"\n\"Why are you hiding? Why are you hiding? Before I begin to friend, love me, Lady Zuleika!\"\nFurious with the mimics, Scotti swung his arms, driving them up into the treetops. He stomped back to the clearing and opened up the satchel again, as he had done some hours before. There was still, unsurprisingly, nothing useful in the bag, and nothing to eat in any corner or pocket. A goodly amount of gold (he smiled grimly, as he had done before, at the irony of being financially solvent in the jungle), a stack of neat blank contracts from Lord Vanech's building commission, some thin cord, and an oiled leather cloak for bad weather. At least, Scotti considered, he had not suffered rain.\nA rolling moan of thunder reminded Scotti of what he had suspected for some weeks now. He was cursed.\nWithin an hour's time, he was wearing the cloak and clawing his way through mud. The trees, which had earlier allowed no sunlight in, provided no shelter against the pounding storm and wind. The only sounds that pierced the pelting of the rain were the mocking calls of the flying creatures, flitting just above, babbling their nonsense. Scotti bellowed at them, threw rocks, but they seemed enamored of his company.\nWhile he was reaching to grab a promising looking stone to hurl at his tormentors, Scotti felt something shift beneath his feet. Wet but solid ground suddenly liquefied and became a rolling tide, rushing him forward. Light as a leaf, he flew head over feet over head, until the mudflow dropped and he continued forward, plunging down into a river twenty-five feet below.\nThe storm passed quite as instantly as it had arrived. The sun melted the dark clouds and warmed Scotti as he swam for the shore. There, another sign of the Khajiiti incursion into Valenwood greeted him. A small fishing village had stood there once, so recently extinct that it smoldered like a still-warm corpse. Dirt cairns that had once housed fish by the smell of them had been ravaged, their bounty turned to ash. Rafts and skiffs lay broken, scuttled, half-submerged. All the villagers were no more, either dead or refugees far away. Or so he presumed. Something banged against the wall of one of the ruins. Scotti ran to investigate.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti?\" sang the first winged beast. \"I'm a Cyrodiil from? The Imperial City? I came here to help rebuild Valenwood after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost?\"\n\"I swell to maculate, apeneck!\" agreed one of its companions. \"I don't see you. Why are you hiding?\"\nAs they fell into chattering, Scotti began to search the rest of the village. Surely the cats had left something behind, a scrap of dried meat, a morsel of fish sausage, anything. But they had been immaculate in their complete annihilation. There was nothing to eat anywhere. Scotti did find one item of possible use under the tumbled remains of a stone hut. A bow and two arrows made of bone. The string had been lost, likely burned away in the heat of the fire, but he pulled the cord from Reglius's satchel and restrung it.\nThe creatures flew over and hovered nearby as he worked: \"The convent of the sacred Liodes Jurus?\"\n\"You know about the war! Worms and wine, circumscribe a golden host, apeneck!\"\nThe moment the cord was taut, Scotti nocked an arrow and swung around, pulling the string tight against his chest. The winged beasts, having had experience with archers before, shot off in all directions in a blur. They needn't have bothered. Scotti's first arrow dove into the ground three feet in front of him. He swore and retrieved it. The mimics, having likewise had experience with poor archers before, returned at once to hovering nearby and mocking Scotti.\nOn his second shot, Scotti did much better, in purely technical terms. He remembered how the archers in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; looked when he pulled himself out from under the hoarvor tick, and they were all taking aim at him. He extended his left hand, right hand, and right elbow in a symmetrical line, drawing the bow so his hand touched his jawline, and he could see the creature in his sight like the arrow was a finger he was pointing with. The bolt missed the target by only two feet, but it continued on its trajectory, snapping when it struck a rock wall.\nScotti walked to the river's edge. He had only one arrow left, and perhaps, he considered, it would be most practical to find a slow-moving fish and fire it on that. If he missed, at least there was less of a chance of breaking the shaft, and he could always retrieve it from the water. A rather torpid, whiskered fish rolled by, and he took aim at it.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti!\" one of the creatures howled, frightening the fish away. \"Stupid and a stupid cow! Will you dance a dance in fire!\"\nScotti turned and aimed the arrow as he had done before. This time, however, he remembered to plant his feet as the archers had done, seven inches apart, knees straight, left leg slightly forward to meet the angle of his right shoulder. He released the last arrow.\nThe arrow also proved a serviceable prong for roasting the creature against the smoking hot stones of one of the ruins. Its other companions had disappeared instantly after the beast was slain, and Scotti was able to dine in peace. The meat proved to be delicious, if scarcely more than a first course. He was picking the last of it from the bones, when a boat sailed into view from around the bend of the river. At the helm were &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; sailors. Scotti ran to the bank and waved his arms. They averted their eyes and continued past.\n\"You bloody, callous bastards!\" Scotti howled. \"Knaves! Hooligans! Apenecks! Scoundrels!\"\nA gray-whiskered form came out from a hatch, and Scotti immediately recognized him as Gryf Mallon, the poet translator he had met in the caravan from Cyrodiil.\nHe peered Scotti's direction, and his eyes lit up with delight, \"Decumus Scotti! Precisely the man I hoped to see! I want to get your thoughts on a rather puzzling passage in the Mnoriad Pley Bar! It begins 'I went weeping into the world, searching for wonders,' perhaps you're familiar with it?\"\n\"I'd like nothing better than to discuss the Mnoriad Pley Bar with you, Gryf!\" Scotti called back. \"Would you let me come aboard though first?\"\nOverjoyed at being on a ship bound for any port at all, Scotti was true to his word. For over an hour as the boat rolled down the river past the blackened remnants of Bosmeri villages, he asked no questions and spoke nothing of his life over the past weeks: he merely listened to Mallon's theories of merethic &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i esoterica. The translator was undemanding of his guest's scholarship, accepting nods and shrugs as civilized conversation. He even produced some wine and fish jelly, which he shared with Scotti absent-mindedly, as he expounded on his various theses.\nFinally, while Mallon was searching for a reference to some minor point in his notes, Scotti asked, \"Rather off subject, but I was wondering where we're bound.\"\n\"The very heart of the province, &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;,\" Mallon said, not looking up from the passage he was reading. \"It's somewhat bothersome, actually, as I wanted to go to &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; first to talk to a Bosmer there who claims to have an original copy of Dirith Yalmillhiad, if you can believe it. But for the time being, that has to wait. Summurset Isle has surrounded the city, and is in the process of starving the citizenry until they surrender. It's a tiresome prospect, since the Bosmeri are happy to eat one another, so there's a risk that at the end, only one fat wood elf will remain to wave the flag.\"\n\"That is vexing,\" agreed Scotti, sympathetically. \"To the east, the Khajiiti are burning everything, and to the west, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; are waging war. I don't suppose the borders to the north are clear?\"\n\"They're even worse,\" replied Mallon, finger on the page, still distracted. \"The &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;[1] don't want Bosmer refugees streaming into their provinces. It only stands to reason. Imagine how much more criminally inclined they'd be now that they're homeless and hungry.\"\n\"So,\" murmured Scotti, feeling a shiver. \"We're trapped in Valenwood.\"\n\"Not at all. I need to leave fairly shortly myself, as my publisher has set a very definite deadline for my new book of translations. From what I understand, one merely petitions to &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; for special border protection and one can cross into Cyrodiil with impunity.\"\n\"Petition the Silvenar, or petition at Silvenar?\"\n\"Petition the Silvenar at Silvenar. It's an odd nomenclature that is typical of this place, the sort of thing that makes my job as a translator that much more challenging. The Silvenar, he, or rather they are the closest the Bosmeri have to a great leader. The essential thing to remember about the Silvenar --\" Mallon smiled, finding the passage he was looking for, \"Here! 'A fortnight, inexplicable, the world burns into a dance.' There's that metaphor again.\"\n\"What were you saying about the Silvenar?\" asked Scotti. \"The essential thing to remember?\"\n\"I don't remember what I was saying,\" replied Mallon, turning back to his oration.\nIn a week's time, the little boat bumped along the shallow, calmer waters of the foaming current the Xylo had become, and Decumus Scotti first saw the city of Silvenar. If Falinesti was a tree, then Silvenar was a flower. A magnificent pile of faded shades of green, red, blue, and white, shining with crystalline residue. Mallon had mentioned off-hand, when not otherwise explaining Aldmeri prosody, that Silvenar had once been a blossoming glade in the forest, but owing to some spell or natural cause, the trees' sap began flowing with translucent liqueur. The process of the sap flowing and hardening over the colorful trees had formed the web of the city. Mallon's description was intriguing, but it hardly prepared him for the city's beauty.\n\"What is the finest, most luxurious tavern here?\" Scotti asked one of the Bosmer boatmen.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Prithala%20Hall\"&gt;Prithala Hall&lt;/a&gt;,\" Mallon answered. \"But why don't you stay with me? I'm visiting an acquaintance of mine, a scholar I think you'll find fascinating. His hovel isn't much, but he has the most extraordinary ideas about the principles of a Merethic Aldmeri tribe the Sarmathi --\"\n\"Under any other circumstances, I would happily accept,\" said Scotti graciously. \"But after weeks of sleeping on the ground or on a raft, and eating whatever I could scrounge, I feel the need for some indulgent creature comforts. And then, after a day or two, I'll petition the Silvenar for safe passage to Cyrodiil.\"\nThe men bade each other goodbye. Gryf Mallon gave him the address of his publisher in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, which Scotti accepted and quickly forgot. The clerk wandered the streets of Silvenar, crossing bridges of amber, admiring the petrified forest architecture. In front of a particularly estimable palace of silvery reflective crystal, he found Prithala Hall.\nHe took the finest room, and ordered a gluttonous meal of the finest quality. At a nearby table, he saw two very fat fellows, a man and a Bosmer, remarking how much finer the food was there than at the Silvenar's palace. They began to discuss the war and some issues of finances and rebuilding provincial bridges. The man noticed Scotti looking at them, and his eyes flashed recognition.\n\"Scotti, is that you? &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, where have you been? I've had to make all the contacts here on my own!\"\nAt the sound of his voice, Scotti recognized him. The fat man was &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, vastly engorged.\nA Dance in Fire, Book VI.\n&lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt; sat down, listening to &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;. The clerk could hardly believe how fat his former colleague at Lord Atrius's Building Commission had become. The piquant aroma of the roasted meat dish before Scotti melted away. All the other sounds and textures of &lt;a href=\"Prithala%20Hall\"&gt;Prithala Hall&lt;/a&gt; vanished all around him, as if nothing else existed but the vast form of Jurus. Scotti did not consider himself an emotional man, but he felt a tide flow over him at the sight and sound of the man whose badly written letters had been the guideposts that carried him from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; back in early &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frost Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Where have you been?\" Jurus demanded again. \"I told you to meet me in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; weeks ago.\"\n\"I was there weeks ago,\" Scotti stammered, too surprised to be indignant. \"I got your note to meet you in &lt;a href=\"Athay\"&gt;Athay&lt;/a&gt;, and so I went there, but the Khajiiti had burned it to the ground. Somehow, I found my way with the refugees in another village, and someone there told me that you had been killed.\"\n\"And you believed that right away?\" Jurus sneered.\n\"The fellow seemed very well-informed about you. He was a clerk from Lord Vanech's Building Commission named &lt;a href=\"Reglius\"&gt;Reglius&lt;/a&gt;, and he said that you had also suggested that he come down to Valenwood to profit from the war.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Jurus, after thinking a moment. \"I recall the name now. Well, it's good for business to have two representatives from Imperial building commissions here. We just need to all coordinate our bids, and all should be well.\"\n\"Reglius is dead,\" said Scotti. \"But I have his contracts from Lord Vanech's Commission.\"\n\"Even better,\" gasped Jurus, impressed. \"I never knew you were such a ruthless competitor, Decumus Scotti. Yes, this could certainly improve our position with the Silvenar. Have I introduced you to &lt;a href=\"Basth\"&gt;Basth&lt;/a&gt; here?\"\nScotti had only been dimly aware of the Bosmer's presence at the table with Jurus, which was surprising given that the mer's girth nearly equaled his dining companion. The clerk nodded to Basth coldly, still numb and confused. It had not left his mind that only any hour earlier, Scotti had intended to petition the Silvenar for safe passage through the border back to Cyrodiil. The thought of doing business with Jurus after all, of profiting from &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Valenwood war with Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, and now the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;second one&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, seemed like something happening to another person.\n\"Your colleague and I were talking about the Silvenar,\" said Basth, putting down the leg of mutton he had been gnawing on. \"I don't suppose you've heard about his nature?\"\n\"A little, but nothing very specific. I got the impression that he's very important and very peculiar.\"\n\"He's the representative of the People, legally, physically, and emotionally,\" explained Jurus, a little annoyed at his new partner's lack of common knowledge. \"When they're healthy, so is he. When they're mostly female, so is he. When they cry for food or trade or an absence of foreign interference, he feels it too, and makes laws accordingly. In a way, he's a despot, but he's the people's despot.\"\n\"That sounds,\" said Scotti, searching for the appropriate word. \"Like ... bunk.\"\n\"Perhaps it is,\" shrugged Basth. \"But he has many rights as the Voice of the People, including the granting of foreign building and trade contracts. It's not important whether you believe us. Just think of the Silvenar as being like one of your mad Emperors, like &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;. The problem facing us now is that since Valenwood is being attacked on all sides, the Silvenar's aspect is now one of distrust and fear of foreigners. The one hope of his people, and thus of the Silvenar himself, is that the Emperor will intervene and stop the war.\"\n\"Will he?\" asked Scotti.\n\"You know as well as we do that the Emperor has not been himself lately,\" Jurus helped himself to Reglius's satchel and pulled out the blank contracts. \"Who knows what he'll choose to do or not do? That reality is not our concern, but these blessings from the late good sir Reglius make our job much simpler.\"\nThey discussed how they would represent themselves to the Silvenar into the evening. Scotti ate continuously, but not nearly so much as Jurus and Basth. When the sun had begun to rise in the hills, its light reddening through the crystal walls of the tavern, Jurus and Basth left to their rooms at the palace, granted to them diplomatically in lieu of an actual immediate audience with the Silvenar. Scotti went to his room. He thought about staying up a little longer to ruminate over Jurus's plans and see what might be the flaw in them, but upon touching the cool, soft bed, he immediately fell asleep.\nThe next afternoon, Scotti awoke, feeling himself again. In other words, timid. For several weeks now, he had been a creature bent on mere survival. He had been driven to exhaustion, attacked by several jungle beasts, starved, nearly drowned, and forced into discussions of ancient Aldmeri poetical works. The discussion he had with Jurus and Basth about how to dupe the Silvenar into signing their contracts seemed perfectly reasonable then. Scotti dressed himself in his old battered clothes and went downstairs in search of food and a peaceful place to think.\n\"You're up,\" cried Basth upon seeing him. \"We should go to the palace now.\"\n\"Now?\" whined Scotti. \"Look at me. I need new clothes. This isn't the way one should dress to pay a call on a prostitute, let alone the Voice of the People of Valenwood. I haven't even bathed.\"\n\"You must cease from this moment forward being a clerk, and become a student of mercantile trade,\" said Liodes Jurus grandly, taking Scotti by the arm and leading him into the sunlit boulevard outside. \"The first rule is to recognize what you represent to the prospective client, and what angle best suits you. You cannot dazzle him with opulent fashion and professional bearing, my dear boy, and it would be fatal if you attempted to. Trust me on this. Several others besides Basth and I are guests at the palace, and they have made the error of appearing too eager, too formal, too ready for business. They will never be granted audience with the Silvenar, but we have remained aloof ever since the initial rejection. I've dallied about the court, spread my knowledge of life in the Imperial City, had my ears pierced, attended promenades, eaten and drunk of all that was given to me. I dare say I've put on a pound or two. The message we've sent is clear: it is in his, not our, best interest to meet.\"\n\"Our plan worked,\" added Basth. \"When I told his minister that our Imperial representative had arrived, and that we were at last willing to meet with the Silvenar this morning, we were told to bring you there straightaway.\"\n\"Aren't we late then?\" asked Scotti.\n\"Very,\" laughed Jurus. \"But that's again part of the angle we're representing. Benevolent disinterest. Remember not to confuse the Silvenar with conventional nobility. His is the mind of the common people. When you grasp that, you'll understand how to manipulate him.\"\nJurus spent the last several minutes of the walk through the city expounding on his theories about what Valenwood needed, how much, and at what price. They were staggering figures, far more construction and far higher costs than anything Scotti had been used to dealing with. He listened carefully. All around them, the city of Silvenar revealed itself, glass and flower, roaring winds and beautiful inertia. When they reached the palace of the Silvenar, Decumus Scotti stopped, stunned. Jurus looked at him for a moment and then laughed.\n\"It's quite bizarre, isn't it?\"\nThat it was. A frozen scarlet burst of twisted, uneven spires as if a rival sun rising. A blossom the size of a village, where courtiers and servants resembled nothing so much as insects walked about it sucking its ichor. Entering over a bent petal-like bridge, the three walked through the palace of unbalanced walls. Where the partitions bent close together and touched, there was a shaded hall or a small chamber. Where they warped away from one another, there was a courtyard. There were no doors anywhere, no any way to get to the Silvenar but by crossing through the entire spiral of the palace, through meetings and bedrooms and dining halls, past dignitaries, consorts, musicians, and many guards.\n\"It's an interesting place,\" said Basth. \"But not very much privacy. Of course, that suits the Silvenar well.\"\nWhen they reached the inner corridors, two hours after they first entered the palace, guards, brandishing blades and bows, stopped them.\n\"We have an audience with the Silvenar,\" said Jurus, patiently. \"This is Lord Decumus Scotti, the Imperial representative.\"\nOne of the guards disappeared down the winding corridor, and returned moments later with a tall, proud Bosmer clad in a loose robe of patchwork leather. He was the Minister of Trade: \"The Silvenar wishes to speak with Lord Decumus Scotti alone.\"\nIt was not the place to argue or show fear, so Scotti stepped forward, not even looking toward Jurus and Basth. He was certain they were showing their masks of benevolent indifference. Following the Minister into the audience chamber, Scotti recited to himself all the facts and figures Jurus had presented to him. He willed himself to remember the Angle and the Image he must project.\nThe audience chamber of the Silvenar was an enormous dome where the walls bent from bowl-shaped at the base inward to almost meet at the top. A thin ray of sunlight streamed through the fissure hundreds of feet above, and directly upon the Silvenar, who stood upon a puff of shimmering gray powder. For all the wonder of the city and the palace, the Silvenar himself looked perfectly ordinary. An average, blandly handsome, slightly tired-looking, extraordinary Wood Elf of the type one might see in any capitol in the Empire. It was only when he stepped from the dais that Scotti noticed an eccentricity in his appearance. He was very short.\n\"I had to speak with you alone,\" said the Silvenar in a voice common and unrefined. \"May I see your papers?\"\nScotti handed him the blank contracts from Lord Vanech's Building Commission. The Silvenar studied them, running his finger over the embossed seal of the Emperor, before handing them back. He suddenly seemed shy, looking to the floor. \"There are many charlatans at my court who wish to benefit from the wars. I thought you and your colleagues were among them, but those contracts are genuine.\"\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Scotti calmly. The Silvenar's conventional aspect made it easy for Scotti to speak, with no formal greetings, no deference, exactly as Jurus had instructed: \"It seems most sensible to begin straightaway talking about the roads which need to be rebuilt, and then the harbors that the Altmeri have destroyed, and then I can give you my estimates on the cost of resupplying and renovating the trade routes.\"\n\"Why hasn't the Emperor seen fit to send a representative when the war with Elsweyr began, two years ago?\" asked the Silvenar glumly.\nScotti thought a moment before replying of all the common Bosmeri he had met in Valenwood. The greedy, frightened mercenaries who had escorted him from the border. The hard-drinking revelers and expert pest exterminating archers in the Western Cross of Falinesti. Nosy old Mother Pascost in Havel Slump. Captain Balfix, the poor sadly reformed pirate. The terrified but hopeful refugees of Athay and Grenos. The mad, murderous, self-devouring Wild Hunt of Vindisi. The silent, dour boatmen hired by Gryf Mallon. The degenerate, grasping Basth. If one creature represented their total disposition, and that of many more throughout the province, what would be his personality? Scotti was a clerk by occupation and nature, instinctively comfortable cataloging and filing, making things fit in a system. If the soul of Valenwood were to be filed, where would it be put?\nThe answer came upon him almost before he posed himself the question. Denial.\n\"I'm afraid that question doesn't interest me,\" said Scotti. \"Now, can we get back to the business at hand?\"\nAll afternoon, Scotti and the Silvenar discussed the pressing needs of Valenwood. Every contract was filled and signed. So much was required and there were so many costs associated that addendums and codicils had to be scribbled into the margins of the papers, and those had to be resigned. Scotti maintained his benevolent indifference, but he found that dealing with the Silvenar was not quite the same as dealing with a simple, sullen child. The Voice of the People knew certain practical, everyday things very well: the yields of fish, the benefits of trade, the condition of every township and forest in his province.\n\"We will have a banquet tomorrow night to celebrate this commission,\" said the Silvenar at last.\n\"Best make it tonight,\" replied Scotti. \"We should leave for Cyrodiil with the contracts tomorrow, so I'll need a safe passage to the border. We best not waste any more time.\"\n\"Agreed,\" said the Silvenar, and called for his Minister of Trade to put his seal on the contracts and arrange for the feast.\nScotti left the chamber, and was greeted by Basth and Jurus. Their faces showed the strain of maintaining the illusion of unconcern for too many hours. As soon as they were out of sight of the guards, they begged Scotti to tell them all. When he showed them the contract, Basth began weeping with delight.\n\"Anything about the Silvenar that surprised you?\" asked Jurus.\n\"I hadn't expected him to be half my height.\"\n\"Was he?\" Jurus looked mildly surprised. \"He must have shrunk since I tried to have an audience with him earlier. Maybe there is something to all that nonsense about him being affected by the plight of his people.\"\nA Dance in Fire, Book VII.\nScene: Silvenar, Valenwood\nDate: 13 &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dusk\"&gt;Sun's Dusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"3E%20397\"&gt;3E 397&lt;/a&gt;\nThe banquet at the palace of the &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0was well attended by every jealous bureaucrat and trader who had attempted to contract the rebuilding of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. They looked on &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, and Basth with undisguised hatred. It made Scotti very uncomfortable, but Jurus delighted in it. As the servants brought in platter after platter of roasted meats, Jurus poured himself a cup of &lt;a href=\"Jagga\"&gt;Jagga&lt;/a&gt; and toasted the clerk.\n\"I can confess it now,\" said Jurus. \"I had grave doubts about inviting you to join me on this adventure. All the other clerks and agents of building commissions I contacted were more outwardly aggressive, but none of them made it through, let alone to the audience chamber of &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, let alone brokered the deals on their own like you did. Come, have a cup of Jagga with me.\"\n\"No thank you,\" said Scotti. \"I had too much of that drug in Falinesti, and nearly got sucked dry by a giant tick because of it. I'll find something else to drink.\"\nScotti wandered about the hall until he saw some diplomats drinking mugs of a steaming brown liquid, poured from a large silver urn. He asked them if it was tea.\n\"Tea made from leaves?\" scoffed the first diplomat. \"Not in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. This is &lt;a href=\"Rotmeth\"&gt;Rotmeth&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti poured himself a mug and took a tentative sip. It was gamy, bitter and sugared, and very salty. At first it seemed very disagreeable to his palate, but a moment later he found he had drained the mug and was pouring another. His body tingled. All the sounds in the chamber seemed oddly disjointed, but not frighteningly so.\n\"So you're the fellow who got the Silvenar to sign all those contracts,\" said the second diplomat. \"That must have required some deep negotiation.\"\n\"Not at all, not at all, just a little basic understand of mercantile trading,\" grinned Scotti, pouring himself a third mug of Rotmeth. \"The Silvenar was very eager to involve the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; state with the affairs of Valenwood. I was very eager to take a percentage of the commission. With all that blessed eagerness, it was merely a matter of putting quill to contract, bless you.\"\n\"You have been in the employ of his Imperial Majesty very long?\" asked the first diplomat.\n\"It's a bite, or rather, a bit more complicated than that in the Imperial City. Between you and me, I don't really have a job. I used to work for Lord Atrius and his Building Commission, but I got sacked. And then, the contracts are from Lord Vanech and his Building Commission, 'cause I got em from this fellow Reglius who is a competitor but still a very fine fellow until he was made dead by those Khajiiti,\" Scotti drained his fifth mug. \"When I go back to the Imperial City, then the real negotiations can begin, bless you. I can go to my old employer and to Lord Vanech, and say, look here you, which one of you wants these commissions? And they'll fall over each other to take them from me. It will be bidding war for my percentage the likes of which no one nowhere has never seen.\"\n\"So you're not a representative of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor?\" asked the first diplomat.\n\"Didn't you hear what I'm said? You stupid?\" Scotti felt a surge of rage, which quickly subsided. He chuckled, and poured himself a seventh mug. \"The Building Commissions are privately owned, but they're still representatives of the Emperor. So I'm a representative of the Emperor. Or I will be. When I get these contracts in. It's very complicated. I can understand why you're not following me. Bless you, it's all like the poet said, a dance in fire, if you follow the &lt;a href=\"illusion\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt;, that is to say, allusion.\"\n\"And your colleagues? Are they representatives of the Emperor?\" asked the second diplomat.\nScotti burst into laughter, shaking his head. The diplomats bade him their respects and went to talk to the Minister. Scotti stumbled out of the palace, and reeled through the strange, organic avenues and boulevards of the city. It took him several hours to find his way to &lt;a href=\"Prithala%20Hall\"&gt;Prithala Hall&lt;/a&gt; and his room. Once there, he slept, very nearly on his bed.\nThe next morning, he woke to Jurus and Basth in his room, shaking him. He felt half-asleep and unable to open his eyes fully, but otherwise fine. The conversation with the diplomats floated in his mind in a haze, like an obscure childhood memory.\n\"What in &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;'s name is Rotmeth?\" he asked quickly.\n\"Rancid, strongly fermented meat juices with lots of spices to kill the poisons,\" smiled Basth. \"I should have warned you to stay with Jagga.\"\n\"You must understand the Meat Mandate by now,\" laughed Jurus. \"These Bosmeri would rather eat each other than touch the fruit of the vine or the field.\"\n\"What did I say to those diplomats?\" cried Scotti, panicking.\n\"Nothing bad apparently,\" said Jurus, pulling out some papers. \"Your escorts are downstairs to bring you to the Imperial Province. Here are your papers of safe passage. The Silvenar seems very impatient about business proceeding forward rapidly. He promises to send you some sort of rare treasure when the contracts are fulfilled. See, he's already given me something.\"\nJurus showed off his new, bejeweled earring, a beautiful large faceted ruby. Basth showed that he had a similar one. The two fat fellows left the room so Scotti could dress and pack.\nA full regiment of the Silvenar's guards was on the street in front of the tavern. They surrounded a carriage crested with the official arms of Valenwood. Still dazed, Scotti climbed in, and the captain of the guard gave the signal. They began a quick gallop. Scotti shook himself, and then peered behind. Basth and Jurus were waving him goodbye.\n\"Wait!\" Scotti cried. \"Aren't you coming back to the Imperial Province too?\"\n\"The Silvenar asked that we stay behind as Imperial representatives!\" yelled Liodes Jurus. \"In case there's a need for more contracts and negotiations! He's appointed us Undrape, some sort of special honor for foreigners at court! Don't worry! Lots of banquets to attend! You can handle the negotiations with Vanech and Atrius yourself and we'll keep things settled here!\"\nJurus continued to yell advice about business, but his voice became indistinct with distance. Soon it disappeared altogether as the convoy rounded the streets of Silvenar. The jungle loomed suddenly and then they were in it. Scotti had only gone through it by foot or along the rivers by slow-moving boats. Now it flashed all around him in profusions of greens. The horses seemed even faster moving through underbrush than on the smooth paths of the city. None of the weird sounds or dank smells of the jungle penetrated the escort. It felt to Scotti as if he were watching a play about the jungle with a background of a quickly moving scrim, which offered only the merest suggestion of the place.\nSo it went for two weeks. There was lots of food and water in the carriage with the clerk, so he merely ate and slept as the caravan pressed endlessly on. From time to time, he'd hear the sound of blades clashing, but when he looked around whatever had attacked the caravan had long since been left behind. At last, they reached the border, where an Imperial garrison was stationed.\nScotti presented the soldiers who met the carriage with the papers. They asked him a barrage of questions that he answered monosyllabically, and then let him pass. It took several more days to arrive at the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The horses that had flown so fast through the jungle now slowed down in the unfamiliar territory of the wooded Colovian Estates. By contrast, the cries of his province's birds and smells of his province's plant life brought Decumus Scotti alive. It was if he had been dreaming all the past months.\nAt the gates of the City, Scotti's carriage door was opened for him and he stepped out on uncertain legs. Before he had a moment to say something to the escort, they had vanished, galloping back south through the forest. The first thing he did now that he was home was go to the closest tavern and have tea and fruit and bread. If he never ate meat again, he told himself, that would suit him very nicely.\nNegotiations with Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech proceeded immediately thereafter. It was most agreeable. Both commissions recognized how lucrative the rebuilding of Valenwood would be for their agency. Lord Vanech claimed, quite justifiably, that as the contracts had been written on forms notarized by his commission, he had the legal right to them. Lord Atrius claimed that Decumus Scotti was his agent and representative, and that he had never been released from employment. The Emperor was called to arbitrate, but he claimed to be unavailable. His advisor, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, had disappeared long ago and could not be called on for his wisdom and impartial mediation.\nScotti lived very comfortably off the bribes from Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech. Every week, a letter would arrive from Jurus or Basth asking about the status of negotiations. Gradually, these letters ceased coming, and more urgent ones came from the Minister of Trade and the Silvenar himself. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; with Summurset Isle ended with the Altmeri winning several new coastal islands from the Wood Elves. The war with Elsweyr continued, ravaging the eastern borders of Valenwood. Still, Vanech and Atrius fought over who would help.\nOne fine morning in the early spring of the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20398\"&gt;3E 398&lt;/a&gt;, a courier arrived at Decumus Scotti's door.\n\"Lord Vanech has won the Valenwood commission, and requests that you and the contracts come to his hall at your earliest convenience.\"\n\"Has Lord Atrius decided not to challenge further?\" asked Scotti.\n\"He's been unable to, having died very suddenly, just now, from a terribly unfortunate accident,\" said the courier.\nScotti had wondered how long it would be before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; was brought in for final negotiations. As he walked toward Lord Vanech's Building Commission, a long, severe piece of architecture on a minor but respectable plaza, he wondered if he had played the game, as he ought to have. Could Vanech be so rapacious as to offer him a lower percentage of the commission now that his chief competitor was dead? Thankfully, he discovered, Lord Vanech had already decided to pay Scotti what he had proposed during the heat of the winter negotiations. His advisors had explained to him that other, lesser building commissions might come forward unless the matter were handled quickly and fairly.\n\"Glad we have all the legal issues done with,\" said Lord Vanech, fondly. \"Now we can get to the business of helping the poor Bosmeri, and collecting the profits. It's a pity you weren't our representative for all the troubles with Bend'r-mahk and the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian business&lt;/a&gt;. But there will be plenty more wars, I'm sure of that.\"\nScotti and Lord Vanech sent word to the Silvenar that at last they were prepared to honor the contracts. A few weeks later, they held a banquet in honor of the profitable enterprise. Decumus Scotti was the darling of the Imperial City, and no expense was spared to make it an unforgettable evening.\nAs Scotti met the nobles and wealthy merchants who would be benefiting from his business dealings, an exotic but somehow faintly familiar smell rose in the ballroom. He traced it to its source: a thick roasted slab of meat, so long and thick it covered several platters. The Cyrodilic revelers were eating it ravenously, unable to find the words to express their delight at its taste and texture.\n\"It's like nothing I've ever had before!\"\n\"It's like pig-fed venison!\"\n\"Do you see the marbling of fat and meat? It's a masterpiece!\"\nScotti went to take a slice, but then he saw something imbedded deep in the dried and rendered roast. He nearly collided with his new employer Lord Vanech as he stumbled back.\n\"Where did this come from?\" Scotti stammered.\n\"From our client, the Silvenar,\" beamed his lordship. \"It's some kind of local delicacy they call Unthrappa.\"\nScotti vomited, and didn't stop for some time. It cast rather a temporary pall on the evening, but when Decumus Scotti was carried off to his manor house, the guests continued to dine. The Unthrappa was the delight of all. Even more so when Lord Vanech himself took a slice and found the first of two rubies buried within. How very clever of the Bosmer to invent such a dish, the Cyrodiils agreed."}

It had stood for two hundred and fifty years, since the reign of the &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Emperor Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, a plain-fronted and austere hall on a minor but respectable plaza in the Imperial City. Energetic and ambitious middle-class lads and ladies worked there, as well as complacent middle-aged ones like &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt;. No one could imagine a world without the Commission, least of all Scotti. To be accurate, he could not imagine a world without himself in the Commission.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Atrius\"&gt;Lord Atrius&lt;/a&gt; is perfectly aware of your contributions,\" said the managing clerk, closing the shutter that demarcated Scotti's office behind him. \"But you know that things have been difficult.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Scotti, stiffly.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Vanech\"&gt;Lord Vanech's&lt;/a&gt; men have been giving us a lot of competition lately, and we must be more efficient if we are to survive. Unfortunately, that means releasing some of our historically best but presently underachieving senior clerks.\"\n\"I understand. Can't be helped.\"\n\"I'm glad that you understand,\" smiled the managing clerk, smiling thinly and withdrawing. \"Please have your room cleared immediately.\"\nScotti began the task of organizing all his work to pass on to his successor. It would probably be young Imbrallius who would take most of it on, which was as it should be, he considered philosophically. The lad knew how to find business. Scotti wondered idly what the fellow would do with the contracts for the new statue of &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;St Alessia&lt;/a&gt; for which the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20One\"&gt;Temple of the One&lt;/a&gt; had applied. Probably invent a clerical error, blame it on his old predecessor Decumus Scotti, and require an additional cost to rectify.\n\"I have correspondence for Decumus Scotti of the &lt;a href=\"Atrius%20Building%20Commission\"&gt;Atrius Building Commission&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti looked up. A fat-faced courier had entered his office and was thrusting forth a sealed scroll. He handed the boy a gold piece, and opened it up. By the poor penmanship, atrocious spelling and grammar, and overall unprofessional tone, it was manifestly evident who the writer was. &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow clerk some years before, who had left the Commission after being accused of unethical business practices.\n\"Dear Sckotti,\nI emagine you always wondered what happened to me, and the last plase you would have expected to find me is out in the woods. But thats exactly where I am. Ha ha. If your'e smart and want to make lot of extra gold for Lord Atrius (and yourself, ha ha), youll come down to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; too. If you have'nt or have been following the politics hear lately, you may or may not know that ther's bin a war between the Boshmer and there neighbors &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; over the past two years. Things have only just calm down, and ther's a lot that needs to be rebuilt.\nNow Ive got more business than I can handle, but I need somone with some clout, someone representing a respected agencie to get the quill in the ink. That somone is you, my fiend. Come &amp; meat me at the M'ther Paskos &lt;a href=\"Tavern\"&gt;Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinnesti&lt;/a&gt;, Vallinwood. Ill be here 2 weeks and you wont be sorrie.\n-- Jurus\nP.S.: Bring a wagenload of timber if you can.\"\n\"What do you have there, Scotti?\" asked a voice.\nScotti started. It was Imbrallius, his damnably handsome face peeking through the shutters, smiling in that way that melted the hearts of the stingiest of patrons and the roughest of stonemasons. Scotti shoved the letter in his jacket pocket.\n\"Personal correspondence,\" he sniffed. \"I'll be cleared up here in a just a moment.\"\n\"I don't want to hurry you,\" said Imbrallius, grabbing a few sheets of blank contracts from Scotti's desk. \"I've just gone through a stack, and the junior scribes hands are all cramping up, so I thought you wouldn't miss a few.\"\nThe lad vanished. Scotti retrieved the letter and read it again. He thought about his life, something he rarely did. It seemed a sea of gray with a black insurmountable wall looming. There was only one narrow passage he could see in that wall. Quickly, before he had a moment to reconsider it, he grabbed a dozen of the blank contracts with the shimmering gold leaf ATRIUS BUILDING COMMISSION BY APPOINTMENT OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY and hid them in the satchel with his personal effects.\nThe next day he began his adventure with a giddy lack of hesitation. He arranged for a seat in a caravan bound for Valenwood, the single escorted conveyance to the southeast leaving the Imperial City that week. He had scarcely hours to pack, but he remembered to purchase a wagonload of timber.\n\"It will be extra gold to pay for a horse to pull that,\" frowned the convoy head.\n\"So I anticipated,\" smiled Scotti with his best Imbrallius grin.\nTen wagons in all set off that afternoon through the familiar Cyrodilic countryside. Past fields of wildflowers, gently rolling woodlands, friendly hamlets. The clop of the horses' hooves against the sound stone road reminded Scotti that the Atrius Building Commission constructed it. Five of the eighteen necessary contracts for its completion were drafted by his own hand.\n\"Very smart of you to bring that wood along,\" said a gray-whiskered &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; man next to him on his wagon. \"You must be in Commerce.\"\n\"Of a sort,\" said Scotti, in a way he hoped was mysterious, before introducing himself: \"Decumus Scotti.\"\n\"Gryf Mallon,\" said the man. \"I'm a poet, actually a translator of old Bosmer literature. I was researching some newly discovered tracts of the Mnoriad Pley Bar two years ago when the war broke out and I had to leave. You are no doubt familiar with the Mnoriad, if you're aware of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti thought the man might be speaking perfect gibberish, but he nodded his head.\n\"Naturally, I don't pretend that the Mnoriad is as renowned as the &lt;a href=\"Meh%20Ayleidion\"&gt;Meh Ayleidion&lt;/a&gt;, or as ancient as the Dansir Gol, but I think it has a remarkable significance to understanding the nature of the merelithic &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; mind. The origin of the Wood Elf aversion to cutting their own wood or eating any plant material at all, yet paradoxically their willingness to import plantstuff from other cultures, I feel can be linked to a passage in the Mnoriad,\" Mallon shuffled through some of his papers, searching for the appropriate text.\nTo Scotti's vast relief, the carriage soon stopped to camp for the night. They were high on a bluff over a gray stream, and before them was the great valley of Valenwood. Only the cry of seabirds declared the presence of the ocean to the bay to the west: here the timber was so tall and wide, twisting around itself like an impossible knot begun eons ago, to be impenetrable. A few more modest trees, only fifty feet to the lowest branches, stood on the cliff at the edge of camp. The sight was so alien to Scotti and he found himself so anxious about the proposition of entering the wilderness that he could not imagine sleeping.\nFortunately, Mallon had supposed he had found another academic with a passion for the riddles of ancient cultures. Long into the night, he recited Bosmer verse in the original and in his own translation, sobbing and bellowing and whispering wherever appropriate. Gradually, Scotti began to feel drowsy, but a sudden crack of wood snapping made him sit straight up.\n\"What was that?\"\nMallon smiled: \"I like it too. 'Convocation in the malignity of the moonless speculum, a dance of fire --'\"\n\"There are some enormous birds up in the trees moving around,\" whispered Scotti, pointing in the direction of the dark shapes above.\n\"I wouldn't worry about that,\" said Mallon, irritated with his audience. \"Now listen to how the poet characterizes &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;'s invocation in the eighteenth stanza of the fourth book.\"\nThe dark shapes in the trees were some of them perched like birds, others slithered like snakes, and still others stood up straight like men. As Mallon recited his verse, Scotti watched the figures softly leap from branch to branch, half-gliding across impossible distances for anything without wings. They gathered in groups and then reorganized until they had spread to every tree around the camp. Suddenly they plummeted from the heights.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;!\" cried Scotti. \"They're falling like rain!\"\n\"Probably seed pods,\" Mallon shrugged, not turning around. \"Some of the trees have remarkable --\"\nThe camp erupted into chaos. Fires burst out in the wagons, the horses wailed from mortal blows, casks of wine, fresh water, and liquor gushed their contents to the ground. A nimble shadow dashed past Scotti and Mallon, gathering sacks of grain and gold with impossible agility and grace. Scotti had only one glance at it, lit up by a sudden nearby burst of flame. It was a sleek creature with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur and a tail like a whip.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Werewolf\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt;,\" he whimpered, shrinking back.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-raht&lt;/a&gt;,\" groaned Mallon. \"Much worse. &lt;a href=\"Khajit\"&gt;Khajit&lt;/a&gt;i cousins or some such thing, come to plunder.\"\n\"Are you sure?\"\nAs quickly as they struck, the creatures retreated, diving off the bluff before the battlemage and knight, the caravan's escorts, had fully opened their eyes. Mallon and Scotti ran to the precipice and saw a hundred feet below the tiny figures dash out of the water, shake themselves, and disappear into the wood.\n\"Werewolves aren't acrobats like that,\" said Mallon. \"They were definitely Cathay-raht. Bastard thieves. Thank &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; they didn't realize the value of my notebooks. It wasn't a complete loss.\""}

The &lt;a href=\"Cathay-Raht\"&gt;Cathay-Raht&lt;/a&gt; had stolen or destroyed almost every item of value in the caravan in just a few minutes' time. &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti's&lt;/a&gt; wagonload of wood he had hoped to trade with the Bosmer had been set on fire and then toppled off the bluff. His clothing and contracts were tattered and ground into the mud of dirt mixed with spilt wine. All the pilgrims, merchants, and adventurers in the group moaned and wept as they gathered the remnants of their belongings by the rising sun of the dawn.\n\"I best not tell anyone that I managed to hold onto my notes for my translation of the Mnoriad Pley Bar,\" whispered the poet Gryf Mallon. \"They'd probably turn on me.\"\nScotti politely declined the opportunity of telling Mallon just how little value he himself placed on the man's property. Instead, he counted the coins in his purse. Thirty-four gold pieces. Very little indeed for an entrepreneur beginning a new business.\n\"Hoy!\" came a cry from the wood. A small party of &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the thicket, clad in leather mail and bearing arms. \"Friend or foe?\"\n\"Neither,\" growled the convoy head.\n\"You must be the &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;s,\" laughed the leader of the group, a tall skeleton-thin youth with a sharp vulpine face. \"We heard you were en route. Evidently, so did our enemies.\"\n\"I thought the war was over,\" muttered one of the caravan's now ruined merchants.\nThe Bosmer laughed again: \"No act of war. Just a little border enterprise. You are going on to &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt;?\"\n\"I'm not,\" the convoy head shook his head. \"As far as I'm concerned, my duty is done. No more horses, no more caravan. Just a fat profit loss to me.\"\nThe men and women crowded around the man, protesting, threatening, begging, but he refused to step foot in Valenwood. If these were the new times of peace, he said, he'd rather come back for the next war.\nScotti tried a different route and approached the Bosmer. He spoke with an authoritative but friendly voice, the kind he used in negotiations with peevish carpenters: \"I don't suppose you'd consider escorting me to Falinesti. I'm a representative for an important Imperial agency, the Atrius Building Commission, here to help repair and alleviate some of the problems the war with the Khajiit brought to your province. Patriotism --\"\n\"Twenty gold pieces, and you must carry your own gear if you have any left,\" replied the Bosmer.\nScotti reflected that negotiations with peevish carpenters rarely went his way either.\nSix eager people had enough gold on them for payment. Among those without funds was the poet, who appealed to Scotti for assistance.\n\"I'm sorry, Gryf, I only have fourteen gold left over. Not even enough for a decent room when I get to Falinesti. I really would help you if I could,\" said Scotti, persuading himself that it was true.\nThe band of six and their Bosmer escorts began the descent down a rocky path along the bluff. Within an hour's time, they were deep in the jungles of Valenwood. A never-ending canopy of hues of browns and greens obscured the sky. A millennia's worth of fallen leaves formed a deep, wormy sea of putrefaction beneath their feet. Several miles were crossed wading through the slime. For several more, they took a labyrinthian path across fallen branches and the low-hanging boughs of giant trees.\nAll the while, hour after hour, the inexhaustible Bosmer host moved so fast, the Cyrodiils struggled to keep from being left behind. A red-faced little merchant with short legs took a bad step on a rotten branch and nearly fell. His fellow provincials had to help him up. The Bosmer paused only a moment, their eyes continually darting to the shadows in the trees above before moving on at their usual expeditious pace.\n\"What are they so nervous about?\" wheezed the merchant irritably. \"More Cathay-Raht?\"\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" laughed the Bosmer unconvincingly. \"&lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i this far into Valenwood? In times of peace? They'd never dare.\"\nWhen the group passed high enough above the swamp that the smell was somewhat dissipated, Scotti felt a sudden pang of hunger. He was used to four meals a day in the Cyrodilic custom. Hours of nonstop exertion without food was not part of his regimen as a comfortably paid clerk. He pondered, feeling somewhat delirious, how long they had been trotting through the jungle. Twelve hours? Twenty? A week? Time was meaningless. Sunlight was only sporadic through the vegetative ceiling. Phosphorescent molds on the trees and in the muck below provided the only regular illumination.\n\"Is it at all possible for us to rest and eat?\" he hollered to his host up ahead.\n\"We're near to Falinesti,\" came the echoing reply. \"Lots of food there.\"\nThe path continued upward for several hours more across a clot of fallen logs, rising up to the first and then the second boughs of the tree line. As they rounded a long corner, the travelers found themselves midway up a waterfall that fell a hundred feet or more. No one had the energy to complain as they began pulling up the stacks of rock, agonizing foot by foot. The Bosmer escorts disappeared into the mist, but Scotti kept climbing until there was no more rock left. He wiped the sweat and river water from his eyes.\nFalinesti spread across the horizon before him. Sprawling across both banks of the river stood the mighty &lt;a href=\"graht-oak\"&gt;graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; city, with groves and orchards of lesser trees crowding it like supplicants before their king. At a lesser scale, the tree that formed the moving city would have been extraordinary: gnarled and twisted with a gorgeous crown of gold and green, dripping with vines and shining with sap. At a mile tall and half as wide, it was the most magnificent thing Scotti had ever seen. If he had not been a starving man with the soul of a clerk, he would have sung.\n\"There you are,\" said the leader of the escorts. \"Not too far a walk. You should be glad it's wintertide. In summertide, the city's on the far south end of the province.\"\nScotti was lost as to how to proceed. The sight of the vertical metropolis where people moved about like ants disoriented all his sensibilities.\n\"You wouldn't know of an inn called,\" he paused for a moment, and then pulled Jurus's letter from his pocket. \"Something like 'Mother Paskos Tavern'?\"\n\"Mother Pascost?\" the lead Bosmer laughed his familiar contemptuous laugh. \"You won't want to stay there? Visitors always prefer the &lt;a href=\"Aysia%20Hall\"&gt;Aysia Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the top boughs. It's expensive, but very nice.\"\n\"I'm meeting someone at Mother Pascost's Tavern.\"\n\"If you've made up your mind to go, take a lift to &lt;a href=\"Havel%20Slump\"&gt;Havel Slump&lt;/a&gt; and ask for directions there. Just don't get lost and fall asleep in the western cross.\"\nThis apparently struck the youth's friends as a very witty jest, and so it was with their laughter echoing behind him that Scotti crossed the writhing root system to the base of Falinesti. The ground was littered with leaves and refuse, and from moment to moment a glass or a bone would plummet from far above, so he walked with his neck crooked to have warning. An intricate network of platforms anchored to thick vines slipped up and down the slick trunk of the city with perfect grace, manned by operators with arms as thick as an ox's belly. Scotti approaches the nearest fellow at one of the platforms, who was idly smoking from a glass pipe.\n\"I was wondering if you might take me to Havel Slump.\"\nThe mer nodded and within a few minutes time, Scotti was two hundred feet in the air at a crook between two mighty branches. Curled webs of moss stretched unevenly across the fork, forming a sharing roof for several dozen small buildings. There were only a few souls in the alley, but around the bend ahead, he could hear the sound of music and people. Scotti tipped the Falinesti Platform Ferryman a gold piece and asked for the location of Mother Pascost's Tavern.\n\"Straight ahead of you, sir, but you won't find anyone there,\" the Ferryman explained, pointing in the direction of the noise. \"Morndas everyone in Havel Slump has revelry.\"\nScotti walked carefully along the narrow street. Though the ground felt as solid as the marble avenues of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, there were slick cracks in the bark that exposed fatal drops into the river. He took a moment to sit down, to rest and get used to the view from the heights. It was a beautiful day for certain, but it took Scotti only a few minutes of contemplation to rise up in alarm. A jolly little raft anchored down stream below him had distinctly moved several inches while he watched it. But it hadn't moved at all. He had. Together with everything around him. It was no metaphor: the city of Falinesti walked. And, considering its size, it moved quickly.\nScotti rose to his feet and into a cloud of smoke that drifted out from around the bend. It was the most delicious roast he had ever smelled. The clerk forgot his fear and ran.\nThe \"revelry\" as the Ferryman had termed it took place on an enormous platform tied to the tree, wide enough to be a plaza in any other city. A fantastic assortment of the most amazing people Scotti had ever seen were jammed shoulder-to-shoulder together, many eating, many more drinking, and some dancing to a lutist and singer perched on an offshoot above the crowd. They were largely Bosmer, true natives clad in colorful leather and bones, with a close minority of orcs. Whirling through the throng, dancing and bellowing at one another were a hideous ape people. A few heads bobbing over the tops of the crowd belonged not, as Scotti first assumed, to very tall people, but to a family of centaurs.\n\"Care for some mutton?\" queried a wizened old mer who roasted an enormous beast on some red-hot rocks.\nScotti quickly paid him a gold piece and devoured the leg he was given. And then another gold piece and another leg. The fellow chuckled when Scotti began choking on a piece of gristle, and handed him a mug of a frothing white drink. He drank it and felt a quiver run through his body as if he were being tickled.\n\"What is that?\" Scotti asked.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Jagga\"&gt;Jagga&lt;/a&gt;. Fermented pig's milk. I can let you have a flagon of it and a bit more mutton for another gold.\"\nScotti agreed, paid, gobbled down the meat, and took the flagon with him as he slipped into the crowd. His co-worker Liodes Jurus, the man who had told him to come to Valenwood, was nowhere to be seen. When the flagon was a quarter empty, Scotti stopped looking for Jurus. When it was half empty, he was dancing with the group, oblivious to the broken planks and gaps in the fencework. At three quarters empty, he was trading jokes with a group of creatures whose language was completely alien to him. By the time the flagon was completely drained, he was asleep, snoring, while the revelry continued on all around his supine body.\nThe next morning, still asleep, Scotti had the sensation of someone kissing him. He made a face to return the favor, but a pain like fire spread through his chest and forced him to open his eyes. There was an insect the size of a large calf sitting on him, crushing him, its spiky legs holding him down while a central spiral-bladed vortex of a mouth tore through his shirt. He screamed and thrashed but the beast was too strong. It had found its meal and it was going to finish it.\nIt's over, thought Scotti wildly, I should have never left home. I could have stayed in the City, and perhaps found work with Lord Vanech. I could have begun again as a junior clerk and worked my way back up.\nSuddenly the mouth released itself. The creature shivered once, expelled a burst of yellow bile, and died.\n\"Got one!\" cried a voice, not too distantly.\nFor a moment, Scotti lay still. His head throbbed and his chest burned. Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement. Another of the horrible monsters was scurried towards him. He scrambled, trying to push himself free, but before he could come out, there was a sound of a bow cracking and an arrow pierced the second insect.\n\"Good shot!\" cried another voice. \"Get the first one again! I just saw it move a little!\"\nThis time, Scotti felt the impact of the bolt hit the carcass. He cried out, but he could hear how muffled his voice was by the beetle's body. Cautiously, he tried sliding a foot out and rolling under, but the movement apparently had the effect of convincing the archers that the creature still lived. A volley of arrows was launched forth. Now the beast was sufficiently perforated so pools of its blood, and likely the blood of its victims, began to seep out onto Scotti's body.\nWhen Scotti was a lad, before he grew too sophisticated for such sports, he had often gone to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%2C%20Arena%20District\"&gt;Imperial Arena&lt;/a&gt; for the competitions of war. He recalled a great veteran of the fights, when asked, telling him his secret, \"Whenever I'm in doubt of what to do, and I have a shield, I stay behind it.\"\nScotti followed that advice. After an hour, when he no longer heard arrows being fired, he threw aside the remains of the bug and leapt as quickly as he could to a stand. It was not a moment too soon. A gang of eight archers had their bows pointing his direction, ready to fire. When they saw him, they laughed.\n\"Didn't anyone ever tell you not to sleep in the western cross? How're we going to exterminate all the &lt;a href=\"hoarvor\"&gt;hoarvor&lt;/a&gt;s if you drunks keep feeding 'em?\"\nScotti shook his head and walked back along the platform, round the bend, to Havel Slump. He was bloodied and torn and tired and he had far too much fermented pig's milk. All he wanted was a proper place to lie down. He stepped into Mother Pascost's Tavern, a dank place, wet with sap, smelling of mildew.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti,\" he said. \"I was hoping you have someone named Jurus staying here.\"\n\"Decumus Scotti?\" pondered the fleshy proprietress, Mother Pascost herself. \"I've heard that name. Oh, you must be the fellow he left the note for. Let me go see if I can find it.\""}

Congradulatens! Im sure you had quit a adventure getting here. Unfortunately, Im not here anymore as you probaby guess. Theres a town down rivver called Athie Im at. Git a bote and join me! Its ideal! I hope you brot a lot of contracks, cause these peple need a lot of building done. They wer close to the war, you see, but not so close they don't have any mony left to pay. Ha ha. Meat me down here as son as you can.\n-- Jurus\nSo, Scotti pondered, Jurus had left Falinesti and gone to some place called Athie. Given his poor penmanship and ghastly spelling, it could equally well be Athy, Aphy, Othry, Imthri, Urtha, or Krakamaka. The sensible thing to do, Scotti knew, was to call this adventure over and try to find some way to get back home to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. He was no mercenary devoted to a life of thrills: he was, or at least had been, a senior clerk at a successful private building commission. Over the last few weeks, he had been robbed by the &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-Raht&lt;/a&gt;, taken on a death march through the jungle by a gang of giggling Bosmeri, half-starved to death, drugged with fermented pig's milk, nearly slain by some kind of giant tick, and attacked by archers. He was filthy, exhausted, and had, he counted, ten gold pieces to his name. Now the man whose proposal brought him to the depths of misery was not even there. It was both judicious and seemly to abandon the enterprise entirely.\nAnd yet, a small but distinct voice in his head told him: You have been chosen. You have no other choice but to see this through.\nScotti turned to the stout old woman, Mother Pascost, who had been watching him curiously: \"I was wondering if you knew of a village that was at the edge of the recent conflict with Elsweyr. It's called something like Ath-ie?\"\n\"You must mean &lt;a href=\"Athay\"&gt;Athay&lt;/a&gt;,\" she grinned. \"My middle lad, Viglil, he manages a dairy down there. Beautiful country, right on the river. Is that where your friend went?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Scotti. \"Do you know the fastest way to get there?\"\nAfter a short conversation, an even shorter ride to Falinesti's roots by way of the platforms, and a jog to the river bank, Scotti was negotiating transport with a huge fair-haired Bosmer with a face like a pickled carp. He called himself Captain Balfix, but even Scotti with his sheltered life could recognize him for what he was. A retired pirate for hire, a smuggler for certain, and probably much worse. His ship, which had clearly been stolen in the distant past, was a bent old Imperial sloop.\n\"Fifty gold and we'll be in Athay in two days time,\" boomed Captain Balfix expansively.\n\"I have ten, no, sorry, nine gold pieces,\" replied Scotti, and feeling the need for explanation, added, \"I had ten, but I gave one to the Platform Ferryman to get me down here.\"\n\"Nine is just as fine,\" said the captain agreeably. \"Truth be told, I was going to Athay whether you paid me or not. Make yourself comfortable on the boat, we'll be leaving in just a few minutes.\"\nDecumus Scotti boarded the vessel, which sat low in the water of the river, stacked high with crates and sacks that spilled out of the hold and galley and onto the deck. Each was marked with stamps advertising the most innocuous substances: copper scraps, lard, ink, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; meal (marked \"For Cattle\"), tar, fish jelly. Scotti's imagination reeled picturing what sorts of illicit imports were truly aboard.\nIt took more than those few minutes for Captain Balfix to haul in the rest of his cargo, but in an hour, the anchor was up and they were sailing downriver towards Athay. The green gray water barely rippled, only touched by the fingers of the breeze. Lush plant life crowded the banks, obscuring from sight all the animals that sang and roared at one another. Lulled by the serene surroundings, Scotti drifted to sleep.\nAt night, he awoke and gratefully accepted some clean clothes and food from Captain Balfix.\n\"Why are you going to Athay, if I may ask?\" queried the Bosmer.\n\"I'm meeting a former colleague there. He asked me to come down from the Imperial City where I worked for the Atrius Building Commission to negotiate some contracts,\" Scotti took another bite of the dried sausages they were sharing for dinner. \"We're going to try to repair and refurbish whatever bridges, roads, and other structures that got damaged in the recent war with the Khajiiti.\"\n\"It's been a hard two years,\" the captain nodded his head. \"Though I suppose good for me and the likes of you and your friend. Trade routes cut off. Now they think there's going to be war with the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summurset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, you heard that?\"\nScotti shook his head.\n\"I've done my share of smuggling &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; down the coast, even helping some revolutionary types escape the Mane's wrath, but now the wars've made me a legitimate trader, a business-man. The first casualties of war is always the corrupted.\"\nScotti said he was sorry to hear that, and they lapsed into silence, watching the stars and moons' reflection on the still water. The next day, Scotti awoke to find the captain wrapped up in his sail, torpid from alcohol, singing in a low, slurred voice. When he saw Scotti rise, he offered his flagon of jagga.\n\"I learned my lesson during revelry at western cross.\"\nThe captain laughed, and then burst into tears, \"I don't want to be legitimate. Other pirates I used to know are still raping and stealing and smuggling and selling nice folk like you into slavery. I swear to you, I never thought the first time that I ran a real shipment of legal goods that my life would turn out like this. Oh, I know, I could go back to it, but &lt;a href=\"Baan%20Dar\"&gt;Baan Dar&lt;/a&gt; knows not after all I've seen. I'm a ruined man.\"\nScotti helped the weeping &lt;a href=\"mer\"&gt;mer&lt;/a&gt; out of the sail, murmuring words of reassurance. Then he added, \"Forgive me for changing the subject, but where are we?\"\n\"Oh,\" moaned Captain Balfix miserably. \"We made good time. Athay's right around the bend in the river.\"\n\"Then it looks like Athay's on fire,\" said Scotti, pointing.\nA great plume of smoke black as pitch was rising above the trees. As they drifted around the bend, they next saw the flames, and then the blackened skeletal remains of the village. Dying, blazing villagers leapt from rocks into the river. A cacophony of wailing met their ears, and they could see, roaming along the edges of the town, the figures of Khajiiti soldiers bearing torches.\n\"Baan Dar bless me!\" slurred the captain. \"The war's back on!\"\n\"Oh, no,\" whimpered Scotti.\nThe sloop drifted with the current toward the opposite shore away from the fiery town. Scotti turned his attention there, and the sanctuary it offered. Just a peaceful arbor, away from the horror. There was a shudder of leaves in two of the trees and a dozen lithe Khajiit dropped to the ground, armed with bows.\n\"They see us,\" hissed Scotti. \"And they've got bows!\"\n\"Well, of course they have bows,\" snarled Captain Balfix. \"We Bosmer may have invented the bloody things, but we didn't think to keep them secret, you bloody bureaucrat.\"\n\"Now, they're setting their arrows on fire!\"\n\"Yes, they do that sometimes.\"\n\"Captain, they're shooting at us! They're shooting at us with flaming arrows!\"\n\"Ah, so they are,\" the captain agreed. \"The aim here is to avoid being hit.\"\nBut hit they were, and very shortly thereafter. Even worse, the second volley of arrows hit the supply of pitch, which ignited in a tremendous blue blaze. Scotti grabbed Captain Balfix and they leapt overboard just before the ship and all its cargo disintegrated. The shock of the cold water brought the Bosmer into temporary sobriety. He called to Scotti, who was already swimming as fast as he could toward the bend.\n\"Master Decumus, where do you think you're swimming to?\"\n\"Back to Falinesti!\" cried Scotti.\n\"It will take you days, and by the time you get there, everyone will know about the attack on Athay! They'll never let anyone they don't know in! The closest village downriver is &lt;a href=\"Grenos\"&gt;Grenos&lt;/a&gt;, maybe they'll give us shelter!\"\nScotti swam back to the captain and side-by-side they began paddling in the middle of the river, past the burning residuum of the village. He thanked &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt; that he had learned to swim. Many a Cyrodiil did not, as largely land-locked as the Imperial Province was. Had he been raised in &lt;a href=\"Mir%20Corrup\"&gt;Mir Corrup&lt;/a&gt; or Artemon, he might have been doomed, but the Imperial City itself was encircled by water, and every lad and lass there knew how to cross without a boat. Even those who grew up to be clerks and not adventurers.\nCaptain Balfix's sobriety faded as he grew used to the water's temperature. Even in wintertide, the &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River\"&gt;Xylo River&lt;/a&gt; was fairly temperate and after a fashion, even comfortable. The Bosmer's strokes were uneven, and he'd stray closer to Scotti and then further away, pushing ahead and then falling behind.\nScotti looked to the shore to his right: the flames had caught the trees like tinder. Behind them was an inferno, with which they were barely keeping pace. To the shore on their left, all looked fair, until he saw a tremble in the river-reeds, and then what caused it. A pride of the largest cats he had ever seen. They were auburn-haired, green-eyed beasts with jaws and teeth to match his wildest nightmares. And they were watching the two swimmers, and keeping pace.\n\"Captain Balfix, we can't go to either that shore or the other one, or we'll be parboiled or eaten,\" Scotti whispered. \"Try to even your kicking and your strokes. Breath like you would normally. If you're feeling tired, tell me, and we'll float on our backs for a while.\"\nAnyone who has had the experience of giving rational advice to a drunkard would understand the hopelessness. Scotti kept pace with the captain, slowing himself, quickening, drifting left and right, while the Bosmer moaned old ditties from his pirate days. When he wasn't watching his companion, he watched the cats on the shore. After a stretch, he turned to his right. Another village had caught fire. Undoubtedly, it was Grenos. Scotti stared at the blazing fury, awed by the sight of the destruction, and did not hear that the captain had ceased to sing.\nWhen he turned back, Captain Balfix was gone.\nScotti dove into the murky depths of the river over and over again. There was nothing to be done. When he surfaced after his final search, he saw that the giant cats had moved on, perhaps assuming that he too had drowned. He continued his lonely swim downriver. A tributary, he noted, had formed a final barrier, keeping the flames from spreading further. But there were no more towns. After several hours, he began to ponder the wisdom of going ashore. Which shore was the question.\nHe was spared the decision. Ahead of him was a rocky island with a bonfire. He did not know if he were intruding on a party of Bosmeri or Khajiiti, only that he could swim no more. With straining, aching muscles, he pulled himself onto the rocks.\nThey were Bosmer refugees he gathered, even before they told him. Roasting over the fire was the remains of one of the giant cats that had been stalking him through the jungle on the opposite shore.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Senche-Tiger\"&gt;Senche-Tiger&lt;/a&gt;,\" said one of the young warriors ravenously. \"It's no animal -- it's as smart as any Cathay-Raht or &lt;a href=\"Ohmes\"&gt;Ohmes&lt;/a&gt; or any other bleeding Khajiiti. Pity this one drowned. I would have gladly killed it. You'll like the meat, though. Sweet, from all the sugar these asses eat.\"\nScotti did not know if he was capable of eating a creature as intelligent as a man or mer, but he surprised himself, as he had done several times over the last days. It was rich, succulent, and sweet, like sugared pork, but no seasonings had been added. He surveyed the crowd as he ate. A sad lot, some still weeping for lost family members. They were the survivors of both the villages of Grenos and Athay, and war was on every person's lips. Why had the Khajiiti attacked again? Why\u2014specifically directed at Scotti, as a Cyrodiil\u2014why was the Emperor not enforcing peace in his provinces?\n\"I was to meet another Cyrodiil,\" he said to a Bosmer maiden who he understood to be from Athay. \"His name was Liodes Jurus. I don't suppose you know what might have happened to him.\"\n\"I don't know your friend, but there were many Cyrodiils in Athay when the fire came,\" said the girl. \"Some of them, I think, left quickly. They were going to Vindisi, inland, in the jungle. I am going there tomorrow, so are many of us. If you wish, you may come as well.\"\nDecumus Scotti nodded solemnly. He made himself as comfortable as he could in the stony ground of the river island, and somehow, after much effort, he fell asleep. But he did not sleep well."}

For &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt;, the jungle was hostile, unfamiliar ground. The enormous vermiculated trees filled the bright morning with darkness, and resembled nothing so much as grasping claws, bent on impeding their progress. Even the fronds of the low plants quivered with malevolent energy. What was worse, he was not alone in his anxiety. His fellow travelers, the natives who had survived the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; attacks on the villages of &lt;a href=\"Grenos\"&gt;Grenos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Athay\"&gt;Athay&lt;/a&gt;, wore faces of undisguised fear.\nThere was something sentient in the jungle, and not merely the mad but benevolent indigenous spirits. In his peripheral vision, Scotti could see the shadows of the Khajiiti following the refugees, leaping from tree to tree. When he turned to face them, the lithe forms vanished into the gloom as if they had never been there. But he knew he had seen them. And the Bosmeri saw them too, and quickened their pace.\nAfter eighteen hours, bitten raw by insects, scratched by a thousand thorns, they emerged into a valley clearing. It was night, but a row of blazing &lt;a href=\"torch\"&gt;torch&lt;/a&gt;es greeted them, illuminating the leather-wrought tents and jumbled stones of the hamlet of Vindisi. At the end of the valley, the torches marked a sacred site, a gnarled bower of trees pressed closed together to form a temple. Wordlessly, the Bosmeri walked the torch arcade toward the trees. Scotti followed them. When they reached the solid mass of living wood with only one gaping portal, Scotti could see a dim blue light glowing within. A low sonorous moan from a hundred voices echoed within. The Bosmeri maiden he had been following held out her hand, stopping him.\n\"You do not understand, but no outsider, not even a friend may enter,\" she said. \"This is a holy place.\"\nScotti nodded, and watched the refugees march into the temple, heads bowed. Their voices joined with the ones within. When the last wood elf had gone inside, Scotti turned his attention back to the village. There must be food to be had somewhere. A tendril of smoke and a faint whiff of roasting venison beyond the torchlight led him.\nThey were five Cyrodiils, two &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;, the group gathered around a campfire of glowing white stones, pulling steaming strips of meat from the cadaver of a great stag. At Scotti's approach, they rose up, all but the Nord who was distracted by his hunk of animal flesh.\n\"Good evening, sorry to interrupt, but I was wondering if I might have a little something to eat. I'm afraid I'm rather hungry, after walking all day with some refugees from Grenos and Athay.\"\nThey bade him to sit down and eat, and introduced themselves.\n\"So the war's back on, it seems,\" said Scotti amiably.\n\"Best thing for these effete do-nothings,\" replied the Nord in between bites. \"I've never seen such a lazy culture. Now they've got the Khajiiti striking them on land, and the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; at sea. If there's any province that deserves a little distress, it's damnable &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"I don't see how they're so offensive to you,\" laughed one of the Bretons.\n\"They're congenital thieves, even worse than the Khajiiti because they are so blessed meek in their aggression,\" the Nord spat out a gob of fat which sizzled on the hot stones of the fire. \"They spread their forests into territory that doesn't belong to them, slowly infiltrating their neighbors, and they're puzzled when &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; shoves back at them. They're all villains of the worst order.\"\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Scotti.\n\"I'm a diplomat from the court of &lt;a href=\"Jehenna\"&gt;Jehenna&lt;/a&gt;,\" muttered the Nord, returning to his food.\n\"What about you, what are you doing here?\" asked one of the Cyrodiils.\n\"I work for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Atrius\"&gt;Lord Atrius&lt;/a&gt; building commission in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;,\" said Scotti. \"One of my former colleagues suggested that I come down to Valenwood. He said the war was over, and I could contract a great deal of business for my firm rebuilding what was lost. One disaster after another, and I've lost all my money, I'm in the middle of a rekindling of war, and I cannot find my former colleague.\"\n\"Your former colleague,\" murmured another of the Cyrodiils, who had introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Reglius\"&gt;Reglius&lt;/a&gt;. \"He wasn't by any chance named &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, was he?\"\n\"You know him?\"\n\"He lured me down to Valenwood in nearly the exact same circumstances,\" smiled Reglius, grimly. \"I worked for your employer's competitor, Lord Vanech's men, where Liodes Jurus also formerly worked. He wrote to me, asking that I represent an Imperial building commission and contract some post-war construction. I had just been released from my employment, and I thought that if I brought some new business, I could have my job back. Jurus and I met in Athay, and he said he was going to arrange a very lucrative meeting with &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti was stunned: \"Where is he now?\"\n\"I'm no theologian, so I couldn't say,\" Reglius shrugged. \"He's dead. When the Khajiiti attacked Athay, they began by torching the harbor where Jurus was readying his boat. Or, I should say, my boat since it was purchased with the gold I brought. By the time we were even aware of what was happening enough to flee, everything by the water was ash. The Khajiiti may be animals, but they know how to arrange an attack.\"\n\"I think they followed us through the jungle to Vindisi,\" said Scotti nervously. \"There was definitely a group of something jumping along the treetops.\"\n\"Probably one of the monkey folk,\" snorted the Nord. \"Nothing to be concerned about.\"\n\"When we first came to Vindisi and the Bosmeri all entered that tree, they were furious, whispering something about unleashing an ancient terror on their enemies,\" the Breton shivered, remembering. \"They've been there ever since, for over a day and a half now. If you want something to be afraid of, that's the direction to look.\"\nThe other Breton, who was a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, was staring off into the darkness while his fellow provincial spoke. \"Maybe. But there's something in the jungle too, right on the edge of the village, looking in.\"\n\"More refugees maybe?\" asked Scotti, trying to keep the alarm out his voice.\n\"Not unless they're traveling through the trees now,\" whispered the wizard. The Nord and one of the Cyrodiils grabbed a long tarp of wet leather and pulled it across the fire, instantly extinguishing it without so much as a sizzle. Now Scotti could see the intruders, their elliptical yellow eyes and long cruel blades catching the torchlight. He froze with fear, praying that he too was not so visible to them.\nHe felt something bump against his back, and gasped.\nReglius's voice hissed from up above: \"Be quiet for &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara's&lt;/a&gt; sake and climb up here.\"\nScotti grabbed hold of the knotted double-vine that hung down from a tall tree at the edge of the dead campfire. He scrambled up it as quickly as he could, holding his breath lest any grunt of exertion escape him. At the top of the vine, high above the village, was an abandoned nest from some great bird in a trident-shaped branch. As soon as Scotti had pulled himself into the soft, fragrant straw, Reglius pulled up the vine. No one else was there, and when Scotti looked down, he could see no one below. No one, that is except the Khajiiti, slowly moving toward the glow of the temple tree.\n\"Thank you,\" whispered Scotti, deeply touched that a competitor had helped him. He turned away from the village, and saw that the tree's upper branches brushed against the mossy rock walls that surrounded the valley below. \"How are you at climbing?\"\n\"You're mad,\" said Reglius under his breath. \"We should stay here until they leave.\"\n\"If they burn Vindisi like they did Athay and Grenos, we'll be dead sure as if we were on the ground,\" Scotti began the slow careful climb up the tree, testing each branch. \"Can you see what they're doing?\"\n\"I can't really tell,\" Reglius stared down into the gloom. \"They're at the front of the temple. I think they also have ... it looks like long ropes, trailing off behind them, off into the pass.\"\nScotti crawled onto the strongest branch that pointed toward the wet, rocky face of the cliff. It was not a far jump at all. So close, in fact, that he could smell the moisture and feel the coolness of the stone. But it was a jump nevertheless, and in his history as a clerk, he had never before leapt from a tree a hundred feet off the ground to a sheer rock. He pictured in his mind's eye the shadows that had pursued him through the jungle from the heights above. How their legs coiled to spring, how their arms snapped forward in an elegant fluid motion to grasp. He leapt.\nHis hands grappled for rock, but long thick cords of moss were more accessible. He held hard, but when he tried to plant his feet forward, they slipped up skyward. For a few seconds, he found himself upside down before he managed to pull himself into a more conventional position. There was a narrow outcropping jutting out of the cliff where he could stand and finally exhale.\n\"Reglius. Reglius. Reglius,\" Scotti did not dare to call out. In a minute, there was a shaking of branches, and Lord Vanech's man emerged. First his satchel, then his head, then the rest of him. Scotti started to whisper something, but Reglius shook his head violently and pointed downward. One of the Khajiiti was at the base of the tree, peering at the remains of the campfire.\nReglius awkwardly tried to balance himself on the branch, but as strong as it was it was exceedingly difficult with only one free hand. Scotti cupped his palms and then pointed at the satchel. It seemed to pain Reglius to let it out of his grasp, but he relented and tossed it to Scotti.\nThere was a small, almost invisible hole in the bag, and when Scotti caught it, a single gold coin dropped out. It rang as it bounced against the rock wall on the descent, a high soft sound that seemed like the loudest alarm Scotti had ever heard.\nThen many things happened very quickly.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cathay-raht\"&gt;Cathay-Raht&lt;/a&gt; at the base of the tree looked up and gave a loud wail. The other Khajiiti followed in chorus, as the cat below crouched down and then sprung up into the lower branches. Reglius saw it below him, climbing up with impossible dexterity, and panicked. Even before he jumped, Scotti could tell that he was going to fall. With a cry, Reglius the Clerk plunged to the ground, breaking his neck on impact.\nA flash of white fire erupted from every crevice of the temple, and the moan of the Bosmeri prayer changed into something terrible and otherworldly. The climbing Cathay-Raht stopped and stared.\n\"Keirgo,\" it gasped. \"The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIt was as if a crack in reality had opened wide. A flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous beings with the face of gods, all poured forth from the great hollow tree, blind with fury. They tore the Khajiiti in front of the temple to pieces. All the other cats fled for the jungle, but as they did so, they began pulling on the ropes they carried. In a few seconds time, the entire village of Vindisi was boiling with the lunatic apparitions of the Wild Hunt.\nOver the babbling, barking, howling horde, Scotti heard the Cyrodiils in hiding cry out as they were devoured. The Nord too was found and eaten, and both Bretons. The wizard had turned himself invisible, but the swarm did not rely on their sight. The tree the Cathay-Raht was in began to sway and rock from the impossible violence beneath it. Scotti looked at the Khajiiti's fear-struck eyes, and held out one of the cords of moss.\nThe cat's face showed its pitiful gratitude as it leapt for the vine. It didn't have time to entirely replace that expression when Scotti pulled back the cord, and watched it fall. The Hunt consumed it to the bone before it struck the ground.\nScotti's own jump up to the next outcropping of rock was immeasurably more successful. From there, he pulled himself to the top of the cliff and was able to look down into the chaos that had been the village of Vindisi. The Hunt's mass had grown and began to spill out through the pass out of the valley, pursuing the fleeing Khajiiti. It was then that the madness truly began.\nIn the moons' light, from Scotti's vantage, he could see where the Khajiiti had attached their ropes. With a thunderous boom, an avalanche of boulders poured over the pass. When the dust cleared, he saw that the valley had been sealed. The Wild Hunt had nowhere to turn but on itself.\nScotti turned his head, unable to bear to look at the cannibalistic orgy. The night jungle stood before him, a web of wood. He slung Reglius's satchel over his shoulder, and entered."}

The forest will eat love! Straight ahead! Stupid and a stupid cow!\"\nThe voice boomed out so suddenly that &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt; jumped. He stared off into the dim jungle glade from which he only heard animal and insect calls, and the low whistling of wind moments before. It was a queer, oddly accented voice of indiscriminate gender, tremulous in its modulations, but unmistakably human. Or, at very least, elven. An isolated Bosmer perhaps with a poor grasp of the Cyrodilic language. After countless hours of plodding through the dense knot of Valenwood jungle, any voice of slight familiarity sounded wondrous.\n\"Hello?\" he cried.\n\"Beetles on any names? Certainly yesterday yes!\" the voice called back. \"Who, what, and when, and mice!\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand,\" replied Scotti, turning toward the brambled tree, thick as a wagon, where the voice had issued. \"But you needn't be afraid of me. My name is Decumus Scotti. I'm a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. I came here to help rebuild &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost.\"\n\"Gemstones and grilled slaves ... The war,\" moaned the voice and broke down into sobs.\n\"You know about the war? I wasn't sure, I wasn't even sure how far away from the border I am now,\" Scotti began slowly walking toward the tree. He dropped Reglius's satchel to the ground, and held out his empty hands. \"I'm unarmed. I only want to know the way to the closest town. I'm trying to meet my friend, &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Silvenar!\" the voice laughed. It laughed even louder as Scotti circled the tree. \"Worms and wine! Worms and wine! Silvenar sings for worms and wine!\"\nThere was nothing to be found anywhere around the tree. \"I don't see you. Why are you hiding?\"\nIn frustration born of hunger and exhaustion, he struck the tree trunk. A sudden shiver of gold and red erupted from a hollow nook above, and Scotti was surrounded by six winged creatures scarcely more than a few inches long. Bright crimson eyes were set on either side of tunnel-like protuberances, the animals' always open mouths. They were legless, and their thin, rapidly beating, aureate wings seemed poorly constructed to transport their fat, swollen bellies. And yet, they darted through the air like sparks from a fire. Whirling about the poor clerk, they began chattering what he now understood to be perfect nonsense.\n\"Wines and worms, how far from the border am I! Academic garnishments, and alas, Liodes Jurus!\"\n\"Hello, I'm afraid I'm unarmed? Smoken flames and the closest town is dear &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Swollen on bad meat, an indigo nimbus, but you needn't be afraid of me!\"\n\"Why are you hiding? Why are you hiding? Before I begin to friend, love me, Lady Zuleika!\"\nFurious with the mimics, Scotti swung his arms, driving them up into the treetops. He stomped back to the clearing and opened up the satchel again, as he had done some hours before. There was still, unsurprisingly, nothing useful in the bag, and nothing to eat in any corner or pocket. A goodly amount of gold (he smiled grimly, as he had done before, at the irony of being financially solvent in the jungle), a stack of neat blank contracts from Lord Vanech's building commission, some thin cord, and an oiled leather cloak for bad weather. At least, Scotti considered, he had not suffered rain.\nA rolling moan of thunder reminded Scotti of what he had suspected for some weeks now. He was cursed.\nWithin an hour's time, he was wearing the cloak and clawing his way through mud. The trees, which had earlier allowed no sunlight in, provided no shelter against the pounding storm and wind. The only sounds that pierced the pelting of the rain were the mocking calls of the flying creatures, flitting just above, babbling their nonsense. Scotti bellowed at them, threw rocks, but they seemed enamored of his company.\nWhile he was reaching to grab a promising looking stone to hurl at his tormentors, Scotti felt something shift beneath his feet. Wet but solid ground suddenly liquefied and became a rolling tide, rushing him forward. Light as a leaf, he flew head over feet over head, until the mudflow dropped and he continued forward, plunging down into a river twenty-five feet below.\nThe storm passed quite as instantly as it had arrived. The sun melted the dark clouds and warmed Scotti as he swam for the shore. There, another sign of the Khajiiti incursion into Valenwood greeted him. A small fishing village had stood there once, so recently extinct that it smoldered like a still-warm corpse. Dirt cairns that had once housed fish by the smell of them had been ravaged, their bounty turned to ash. Rafts and skiffs lay broken, scuttled, half-submerged. All the villagers were no more, either dead or refugees far away. Or so he presumed. Something banged against the wall of one of the ruins. Scotti ran to investigate.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti?\" sang the first winged beast. \"I'm a Cyrodiil from? The Imperial City? I came here to help rebuild Valenwood after the war, you see, and now I'm rather lost?\"\n\"I swell to maculate, apeneck!\" agreed one of its companions. \"I don't see you. Why are you hiding?\"\nAs they fell into chattering, Scotti began to search the rest of the village. Surely the cats had left something behind, a scrap of dried meat, a morsel of fish sausage, anything. But they had been immaculate in their complete annihilation. There was nothing to eat anywhere. Scotti did find one item of possible use under the tumbled remains of a stone hut. A bow and two arrows made of bone. The string had been lost, likely burned away in the heat of the fire, but he pulled the cord from Reglius's satchel and restrung it.\nThe creatures flew over and hovered nearby as he worked: \"The convent of the sacred Liodes Jurus?\"\n\"You know about the war! Worms and wine, circumscribe a golden host, apeneck!\"\nThe moment the cord was taut, Scotti nocked an arrow and swung around, pulling the string tight against his chest. The winged beasts, having had experience with archers before, shot off in all directions in a blur. They needn't have bothered. Scotti's first arrow dove into the ground three feet in front of him. He swore and retrieved it. The mimics, having likewise had experience with poor archers before, returned at once to hovering nearby and mocking Scotti.\nOn his second shot, Scotti did much better, in purely technical terms. He remembered how the archers in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; looked when he pulled himself out from under the hoarvor tick, and they were all taking aim at him. He extended his left hand, right hand, and right elbow in a symmetrical line, drawing the bow so his hand touched his jawline, and he could see the creature in his sight like the arrow was a finger he was pointing with. The bolt missed the target by only two feet, but it continued on its trajectory, snapping when it struck a rock wall.\nScotti walked to the river's edge. He had only one arrow left, and perhaps, he considered, it would be most practical to find a slow-moving fish and fire it on that. If he missed, at least there was less of a chance of breaking the shaft, and he could always retrieve it from the water. A rather torpid, whiskered fish rolled by, and he took aim at it.\n\"My name is Decumus Scotti!\" one of the creatures howled, frightening the fish away. \"Stupid and a stupid cow! Will you dance a dance in fire!\"\nScotti turned and aimed the arrow as he had done before. This time, however, he remembered to plant his feet as the archers had done, seven inches apart, knees straight, left leg slightly forward to meet the angle of his right shoulder. He released the last arrow.\nThe arrow also proved a serviceable prong for roasting the creature against the smoking hot stones of one of the ruins. Its other companions had disappeared instantly after the beast was slain, and Scotti was able to dine in peace. The meat proved to be delicious, if scarcely more than a first course. He was picking the last of it from the bones, when a boat sailed into view from around the bend of the river. At the helm were &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; sailors. Scotti ran to the bank and waved his arms. They averted their eyes and continued past.\n\"You bloody, callous bastards!\" Scotti howled. \"Knaves! Hooligans! Apenecks! Scoundrels!\"\nA gray-whiskered form came out from a hatch, and Scotti immediately recognized him as Gryf Mallon, the poet translator he had met in the caravan from Cyrodiil.\nHe peered Scotti's direction, and his eyes lit up with delight, \"Decumus Scotti! Precisely the man I hoped to see! I want to get your thoughts on a rather puzzling passage in the Mnoriad Pley Bar! It begins 'I went weeping into the world, searching for wonders,' perhaps you're familiar with it?\"\n\"I'd like nothing better than to discuss the Mnoriad Pley Bar with you, Gryf!\" Scotti called back. \"Would you let me come aboard though first?\"\nOverjoyed at being on a ship bound for any port at all, Scotti was true to his word. For over an hour as the boat rolled down the river past the blackened remnants of Bosmeri villages, he asked no questions and spoke nothing of his life over the past weeks: he merely listened to Mallon's theories of merethic &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt;i esoterica. The translator was undemanding of his guest's scholarship, accepting nods and shrugs as civilized conversation. He even produced some wine and fish jelly, which he shared with Scotti absent-mindedly, as he expounded on his various theses.\nFinally, while Mallon was searching for a reference to some minor point in his notes, Scotti asked, \"Rather off subject, but I was wondering where we're bound.\"\n\"The very heart of the province, Silvenar,\" Mallon said, not looking up from the passage he was reading. \"It's somewhat bothersome, actually, as I wanted to go to &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth\"&gt;Woodhearth&lt;/a&gt; first to talk to a Bosmer there who claims to have an original copy of Dirith Yalmillhiad, if you can believe it. But for the time being, that has to wait. Summurset Isle has surrounded the city, and is in the process of starving the citizenry until they surrender. It's a tiresome prospect, since the Bosmeri are happy to eat one another, so there's a risk that at the end, only one fat wood elf will remain to wave the flag.\"\n\"That is vexing,\" agreed Scotti, sympathetically. \"To the east, the Khajiiti are burning everything, and to the west, the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; are waging war. I don't suppose the borders to the north are clear?\"\n\"They're even worse,\" replied Mallon, finger on the page, still distracted. \"The &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Cyrodiils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;[1] don't want Bosmer refugees streaming into their provinces. It only stands to reason. Imagine how much more criminally inclined they'd be now that they're homeless and hungry.\"\n\"So,\" murmured Scotti, feeling a shiver. \"We're trapped in Valenwood.\"\n\"Not at all. I need to leave fairly shortly myself, as my publisher has set a very definite deadline for my new book of translations. From what I understand, one merely petitions to &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; for special border protection and one can cross into Cyrodiil with impunity.\"\n\"Petition the Silvenar, or petition at Silvenar?\"\n\"Petition the Silvenar at Silvenar. It's an odd nomenclature that is typical of this place, the sort of thing that makes my job as a translator that much more challenging. The Silvenar, he, or rather they are the closest the Bosmeri have to a great leader. The essential thing to remember about the Silvenar --\" Mallon smiled, finding the passage he was looking for, \"Here! 'A fortnight, inexplicable, the world burns into a dance.' There's that metaphor again.\"\n\"What were you saying about the Silvenar?\" asked Scotti. \"The essential thing to remember?\"\n\"I don't remember what I was saying,\" replied Mallon, turning back to his oration.\nIn a week's time, the little boat bumped along the shallow, calmer waters of the foaming current the Xylo had become, and Decumus Scotti first saw the city of Silvenar. If Falinesti was a tree, then Silvenar was a flower. A magnificent pile of faded shades of green, red, blue, and white, shining with crystalline residue. Mallon had mentioned off-hand, when not otherwise explaining Aldmeri prosody, that Silvenar had once been a blossoming glade in the forest, but owing to some spell or natural cause, the trees' sap began flowing with translucent liqueur. The process of the sap flowing and hardening over the colorful trees had formed the web of the city. Mallon's description was intriguing, but it hardly prepared him for the city's beauty.\n\"What is the finest, most luxurious tavern here?\" Scotti asked one of the Bosmer boatmen.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Prithala%20Hall\"&gt;Prithala Hall&lt;/a&gt;,\" Mallon answered. \"But why don't you stay with me? I'm visiting an acquaintance of mine, a scholar I think you'll find fascinating. His hovel isn't much, but he has the most extraordinary ideas about the principles of a Merethic Aldmeri tribe the Sarmathi --\"\n\"Under any other circumstances, I would happily accept,\" said Scotti graciously. \"But after weeks of sleeping on the ground or on a raft, and eating whatever I could scrounge, I feel the need for some indulgent creature comforts. And then, after a day or two, I'll petition the Silvenar for safe passage to Cyrodiil.\"\nThe men bade each other goodbye. Gryf Mallon gave him the address of his publisher in the Imperial City, which Scotti accepted and quickly forgot. The clerk wandered the streets of Silvenar, crossing bridges of amber, admiring the petrified forest architecture. In front of a particularly estimable palace of silvery reflective crystal, he found Prithala Hall.\nHe took the finest room, and ordered a gluttonous meal of the finest quality. At a nearby table, he saw two very fat fellows, a man and a Bosmer, remarking how much finer the food was there than at the Silvenar's palace. They began to discuss the war and some issues of finances and rebuilding provincial bridges. The man noticed Scotti looking at them, and his eyes flashed recognition.\n\"Scotti, is that you? &lt;a href=\"Kynareth\"&gt;Kynareth&lt;/a&gt;, where have you been? I've had to make all the contacts here on my own!\"\nAt the sound of his voice, Scotti recognized him. The fat man was Liodes Jurus, vastly engorged."}

The clerk could hardly believe how fat his former colleague at Lord Atrius's Building Commission had become. The piquant aroma of the roasted meat dish before Scotti melted away. All the other sounds and textures of &lt;a href=\"Prithala%20Hall\"&gt;Prithala Hall&lt;/a&gt; vanished all around him, as if nothing else existed but the vast form of Jurus. Scotti did not consider himself an emotional man, but he felt a tide flow over him at the sight and sound of the man whose badly written letters had been the guideposts that carried him from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; back in early &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frost Fall&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Where have you been?\" Jurus demanded again. \"I told you to meet me in &lt;a href=\"Falinesti\"&gt;Falinesti&lt;/a&gt; weeks ago.\"\n\"I was there weeks ago,\" Scotti stammered, too surprised to be indignant. \"I got your note to meet you in &lt;a href=\"Athay\"&gt;Athay&lt;/a&gt;, and so I went there, but the Khajiiti had burned it to the ground. Somehow, I found my way with the refugees in another village, and someone there told me that you had been killed.\"\n\"And you believed that right away?\" Jurus sneered.\n\"The fellow seemed very well-informed about you. He was a clerk from Lord Vanech's Building Commission named &lt;a href=\"Reglius\"&gt;Reglius&lt;/a&gt;, and he said that you had also suggested that he come down to Valenwood to profit from the war.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Jurus, after thinking a moment. \"I recall the name now. Well, it's good for business to have two representatives from Imperial building commissions here. We just need to all coordinate our bids, and all should be well.\"\n\"Reglius is dead,\" said Scotti. \"But I have his contracts from Lord Vanech's Commission.\"\n\"Even better,\" gasped Jurus, impressed. \"I never knew you were such a ruthless competitor, Decumus Scotti. Yes, this could certainly improve our position with &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;. Have I introduced you to &lt;a href=\"Basth\"&gt;Basth&lt;/a&gt; here?\"\nScotti had only been dimly aware of the Bosmer's presence at the table with Jurus, which was surprising given that the mer's girth nearly equaled his dining companion. The clerk nodded to Basth coldly, still numb and confused. It had not left his mind that only any hour earlier, Scotti had intended to petition the Silvenar for safe passage through the border back to Cyrodiil. The thought of doing business with Jurus after all, of profiting from &lt;a href=\"Five%20Year%20War\"&gt;Valenwood war with Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;, and now the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;second one&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt;, seemed like something happening to another person.\n\"Your colleague and I were talking about the Silvenar,\" said Basth, putting down the leg of mutton he had been gnawing on. \"I don't suppose you've heard about his nature?\"\n\"A little, but nothing very specific. I got the impression that he's very important and very peculiar.\"\n\"He's the representative of the People, legally, physically, and emotionally,\" explained Jurus, a little annoyed at his new partner's lack of common knowledge. \"When they're healthy, so is he. When they're mostly female, so is he. When they cry for food or trade or an absence of foreign interference, he feels it too, and makes laws accordingly. In a way, he's a despot, but he's the people's despot.\"\n\"That sounds,\" said Scotti, searching for the appropriate word. \"Like ... bunk.\"\n\"Perhaps it is,\" shrugged Basth. \"But he has many rights as the Voice of the People, including the granting of foreign building and trade contracts. It's not important whether you believe us. Just think of the Silvenar as being like one of your mad Emperors, like &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius&lt;/a&gt;. The problem facing us now is that since Valenwood is being attacked on all sides, the Silvenar's aspect is now one of distrust and fear of foreigners. The one hope of his people, and thus of the Silvenar himself, is that the Emperor will intervene and stop the war.\"\n\"Will he?\" asked Scotti.\n\"You know as well as we do that the Emperor has not been himself lately,\" Jurus helped himself to Reglius's satchel and pulled out the blank contracts. \"Who knows what he'll choose to do or not do? That reality is not our concern, but these blessings from the late good sir Reglius make our job much simpler.\"\nThey discussed how they would represent themselves to the Silvenar into the evening. Scotti ate continuously, but not nearly so much as Jurus and Basth. When the sun had begun to rise in the hills, its light reddening through the crystal walls of the tavern, Jurus and Basth left to their rooms at the palace, granted to them diplomatically in lieu of an actual immediate audience with the Silvenar. Scotti went to his room. He thought about staying up a little longer to ruminate over Jurus's plans and see what might be the flaw in them, but upon touching the cool, soft bed, he immediately fell asleep.\nThe next afternoon, Scotti awoke, feeling himself again. In other words, timid. For several weeks now, he had been a creature bent on mere survival. He had been driven to exhaustion, attacked by several jungle beasts, starved, nearly drowned, and forced into discussions of ancient Aldmeri poetical works. The discussion he had with Jurus and Basth about how to dupe the Silvenar into signing their contracts seemed perfectly reasonable then. Scotti dressed himself in his old battered clothes and went downstairs in search of food and a peaceful place to think.\n\"You're up,\" cried Basth upon seeing him. \"We should go to the palace now.\"\n\"Now?\" whined Scotti. \"Look at me. I need new clothes. This isn't the way one should dress to pay a call on a prostitute, let alone the Voice of the People of Valenwood. I haven't even bathed.\"\n\"You must cease from this moment forward being a clerk, and become a student of mercantile trade,\" said Liodes Jurus grandly, taking Scotti by the arm and leading him into the sunlit boulevard outside. \"The first rule is to recognize what you represent to the prospective client, and what angle best suits you. You cannot dazzle him with opulent fashion and professional bearing, my dear boy, and it would be fatal if you attempted to. Trust me on this. Several others besides Basth and I are guests at the palace, and they have made the error of appearing too eager, too formal, too ready for business. They will never be granted audience with the Silvenar, but we have remained aloof ever since the initial rejection. I've dallied about the court, spread my knowledge of life in the Imperial City, had my ears pierced, attended promenades, eaten and drunk of all that was given to me. I dare say I've put on a pound or two. The message we've sent is clear: it is in his, not our, best interest to meet.\"\n\"Our plan worked,\" added Basth. \"When I told his minister that our Imperial representative had arrived, and that we were at last willing to meet with the Silvenar this morning, we were told to bring you there straightaway.\"\n\"Aren't we late then?\" asked Scotti.\n\"Very,\" laughed Jurus. \"But that's again part of the angle we're representing. Benevolent disinterest. Remember not to confuse the Silvenar with conventional nobility. His is the mind of the common people. When you grasp that, you'll understand how to manipulate him.\"\nJurus spent the last several minutes of the walk through the city expounding on his theories about what Valenwood needed, how much, and at what price. They were staggering figures, far more construction and far higher costs than anything Scotti had been used to dealing with. He listened carefully. All around them, the city of Silvenar revealed itself, glass and flower, roaring winds and beautiful inertia. When they reached the palace of the Silvenar, Decumus Scotti stopped, stunned. Jurus looked at him for a moment and then laughed.\n\"It's quite bizarre, isn't it?\"\nThat it was. A frozen scarlet burst of twisted, uneven spires as if a rival sun rising. A blossom the size of a village, where courtiers and servants resembled nothing so much as insects walked about it sucking its ichor. Entering over a bent petal-like bridge, the three walked through the palace of unbalanced walls. Where the partitions bent close together and touched, there was a shaded hall or a small chamber. Where they warped away from one another, there was a courtyard. There were no doors anywhere, no any way to get to the Silvenar but by crossing through the entire spiral of the palace, through meetings and bedrooms and dining halls, past dignitaries, consorts, musicians, and many guards.\n\"It's an interesting place,\" said Basth. \"But not very much privacy. Of course, that suits the Silvenar well.\"\nWhen they reached the inner corridors, two hours after they first entered the palace, guards, brandishing blades and bows, stopped them.\n\"We have an audience with the Silvenar,\" said Jurus, patiently. \"This is Lord Decumus Scotti, the Imperial representative.\"\nOne of the guards disappeared down the winding corridor, and returned moments later with a tall, proud Bosmer clad in a loose robe of patchwork leather. He was the Minister of Trade: \"The Silvenar wishes to speak with Lord Decumus Scotti alone.\"\nIt was not the place to argue or show fear, so Scotti stepped forward, not even looking toward Jurus and Basth. He was certain they were showing their masks of benevolent indifference. Following the Minister into the audience chamber, Scotti recited to himself all the facts and figures Jurus had presented to him. He willed himself to remember the Angle and the Image he must project.\nThe audience chamber of the Silvenar was an enormous dome where the walls bent from bowl-shaped at the base inward to almost meet at the top. A thin ray of sunlight streamed through the fissure hundreds of feet above, and directly upon the Silvenar, who stood upon a puff of shimmering gray powder. For all the wonder of the city and the palace, the Silvenar himself looked perfectly ordinary. An average, blandly handsome, slightly tired-looking, extraordinary Wood Elf of the type one might see in any capitol in the Empire. It was only when he stepped from the dais that Scotti noticed an eccentricity in his appearance. He was very short.\n\"I had to speak with you alone,\" said the Silvenar in a voice common and unrefined. \"May I see your papers?\"\nScotti handed him the blank contracts from Lord Vanech's Building Commission. The Silvenar studied them, running his finger over the embossed seal of the Emperor, before handing them back. He suddenly seemed shy, looking to the floor. \"There are many charlatans at my court who wish to benefit from the wars. I thought you and your colleagues were among them, but those contracts are genuine.\"\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Scotti calmly. The Silvenar's conventional aspect made it easy for Scotti to speak, with no formal greetings, no deference, exactly as Jurus had instructed: \"It seems most sensible to begin straightaway talking about the roads which need to be rebuilt, and then the harbors that the Altmeri have destroyed, and then I can give you my estimates on the cost of resupplying and renovating the trade routes.\"\n\"Why hasn't the Emperor seen fit to send a representative when the war with Elsweyr began, two years ago?\" asked the Silvenar glumly.\nScotti thought a moment before replying of all the common Bosmeri he had met in Valenwood. The greedy, frightened mercenaries who had escorted him from the border. The hard-drinking revelers and expert pest exterminating archers in the Western Cross of Falinesti. Nosy old Mother Pascost in Havel Slump. Captain Balfix, the poor sadly reformed pirate. The terrified but hopeful refugees of Athay and Grenos. The mad, murderous, self-devouring Wild Hunt of Vindisi. The silent, dour boatmen hired by Gryf Mallon. The degenerate, grasping Basth. If one creature represented their total disposition, and that of many more throughout the province, what would be his personality? Scotti was a clerk by occupation and nature, instinctively comfortable cataloging and filing, making things fit in a system. If the soul of Valenwood were to be filed, where would it be put?\nThe answer came upon him almost before he posed himself the question. Denial.\n\"I'm afraid that question doesn't interest me,\" said Scotti. \"Now, can we get back to the business at hand?\"\nAll afternoon, Scotti and the Silvenar discussed the pressing needs of Valenwood. Every contract was filled and signed. So much was required and there were so many costs associated that addendums and codicils had to be scribbled into the margins of the papers, and those had to be resigned. Scotti maintained his benevolent indifference, but he found that dealing with the Silvenar was not quite the same as dealing with a simple, sullen child. The Voice of the People knew certain practical, everyday things very well: the yields of fish, the benefits of trade, the condition of every township and forest in his province.\n\"We will have a banquet tomorrow night to celebrate this commission,\" said the Silvenar at last.\n\"Best make it tonight,\" replied Scotti. \"We should leave for Cyrodiil with the contracts tomorrow, so I'll need a safe passage to the border. We best not waste any more time.\"\n\"Agreed,\" said the Silvenar, and called for his Minister of Trade to put his seal on the contracts and arrange for the feast.\nScotti left the chamber, and was greeted by Basth and Jurus. Their faces showed the strain of maintaining the illusion of unconcern for too many hours. As soon as they were out of sight of the guards, they begged Scotti to tell them all. When he showed them the contract, Basth began weeping with delight.\n\"Anything about the Silvenar that surprised you?\" asked Jurus.\n\"I hadn't expected him to be half my height.\"\n\"Was he?\" Jurus looked mildly surprised. \"He must have shrunk since I tried to have an audience with him earlier. Maybe there is something to all that nonsense about him being affected by the plight of his people.\""}

They looked on &lt;a href=\"Decumus%20Scotti\"&gt;Decumus Scotti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liodes%20Jurus\"&gt;Liodes Jurus&lt;/a&gt;, and Basth with undisguised hatred. It made Scotti very uncomfortable, but Jurus delighted in it. As the servants brought in platter after platter of roasted meats, Jurus poured himself a cup of &lt;a href=\"Jagga\"&gt;Jagga&lt;/a&gt; and toasted the clerk.\n\"I can confess it now,\" said Jurus. \"I had grave doubts about inviting you to join me on this adventure. All the other clerks and agents of building commissions I contacted were more outwardly aggressive, but none of them made it through, let alone to the audience chamber of &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, let alone brokered the deals on their own like you did. Come, have a cup of Jagga with me.\"\n\"No thank you,\" said Scotti. \"I had too much of that drug in Falinesti, and nearly got sucked dry by a giant tick because of it. I'll find something else to drink.\"\nScotti wandered about the hall until he saw some diplomats drinking mugs of a steaming brown liquid, poured from a large silver urn. He asked them if it was tea.\n\"Tea made from leaves?\" scoffed the first diplomat. \"Not in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;. This is &lt;a href=\"Rotmeth\"&gt;Rotmeth&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nScotti poured himself a mug and took a tentative sip. It was gamy, bitter and sugared, and very salty. At first it seemed very disagreeable to his palate, but a moment later he found he had drained the mug and was pouring another. His body tingled. All the sounds in the chamber seemed oddly disjointed, but not frighteningly so.\n\"So you're the fellow who got the Silvenar to sign all those contracts,\" said the second diplomat. \"That must have required some deep negotiation.\"\n\"Not at all, not at all, just a little basic understand of mercantile trading,\" grinned Scotti, pouring himself a third mug of Rotmeth. \"The Silvenar was very eager to involve the &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; state with the affairs of Valenwood. I was very eager to take a percentage of the commission. With all that blessed eagerness, it was merely a matter of putting quill to contract, bless you.\"\n\"You have been in the employ of his Imperial Majesty very long?\" asked the first diplomat.\n\"It's a bite, or rather, a bit more complicated than that in the Imperial City. Between you and me, I don't really have a job. I used to work for Lord Atrius and his Building Commission, but I got sacked. And then, the contracts are from Lord Vanech and his Building Commission, 'cause I got em from this fellow Reglius who is a competitor but still a very fine fellow until he was made dead by those Khajiiti,\" Scotti drained his fifth mug. \"When I go back to the Imperial City, then the real negotiations can begin, bless you. I can go to my old employer and to Lord Vanech, and say, look here you, which one of you wants these commissions? And they'll fall over each other to take them from me. It will be bidding war for my percentage the likes of which no one nowhere has never seen.\"\n\"So you're not a representative of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor?\" asked the first diplomat.\n\"Didn't you hear what I'm said? You stupid?\" Scotti felt a surge of rage, which quickly subsided. He chuckled, and poured himself a seventh mug. \"The Building Commissions are privately owned, but they're still representatives of the Emperor. So I'm a representative of the Emperor. Or I will be. When I get these contracts in. It's very complicated. I can understand why you're not following me. Bless you, it's all like the poet said, a dance in fire, if you follow the &lt;a href=\"illusion\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt;, that is to say, allusion.\"\n\"And your colleagues? Are they representatives of the Emperor?\" asked the second diplomat.\nScotti burst into laughter, shaking his head. The diplomats bade him their respects and went to talk to the Minister. Scotti stumbled out of the palace, and reeled through the strange, organic avenues and boulevards of the city. It took him several hours to find his way to &lt;a href=\"Prithala%20Hall\"&gt;Prithala Hall&lt;/a&gt; and his room. Once there, he slept, very nearly on his bed.\nThe next morning, he woke to Jurus and Basth in his room, shaking him. He felt half-asleep and unable to open his eyes fully, but otherwise fine. The conversation with the diplomats floated in his mind in a haze, like an obscure childhood memory.\n\"What in &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;'s name is Rotmeth?\" he asked quickly.\n\"Rancid, strongly fermented meat juices with lots of spices to kill the poisons,\" smiled Basth. \"I should have warned you to stay with Jagga.\"\n\"You must understand the Meat Mandate by now,\" laughed Jurus. \"These Bosmeri would rather eat each other than touch the fruit of the vine or the field.\"\n\"What did I say to those diplomats?\" cried Scotti, panicking.\n\"Nothing bad apparently,\" said Jurus, pulling out some papers. \"Your escorts are downstairs to bring you to the Imperial Province. Here are your papers of safe passage. The Silvenar seems very impatient about business proceeding forward rapidly. He promises to send you some sort of rare treasure when the contracts are fulfilled. See, he's already given me something.\"\nJurus showed off his new, bejeweled earring, a beautiful large faceted ruby. Basth showed that he had a similar one. The two fat fellows left the room so Scotti could dress and pack.\nA full regiment of the Silvenar's guards was on the street in front of the tavern. They surrounded a carriage crested with the official arms of Valenwood. Still dazed, Scotti climbed in, and the captain of the guard gave the signal. They began a quick gallop. Scotti shook himself, and then peered behind. Basth and Jurus were waving him goodbye.\n\"Wait!\" Scotti cried. \"Aren't you coming back to the Imperial Province too?\"\n\"The Silvenar asked that we stay behind as Imperial representatives!\" yelled Liodes Jurus. \"In case there's a need for more contracts and negotiations! He's appointed us Undrape, some sort of special honor for foreigners at court! Don't worry! Lots of banquets to attend! You can handle the negotiations with Vanech and Atrius yourself and we'll keep things settled here!\"\nJurus continued to yell advice about business, but his voice became indistinct with distance. Soon it disappeared altogether as the convoy rounded the streets of Silvenar. The jungle loomed suddenly and then they were in it. Scotti had only gone through it by foot or along the rivers by slow-moving boats. Now it flashed all around him in profusions of greens. The horses seemed even faster moving through underbrush than on the smooth paths of the city. None of the weird sounds or dank smells of the jungle penetrated the escort. It felt to Scotti as if he were watching a play about the jungle with a background of a quickly moving scrim, which offered only the merest suggestion of the place.\nSo it went for two weeks. There was lots of food and water in the carriage with the clerk, so he merely ate and slept as the caravan pressed endlessly on. From time to time, he'd hear the sound of blades clashing, but when he looked around whatever had attacked the caravan had long since been left behind. At last, they reached the border, where an Imperial garrison was stationed.\nScotti presented the soldiers who met the carriage with the papers. They asked him a barrage of questions that he answered monosyllabically, and then let him pass. It took several more days to arrive at the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. The horses that had flown so fast through the jungle now slowed down in the unfamiliar territory of the wooded Colovian Estates. By contrast, the cries of his province's birds and smells of his province's plant life brought Decumus Scotti alive. It was if he had been dreaming all the past months.\nAt the gates of the City, Scotti's carriage door was opened for him and he stepped out on uncertain legs. Before he had a moment to say something to the escort, they had vanished, galloping back south through the forest. The first thing he did now that he was home was go to the closest tavern and have tea and fruit and bread. If he never ate meat again, he told himself, that would suit him very nicely.\nNegotiations with Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech proceeded immediately thereafter. It was most agreeable. Both commissions recognized how lucrative the rebuilding of Valenwood would be for their agency. Lord Vanech claimed, quite justifiably, that as the contracts had been written on forms notarized by his commission, he had the legal right to them. Lord Atrius claimed that Decumus Scotti was his agent and representative, and that he had never been released from employment. The Emperor was called to arbitrate, but he claimed to be unavailable. His advisor, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Battlemage\"&gt;Imperial Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, had disappeared long ago and could not be called on for his wisdom and impartial mediation.\nScotti lived very comfortably off the bribes from Lord Atrius and Lord Vanech. Every week, a letter would arrive from Jurus or Basth asking about the status of negotiations. Gradually, these letters ceased coming, and more urgent ones came from the Minister of Trade and the Silvenar himself. The &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;War of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; with Summurset Isle ended with the Altmeri winning several new coastal islands from the Wood Elves. The war with Elsweyr continued, ravaging the eastern borders of Valenwood. Still, Vanech and Atrius fought over who would help.\nOne fine morning in the early spring of the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20398\"&gt;3E 398&lt;/a&gt;, a courier arrived at Decumus Scotti's door.\n\"Lord Vanech has won the Valenwood commission, and requests that you and the contracts come to his hall at your earliest convenience.\"\n\"Has Lord Atrius decided not to challenge further?\" asked Scotti.\n\"He's been unable to, having died very suddenly, just now, from a terribly unfortunate accident,\" said the courier.\nScotti had wondered how long it would be before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; was brought in for final negotiations. As he walked toward Lord Vanech's Building Commission, a long, severe piece of architecture on a minor but respectable plaza, he wondered if he had played the game, as he ought to have. Could Vanech be so rapacious as to offer him a lower percentage of the commission now that his chief competitor was dead? Thankfully, he discovered, Lord Vanech had already decided to pay Scotti what he had proposed during the heat of the winter negotiations. His advisors had explained to him that other, lesser building commissions might come forward unless the matter were handled quickly and fairly.\n\"Glad we have all the legal issues done with,\" said Lord Vanech, fondly. \"Now we can get to the business of helping the poor Bosmeri, and collecting the profits. It's a pity you weren't our representative for all the troubles with Bend'r-mahk and the &lt;a href=\"Arnesian%20War\"&gt;Arnesian business&lt;/a&gt;. But there will be plenty more wars, I'm sure of that.\"\nScotti and Lord Vanech sent word to the Silvenar that at last they were prepared to honor the contracts. A few weeks later, they held a banquet in honor of the profitable enterprise. Decumus Scotti was the darling of the Imperial City, and no expense was spared to make it an unforgettable evening.\nAs Scotti met the nobles and wealthy merchants who would be benefiting from his business dealings, an exotic but somehow faintly familiar smell rose in the ballroom. He traced it to its source: a thick roasted slab of meat, so long and thick it covered several platters. The Cyrodilic revelers were eating it ravenously, unable to find the words to express their delight at its taste and texture.\n\"It's like nothing I've ever had before!\"\n\"It's like pig-fed venison!\"\n\"Do you see the marbling of fat and meat? It's a masterpiece!\"\nScotti went to take a slice, but then he saw something imbedded deep in the dried and rendered roast. He nearly collided with his new employer Lord Vanech as he stumbled back.\n\"Where did this come from?\" Scotti stammered.\n\"From our client, the Silvenar,\" beamed his lordship. \"It's some kind of local delicacy they call Unthrappa.\"\nScotti vomited, and didn't stop for some time. It cast rather a temporary pall on the evening, but when Decumus Scotti was carried off to his manor house, the guests continued to dine. The Unthrappa was the delight of all. Even more so when Lord Vanech himself took a slice and found the first of two rubies buried within. How very clever of the Bosmer to invent such a dish, the Cyrodiils agreed."}

Upon accepting, he sends the Agent off to a location within the city where they must meet a contact of his.\nWalkthrough.\nWhile in the city, a letter may be delivered:\n\"A small child of indeterminate gender hands you a note, and runs away before you have a chance to react.\"\"\nThe letter reads:\n\"Dear ,\nChang of plans. had to leave town quickly, and asked me to meet you in . Please come at once. The matter is extremely urgent.\nApproaching the contact in the tavern will trigger a response:\n\", right? I'm glad I managed to contact you. Did tell you much about what was going on? I didn't think so. Suffice it to say that the Necromancers are involved. Dangerous people to cross, indeed. But, I have an Amulet for you which will warn you if agents of the Necromancers are nearby. Should come in handy. Keep a wary eye out, friend.\"\nTaking the Amulet, the Agent must make their way towards the original contact mentioned by the Quester. Upon arrival at the right location and at the right time, the contact will state:\n\"You are ? described you well. I am . We must proceed to Sentinel at once. I can tell you no more, except that the enemies of Queen Akorithi would give much to stop us.\"\nTaking the contact with them, the Agent leaves the building, upon doing so they are ambushed by mages and archers. The contact is killed:\n\"\" gasps, and you turn to see a feathered shaft petruding from her chest. As she sinks to her knees, she slips a letter in your hand, and murmurs, \"Lord &lt;a href=\"K%27avar\"&gt;K'avar&lt;/a&gt; is a traitor to Sentinel. You must get this to Queen Akorithi.\" is dead.\"\"\nDefeating the warriors involved in the ambush, the Agent can read the letter in peace, which will state:\n\"\"My dear ,\nI am pleased to hear of your progress in training my forces at . I will send more money as soon as I can raise it, as you will need to hire more troops if we hope to defeat Queen Akorithi. You are surely correct that going into open battle against her is a lost cause, but I believe that even for a coup de main against the Castle itself, we will need more men.\nWe can discuss this matter further in person when I arrive at in a few weeks. If you need to reach me in the meantime, I am staying in the Palace at . If all goes well, we may soon have a new ally. Once the situation here is proceeding smoothly again, I must return to Sentinel to pay my respects (perhaps my \"final respects\") to our dear Queen. Her agents have been dogging my steps lately, so I shall allay her suspicions by a show of fawning subservience which she so appreciates.\nKeep me informed of your progress.\nMost sincerely,\nLord K'avar,\nIf the Agent waits around too long, or attempts to travel to either location, they will be teleported to a dungeon by the Amulet given to them by the contact in the tavern:\n\"You are suddenly surrounded by a bright glow. Looking down, you see that the light is coming from the amulet gave you. The ground seems to open beneath your feet, and darkness engulfs you.\"\nThe ruins are filled with enemies loyal to K'avar, hitting the first will trigger a response stating \" dog, you will pay for your meddling in Lord K'avar's affairs.\" One will have to fight their way out of the ruins before the time is up. One way to bypass this obstacle is through the usage of a recall spell, by placing the anchor point before the amulet takes the Agent away, the Agent can use the teleport again to return to the location before the Amulet's effect.\nEscaping the dungeon one way or another, the Agent is given two options. Either continue on with the mission to deliver the note to Queen &lt;a href=\"Akorithi\"&gt;Akorithi&lt;/a&gt;, or instead to deliver it to Lord &lt;a href=\"K%27avar\"&gt;K'avar&lt;/a&gt;.\nK'avar.\nThe location of Lord K'avar varies. In the early days of the quest, he can commonly be found in the Palace mentioned in his note to his agent, but otherwise he will be bunkered down in the fortress mentioned instead. Making their way to Lord K'avar, the Agent has the option to either give him the note, and thus ending the quest, or refuse to do so. If the latter option is selected, Queen Akorithi must still be informed.\nAkorithi.\nQueen Akorithi is found in Castle Sentinel's throne room. If she is met in the early days of the quest, she will have Lord K'avar arrested and put in jail. At a later date, however, Lord K'avar will be absent from the court, as will be the case if he was directly confronted at the Palace. Queen Akorithi will then request the Agent to chase down K'avar. If the Agent accepts, they must travel to K'avar's hideout and confront him and slay him.\n\"Lord K'avar is dead.\"\nIf the Agent takes too to beat him, K'avar escapes.\n\"Lord K'avar throws down his weapon. Thinking he is surrendering, you pause in your attack, but instead he twists a ring on his finger. As Lord K'avar disappears in a haze of light, you faintly hear him shout, \"Tell that bitch that she hasn't seen the last of me!\"\"\nIf the Agent refuses, Akorithi will send her own forces to capture K'avar."}

In these last cold hours before the sun rises, I sit down to write this account of a dream I had not long after.\nI believe this dream was the answer to my prayers, and I would pass along the wisdom it contained to my kinsmen, for the battles they will fight in the years after my passing.\nIn the dream, I walked through mist toward the sound of laughter, merriment and the songs of the north. The mist soon cleared, and before me lay a great chasm. Waters thundered over its brim, and so deep it was, I could not see the bottom.\nA great bridge made all of whale-bone was the only means to cross, and so I took it.\nIt was only a few steps onto the bridge that I encountered a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Class%29\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, grim and strong. \"I am &lt;a href=\"Tsun\"&gt;Tsun&lt;/a&gt;, master of trials,\" he said to me, his voice booming and echoing upon the walls of the high mountains all around us.\nWith a wave, he bade me pass on. I knew in my heart I was granted passage only because I was a visitor. Should the hour come when I return here after my mortal life, the legends say that I must beat this dread warrior in single combat.\nBeyond the bridge, a &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Valor\"&gt;great stone longhouse&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0rose up\u00a0before me, so tall as to nearly touch the clouds. Though it took all my strength, I pushed open the towering oaken door and beheld the torch-lit feast hall.\nHere were assembled the greatest heroes of the Nords, all drinking mead poured from great kegs and singing battle-songs. Suckling pigs turned on a long iron spit over a roaring fire. My mouth watered at the smell of roast meat, and my heart was glad to hear the songs of old.\n\"Come forth!\" cried out a hoary man who sat upon a high wooden chair. This I knew to be &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, father to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the Nords. I approached and knelt before him.\n\"You find yourself in &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, hall of the honored dead. Now, what would you have of\u00a0me, son of the north?\" he bellowed. \"I seek counsel,\" said I, \"for tomorrow we fight a desperate battle and my heart is full of fear.\"\nYsgramor raised his tankard to his lips and drank until the cup was empty. Then he spoke once more.\n\"Remember this always, son of the north- a Nord is judged not by the manner in which he lived, but the manner in which he died.\"\nWith that, he cast aside his flagon, raised his fist in the air and roared a great cheer. The other heroes rose to their feet and cheered in answer.\nThe sound still rang in my ears when I awoke. I gathered my men and told them of my vision. The words seemed to fill their hearts with courage.\nThe horns are blowing, and the banners are raised. The time has come to muster. May Talos grant us victory this day, and if I am found worthy, may I once again look upon the great feast hall.\n- &lt;a href=\"Skardan%20Free-Winter\"&gt;Skardan Free-Winter&lt;/a&gt;"}

I was admiring the famous animal pens of the Tower when I was approached by an older student. The fellow who told me this tale seemed very trustworthy at first, but, as the reader will soon discover, the tale is very dubious indeed. Of course, I have told it since to other neonates of the Tower in the same spirit.\nI offer the following for your august consideration, gentle reader.\nMany, many years back, a talented but poor &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt; was passing through Sumurset, looking for work. He could sing, he could dance, he could act, but no one had any use for his performances. The poor bard was lugubrious, but he still visited the taverns and palaces, day after day, begging for a chance to showcase his talents.\nOne day, dejected from more bad &lt;a href=\"Luck%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;luck&lt;/a&gt;, he was approached by a tall &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;elf&lt;/a&gt; in a long robe. A Magister of the Crystal Tower, in charge of the animal pens. The elf tells the bard of the white ape they made a cell for at the Tower, how it had died en route. There was a royal party from &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; visiting who had been promised a glimpse at the rare white ape. The Magister had a costume for the bard if he would deign to act out the part of the ape for the visitors. The bard had promised himself to take the first part that came his way, no matter how minor, so he agreed. The elf promised that the charade would last no longer than a fortnight, when the visitors left.\nFor the first several days of the masquerade, the bard did nothing more than sit in the back of the pen. He was afraid to move and show the possible imperfections of the ape costume. In time, he became bored and began walking around. He suddenly noticed that the royal party was watching, fascinated. Happy that the ruse was working, he decided to enliven the act.\nSoon he had both a performance and a crowd. Instead of dancing a traditional elven jig, he would swing around the cell with every acrobatic trick he knew. Instead of singing a ballad, he would roar a roar he imagined a rare white ape might roar. The crowd loved it. The party outside his cell grew larger and larger every day.\nOne day, he was performing for the crowd\u2014his finest work to date. He swung himself round and round, roaring and bleating. His hand slipped and he went flying through the bar and into the cell next door, where a &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Wolf\"&gt;Snow Wolf&lt;/a&gt; was in residence. Hackling its back and growling, the Snow Wolf began to inch toward the bard.\nSeeing no other way out, the bard screamed, \"Help! Help!\"\nThe Snow Wolf whispered, \"Shut up or you'll get us all fired.\""}

Perhaps it was simply a freak accident, and I was simply in the wrong place at the right time. Regardless, I now lie here, half buried in the collapse, with crushed legs. The pain was unbearable for the first day or so. Or was it? Who knows? You lose track of time in a place like this. Especially in a situation such as this. The pain has all but left though. Getting used to pain is a battle all in itself. My time now runs short. I will die here, in this tomb. No better place for a dead man.\nMy adventures have taken me all over. I have been places that man never knew existed. I have retrieved artifacts and fine treasures that were thought to be myth.

She will tell you that she has received an unsigned letter which based on a flower contained within she believes to be from her family. She left her family in &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; on bad terms, releasing a ton of their slaves and giving them money from the house treasury.

Speaking to &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; will initiate the next stage of the quest:\n\"You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you. You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility. Make your way to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt; can now be found in the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Pale Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and wishes to send false orders to the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;. In order to do this, she needs real Stormcloak Orders to forge. Stormcloak couriers often stop at the nearby inns between Dawnstar and Windhelm. If an innkeeper can be persuaded to help, the orders can be more easily intercepted:\n\"\"I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to make the forgeries.\" ... \"See if you can't 'convince' one of those innkeepers to help you. One way or another, get me those documents. But don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm.\"\"\nFinding the Stormcloak courier.\n&lt;a href=\"Legate%20Rikke%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Legate Rikke&lt;/a&gt;'s order requires the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Courier\"&gt;Stormcloak Courier&lt;/a&gt; at either the &lt;a href=\"Nightgate%20Inn\"&gt;Nightgate Inn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;. The courier will be absent on arrival. If encouraged to talk, the innkeeper can give more information:\nSeen any Stormcloak couriers lately? \nOr, if the courier is found still at the inn, he can simply be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed for the order while he is at the bar.\nRetrieving the documents.\nOnce the courier is located, obtain the documents from him, either by pickpocketing or by looting his corpse. If spoken to at either of the inns, the following conversation will occur:\n\"Can't stop to chat, citizen.\"\nI'm not here to talk. I'm here for those documents. \"Is that so?\"\nNever mind. \"Hmph.\"\nIf the first option is chosen, he will then pull out his sword and attack the Dragonborn. If killed, a bounty of 1000 will be obtained.\nAlternatively, one can use a sneak attack to kill him which will not induce a bounty. Meeting the courier on the road and fighting him in seclusion is ideal, as it allows for stealing his armor as well. Alternatively, if followed, the courier may be attacked by a troll just east of the Nightgate Inn at the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Cave\"&gt;Forsaken Cave&lt;/a&gt; and easily killed by it, making acquiring the documents much easier.\nReturning the documents.\nOnce the Stormcloak documents are obtained, return to Legate Rikke at the &lt;a href=\"Pale%20Imperial%20Camp\"&gt;Pale Imperial Camp&lt;/a&gt; where she will \"correct\" the documents:\n\"Very good... Let's see what you have here. Interesting... They know more of our plans than I expected... It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those... One moment while I 'correct' some of these documents... That should do it. Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more freely.\"\nRikke will then order the Dragonborn to take the forged papers to the Stormcloak commander &lt;a href=\"Frorkmar%20Banner-Torn\"&gt;Frorkmar Banner-Torn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDelivering the forged documents.\nThe general will be waiting in his quarters in &lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Hall\"&gt;The White Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Approaching him in appropriate garb will aid in the deception. The commanding officer\u00a0will be satisfied with the forgery. With the \"new\" information in hand, he will make the necessary provisions and indicate that the &lt;a href=\"Windpeak%20Inn\"&gt;Windpeak Inn&lt;/a&gt; would be a nice place to get a drink for a job well done. Instead, return to Legate Rikke with news of success. Frorkmar's response to the Dragonborn will differ depending on what armor they are wearing:\nI have important documents for you, sir. \"Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your Stormcloak colors?\"\nOr, if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is wearing &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Armor\"&gt;Stormcloak Armor&lt;/a&gt;, he will not doubt that they are indeed the courier:\nI have important documents for you, sir. \"All right. Let's take a look... [...]\"\nAfter accepting the papers, he will then hand the Dragonborn 5 .

I am then to return to base camp where I will receive forged documents that I, posing as an enemy courier, will deliver to the enemy commander in Morthal.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; is pleased with the victory at &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Fort%20Sungard\"&gt;Fort Sungard&lt;/a&gt; and the liberation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; hands. With the production of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s rightful Silver Mines halted and the enemy buried in an avalanche of pain and retribution, Ulfric bestows a new nickname - Snow Hammer - as well as a small token of his appreciation. His next orders are to report to &lt;a href=\"Galmar%20Stone-Fist\"&gt;Galmar Stone-Fist&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch%20Stormcloak%20Camp\"&gt;Hjaalmarch Stormcloak Camp&lt;/a&gt; to initiate the next leg of the \"&lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20Skyrim\"&gt;Liberation of Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;:\"\n\"Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs in Skyrim. Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer now. You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause. We do what we do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token of such love reciprocated.\"\nWhat's next? \"\"You're needed in &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;. There's much to be done.\"\"\nGalmar wishes to send false orders to the Legate in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. In order to do this he needs real Imperial Orders to forge. Imperial couriers often stop at the nearby inns at &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt;. If an innkeeper can be persuaded to help, the orders can be more easily intercepted:\nReporting for duty. \"\"Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in Morthal. But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to make the forgeries. The inns at Dragon Bridge and Rorikstead are frequent stops for Imperial runners. See if you can't \"convince\" one of those innkeepers to help you. One way or another, get me those documents. What do you say?\"\"\nFinding the Imperial courier.\nAs indicated by Galmar, two inns are possible locations that an Imperial Courier might be located, &lt;a href=\"Four%20Shields%20Tavern\"&gt;Four Shields Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in Dragon Bridge, and &lt;a href=\"Frostfruit%20Inn\"&gt;Frostfruit Inn&lt;/a&gt; in Rorikstead. If Whiterun has been captured by the Stormcloaks, and if the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; is in the town, the courier will attack the guards there.\nDragon Bridge is the closest location to the camp and ultimately most advantageous to pursue. Speaking with &lt;a href=\"Faida\"&gt;Faida&lt;/a&gt; at Dragon Bridge or &lt;a href=\"Mralki\"&gt;Mralki&lt;/a&gt; at Rorikstead regarding the courier will initially garner little information, as they both respect their patrons' privacy. However, they can be paid, persuaded, or intimidated into revealing that the courier has left and can be caught up with or his return waited for:\nSeen any Imperial couriers lately? \nOr, if the courier is found still at the inn, he can simply be &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ed for the order while he is at the bar.\nRetrieving the courier's package.\nStarting from Rorikstead is less desirable, as the courier is running from Rorikstead to Dragon Bridge and is halfway in between once his location is learned. A fast steed would be necessary to catch up with him before he reaches his destination. Alternatively, he can simply be met en route when starting from Dragon Bridge. Waiting for him in the inn is also undesirable, as demanding the documents will ultimately end up in \"hostile negotiations\" and a 1000 gold bounty for murder will be incurred; plus however much while fighting off the guards. If spoken to at either of the inns, the following conversation will occur:\n\"Can't stop to chat, citizen.\"\nI'm not here to talk. I'm here for those documents. \"Is that so?\"\nNever mind. \"Hmph.\"\nIf the first option is chosen, he will then pull out his sword and attack the Dragonborn. If killed, a bounty of 1000 will be obtained.\nMeeting the courier on the road and fighting him in seclusion is ideal, as it allows for stealing his armor, as well. If meeting him outside Dragon Bridge, the Dragonborn may find him in combat with a dragon. Pickpocketing the documents at any time is another possible way to continue the quest. If a bounty is not wanted without having to pickpocket, they can ask the Courier for the package. Of course, he will not hand it over and, instead, will fight. This will trigger the Dragonborn's follower, who will then attack him and most likely kill him. They can then loot it from his corpse bounty-free. One can also intimidate him in &lt;a href=\"Rorikstead\"&gt;Rorikstead&lt;/a&gt; in which he attacks you and the guards attack the courier since the guards are now &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nForging the documents.\nAfter returning to Galmar with the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Documents\"&gt;Imperial Documents&lt;/a&gt;, he notices that they contain more information about Stormcloak movements than he had originally anticipated, but the Imperial &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Snowhawk\"&gt;Fort Snowhawk&lt;/a&gt; is in need of reinforcements. He quickly alters the document in favor of the Stormcloaks and orders it delivered to &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Taurinus%20Duilis\"&gt;Legate Taurinus Duilis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"\"Good work! Let's see what you got. Hmm... They know more of our plans than they thought... Not good... Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those... Give me a moment while a make a few, um, \"corrections\" to these reports... There we go. Make sure those forged documents get to the Legate in Morthal. They should give them the wrong idea... and give us the advantage.\"\"\nRemind me - what am I supposed to do? \"Make sure those forged documents get to the Legate in Morthal. They should give them the wrong idea... and give us the advantage.\"\nDelivering the forged documents.\nThe Legate will be waiting in his quarters in &lt;a href=\"Highmoon%20Hall\"&gt;Highmoon Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Approaching him in appropriate garb will aid in the deception, but regardless, the Legate will be satisfied with the forgery. With the \"new\" information in hand he will make the necessary provisions and indicate that the &lt;a href=\"Moorside%20Inn\"&gt;Moorside Inn&lt;/a&gt; would be a nice place to get a drink for a job well done. Instead, return to Galmar with news of success. Taurinus' response to the Dragonborn will differ depending on what armor they are wearing:\nI have important documents for you, sir. \"Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?\"\nOr, if the Dragonborn is wearing &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial Armor&lt;/a&gt;, he will not doubt that they are indeed the courier:\nI have important documents for you, sir. \"Thank you soldier. Let's take a look at these reports... [...]\""}

The Nurin family needs help.

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to help.\nWalkthrough.\nOutside &lt;a href=\"Nurin%20Farm\"&gt;Nurin Farm&lt;/a&gt; an &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Lugharz\"&gt;Lugharz&lt;/a&gt; is distraught. She asks for help as the Nurin Farm has been burned down and Mister Nurin has disappeared. When they woke up this morning, the farm was on fire. She tried to put it out, but most of the farm was destroyed, and then they realized that Mister Nurin was missing. Mister Nurin's wife says she is calling of the search, she is giving up. Please go and offer to help and don't tell her they spoke as she has been dismissed by the wife...\nHead up to the burned farm to find Mrs. Nurin. She is standing outside one of the buildings, crying a lot. Fire, &lt;a href=\"Scamp%20%28Online%29\"&gt;scamps&lt;/a&gt; and William disappears she says and now strangers are on the property. The farmhands gave up, maybe it's time to give up for her. Offer to help but Rosalie says it's too late. She wants the Vestige to find her daughter Ganise and tell her William must have perished in the fire.\nFind Ganise in the westernmost house, fight the scamps and &lt;a href=\"Clannfear%20%28Online%29\"&gt;clannfears&lt;/a&gt; on the way. Ganise is distraught, there has to be some sign of what happened to her father. Let her know her mother says it's time to give up. But Ganise can't believe her mother can say this. How can she give up? She really believes her father is alive. They haven't even checked all the buildings yet, in fact she has been putting off the northern barn as it creeps her out. Could the Vestige have a look in there? Tell her to meet up afterwards in their house.\nHead off to the northern barn and deal with the clannfears outside. It looks like a ritual has been performed recently inside. Maybe the &lt;a href=\"To%20Dream%20Beyond%20Dreams%20%28Daedric%20Cults%29\"&gt;tattered book&lt;/a&gt; have some clue of the ritual's purpose. It describes an initiation ritual for &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers%20Cult\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt;. Ganise will want to know about this, so go to the Nurin house on the eastern side of the farm.\nThe door is locked to the house so knock hard on it. Ganise asks if it's mother but tell her they're back from the barn. She asks for help as a creepy guy was here, then her mother tied her up and locked the door and left. Please get me out she says, I think mother wrapped the key up in a piece of bacon and fed it to one of those scamps.\nA gruesome task but they have to kill scamps until the key is found. Then go back to the house and talk to Ganise. She says some creepy guy named &lt;a href=\"Sentulus\"&gt;Sentulus&lt;/a&gt; was here with mother. She said it was for her own good to tie her up, then something about a dream and her dad. She doesn't understand, who was that man and why did mother tie her up? Explain to her that her mother is joining a cult. Ganise is shocked, a cult? Oh no, her dad, mother said something about him and a sacrifice he had to make... they were going up the hill to the west. Please, go after them. Agree to help, then untie Ganise so she'll be free to meet outside afterwards.\nHead west of the farm to find the &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers%20Offering%20Site\"&gt;offering site&lt;/a&gt; where the cultists are holding William, and rescue him before it's too late. Kill the cultists watching him, then untie him. He'll run back to the farm, talking about Ganise. Go back after him and talk to Ganise. She is grateful for saving her father and thinks the Vestige are a hero. She feels like she should be sad because of her mother but she can't help feeling happy her father is safe. We'll rebuild the farm and make a statue in their honor she says."}

However, all that will remain of the militia will be a pile of charred bodies. Examining the bodies will reveal that there is a melted amulet within the pile. The Vestige will need to take this amulet as proof back to Treethan Dailithil. Once the amulet is taken, a voice will arise in the distance; it is Firwin, who can be found to the far left of the charred bodies beside a rockface. Upon being spoken to, she will respond with:\n\"Stay back...I've been bitten. I won't have another fall for my mistakes.\"\nFirwin will then lead the Vestige to the spring, which contains the Aspect of &lt;a href=\"Hircine%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hircine&lt;/a&gt;.

The young &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; fears what the future holds. Her flesh is weak, but not for long.\"\nThe Vestige can then speak with Firwin, who appears to be fully disheartened:\n\"So...it is the end. There's no saving myself after all. My mother will never forgive me, but I don't regret saving our village. Perhaps I can save her as well.\"\nImmediately after speaking to her, she will transform into a &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Werewolf&lt;/a&gt; and run away. The Vestige will need to speak to Dialithil, who can be found along the bank of the river located a short distance south of the spring.

Now I don't know if I'll live long enough to see her again.\"\nImmediately after this, Dialithil will kneel down, and Firwin will appear, asking what has been done to her.\n\"It's all gone so horribly wrong. I only wanted to protect the village! But now...Mother, I can help you. Please, hold on!\"\nFirwin will then run across the river, with her mother trailing behind in an attempt to convince her to stop. She will then double over in exhaustion after a few seconds of chase.

However, she will become human again within a few seconds during battle, kneeling down. Once Thulendor is defeated, Firwin will regain her strength and run towards the spring containing Hircine's Aspect, declaring that the blood gift has been paid back, and demanding Hircine to leave them. She will then run back to find her mother, only to realize that she has disappeared. Panicking, she calls out for her, but to no avail. Then, she will find her mother beside a boulder, unconscious and lying down. The Vestige will need to speak with her again, to which she will respond with:\n\"Thank the moons, we're not too late. I hope she still has enough strength to drink.\"\nShe will then reward the Vestige with the &lt;a href=\"Greaves%20of%20the%20Wolf-Father\"&gt;Greaves of the Wolf-Father&lt;/a&gt; and 298 , completing the quest."}

Forget I asked. \"That's what I thought.\"\nAfter Ranmir has been successfully persuaded, intimidated, bribed, or brawled the player can return to Haran for a reward where she will say: \"He's not a bad man, just bad with his coins and his drink.\" She will then reward the player with a weapon and a piece of armor.\nIddra and Roggi Knot-Beard.\nIddra is the owner of Braidwood Inn in Kynesgrove. She thinks highly of Roggi Knot-Beard as a storyteller and comments that he can keep everyone's spirits up. Although he owed Iddra money for drinks, she keeps telling him not to worry about it. However, his \"stubborn Nord blood\" does not allow him to do so and Iddra will eventually tell the player \"\"Damn fool doesn't have the coin to pay me back, so he just beats himself up over it, and then he gets thirsty, and it cycles all over again.\" If you can talk to Roggi, she would feel better.\nRoggi is a miner and he can be found inside Braidwood Inn or in the nearby camp. Telling him to forget about the coin he owes will make him angry and say: \"What do you think I am, a beggar? My family has always paid back every single coin we owed, going back to Tiber Septim's time.\" If the player has helped Roggi before by retrieving his ancestral shield, he will agree saying: \"I guess if you're telling me to stop worrying about it, maybe I should just let it go. Thank you, friend.\"\"\nStop being stubborn. Let it go. (Persuade) \nWhat if I pay it? (Bribe) \nDo I need to beat some sense into you? (Brawl) \nFine. Forget I asked. \"It's better that way.\"\nAfter Roggi has been successfully persuaded, bribed, intimidated, or brawled, Iddra will say: \"\"Roggi pawned a few things of his back when he still had things to pawn.\" and will then reward the player with a weapon or piece of armor.\nOctieve San and Irnskar Ironhand.\nOctieve San is an old warrior living in Solitude, frequently found in The Winking Skeever. San enjoys his life saying: \"Being old's not so bad. Daughter keeps me fed, and my working days are done.\" Talking to him will reveal that he is in debt and will say: \"Take my advice. Never gamble. Damn Irnskar has me in debt up to the eyes.\" The player can offer to help San with his debt and Irnskar will respond when spoken to: \"Debts are debts. Either he pays them, or his kind do.\"\" The player can proceed to successfully persuade or intimidate Irnskar with a Speech skill of 17 or greater or bribe or brawl him.\nHe's an old man. Let it go. (Persuade) \nWhat if I pay it? (Bribe) \nLay off the old man. Now. (Brawl) \nFine. Forget I asked. \"That's what I thought.\"\nAfter informing Octieve San that his debt has been settled he will provide a one-point boost in Two-Handed and become a marriage candidate.\nOmluag and Mulush gro-Shugurz.\nOmluag lives in The Warrens and works at the smelter in Markarth. He may also be found in the Silver-Blood Inn. During work he will say: \"\"Can't talk. Mulush will beat me if I stop working.\" Omluag will also say about Mulush: \"He's a damn tyrant. Always being goaded on by the Silver-Bloods to get more work out of us. They pay us next to nothing. We get beaten if we make a mistake, and where are our kind Nord rulers? What are they doing? Typical.\" Omluag will be surprised if the player offers to help, saying: \"You're going to try to talk sense into that Orc? I'll believe it when I see it.\" Mulush is near his workers during the day, monitoring them. He will ask what your business here is when talked to and respond when asked to take it easy on Omluag by saying: \"What? Are you telling me how to treat my workers? Do you have any idea how much metal the Silver-Blood family wants us to smelt?\"\" If the player has a Speech skill of 17 or greater Mulush can be persuaded or intimidated, otherwise he can be bribed or brawled.\nYou're working him to death. Lay off. (Persuade) \nMaybe we can come to an understanding. (Bribe) \nThen we do this the hard way. (Brawl) \nFine. Forget I asked. \"Idiot.\"\nUpon informing Omluag that Mulush will ease off, he will be excited and offer you a week's worth of his wage as payment, saying: \"\"I don't believe it. Someone sticking up for us.\"\nScouts-Many-Marshes and Torbjorn Shatter-Shield.\nScouts-Many-Marshes is an Argonian dock worker in Windhelm. He and other Argonians can be seen working around the Windhelm docks and when asked about his trouble he will inform the player that his boss, Torbjorn Shatter-Shield, wants everything for nothing and clings to every septim. Scouts-Many-Marshes will say: \"He says an Argonian's labor is only worth a tenth of a 'proper Nord worker.' My people are not slaves!\" He will then request that the player talk to Torbjorn to get him to pay the Argonian workers fairer wages. If the player already has a positive disposition with Torbjorn by bringing him an Amulet of Arkay or an alcoholic drink, he will agree with the player without having to be persuaded, bribed, intimidated, or brawled and say: \"Well, my friend, if you think those boots need more coin, I'll make it happen. But I'm doing this for you, not them.\" If the player does not have a positive disposition with Torbjorn, he will refuse saying: \"Those boots aren't worth the septims I do pay them. I'm not giving them coin I could give to good, Nord workers.\"\" If the player has a Speech skill of 25 or greater, Torbjorn may be persuaded or intimidated, otherwise he can be brawled or bribed.\nThey'll work harder if you pay them more. (Persuade) \nWhat if I invest in their future? (Bribe) \nPay them, or things will get ugly. (Brawl) \nFine. Forget I asked. \"That's what I thought.\"\nWhen the player returns to Scouts-Many-Marshes, he will be impressed and provide a reward of either two fortify skill potions or three restoration potions."}

She has a plan to uncover the truth of what happened during the guild's failed heist.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Long%20Game%20%28Thieves%20Guild%29\"&gt;The Long Game&lt;/a&gt;,\" head to the Den and speak with either &lt;a href=\"Andarri\"&gt;Andarri&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Thrag\"&gt;Thrag&lt;/a&gt;. They will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Zeira\"&gt;Zeira&lt;/a&gt; is pondering why the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt; think the Thieves Guild stole &lt;a href=\"Magnifica%20Falorah\"&gt;Magnifica Falorah&lt;/a&gt;'s dowry, and that you should go talk to her. \nHead over to Zeira. She will tell you that she wants to find out whether the dowry was actually stolen, and to do that she plans to once again break into that family tomb. She will tell you to enlist the help of &lt;a href=\"Percius%20Loche\"&gt;Percius Loche&lt;/a&gt;. Head to Percius's shop, &lt;a href=\"The%20Diamond%20Thimble\"&gt;The Diamond Thimble&lt;/a&gt;. When you arrive there, you will notice the place has been thrashed and that Percius is missing. Speak with the clerk &lt;a href=\"Mamaea\"&gt;Mamaea&lt;/a&gt; to find out that the Iron Wheel came here looking for Percius, but that he escaped. He stepped in paint on his way out though, so you should be able to follow his trail through the city. \nFollow the green footprints, and you will eventually find Percius hiding behind a tree near the gate to the Warehouse District. Tell him to meet with you and the others at &lt;a href=\"Prince%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Prince's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of &lt;a href=\"Bahraha%27s%20Gloom\"&gt;Bahraha's Gloom&lt;/a&gt;. He will not wat to travel there by himself, but Quen can take him.\nHead to Prince's Gate to rendezvous with the others, and speak with Zeira. Once you tell her you are ready to go, you will be transported to the &lt;a href=\"Al-Danobia%20Tomb\"&gt;Al-Danobia Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. You will find the Iron Wheel guarding the tomb's main entrance; Zeira will be none to pleased with this. She will tell you to sneak past, and to speak with Percius Loche about a side entrance. Percius will tell you about an old path to the right side of the main path that will lead to a sealed entrance. Head along the path, either avoiding or killing the Iron Wheel guards in the process, until you notice the path to your right. Once you head up that path, Percius will unseal the entrance there, and you can head in. \nThe hallway ahead is littered with traps, so try to avoid those if you can. Once you get to the main entrance, you will be joined by the others. There is a puzzle here; the pillars next to the door must be twisted a certain way. the &lt;a href=\"Excerpt%20from%20al-Danobia%20Heist%20Journal\"&gt;Excerpt from al-Danobia Heist Journal&lt;/a&gt; found in this room, as well as the texts found in the corners, will provide clues on how this should be done. \nThe solution to this riddle is as follows: on the left side, from right to left, the symbols should be Scroll-Warrior-Torch. on the right side, it is Snake-Warrior-Sword. This will open the door and allow you to proceed further. You will find a big chasm Zeira calls Shinji's Truth. She will ask you to follow her and Velsa while Quen and Walks-Softly look for any hidden passages. Follow her into Malooc's Path, where she will tell Velsa to hold and keep her hand on a panel so that you will not be harmed as you try to cross the darkness ahead. \nSpeak with Zeira before you cross. She will reveal that this is where &lt;a href=\"Nicolas\"&gt;Nicolas&lt;/a&gt; and the others died. She will tell you to stay close to her as you cross, otherwise the darkness will consume you. As the two of you proceed through the darkness, you will occasionally be attacked by enemies; fend these off as you progress. Zeira will find it curious that the bodies of her friends are no longer here. Once you reach the end, you will find Nicolas's old lamp there. the vase containing Tall Papa's Ashes, which are needed to cross the chasm, then talk to Zeira. She will not understand how the lamp can be here, as she saw it hit the ground and go out when Nicolas was consumed by the darkness here. \nWith the ashes in hand, head back to the chasm. There is a way back if you go south; you do not have to go through the fog again. Along the way, Velsa will confront Zeira, as she has figured out what went wrong on the previous heist. Zeira was supposed to hold the panel, but she let go and rushed to Nicolas's aid when enemies approached. This led to darkness consuming Nicolas and gravely injuring Zeira, preventing her from making a swift return to the guild and warning them of the Iron Wheel. \nWhen you arrive back at the chasm, you will see Quen seemingly floating in midair. She will reveal that she found an invisible bridge. Sprinkle the ashes on the bridge to reveal the path forward, then make your way across. The door ahead will be guarded by a &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; you will have to dispose of. In the next room, you will find the final guardian of the vaults, &lt;a href=\"Lakayd%20the%20Repentant\"&gt;Lakayd the Repentant&lt;/a&gt;. When you and your allies fail to produce the password, it will attack. Lakayd likes to create clones of himself, so beware of that. Kill him, then head into the treasure vaults. \nYou will find the vault completely empty. Look around for clues as to what happened here; you will find several objects. There will be a coded map on the floor besides the opened treasure chest. Velsa will reveal that Nicolas always used these kinds of half-maps. To the right, by the statue, you will find a torn journal page from Nicolas's journal. Finally, on the left side of the room, you will find a headless skeleton. Speak with Zeira about these hints and she will conclude that Nicolas somehow survived and took the dowry for himself. She knows how to interpret the map, and will tell you to head to the location to see if Nicolas has a hideout there. You can leave the tomb through a passage in the southeast of the room. Head back to the camels and use them to return to Abah's Landing. \nNicolas's secret hideout can be found northeast of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Hew%27s%20Shuttered%20Tomb\"&gt;Prince Hew's Shuttered Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, southwest of the &lt;a href=\"Zeht%27s%20Displeasure%20Wayshrine\"&gt;Zeht's Displeasure Wayshrine&lt;/a&gt;. The door to the retreat will be locked, so bring some picks. Inside, you will find several hints that Nicolas has been working with &lt;a href=\"Cosh\"&gt;Cosh&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some crystallized blood. This will lead Zeira to figure out how he survived the tomb; he had some crystallyzed al-Danobia blood on him so that the darkness would not hurt him. He also knew the passphrase to get past Lakayd. Zeira will then tell you to head back to the Den with her so she can reveal what really happened to everyone in the guild. \nHead back to the guild and speak with Zeira to finish the quest."}

Balag explains there are three divisions: Swordmaster, Sorcerer and Summoner.\u00a0 &lt;a href=\"Zara\"&gt;Zara&lt;/a&gt;, who is the Division leader for the Swordmasters, is standing closest to Balag in a circle surrounded by braziers.\nBecause &lt;a href=\"Feluni\"&gt;Feluni&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the Arena, capped the number of combatants, the Vestige must beat one of the current combatants in a match and take their credentials.

But even a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; will bite if kicked long enough.\nIf the Pact will not help us get what we deserve for our generations of suffering, others will help us. The &lt;a href=\"Varakun\"&gt;Varakun&lt;/a&gt; seek power for their master, but also grant power to those who serve them. Through their auspices, I will avenge those who died as slaves. I will raise their tormentors as my &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; vassals, and they will serve me forever in death."}

They are not near her, but can be found all along the way to her location, which is at the end of the delve. Once you find her, you have the option to either kill her or take the deed and key and let her go free.\nObtaining furniture.\nAfter meeting with Canthion back at his bank, he tells you to obtain at least one piece of furniture for the room so that he can give it to you. The simplest way is to buy at least one piece of furniture from the nearest Home Goods Furnisher in the city ( in Vulkhel Guard, &lt;a href=\"Rozhika\"&gt;Rozhika&lt;/a&gt; in Daggerfall, in Davon's Watch). It is also possible to purchase furniture with &lt;a href=\"Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt;, though this would require you to have bought a house before the quest, as the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt; for furniture is only accessible when in an owned house. Since every house purchasable with gold requires you to have this quest (A Friend in Need) already completed, this method is not recommended, and it is best to stick with buying the items from a Furnisher.\nAnother method is to craft something after learning a blueprint, which can be bought from most merchants or found in containers when exploring. Crafting the furniture however requires resources and knowledge of the blueprint's crafting level, though if you have these requirements, it can be simple to make them.\nReceiving the house.\nAfter you have at least one piece of furniture, meet with Canthion at the inn (Aldmeri Dominion: &lt;a href=\"Mara%27s%20Kiss%20Public%20House\"&gt;Mara's Kiss Public House&lt;/a&gt; in Vulkhel Guard; Daggerfall Covenant: &lt;a href=\"The%20Rosy%20Lion\"&gt;The Rosy Lion&lt;/a&gt; in Daggerfall; Ebonheart Pact: &lt;a href=\"The%20Ebony%20Flask\"&gt;The Ebony Flask&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt;) and he will let you complete the quest, giving you the room and the other rewards."}

The original letter to the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Dhaunayne%20Aundae\"&gt;Dhaunayne&lt;/a&gt; was copied and began circulating around the &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago. In time, a print found its way to the mainland and Prince &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Hlaalu Helseth's&lt;/a&gt; palace outside &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;. While the reader may conclude after reading this letter that the Prince would be furious about such a work, impugning his highness with great malevolence, quite the reverse was true. The Prince and his mother, Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, had it privately printed into bound copies and sent to libraries and booksellers throughout &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs matter of record, the Prince and the Queen have not officially stated whether the letter is a work of pure imagination or based on an actual occurrence. The &lt;a href=\"House%20Dres\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt; has publicly denounced the work, and indeed, no one named Dhaunayne, despite the suggestions in the letter, has ever been linked to the house. We leave the reader to interpret the letter as he or she believes.\n-- Nerris Gan, Publisher\nDark Liege Dhaunayne,\nYou asked for a detailed description of my experience last night and the reasons for my plea to House Dres for another assignment. I hope I have served you well in my capacity as informant in the court of Prince Helseth, a man who I have stated in many previous reports could teach &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; how to scheme. As you know, I've spent nearly a year now working my way into his inner circle of advisors. He was in need of friendship when he first arrived in Morrowind and eagerly took to me and a few others. Still, he was disinclined to trust any of us, which is perhaps not surprising, given his tenuous position in Morrowind society.\nFor your unholiness's recollection, the Prince is the eldest son of Barenziah, who was once the Queen of Morrowind and once the Queen of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;. At the death of her husband, Prince Helseth's stepfather, King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, there was a power struggle between the Prince and Eadwyre's daughter, the Princess &lt;a href=\"Elysana\"&gt;Elysana&lt;/a&gt;. Though details of what transpired are imperfect, it is clear that Elysana won the battle and became Queen, banishing Helseth and Barenziah. Barenziah's only other child, &lt;a href=\"Morgiah\"&gt;Morgiah&lt;/a&gt;, had already left court to marry and become Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Summurset%20Isle\"&gt;Summurset Isle&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBarenziah and Helseth crossed the continent to return to Morrowind only last year. They were well received by Barenziah's uncle, our current king, &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Llethan\"&gt;Hlaalu Athyn Llethan&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken the throne after Barenziah's abdication more than forty years ago. Barenziah made it clear that she had no designs on reclaiming the throne, but merely to retire to her family estates. Helseth, as you know, has lingered in the royal court, and many have whispered that while he lost the throne of Wayrest, he does not intend to lose the throne of Morrowind at Llethan's death.\nI've kept your unholiness informed of the Prince's movements, meetings, and plots, as well as the names and characters of his other advisors. As you may recall, I've often thought that I was not the only spy in Helseth's court. I told you before that a particular &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; counselor of Helseth looked like a fellow I had seen in the company of &lt;a href=\"Tholer%20Saryoni\"&gt;Tholer Saryoni&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Archcanon\"&gt;Archcanon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Another, a young &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; woman, has been verified to visit the Imperial fortress in &lt;a href=\"Balmora\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, in their cases, they might well have been on Helseth's own business, but I couldn't be certain. I had begun to think myself paranoid as the Prince himself when I found myself doubting the sincere loyalty of the Prince's chamberlain, Burgess, a &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; who had been in his employ since his days in the court of Wayrest.\nThat is the background on that night, last night.\nYesterday morning, I received a curt invitation to dine with the Prince. Based only on my own paranoia, I dispatched one of my servants, who is a good and loyal servant of the House Dres, to watch the palace and report back anything unusual. Just before dinner, he returned and told me what he had witnessed.\nA man cloaked in rags had been given entrance into the palace, and had stayed there for some time. When he left, my servant saw his face beneath the cloak\u2014an alchemist of infamous repute, said to be a leading suppliers of exotic poisons. A fine observer, my servant also noticed that the alchemist entered the palace smelling of &lt;a href=\"wickwheat\"&gt;wickwheat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bittergreen\"&gt;bittergreen&lt;/a&gt;, and something alien and sweet. When he left, he was odorless.\nHe had come to the same conclusion as I did. The Prince had procured ingredients to prepare a poison. Bittergreen alone is deadly when eaten raw, but the other ingredients suggested something far deeper. As your unholiness can doubtless imagine, I went to dinner that night, prepared for any eventuality.\nAll of Prince Helseth's other counselors were in attendance, and I noticed that all were slightly apprehensive. Of course, I imagined that I was in a nest of spies, and all knew of the Prince's mysterious meeting. It is just as likely that some knew of the alchemist's visit, while others were simply concerned by the nature of the Prince's invitation, and still others merely unconsciously adopted the tense disposition of their fellow, better informed counselors.\nThe Prince, however, was in fine mettle and soon had everyone relaxed and at ease. At nine, we were all ushered into his dining hall where the feast had been laid out. And what a feast! Honeyed gorapples, fragrant stews, roasts in various blood sauces, and every variety of fish and fowl expertly and ostentatiously prepared. Crystal and gold flagons of &lt;a href=\"Beverages\"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Flin%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;flin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shein\"&gt;shein&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"matze\"&gt;matze&lt;/a&gt; were at our seats to be savored as appropriate with each course. As tantalizing as the aromas were, it occurred to me that in such a maze of spices and flavors, a discreet poison would be undetectable.\nThroughout the meal, I maintained the illusion of eating the food and drinking the liquor, but I was surreptitious and swallowed nothing. Finally, the plates and food were cleared from the table, and a tureen of a spicy broth was placed in the center of the banquet. The servant who brought it then retired, closing the banquet hall door behind him.\n\u201cIt smells divine, my Prince,\u201d said the Marchioness Kolgar, the Nord woman. \u201cBut I cannot eat another thing.\u201d\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d I added, feigning a tone of friendliness and slight intoxication. \u201cYou know that every one at this table would gladly die to put you on the throne of Morrowind, but is it really necessary that we gorge ourselves to death?\u201d\nThe others at the table agreed with appreciative groans. Prince Helseth smiled. I swear by &lt;a href=\"Vaernima\"&gt;Vaernima the Gifter&lt;/a&gt;, my dark liege, even you have never seen a smile such as this one.\n\u201cIronic words. You see, an alchemist visited me today, as some of you already doubtless know. He showed me how to make a marvelous poison and its antidote. A most potent potion, excellent for my purposes. No Restoration spell will aid you once you've ingested it. Only the antidote in the tureen will save you from certain death. And what a death, from what I've heard. I am eager to see if the effects are all that the alchemist promised. It should be horribly painful for the afflicted, but quite entertaining.\u201d\nNo one said a word. I could feel my heart beating hard in my chest.\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d said Allarat, the Dunmer I suspected of alliance with the Temple. \u201cHave you poisoned someone at this table?\u201d\n\u201cYou are very astute, Allarat,\u201d said Prince Helseth, looking about the table, eying each of his advisors carefully. \u201cLittle wonder I value your counsel. As indeed I value all in this room. It would be perhaps easiest for me to say who I haven't poisoned. I haven't poisoned any who serve but one master, any whose loyalty to me is sincere. I haven't poisoned any person who wants to see King Helseth on the throne of Morrowind. I haven't poisoned anyone who isn't a spy for the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Temple, the &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;House of Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran\"&gt;House of Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;the House of Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, the House of Dres.\u201d\nYour unholiness, he looked directly at me at his last words. I know that in certainty. My face is practiced at keeping my thoughts from showing, but I immediately thought of every secret meeting I've had, every coded message I sent to you and the House, my dark liege. What could he know? What could he, even without knowing, suspect?\nI felt my heart beating even faster. Was it fear, or poison? I couldn't speak, certain as I was that my voice would betray my calm facade.\n\u201cThose loyal to me who wish harm on my enemies may be wondering how can I be certain that the poison has been ingested. Is it possible that the guilty party, or dare I say, parties were suspicious and merely pretended to eat and drink tonight? Of course. But even the craftiest of pretenders would have to raise a glass to his or her lips and put empty forks or spoons in their mouths to play the charade. The food, you see, was not poisoned. The cups and cutlery were. If you did not partake out of fear, you're poisoned just the same, and sadly, missed an excellent roast.\u201d\nSweat beaded on my face and I turned from the Prince so he would not see. My fellow advisors, all of them, were frozen in their seats. From the Marchioness Kolgar, white with fear, to Kema Inebbe, visibly shaking; from the furrowed, angry brow of Allarat to the statue-like stare of Burgess.\nI couldn't help thinking then, could the Prince's entire counsellorship be comprised of nothing but spies? Was there any person at the table loyal? And then I thought, what if I were not a spy myself, would I trust Helseth to know that? No one knows better than his advisors both the depth of the Prince's paranoia and the utter implacability of his ambition. If I were not a spy for the House Dres, even then would I be safe? Could a loyalist be poisoned because of a not-so-innocent misjudgment?\nThe others must have been thinking the same, loyalists and spies alike.\nWhile my mind whirled, I could hear the Prince's voice, addressing all assembled: \u201cThe poison acts quickly. If the antidote is not taken within one minute from now, there will be death at the table.\u201d\nI couldn't decide whether I had been poisoned or not. My stomach ached, but I reminded myself it might have been the result of sitting at a sumptuous banquet and not partaking. My heart shook in my chest and a bitter taste like &lt;a href=\"Trama%20Root\"&gt;Trama Root&lt;/a&gt; stung my lips. Again, was it fear or poison?\n\u201cThese are the last words you will hear if you are disloyal to me,\u201d said Prince Helseth, still smiling that damned smile as he watched his advisors squirming in their seats. \u201cTake the antidote and live.\u201d\nCould I believe him? I thought of what I knew of the Prince and his character. Would he kill a self-confessed spy at his court, or would he rather send the vanquished back to his masters? The Prince was ruthless, but either possibility was within his manner. Surely the theatricality of this whole dinner was meant to be a presentation to instill fear. What would my ancestors say if I joined them after sitting at a table, eventually dying of poison? What would they say if I took the antidote, confessing my allegiance to you and the House Dres, and was summarily executed? And, I confess, I thought of what you might to do me even after I was dead.\nI had grown so light-headed and filled with my own thoughts, that I didn't see Burgess jump from his seat. I was only suddenly aware that he had the tureen in his hands and was gulping down the liquid within. There were guards all around, though I never noticed them entering.\n\u201cBurgess,\u201d said Prince Helseth, still smiling. \u201cYou have spent some time at &lt;a href=\"Ghostgate\"&gt;Ghostgate&lt;/a&gt;. House Redoran?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn't know?\u201d Burgess laughed sourly. \u201cNo House. I report to your stepsister, the Queen of Wayrest. I've always been in her employ. By &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, you poisoned me because you thought I was working for some damnable Dark Elves?\u201d\n\u201cYou're half right,\u201d said the Prince. \u201cI didn't guess who you were working for, or even that you were a spy. But you're also wrong about me poisoning you. You poisoned yourself when you drank from the tureen.\u201d\nYour unholiness, you don't need to hear how Burgess died. I know that you have seen much over the many, many years of your existence, but you truly don't want to know. I wish I could erase the memory of his agonies from my own mind.\nThe council was dismissed shortly thereafter. I do not know if Prince Helseth knows or suspects that I too am a spy. I do not know how many others that night, last night, were as close as I was from drinking from the tureen before Burgess did. I only know that if the Prince does not suspect me now, he will. I cannot win at the games he mastered long ago at the court of Wayrest, and I beg your unholiness, my dark liege Dhaunayne to use your influence in the House Dres and dismiss your loyal servant from this charge.\nPublisher's Note:\nOf course, the anonymous writer's signature has not been on any reprint of the letter since the original."}

Within these pages, I, your humble author and guide, will describe to you the great city of &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, the Jewel of the North.\nWhiterun offers numerous diversions for the man in search of adventure, fortune and companionship, whether for a night or for a lifetime. The city is graced with not one, but two worthy taverns and there are maids and wenches aplenty.\nThe city is located rather centrally in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and this is well, for it is not far from anywhere. Perched high upon a rocky hill, Whiterun dominates the grassy plains that surround it. High wooden walls protect its denizens from the wolves, mammoths, bandits and other dangers lurking beyond.\nWhen you first enter through the city's main gate, you will find yourself in the Plains District. This is so named because it is the lowest of the city's three neighborhoods.\nAh, but there can be found &lt;a href=\"The%20Bannered%20Mare\"&gt;The Bannered Mare&lt;/a&gt;, which I count among the finest taverns in all Skyrim. The scenery within is quite compelling, if you have an eye for the fairer sex.\nA stout lass named &lt;a href=\"Hulda\"&gt;Hulda&lt;/a&gt; tends the bar. Don't let that stony &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; exterior fool you, for she is possessed of that same fiery passion that all Nord women try so hard to conceal. &lt;a href=\"Saadia\"&gt;Saadia&lt;/a&gt;, the barmaid, is an exotic &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; beauty. She is quite mysterious, and your humble author is determined to learn her secrets.\nOutside the Bannered Mare is a modest marketplace, and here is where I found true love. Though I would never deter a fellow hunting hound from the chase - for indeed, why should I author these tomes, if not to provide guidance in this very matter? - I must ask that you do this one kindness.\nHer name is &lt;a href=\"Carlotta%20Valentia\"&gt;Carlotta Valentia&lt;/a&gt;, and she is a magnificent beauty who makes a modest living selling bread and produce in the daylight hours. By the gods, I will make that feisty beauty mine someday!\nAnd of course, there are other services to be found in the Plains District. &lt;a href=\"Belethor%27s%20General%20Goods\"&gt;Belethor's General Goods&lt;/a&gt; offers various and sundry for the adventurous traveler, and &lt;a href=\"Arcadia%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Arcadia's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt; offers what tonics and herbs one would expect from an apothecary's shop.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcadia\"&gt;Arcadia&lt;/a&gt; herself is an amiable sort. I often visit her to make conversation, as she is a fellow &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; far from home. She is, however, a bit old for my taste. A gentleman of advanced years might find in her a worthy companion.\nShould you need your blade sharpened or your armor hammered, &lt;a href=\"Warmaiden%27s\"&gt;Warmaiden's&lt;/a&gt; offers &lt;a href=\"Smithing%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;smithing&lt;/a&gt; services very near the main gate. The smith is a pretty Nord named &lt;a href=\"Adrianne%20Avenicci\"&gt;Adrianne Avenicci&lt;/a&gt;, but she is married to a great hulking brute named &lt;a href=\"Ulfberth%20War-Bear\"&gt;Ulfberth War-Bear&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdrianne is quite fair, but I should not want to find myself being introduced to the keen edge of that husband's war-axe. If married ladies are your preferred sport, then have at, but don't say that you weren't warned!\nNear the smith is the &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Huntsman\"&gt;Drunken Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;. Here some of the wealthier gentlemen gather to share both drink and rumors of the wide world. If your prefer a more distinguished class of company while you sip fine wine, you'll be well at home here.\nOf the Wind District I have little to say. Most of the buildings in this second tier of the city are residences, though there is also a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kynareth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of Kynareth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jorrvaskr\"&gt;Jorrvaskr&lt;/a&gt;, the mead hall of &lt;a href=\"the%20Companions\"&gt;the Companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are some intriguing prospects to be found in the mead hall should you favor a strong and fearless warrior-woman. You will find a little game at the temple, however. The priestess, &lt;a href=\"Danica%20Pure-Spring\"&gt;Danica Pure-Spring&lt;/a&gt;, is interested almost exclusively in spiritual matters.\nAt last we come to the Cloud District, exclusive domain of the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl's&lt;/a&gt; castle. I have had some merry adventures within the stone walls of &lt;a href=\"Dragonsreach\"&gt;Dragonsreach&lt;/a&gt;, let me tell you. The serving girls are most easily impressed by a well spoken &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;. After all, the nights in Skyrim do grow quite cold, if you take my meaning.\nAnd I will not deny that I have visited the town's jail once or twice, which can be found in the lower levels of the palace.\nAs for the Jarl and his court, take pains to avoid them. I find that they lack any sense of humor or appreciation for the Imperial culture. Besides which, they are all wealthy men and so much be viewed as your most serious competition. These Nord are simple folk, after all, and too easily swayed by the sight of fine clothes and a purse full of &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow I will conclude this work by wishing you great success in your pursuits of women and wine. Spare a moment in your revels to think of me, your humble author, and the risks I have taken to bring you this most thorough report on all of interest to the discerning gentleman in the grand city of Whiterun.\nAh, but I will not lie and say it was all a hardship. After all, who could want to sleep alone in such a cold and hard land as this? Not I!"}

He wants to go back there and try to confirm the Black Dragon's claims.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Revelations\"&gt;Dark Revelations&lt;/a&gt;,\" talk to Green-Venom-Tongue. He has learned from &lt;a href=\"Lyra%20Viria\"&gt;Lyra Viria&lt;/a&gt;'s journal that either &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Dragon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt; destroyed his old sanctuary and took the name of Lyra who died in that event, or Lyra herself destroyed the sanctuary and became the Black Dragon. He will ask you to head there with him to help him investigate. \nGreen-Venom-Tongue has arranged for transport, and will ask you to meet him outside of Anvil. There, you will find the cart that will bring you to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, proceed ahead and follow Green-Venom-Tongue to the purified sanctuary in the Ruins of Xith-Izkul. Green-Venom-Tongue will know the password and allow you to head in; speak with him once inside. He will tell you that he has brought a special resin that when burned, reveals hidden secrets. He will also tell you that there may be undead or ghosts roaming these halls, even if the living have abandoned this place. \nThere are four spots within the sanctuary you need to examine; you can do these in any order. In the library in the north of the sanctuary, you will find the remains of one of the assassins; using the resin will show you a vision of Lyra killing her fellow assassin. From here, proceed east to the room with the cages hanging from the ceiling; you can get here by jumping off the bridge or by taking the long way around. The vision here will reveal that Lyra was sanctioned by the Black Hand to perform the purification here. \nHead south from here. The room with the shrine to Sithis houses nothing of note for now, but the room south of that with the hanging skeletons will reveal to you that Lyra really did not want to do this to her comrades. Finally, continue south along the hallway, then turn east and north to the final room. You can either parkour over some rubble or you can choose the long way around. In this final room, you will see Lyra kill an assassin she knew would never betray the Brotherhood. \nAfter seeing all the visions, speak with Green-Venom-Tongue. He will empathize with how hard it must have been for Lyra to purge this sanctuary, but he still has trouble believing she is the Black Dragon. He will implore you to head to the Shrine to Sithis here in the sanctuary; it is where Lyra would often go and pray after a successful mission. There, you will see a vision of Lyra praying to Sithis, after which &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Arawen\"&gt;Speaker Arawen&lt;/a&gt; approaches her and gives her her next mission, to kill the primate of Akatosh in Kvatch. \nTalk to Green-Venom-Tongue about this and he will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Jonas\"&gt;Primate Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Primate%20Artorius\"&gt;Primate Artorius&lt;/a&gt;'s predecessor, did indeed die shortly after these events. He still does not understand what could push Lyra to betray the brotherhood though. Because of this, he will ask you to come to Kvatch with him to use the last of his resin to figure out what happened. \nHead out of the sanctuary and back to &lt;a href=\"Shazara-Ta\"&gt;Shazara-Ta&lt;/a&gt; and her boat. She will bring you back to Anvil; from there, head to Kvatch. Green-Venom-Tongue will be in front of the cathedral. Speak with him and he will use the last bit of his resin to show one final vision of the past. In this vision, you will learn that it was Primate Artorius who performed the black sacrament to have Primate Jonas killed, and that he then promised Lyra redemption should she turn her back on the brotherhood and serve him as his Black Dragon. \nTalk to Green-Venom-Tongue about this and he will tell you to head back to the sanctuary and talk to Astara. Do this to finish the quest."}

With full Fighters Guild membership, the Agent will be paid for completing quests for the Guild, and will improve their reputation to gain ranks within.\nWalkthrough.\nWhen speaking to a Questgiver from one of the Iliac Bay's Fighters Guild Guildhalls, it is revealed to the Agent that a giant has recently moved into the local area. Ordinarily, the Guild would not have to act on this information but a &lt;a href=\"Noble%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;noble&lt;/a&gt; has complained that the giant \"has been having a fine old time feastin' on [their] sheep.\" While the giant has also been feasting on the local villagers, the Noble is paying the Guild to deal with the giant before it eats the rest of his flock, and so the Agent is sent off to kill it in its lair.\nA Bigger Problem.\nThe Questgiver will mark the location of giant's lair, a dungeon, on their map, with the Agent having to enter said dungeon to find the giant within. Other than the giant, the Agent will encounter a random assortment of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Enemies%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;, potentially including several other giants. One of those will be the target giant, although when the target is slain, the Agent will face another issue:\nAs many as six more giants will appear, one by one, to kill the Agent for killing their leader, making the escape much harder than initially thought. They do not need to be killed, however, so all the Agent has to do is escape the dungeon and return to the Questgiver before the time limit expires.\n(Potential) The Next Meal.\nAfter slaying the target giant, the Agent has a one in three chance of coming across a merchant, hiding out in the dungeon after being kidnapped. When spoken to the villager will remark:\nThe Agent has the option to aid the merchant or leave them for dead, although there will be no extra reward for aiding them, other than a reputation boost among the merchants. Should the Agent choose to aid them, they will be asked to take the merchant to their home town, which must be completed before the Agent returns to the Questgiver.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will be paid a random amount of for killing the beast, as well as a standard boost to their &lt;a href=\"reputation%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; within the Guild. Furthermore, the Agent has a one in three chance of receiving a random map from the Questgiver for successfully killing the creature.\nFailing the quest will not only see the Agent forfeit a reward, but also have their standing with the Guild harmed:\nChoosing to save the kidnapped merchant will grant an additional reputation boost:\nRefusing to aid the kidnapped merchant will result in the following loss of reputation:"}

Bet you were mad! You probably stormed back to the market to find the silver-tongued bastard who convinced you it was magical, only to find his stall vacant.\nI know this because you bought that weapon from someone just like me.\nThat's right, I used to pass off the shoddiest merchandise I could get my hands on to folk like you. I'd buy apprentices' failures, find rusted heirlooms at the pawnbroker, and make a profit off people who didn't have much more than big dreams about becoming a hero. Those days are behind me. I've done wrong and want to make amends, so I'm going to arm you with a little knowledge.\nThe best advice is to buy your weapon from a trusted smith. It may not look like much, but you don't need fancy. I passed off cartloads of giant two-handers on youths with starry eyes, but you'll want to start out with something reasonable - a simple, solid one-hander. A warrior's only as good as his weapon, and you won't learn anything with one that's going to fall apart.\nIf you insist on visiting market stalls, your first goal is to get a weapon in-hand. Never purchase anything without giving a nearby post a few good hacks with it first. If the merchant won't let you handle it and keeps coming up with excuses, he's up to something.\nI got good at distracting customers with fancy moves or a sappy yarn. You'd be surprised how easy it is to con someone into a purchase with a tale about how the noble knight's poor widow is just having such a hard time getting by these days, and how, being such a kind-hearted trader, I'm going to take all the profits from his old sword to her anyway - doing an honest deed for a sweet old lady who can't travel to the market on her own.\nDon't let this happen to you. Ignore the chatter, get hold of the weapon, and check it for signs of painted-over rust. Examine the hilt or half with care, look for traces of adhesives where metal contracts other materials. Avoid flashy weapons studded with gems, since you probably can't tell a real jewels from glass fakes. The best cons know just a little bit of illusion magic, too, so be skeptical about supposed magical properties, and make sure you examine the item for more than a few minutes.\nYou should know enough now about what to look for in a good one-hander, and I hope you won't fall for any of these tricks. I'm sorry to anyone I pulled them on in the past, and I wish you the best of luck out in the market and in your training."}

Legends of Dwemer orreries and fabrication chambers abound, but direct, first-hand scholarship remains scant. I have spent my life in search of these Dwarven mega-structures. While I've met with considerable success, there is one mechanism in particular that I am keen to find: the Dwemer &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Resonator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tonal Resonator&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the height of their power, the Dwemer exhibited near total mastery of tonal forces. Even now, countless centuries later, they remain peerless in this respect. Sound, not magic, facilitated their rise to power. I am continually astounded by tonal forces' wide range of uses. The Dwemer used sound in mining, medicine, architecture\u2014even psychology. It's the latter use that I find most intriguing. According to ancient Chimeri scholarship, the Dwemer could employ tonal forces to bend weaker minds to their will\u2014a form of complex aural hypnosis. Luckily, the Dwarves never managed to mobilize this technology on the battlefield against our august ancestors. The scale and complexity of the devices likely made transportation nearly impossible. But they still managed to employ it on a limited scale using massive devices called Tonal Resonators.\nIf the legends are true, these resonators were incredibly complex architectural wonders. They stood taller than the most imposing giants, and filled cavernous chambers with pipes, dials, and pistons. When enabled, the resonators released a series of powerful tones that could alter the brainwaves of lesser mer and men\u2014inducing deep calm and profound pleasure, or even paranoia and terror. The uses for such a device are virtually limitless. Alas, I fear that I will never see one with my own eyes. If such a power could be replicated and perfected, the children of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; could very well reign supreme in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and continents beyond."}

After a hard week of farming, or a long night of being nagged by your wife, there is nothing better than going out for a bit of a fish.\nNow just being alone in the wild, listening to the wind in the trees or the waves on the shore, is good enough for most men. Catching anything of worth is typically the furthest from their minds. And of course that means their neighbors and wives think all they did was sleep in the forest.\nBut true anglers always look to fill up their catch baskets with the largest fish, which can be used for the tastiest dishes. And to do that, you have to know what you are attempting to catch, where they are found and what baits are best to use. Here is a list of common fish found throughout &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trodh\"&gt;Trodh&lt;/a&gt;:\nThese fish are found in the foulest waters possible: &lt;a href=\"sewers\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt;, fetid swamps, and in pools near decomposing corpses. A favorite of city dwellers who don't want to leave the safety of their walls, these fish are drawn to &lt;a href=\"crawlers\"&gt;crawlers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Salmon\"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty\"&gt;River Betty&lt;/a&gt;:\nFresh flowing rivers and streams are the home of these tasty fish.

Using common garden &lt;a href=\"worms\"&gt;worms&lt;/a&gt; and small &lt;a href=\"chub\"&gt;chub&lt;/a&gt; will entice the largest of these fish.\nI hope that this helps you when you next decide to go out and fish, my son. At least this way you will come home with a full catch and no one will accuse you of wasting your day."}

Those are the ones that produce the widest range of sounds.\nFirst, find a few of the green moss-foot croakers in the bushes that grow in the marsh east of &lt;a href=\"Lilmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lilmoth&lt;/a&gt;. They are quite docile and easy to catch.\nSecond, look for the ruby hoppers. These rare, red frogs, like to sun themselves on stones near water around Lilmoth. You have to sneak up on them, though, or they get frightened and hop away. If that happens, the scared hoppers often hide by the big tree at the center of town.\nCatching indigo tree frogs is a little more complicated. After you locate the trees where they nest, you need to gather some fleshflies. The blue frogs love them! Release the fleshflies beneath the tree. When the frogs hop down to feast, just grab them.\nFinally, sun-blessed toads will prove to be the most difficult of the frogs to catch. To lure them out of their mud pit, you need to trick them into thinking it's time to mate. To do that, you first need to gather the ingredients to make a scent that will attract the frogs and draw them out of hiding.\nTo make the scent, you need to gather the following plants: stench sedge, salt rush, and joymallow. Then combine them to create toad musk. Once you have the musk, locate a toad mud pit. Then pour the toad musk onto yourself and use the croak-wheel. Between the scent of the musk and the croaks emerging from the wheel, you are sure to attract sun-blessed toads that you can catch.\nGood luck!"}

Every thought, word, and gesture, no matter how trivial, must glorify the Three. Our appearance, too, must bring honor to ALMSIVI. Herein you shall find a guide to liturgical vestment.\nAt the beginning of the vesting, an Ordinator must wash herself thoroughly, using mineral water from one of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;'s sacred hot springs and a volcanic pumice. This act has profound spiritual significance. In washing the body, the Ordinator also washes the soul\u2014removing residual sin and any nagging doubts that might interfere with the merciless application of Tribunal law.\nOnce the washing is complete, the proper vesting can begin.\nThe Ordinator begins with the rathith\u2014triangular linen small clothes, dyed a deep blue and fastened with brass pins. The rathith is further secured by the arnith, the golden \"underbelt\" which is also secured using brass pins. Daughters of ALMSIVI are also permitted to wear the alrathith, a second garment tailored to support the breasts.\nWith the rathith and alrathith secured, the Ordinator is free to move on to the llananor, or \"second garment.\" This long shirt must be washed in sacred mineral water before the sun rises, and pressed thrice over a hot stone. When donning the llananor, the Ordinator must also recite the Litany of Three Virtues. If the Ordinator completes the litany before the shirt is fully donned, they are obliged to repeat the litany twice more before moving on to the next step of the vesting.\nThe Ordinator's pants, or felassani, must also be washed and thrice pressed before wearing. Ordinators should put on these trousers starting with the left foot and must fasten them using a blue, rope-like belt called a nosa. The slippers must likewise be worn starting with the left foot, and laced with gold ribbon.\nFinally, the Ordinator must drape a crimson wool stole, or duleso, about the neck and shoulders thrice, and fasten it with a triangular golden reliquary clasp\u2014a neleviso. This ends the first vesting, or llanathro'lani, and prepares the Ordinator for armor-suiting.\nBefore the holy armor can be donned, the Ordinator must recite the Forty-Six Canticles of Supplication, and appeal to St. &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; the Captain, patron of warriors and defender of Dunmeri society, for protection. After receiving Nerevar's blessing, the Ordinator begins armor inspection.\nThe Armor of Triune Faith must be free of any nicks, dents, stains, corrosion, or other aesthetic imperfections. Even minor blemishes are affronts to ALMSIVI's divine persons. Ordinators found wearing imperfect armor shall be subject to severe sanction.\nThe polish should be thorough and uniform, but not garish. The chitinous undervest must be rubbed with an oiled cloth and flexed to prevent aging and distress. Furthermore, the Ordinator should oil all joints, and treat all leather with a firm brushing and a liberal application of kwama-wax armor dressing. At this point, the Ordinator should signal an initiate to prepare for armor fitting.\nThe initiate begins with the sabatons and greaves (starting with the left) while reciting a prayer to St. Rilms, patron of pilgrims. Once this devotional is complete, the initiate proceeds to the cuisses, reciting another prayer to &lt;a href=\"Meris\"&gt;St. Meris&lt;/a&gt;, patron of laborers. At this point, the Ordinator must anoint the breastplate with sacred mineral oil and recite another prayer of supplication to blessed St. Nerevar before handing it over to the initiate. After fastening the cuirass, the initiate moves on to the rerebraces and couters, reciting another devotional to St. Aralor the Penitent. After securing and lacing the pauldrons, the inititate should glove the Ordinator, starting with the left gauntlet, all the while reciting a prayer to &lt;a href=\"Delyn\"&gt;St. Delyn the Wise&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the initiate must drape the blue prayer stole, or retheles, over the warrior's shoulders, reciting a final prayer to St. Felms the Bold. This accomplished, the assistant is permitted to retreat to the chapel for post-vesting prayer.\nFinal armor preparations are left to the Ordinator herself. Using the left hand, the Ordinator must tuck a sprig of bittergreen beneath her right pauldron. Using the right hand, the Ordinator must trace the sign of the Tribunal on her chest\u2014gnashing her teeth and hissing thrice, at each point of the triune to summon up the wrath of the Tribunal. The tinder of faith thus kindled, the Ordinator anoints the Golden Mask of Devotion with mineral oil, presses her forehead to the helm to likewise anoint herself, then dons the helm. Ordinators may now arm themselves with any weapon, so long as it is thoroughly cleaned, and thrice blessed before use.\nAt this point, any action of the Ordinator is protected by divine mandate. So long as she wears the mask, the Ordinator is considered a faultless hand of the Three, and is authorized to commit any martial action deemed necessary to protect the True Faith. &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20Almalexia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hands of Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and other specialized members of the order may have additional vestments to wear, but any servant of the Three thus vested is considered a full Ordinator.\nKeep to this guide, stay earnest in your prayers, and you will bring naught but glory to ALMSIVI.\nVictory for the Three."}

No, you think of a fine &lt;a href=\"Greatswords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Greatsword&lt;/a&gt;, gleaming in the sun, slicing through enemies just as easily as it cuts the air and singing against &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armored&lt;/a&gt; foes sent staggering by the force of it's strikes. That is a hero's weapon.\nI have spent long hours observing the soldiers training in the courtyard below my chambers. It is quite clear to me that the strongest, bravest, smartest, and most handsome of the warriors always choose the greatsword (trust me). It balances brute force with skillful maneuvers, and it is neither as clumsy as a hammer or &lt;a href=\"Axes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; nor as easily broken as a smaller &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Bow%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;.

When you see someone striding into town covered in &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt; with a greatsword in tow, you know you're looking at the very face of daring. A greatsword wielder doesn't fear injury, he charges into battle knowing that foes will flee or suffer grave consequences. You might feel a bit faint as they walk by, overwhelmed by such valiant sight.One who wields such a sword shows they embody the hero's approach: to master all aspects of combat. I watch them train their endurance and strength by lifting and running, see them practice moving and dodging. Greatsword wielders train harder than all the other soldiers and are much stronger\u2014that is quite clear.\nNot everyone is cut out for heroism, and not every soldier or adventurer will have legends crafted from their deeds. If you aspire to more than just your duty or daily work, as feel the call of battle, then I advise you to set your sights high, aspire to master the greatsword!"}

He will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"Mind your step. I would not want you to step on this random patch of grass. I jest, of course. The Telvanni force me to work, but I make sure it brings them no pleasure. I see you wear no shackles. Do you seek work? I know someone who needs help.\"\nThe Vestige must now search out Sun-in-Shadow in Tel Naga. She can be found sweeping the floor in the central chamber. After approaching, she will say the following:\n\"Yes? Can I help you, serjo?\"\nNow that the Vestige knows their objective, they will speak to Magister Therana's Mouth, Eraven Onthim. Because Sun-in-Shadow believes he possesses a letter containing information regarding what Therana is looking for in Zaintiraris, the Vestige must search his chambers. Upon entering his chambers, however, they will encounter Brelan Neloren:\n\"Master Eraven is away on business. Has been for some time, in fact. I know a prowler when I see one. What do you want?\"\nThat seem fair. Where is Ethrandora? \"She spends most of her time in the study, here in the Council Hall. She's very diligent. Always leaning over one book or another. And the way she licks her thumb when she turns the pages \u2026. Sorry. You'll find her in the study. Yes.\"\nThe Vestige will find Ehtrandora in the Wizards' Study. They will have to pickpocket the poem from her and return it to Brelan. He will thank the Vestige profusely and point them towards Master Eraven's correspondence box, noting that \"I sure hope I didn't leave Master Eraven's correspondence box unlocked. That would be careless in the extreme.\"\nAfter taking the letter from said correspondence box, the Vestige will have to return to Sun-in-Shadow to discuss how to proceed from here. Reading the letter will reveal Magister Therana is searching Zaintiraris, a shrine to &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt;, for a saint's relic; that of &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Felms\"&gt;Saint Felms&lt;/a&gt;. It appears the shrine is locked, however, protected by a puzzle-ward. Luckily, the letter provides some hints on how to break in. Sun-in-Shadow requests the Vestige travels to Zaintiraris, breaks into the shrine, grab the relic and offer it to Therana on her behalf.\nUpon entering Zaintiraris and disposing of the hostile occupants, the Vestige will encounter a scribbled note next to a dead &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt;. The note offers some insight into the puzzle that protects the entrance of the shrine, notably the effects it had on the deranged author. The solution to the puzzle above the Zaintiraris entrance is as follows: The brazier near the two skulls, then the one with three, then the one with five, then six.\nNow that the Vestige has gained access to the shrine, they will have to make their way to the central chamber. Along the way, the Vestige will find a \"&lt;a href=\"Shrine%20Scavenging%20Journal\"&gt;Shrine Scavenging Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" lying on the ground next to a deceased &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;. The journal details a previous expedition into the Mad God's shrine, telling the events that preceded the Nord's faith. It also references a key to open the main gate, located in another worship room in the back of the shrine. Continuing deeper into the shrine and fighting off Sheogorath's many minions will eventually lead the Vestige to the Inner Sanctum of the shrine. Upon entering, they will have to defeat the &lt;a href=\"watcher\"&gt;watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Izhavi%20the%20Petty\"&gt;Izhavi the Petty&lt;/a&gt;, who guards the key.\nAfter defeating the creature, the Vestige must take the peculiar key that it guarded and use it to open the gates to the central chamber of the shrine. Once there, they must defeat more of Sheogorath's minions and grab the relic; the finger bone of Saint Felms. They must then return to Tel Branora to give the finger bone to Magister Therana on behalf of Sun-in-Shadows.\nMaking their way up to Therana's chambers in the Tel Branora tower, the Vestige will encounter her reading a book:\n\"Oh, excellent. Another clumsy adventurer bumbles into my home. I really must put a hex on that lift \u2026. Have you come to rob me? That would go very poorly for you.\"\nNow that Magister Therana has agreed to sponsor Sun-in-Shadow's appeal for freedom, the Vestige must take the sponsorship writ to Eraven Othrim. Surprised, he notes that Sun-in-Shadow has always been ambitious and agrees to take the writ to the Council Chamber for evaluation. In the Council Chamber, Sun-in-Shadow will thank the Vestige for their help and reward them."}

Whether such an account is mere exaggeration or a spectacular truth, no one is certain. What is certain, however, is that Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; ordered the prison's construction, and &lt;a href=\"Pelladil%20Direnni\"&gt;Pelladil Direnni&lt;/a&gt; dutifully\u2014or boastfully\u2014fulfilled the order by summoning an army of stone atronachs to perform the labor.\nThough often thought to be built adjacent to the city, the prison's location is actually a day's march south, within the dangers of the swamp but accessible from the coast. This isolated location was specifically chosen to deter prisoners from escaping its confines. Few non-natives have been known to successfully traverse the dangers of &lt;a href=\"Murkmire\"&gt;Murkmire&lt;/a&gt;, especially those as ill-equipped as escaped prisoners would be.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; prisoners were sent to Blackrose Prison only for the most heinous or politically charged crimes. This was where men and mer alike were sent when the reigning power wished to never see them again. As such, the accountability of the prison staff was near non-existent. The brutality and cruelty that these prisoners faced was, by all accounts, particularly horrid.\nGiven its convenient location, all Murkmire natives who conflicted with Imperial power would wind up within Blackrose Prison as well. &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;s in particular were apt to find their way here, given their rebellious nature against Imperial oppression. Even among their fellow prisoners, Nagas were treated with particular disdain, most likely provoked by their aggressive culture and drastic appearance. It is theorized that an increase in the Naga prisoner population, as well as a decline in Imperial power in the region, led to the mass riots that eventually forced Blackrose Prison to be abandoned.\nIn the years following its abandonment, the prison was taken over by the very prisoners who were rumored to liberate it. Reclaiming that which once imprisoned them, they swore to eradicate any Imperials who dared to threaten their homeland. They called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blackguards\"&gt;Blackguards&lt;/a&gt;, and swore loyalty to none but themselves.\nThis claim was not well received by the surrounding tribes, who believed that such values went against the very cornerstones of their culture. One Argonian I spoke to had this to say on the matter: \"The Blackguards, they have stone hearts and sour bellies, hiding from change within their stone nest. Always they look back, never forward. It is because of this that the tribes would not support them. And now they are little more than bandits.\"\nIndeed, no matter how heroic their original ideals might have been, the Blackguards are now known as the largest crime organization within Murkmire. Within the last decade, they have even begun to allow non-Argonian members in their ranks; including, yes, the very Imperials that they once so adamantly fought against.\nUnfortunately, I will not be able to write of the current condition of Blackrose Prison, due to the dangers the Blackguards present. An unfortunate circumstance, due to the rich history such a visit would offer."}

The first use of the name Daggerfall to refer to the area around the current capitol was most probably in the &lt;a href=\"1E%20246\"&gt;246th&lt;/a&gt; year of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. The north half of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, in fact all of the current province of &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, was conquered by invading &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; who brought a rough sort of civilization with them. One of the first civilized acts the Nords performed was a census\u2014the so-called &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Life\"&gt;Book of Life&lt;/a&gt;. Listed on page 933 of the Book is this entry:\n\"\"North of the Highest bluffs, south of the moors, west of the hills, and east of the sea is called DAGGERFALL. 110 men, 93 women, 13 &lt;a href=\"children\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; under 8 years of age, 58 &lt;a href=\"Cow%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Cows&lt;/a&gt;, 7 bulls, 63 chickens, 11 cocks, 38 hogs live here.\"\"\nNearly four thousand years after this census was taken, we can see that these two hundred and sixteen people have multiplied heartily. The last census, in the year &lt;a href=\"3E%20401\"&gt;3E 401&lt;/a&gt;, lists the population at over 110,000. It is always difficult to find an exact number, but the capitol city of Daggerfall certainly outnumbers her rivals, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt has been a , if not actually helpful amusement of historians to find the origin of placenames. Daggerfall, by tradition, is said to refer to the knife the first chieftain threw to form the borders of his lands. But there are other legends that may have equal validity.\nThe Daggerfall entry from the Book of Life actually supports one theory about the reason for Daggerfall's longevity. The people were coastal fishermen, but they also found the land itself sufficiently rich to support raising livestock. This inclination of the early citizenry toward reinforcing their principal products brought stability to a fickle land.\nDaggerfall thrived during the years of the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; occupancy. When the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; killed King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%20369\"&gt;1E 369&lt;/a&gt;, the northlands engaged in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt; and Skyrim, greatly weakened, lost her holdings in High Rock and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. The Iliac Bay had become important strategically, and Daggerfall began to expand her military.\nThere were multiple opportunities for her to exercise this army and navy during the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; conflicts with the force of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt;. The Dirennis were native &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; and Bretons are hardly ever given to excessive religion. Daggerfall became a minor base of operations for the Dirennis and their allies. &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Direnni\"&gt;Raven Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, the enchantress whose magic helped secure the final victory over the Alessians in the &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Glenumbria Moors&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the earliest occupants of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Daggerfall\"&gt;Castle Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver the centuries that followed, the Dirennis felt into obscurity, but Daggerfall continued her growth. In &lt;a href=\"1E%20609\"&gt;1E 609&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Thagore\"&gt;King Thagore&lt;/a&gt; of Daggerfall defeated the army of &lt;a href=\"Glenpoint%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Glenpoint&lt;/a&gt; and became the preeminant economic, cultural, and military force in southern High Rock. A position the kingdom has precariously kept ever since.\nIronically, it was another successful military exercise three hundred and seventy years later that ended Daggerfall's monopoly of Bay trade: the annihilation of the &lt;a href=\"Orc%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; capitol &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; by a joint effort of Daggerfall, the new kingdom of Sentinel, and the now extinct &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Diagna\"&gt;Order of Diagna&lt;/a&gt;. The scattering of the orcs from southeastern High Rock made the river route to the Bay more accessible. The tiny village of Wayrest grew like a flower that no longer feared the mow. In twenty years, Wayrest's trade profits Daggerfall's. In forty years, Wayrest was the acknowledged master of Iliac Bay trade. In one hundred and twenty years, Wayrest became the Kingdom of Wayrest.\nThe Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; did not exhibit Wayrest's aggrandizement during the First Era. The &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; were warriors learning the ways of the &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, and their land was enemy enough to keep their population checked. Indeed, the number of people in all areas of the Iliac Bay was halved once in the First Era by the &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;Thrassian Plague&lt;/a&gt;, once again by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;War of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt;, and a third time by the invading . If Daggerfall had not spent its first thousand years preparing for the battles of the next thousand years, it is indeed conceivable that the Iliac Bay today might be Akavarian.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, like the latter part of the First Era, is a tapestry of wars, insurrections, and plagues. Daggerfall, Sentinel, and Wayrest continued to expand and improve their military and economic positions in the Bay. Daggerfall and Wayrest would transpose positions as major trading center of the Bay, and Daggerfall and Sentinel likewise bandied over which was the superior military power.\nThe Iliac Bay has continued to hold an important position in the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; government of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Rarely allies (though the combined armies in opposition to the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Usurper\"&gt;Camoran Usurper&lt;/a&gt; in the 3rd century of the 3rd Era is a notable exception), but not always enemies, Daggerfall, Sentinel, and Wayrest have weathered the storms of contention, plague, famine, and pestilence. The recent &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Betony\"&gt;War of Betony&lt;/a&gt; was typical of Iliac Bay warfare: sincere, frighteningly violent, and peaceably resolved."}

Merchants and travelers alike walk its muddy streets, the rampant humidity causing sweat to pearl against their skin. In all of Black Marsh, you will find no town quite so cultivated.\nIn fact, you are unlikely to come across a town at all, as decades have passed since the time of &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; occupation. One sees only shadows of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s influence now, such as when visiting Old Imperial Lilmoth. There you will find a gallery of half-sunken villas, covered in moss and decay. The swamp has indeed reclaimed this place, just as the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed Black Marsh.\nScaly hands, however, did not lay out the foundation of Lilmoth. You can immediately see this in its distinctive name, which refers to the vulpine race that founded the town. Unfortunately, you will find no &lt;a href=\"Lilmothiit\"&gt;Lilmothiit&lt;/a&gt; in Lilmoth now, as the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt; killed off all such inhabitants. Merchants from all over Tamriel, as well as Argonian travelers from nearby tribes, now occupy the town.\nGiven the lack of a proper power structure, a council of highly influential merchants tends to most of the town's affairs. They see to the port tariffs and hire guards to patrol Lilmoth's streets. They also dispense justice to all non-natives, using an informal court system. It is well known, however, that a well-placed bribe is likely to settle matters far quicker than a well-spoken defense.\nMurkmire natives have a less structured system of justice. While tree-minders and war chiefs tend to settle most conflicts within the surrounding tribes, Lilmoth has no such legal system in place. In my year in Lilmoth, I have noticed that many Argonians defer to an elderly Argonian by the name of &lt;a href=\"Sulahkeesh\"&gt;Sulahkeesh&lt;/a&gt;. What her role in their society is, I am uncertain, though it appears that the native population sees her as a well-respected arbitrator.\nThough still a bit rough around the edges, Lilmoth has come far from its origins as a den of war, piracy, and political struggle. You will find it now to be a lovely destination for all who wish to sample Murkmire's exotic mystery without risking the dangers of its expansive swamps. It's a must-see location for any who are fascinated with the eccentricities of Argonian culture, such as myself."}

It wasn't easy to compile this information. I wouldn't have been able to do so at all were it not for a few patient miners who dealt with my constant questions with only slight annoyance and threat to my physical being.\nAfter leaving &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, the founding Orcs of the Mor Khazgur clan found a prosperous, rich mine and decided to settle there. In the early days, the mine was self-sustaining. The place overflowed with resources and the Orcs settled into a rhythm. They built their settlement around the mine and flourished.\nThe current mine Overseer, &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Thulsgreg\"&gt;Overseer Thulsgreg&lt;/a&gt;, comes from a long line of leadership. His grandfather and father were the chiefs of the clan before him. They led the clan during a sort of golden age of the mine, when the mines themselves flourished. The clan saw a good deal of success and comfortable living even separated from &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was always assumed that Thulsgreg would inherit the mine from his father. Which is strange, considering he married beforehand. This clan isn't strictly traditional, but even still, that came as quite a shock to me.\nUnfortunately for him, as his father began to prepare to pass down the title, the Mor Khazgur mines dried up. Not completely, mind you, but the decline was quick and noticeable. The once prospering clan was suddenly confronted with the very real possibility of dying out. The mine would dry up, and they would have nothing left.\nThankfully, a new chief stepped up. A strong, young Orc named &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Urzikh\"&gt;Urzikh&lt;/a&gt; challenged Thulsgreg for the title. She won, and immediately instated new mining practices to bring the clan back to its former glory."}

In contrast, rejecting the offer will result in the Agent having to escape the guards and get back to the Schemer whom gave them the quest before the time limit expires.\nRewards.\nSuccessfully returning to the Schemer with the gem before the time limit expires will see the Agent handed a random amount of , as well as boost in reputation with the Guild, the Schemer, and the Guild's associated factions. Conversely failing the quest will see the Agent lose reputation, with a varying number of penalties based on how the quest is failed.\nThe changes in reputation, based on success or failure, are outlined below:\nFailing the quest through failing to return the gem will result in the following additional penalties:\nFailing the quest by handing the gem to the guard will result in even more severe penalties:"}

The letter is revealed to be a warning from a \"renowned vampire hunter,\" who threatens to slay the Agent unless they cure their vampirism. To do so, the hunter states that the Agent must kill their \"Bloodfather,\" an action that will \"rid [the region] of a cancer at its heart.\"\nHowever, the Hunter does not know either whom nor where the Agent's Bloodfather can be found, although they do have a lead. Indeed, the Hunter's letter notes that one of their \"sources\" knows of \"one high in [the Agent's bloodline] who should have this information.\" With that, the Agent faces a choice: Ignore the letter, allow the time limit expire, and be harassed by &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;vampire hunters&lt;/a&gt;; or seek out the bloodline vampire mentioned in the letter.\nAn Understandable Urge.\nShould the Agent choose to seek out the vampire mentioned by the Hunter, they will have to find them in the town identified in the letter. Upon speaking with the vampire, however, the Agent will be offered a choice: Either show them the Hunter's letter; or, ask about their Bloodfather.\nAn Advanced Warning.\nShowing the vampire the letter will result in the following response:\nWith that, the Agent has no choice but to let the time limit expire and face the Hunter's hoards.\nA Privileged Youth.\nInstead, the Agent may choose not to show the bloodline vampire the letter, in which case the vampire will reveal that knowing the name of a Bloodfather is \"a privilege not usually granted to one of your youth.\" However, while the vampire does not know precisely whom the Agent's Bloodfather is, they are willing to acquiesce to the Agent's \"urge.\" They offer the names of two potential \"Elders\" and their lairs, although they recommend instead speak with the \"Keeper of the Bloodline,\" residing in another town.\nThe Keeper's Knowledge.\nThe Agent is again faced with a choice, either go and slay the two Elders, or meet with the Keeper of the Bloodline. Should the Agent chose to meet with the Keeper, they must head to the town mentioned by the bloodline vampire within three days, taking a &lt;a href=\"Clothing%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;bracelet&lt;/a&gt; handed to them by the bloodline vampire as a show of good faith. Upon meeting the Keeper and showing them the bracelet the Agent will be told:\nWith that, the Agent should head off to find, and fight, their Bloodfather.\nTime Ticks On.\nHowever, if the time limit to meet with the Keeper expires, the Agent will be faced with a new challenge. Indeed, failing to meet the Keeper will result in the Agent being hunted by their fellow &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; by night. When struck, one of the vampires stalking the Agent will shout:\nWith that the Agent either has to sit out the rest of the quest, and face the Hunter's hoards, or guess which of the two Elders is their Bloodfather and slay them.\nA Purifying Patricide.\nHaving either been given the precise dungeon location, or simply decided to kill both Elders, the Agent must head into the Bloodfather's lair, which will always be the second dungeon identified by the Bloodline vampire. Once inside, the Agent will find a &lt;a href=\"vampire%20ancient\"&gt;vampire ancient&lt;/a&gt;, who reveals themselves as the Bloodfather when struck by stating:\nThe Agent must then kill their Bloodfather, whose death will result in the Agent's vampirism being instantly cured. Indeed, this will be indicated by both a notification, and the Agent's portrait being restored to its pre-vampiric state.\nAn \"Innocent\" Elder.\nShould the Agent guess incorrectly, or decided to take out both Elders, then they must head to the first dungeon listed by the Bloodline vampire, containing another vampire ancient. This ancient, however, will not be remotely receptive to the Agent, uttering when struck:\nThe Elder's death will result in a huge penalty to the Agent's reputation with their bloodline, but will not lift the curse of vampirism from them.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will not receive any kind of reward for completing the quest through the curing of their vampirism, although they will suffer some major reputation penalties with their former Clan. In contrast simply ignoring, and therefore effectively failing the quest, will see no changes to the Agent's reputation\nThe changes in reputation, based on how far the Agent takes their hunt of cure, are outlined below:"}

All around we hear wolves howling. A bloodied reptilian figure, SCHIAVAS, breaks through the branches of one of the trees and surveys the area.\nSCHIAVAS: It's clear.\nINZOLIAH, a beautiful &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; mage, climbs down from the tree, helped by the barbarian. There is the sound of footsteps nearby. Schiavas readies his sword and Inzoliah prepares to cast a spell. Nothing comes out.\nINZOLIAH: You're bleeding. You should have Dolcettus heal that for you.\nSCHIAVAS: He's still drained from all the spells he had to cast down in the caves. I'm fine. If we get out of this and no one needs it more, I'll take the last potion of healing. Where's Malvasian?\nMALVASIAN, a High Elf &lt;a href=\"battlemage\"&gt;battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, and DOLCETTUS, a &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; healer, emerge from the tree, carrying a heavy chest between the two of them. They awkwardly try to get down from the tree, carrying their loot.\nMALVASIAN: Here I am, though why I'm carrying the heavy load is beyond me. I always thought that the advantage of dungeon delving with a great barbarian was that he carried all the loot.\nSCHIAVAS: If I carried that, my hands would be too full to fight. And tell me if I'm wrong, but not one of the three of you has enough magicka reserved to make it out of here alive. Not after you electrified and blasted all those homunculuses down below ground.\nDOLCETTUS: Homunculi.\nSCHIAVAS: Don't worry, I'm not going to do what you think I'm going to do.\nINZOLIAH (innocently): What's that?\nSCHIAVAS: Kill you all and take the Ebony Mail for myself. Admit it -- you thought I had that in mind.\nDOLCETTUS: What a perfectly horrible thought. I never thought anyone, no matter how vile and degenerate --\nINZOLIAH: Why not?\nMALVASIAN: He needs porters, like he said. He can't carry the chest and fight off the inhabitants of Eldengrove both.\nDOLCETTUS: By &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, of all the mean, conniving, typically Argonian --\nINZOLIAH: And why do you need me alive?\nSCHIAVAS: I don't necessarily. Except that you're prettier than the other two, for a smoothskin that is. And if something comes after us, it might go for you first.\nThere is a noise in some bushes nearby.\nSCHIAVAS: Go check that out.\nINZOLIAH: It's probably a wolf. These woods are filled with them. You check it out.\nSCHIAVAS: You have a choice, Inzoliah. Go and you might live. Stay here, and you definitely won't.\nInzoliah considers and then goes to the bushes.\nSCHIAVAS (to Malvasian and Dolcettus): The king of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; will pay good money for the Mail, and we can divide it more nicely between three than four.\nINZOLIAH: You're so right.\nInzoliah suddenly levitates up to the top of the stage. A semi-transparent Ghost appears from the bush and rushes at the next person, who happens to be Schiavas. As the barbarian screams and thrashes at it with his sword, it levels blasts of whirling gas at him. He crumbles to the ground. It turns next to Dolcettus, the healer, and as the Ghost focuses its feasting chill on the hapless Dolcettus, Malvasian casts a ball of flame at it that causes it to vaporize into the misty air.\nInzoliah floats back down to the ground as Malvasian examines the bodies of Dolcettus and Schiavas, who are both white-faced from the draining power of the ghost.\nMALVASIAN: You had some magicka reserved after all.\nINZOLIAH: So did you. Are they dead?\nMalvasian takes the potion of healing from Dolcettus's pack.\nMALVASIAN: Yes. Fortunately, the potion of healing wasn't broken when he fell. Well, I guess this leaves just the two of us to collect the reward.\nINZOLIAH: We can't get out of this place without each other. Like it or not.\nThe two battlemages pick up the chest and begin plodding carefully through the undergrowth, pausing from time to time at the sound of footsteps or other eerie noises.\nMALVASIAN: Let me make sure I understand. You have a little bit of magicka left, so you elected to use it to make Schiavas the ghost's target, forcing me to use most of my limited reserve to destroy the creature so I wouldn't be more powerful than you. That's first-rate thinking.\nINZOLIAH: Thank you. It's only logical. Do you have enough power to cast any other spells?\nMALVASIAN: Naturally. An experienced battlemage always knows a few minor but highly effective spells for just such a trial. I take it you, too, have a few tricks up your sleeve?\nINZOLIAH: Of course, like you said.\nThey pause for a moment before continuing as a fearful wail pierces the air. When it dies away, they slowly trudge on.\nINZOLIAH: Just as an intellectual exercise, I wonder what spell you would cast at me if we made it out of here without any more combat.\nMALVASIAN: I hope you're not implying that I would dream of killing you so I would keep the treasure all to myself.\nINZOLIAH: Of course not, nor would I do that to you. It is merely an intellectual exercise.\nMALVASIAN: Well, in that case, purely as an intellectual exercise, I would probably cast a leech spell on you, to take away your life force and heal myself. After all, there are brigands on the road between here and Silvenar, and a wounded battlemage with a valuable artifact would make a tempting target. I'd hate to survive Eldengrove merely to die in the open.\nINZOLIAH: That's a well-reasoned response. As for myself, again, not saying I would ever do this, but I think a simple, sudden electrical bolt would serve my purposes admirably. I agree about the danger of brigands, but don't forget, we also have a potion of healing. I could easily slay you and heal myself to full capacity.\nMALVASIAN: Very true. It would end up a question then of whose spell was more effective at that instant. If our spells counteracted one another and I leeched your life energy only to be crippled by your lightning bolt, then we could both be killed. Or so near death that a mere potion of healing would scarcely help either one of us, let alone both. How ironic it would be if two scheming battlemages, not saying we are scheming but for the purpose of this intellectual exercise, were left on the brink of death, completely drained of magicka, with one healing potion to choose from. Who would get it then?\nINZOLIAH: Logically, whoever drank it first, which in this case would be you since you're holding it. Now, what if one of us were injured, but not killed?\nMALVASIAN: Logic would dictate that a scheming battlemage would take the potion, leaving the injured party to the mercy of the elements, I suppose.\nINZOLIAH: That does seem most sensible. But suppose that the battlemages, while certainly scheming types, had a certain respect for one another. Perhaps in that case, the victorious one might, for instance, put the potion up a tree near his or her gravely wounded victim. Then when the wounded party had enough magicka replenished, he or she would be able to levitate to the tree branches and recover the potion. By that time, the victorious battlemage would have already collected the reward.\nThey pause for a moment at the sound of something in the bushes nearby. Carefully, they climb across the branches of a tree to bypass it.\nMALVASIAN: I understand what you're saying, but it seems out of character for our hypothetic scheming battlemage to allow his or her victim to live.\nINZOLIAH: Perhaps. But it's been my observation that most scheming battlemages enjoy the feeling of having bested someone in combat, and having that person alive to live with the humiliation.\nMALVASIAN: These hypothetical scheming battlemages sound ... (excitedly) Daylight! Do you see it?\nThe two scurry across the branch dropping behind a bush, so we can no longer see them. We can, however, see the shimmering halo of sunlight.\nMALVASIAN (behind the tall bush): We made it.\nINZOLIAH (likewise, behind the tall bush): Indeed.\nThere is a sudden explosion of electrical energy and a wild howling aura of red light, and then silence. After a few moment's pause, we hear someone climbing up the tree. It is Malvasian, putting the potion high up in the bough. He chuckles as he climbs back down and the curtain drops.\nEpilogue.\nThe curtain rises on a road to Silvenar. A gang of bandits have surrounded Malvasian, who is propped up on his staff, barely able to stand. They pull his chest away from him with ease.\nBANDIT #1: What have we got here? Don't you know it ain't safe to be out on the road, all sick like you are? Why don't we help you with your load?\nMALVASIAN (weakly): Please ... Let me be ...\nBANDIT #2: Go on, spellcaster, fight us for it!\nMALVASIAN: I can't ... too weak ...\nSuddenly, Inzoliah flies in, casting lightning bolts from her fingers at the bandits, who quickly scramble away. She lands on the ground and picks up the chest. Malvasian collapses, dying.\nMALVASIAN: Hypothetically, what if ... a battlemage cast a spell on another which didn't harm him at once, but ... drained his life force and his magicka, bit by bit, so he wouldn't know at the time, but ... feel confident enough to leave the potion of healing behind?\nINZOLIAH: A most treacherous battlemage she'd be.\nMALVASIAN: And ... hypothetically ... would she be likely to help her fallen foe ... so that she could enjoy the humiliation of him continuing ... to live?\nINZOLIAH: From my experience, hypothetically, no. She doesn't sound like a fool.\nAs Inzoliah lugs the chest off toward Silvenar, and Malvasian expires on the stage, we drop the curtain."}

An old pack within the ancient ruins inside Bonerock Cavern contained a Khajiit medallion. Could it be a clue to Zhasim's origin?\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest is initiated from an old pack within the puzzle chamber in Bonerock Cavern that leads to Bonerock Ruins. The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; may interact with it.\n\"&lt;The old pack contains a medallion on a long, silver chain. Two moons are etched upon the metal coin. It looks like Khajiit crafting.&gt;\"\nUpon obtaining the medallion, Zhasim will comment:\n\"Find anything interesting?\"\nShow the medallion to Zhasim. It is exactly like the one left to him at birth. Zhasim will suspect that this place holds the key to his origins, and that solving the pillar puzzle here will grant him clues. You will find a book nearby called \"&lt;a href=\"Kal-Eeto%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Kal-Eeto's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" that will contain the solution to the puzzle. \nThe solution is Torch-Hammer-Wolf. Once you have twisted the pillars correctly, a small coffer will appear in the east of the room. It will contain \"&lt;a href=\"Zayshara%27s%20First%20Note\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt;\" from Zhasim's mother, stating that she suspects that her son who wandered off into the snow somehow survived. Upon reading this, Zhasim will remember the names of his birth parents. He will head deeper into the ruins to uncover more; follow him into the next room and you will find \"&lt;a href=\"The%20King%27s%20Riddle\"&gt;a note&lt;/a&gt;\" with a knife stuck in it. Read it to learn the following riddle:\nWhere is the armored soldier, tall and brave?\nSword in hand, he lies in the covered grave.\nWhere is the hunt-wife with axe and bow?\nThe claws of a bear brought her low.\nWhere is the knight with the golden blade?\nFighting the monster deep in the glade.\nWhere is the king on the broken throne?\nNo knight nor soldiers protect his home.\nHis table is empty, not even a bone,\nThe king is sad and always alone.\nTo solve this puzzle, first examine the closed sarcophagus in the room, then the open one. After that, examine the tapestry showing someone fighting a monster. Finally, examine the empty table, and another small coffer will appear on top of it. it will contain \"&lt;a href=\"Zayshara%27s%20Second%20Note\"&gt;another note&lt;/a&gt;\" from Zhasim's mother, detailing how Zhasim got separated from the group. \nHead directly north to find the final riddle, in the dead end. You will find another note there, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Moons%20Rhyme\"&gt;The Moons Rhyme&lt;/a&gt;\". It will talk about a smiling moon. After reading it, Zhasim will remark that the vase here resembles a smiling moon. You will also find vases resembling a tall moon and the twin moons here. You should place these in accordance with the riddle: \nLittle moon, like a smile,\nSet in a golden style.\nLittle moon, a gilded twin,\nAdorned with a broad, wide grin.\nTall moon, proud moon,\nHigher in the sky, it sets too soon.\nThree moons in the night,\nWhat an unusual sight.\nPlace the moons, per the rule,\nBeside the small, tranquil pool.\nTall moon, smiling moon, and the gilded twin,\nSet them right and the game you will win.\nThe tall vase goes on the higher platform, while the smaller vases go on the smaller ones to the sides of the pool. This will cause yet another coffer to appear. It will contain a final note from Zhasim's mother. She hopes he grew up to be a fine Baandari and wishes him well. \nZhasim will head on ahead to continue looking for his cat, and to see whether his mother left anything else for him. Proceed onward through the ruins into the big room, then north into the smaller room. There, you will meet Zhasim again, standing over a skeleton. He thinks this is his mother; she did not make it. He will ponder a bit about what all this means for him, but this will finish the quest."}

Once there, you will find that all the guards are dead. Investigate what happened here; while you are doing so, the Ascendant order will attack you. Just outside the big building, you will find a note called \"&lt;a href=\"Ascendant%20Champion%27s%20New%20Orders\"&gt;Ascendant Champion's New Orders&lt;/a&gt;\", indicating that since the medallion plan failed, the Ascendant Order is now planning to straight up murder &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;. Head inside and search the place; you will find a door to the basement down the stairs on the east side. This basement is just one hallway; fight your way through to the other side. Along the way, you will overhear conversations between &lt;a href=\"The%20Ascendant%20Champion\"&gt;The Ascendant Champion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ascendant%20Magus\"&gt;The Ascendant Magus&lt;/a&gt; indicating that they have not yet breached the wards on King Emeric's chamber and that they have yet to find Lady Arabelle. \nOn the other end of the hallway, you will find Lady Arabelle. Inform her of the situation, and she will formulate a plan. You are to fight the Ascendant Champion in the courtyard while she and Jakarn ambush the magus. Head up the ladder and through the door and you will find yourself in said courtyard. The ascendant champion will be ready to fight you; beware though, as she is very strong and will occasionally summon other Ascendant Order members to help her. Once she is dead, speak with Lady Arabelle and she will tell you to meet her back at her camp once she has delivered the medallion to Emeric. You can find a boat back to Vvardenfell on the island's coast; get back to Arabelle's camp and speak with her there to finish the quest."}

It seems General Endare has begun an excavation.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nThis quest can be obtained directly by speaking to Brelor\u00a0at the Falinesti Winter Site in Grahtwood; alternatively, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; may encounter Brelor as part of the Fit to Rule quest, when &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; asks them to retrieve three items she needs.\u00a0\nBrelor\u00a0tells the Vestige that a commander from the Aldmeri Dominion has come to the site and pressed the Falinesti Faithful, a group of pilgrims that reside at the site, into service. General Endare has been forcing the Faithful to dig so that she might find an artifact known as Rajhin's Mantle, with the unintended side effect of releasing a host of frost trolls into the forest. When questioned, Brelor reveals that the site used to be home to the Walking City of Falinesti, although he is unsure why that would mean that the mantle of the trickster god Rajhin would reside there.\u00a0\nRegardless, Brelor asks the Vestige to accompany him to the three Welkynd stones around the site so that he might learn why the mantle is there and, potentially, what happened to the now-disappeared Falinesti. The Vestige agrees with the promise to protect him from any frost trolls they encounter along the way.\u00a0\nAs each Welkynd stone is activated, the pair learn of the history between an ancient elven resident of Falinesti, Nairume, and a khajiit identified as the Lord. Upon meeting, the Lord fell in love with Nairume on account of her verbal brilliance, but she rejected him on the principle that she was happily married, sending him away. In reaction to this rejection, the Lord casts a curse on Nairume and her husband to give Nairume's sleep to her partner, cursing him to endless sleep while she has to remain perpetually awake. When this fails to convince Nairume to fall in love with the Lord, he summons her to an underground frozen prison and binds her there, revealing himself to be a Shadow of Rajhin.\u00a0\nWhen speaking with Brelor, he will tell the Vestige to seek out Cirtor in the camp of the Falinesti Faithful. Once there, Cirtor explains to the Vestiage that he approached Endare with a request to treat the Faithful more kindly than she had done at first; in return, he would convince them to help her dig freely. She accepted and the Faithful continued to work for her in an attempt to uncover Rajhin's Mantle. After breaching the first chamber, she sent the workers back to their camp and a short while late, the frost trolls appeared, wiping out the remaining Aldmeri guards on the surface.\u00a0\nCirtor directs the Vestige down into the centre of the excavation, although he does not know which of the three caves Endare went into. Following these directions, the Vestige eventually fights their way into the central cave and encounters a manifestation of Nairume made of ice, who begs to speak with them. She tells them that she is still alive in her prison, and that General Endare has already travelled into the inner sanctum in search of the Mantle.\u00a0Nairume reveals that she'd allowed Endare to pass because she was so pleased to see another person after so long in isolation, but once they'd got inside, the General had ignored her entirely. In irritation, Nairume is willing to allow the Vestige into the inner sanctum on the promise that when they retrieve the Mantle, they will use it to free Nairume from her prison.\u00a0\nAgreeing to this deal convinces Nairume to lower the ice barrier she had put in place in front of her prison and allows the Vestige to enter into her ice-covered chamber, where the can speak face to face. Nairume explains the situation further, confirming the previously seen story of her being imprisoned there by Rajhin's Shadow long, long ago and explaining that while she cannot leave her chamber, she can project her ice form for a short distance outside. She also gives the Vestige her wedding ring, the one thing that matters to her in that place, and tells them to proceed into inner chamber; if they need her aid, they can point the ring towards enemies and she will freeze them in place for a short time.\u00a0\nPast the inner door, the Vestige will encounter ice glyph traps, skeletons, and gargoyles that try to prevent them from moving forward. After these barriers are overcome, the Vestige makes it to the final room of the cave and encounters General Endare, who has already obtained the Mantle and is feeling the psychological effects it has over living beings. The Vestige can speak with Endare and either intimidate her into giving up the Mantle willingly or triggering a fight if they cannot convince her to part with it. If a fight does break out, Endare splits herself into two shadows that can attack the Vestige at the same time; to win the fight, the Vestige has to kill both shadows before a new one can be created.\u00a0\nWhether obtained willingly or by force, the Vestige can leave the caves with Rajhin's Mantle and return to Nairume's chamber, which is now starting to melt. Upon speaking with the Vestige, Nairume reveals that the way to break her curse is to place the Mantle into the fire in the centre of the room, although she reassures that it will not harm the artifact in any way.\u00a0\nWhen the Vestige does so, it does break Nairume's curse, but it also causes an apparition of the Lord to appear. It warns Nairume that unless she begs his forgiveness, she will never be able to find her city, Falinesti, which he has stolen from the world, accounting for its disappearance. Warning given, the apparition then dissolves and Nairume asks the Vestige what she is supposed to do in a world that she has not been free in for more than an era. The Vestige directs her towards Brelor, who is the most likely person to be able to help her find Falinesti, and then watches as she leaves the prison.\u00a0\nWith this done, the Vestige can return to Brelor for a reward and the quest is completed."}

The &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; all resisted incorporation into the reborn Empire.\nHere in the Trans-&lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt;, warlike clans of Khajiit from the savannahs around &lt;a href=\"Rimmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt; sometimes crossed the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20River\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; to raid the farmlands and small towns of northern &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt;. Nibenese settlers pushing westward from the great river encroached on traditional Anequinan hunting grounds, so the more aggressive hunt-barons took matters into their own claws. These proud Khajiit repaid \"Nibenese poaching\" in what they saw as their lands with \"hunts\" of their own in human lands.\nTo defend the region from the ongoing threat of Khajiit raids, General &lt;a href=\"Nemenius%20Hestor\"&gt;Nemenius Hestor&lt;/a&gt; (commander of the &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Legion\"&gt;Tenth Legion&lt;/a&gt;) proposed the construction of a border-fort at the narrows of the Lower Niben. Not only was this located about halfway between the strong defenses of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and the protection provided by &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Bay\"&gt;Niben Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the narrows were also the spot Khajiit raiders favored for their crossing. General Hestor's original plans called for a powerful keep to be called Fort Niben, but it seems that construction proceeded fitfully. In the early years of Emperor Reman's reign, &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;'s resources were sorely strained by the need to subdue threats all across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Khajiit brigandage in Blackwood simply did not rise to the same level as other threats.\nFrustrated by the parsimony of his superiors, General Hestor hit upon a somewhat questionable scheme to bring the threat posed by Anequinan raiders to their attention. He settled upon a fierce but formerly obscure Khajiit clan-chief named &lt;a href=\"Hunzur-ri\"&gt;Hunzur-ri&lt;/a&gt;, and built him up as the leader of a wild horde of \"beast-men\" slavering for human blood. The general went so far as to name Hunzur-ri \"the Red Mane,\" and describe him as a fanatical religious leader who had declared a holy crusade to drive men out of the Trans-Niben region altogether.\nOf course, we know that the Khajiit have only one Mane at a time, and that leader is rarely a warrior and never a brigand. But in the early years of the Second Empire, the Khajiiti realms of Anequina and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Elsweyr\"&gt;Pellitine&lt;/a&gt; were exotic and foreign to the people of Cyrodiil. All kinds of wildly inaccurate stories about \"the beast-men\" of these unfamiliar lands were taken for true.\nGeneral Hestor's plan worked: Exaggerating the threat of the Red Mane forced the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; purse to open wide. Gold flooded in to build the keep Hestor demanded to secure the border.\nIn the meantime, Hunzur-ri found himself badgered and harangued by his fellow hunt-barons for \"provoking\" the Imperials. Infuriated by the fabrications flowing from General Hestor's reports, Hunzur-ri gathered a small band of loyal followers and crossed the Niben to seek out his foe\u2014a dozen warriors in a single stealthy raid, not the rampaging horde he was said to command. Not an hour's march from the fort, Hunzur-ri and his warriors ambushed General Hestor. The general was killed by the very Khajiit he had vilified, but Hunzur-ri in turn was cut down by Hestor's soldiers.\nRather than admit that they had perhaps created the very monster they said they wanted to destroy, the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; chose to describe Nemenius Hestor's death as a heroic last stand, in which the general bravely gave his own life to end the threat of \"the Red Mane.\" A few years later, Fort Niben was renamed Fort Redmane in honor of the Legion's fierce adversary. Ironically, by the time the fort was completed, the troublesome raids that had impelled General Hestor to fortify the area in the first place had come to an end\u2014the Khajiit kingdoms of Anequina and Pellitine were already under Imperial control.\nTo this day, Fort Redmane stands above the narrows of the Niben River, watching for an enemy that will never come."}

My mother was a weaver, and my father was a boat-builder who made small fishing smacks and coracles for the river trade. I remember my youth as a happy one, playing around the docks where Father worked, or hunting through the near woods for entoloma caps and hickory nuts.\nIt was while doing the latter one day that I strayed a bit farther from the hamlet than usual, pushed my way through a briar thicket \u2026 and suddenly found myself staring at a pair of human skulls. Startled, I shrieked and dropped my basket of nuts. By the time I realized that what I'd seen was a skull on a staff next to a woman's face painted like a skull, I'd been knocked down, bound, and thrown over her shoulder.\nI was being borne away to the north, away from my home and into the mountains. I began to kick and scream, at which the woman threw me down, bound me tighter, and gagged me into the bargain. Then she resumed carrying me off into the wild. Eventually I passed out from sheer exhaustion.\nWhen I awoke it was dark, but I could see forms in the dance of firelight, silhouettes sporting horns, bones, spikes, feathers. Reachmen. I closed my eyes and tried to wake up, but it was no nightmare: when I opened my eyes they were still there.\nMy gag was gone, so I cried out for water. The skull-faced woman, whom I later learned was named Voanche, brought me a cup. She checked my bonds, and where I winced in pain, she actually loosened them a little. This surprised me, as I'd always heard that &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; Clans were barbarians, wicked &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshipers who reveled in cruelty. Maybe, once they realized how distressed I was, they would set me free and send me home.\nIt was a false hope: I was to be the captive of the &lt;a href=\"Crow-Wife%20Clan\"&gt;Crow-Wife Clan&lt;/a&gt; for the next eight years. The Reachmen were far more complex than I had been led to believe in my &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt; home, but in one thing we were right: barbarism and cruelty are everyday facts of life in the Reach. Voanche was a horse-breeder who had abducted me because she needed a &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; to tend to her livestock, since her former thrall had died of a kick to the head. She had given me water and loosened my bonds solely out of concern for the condition of her new possession.\nVoanche's clan was ruled by a &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;hagraven&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kloavdra\"&gt;Kloavdra&lt;/a&gt;, a claw-fingered crone who was a witch-shaman of considerable power. She was a priestess of &lt;a href=\"Namira\"&gt;Namira&lt;/a&gt; the Spirit Daedra, the lady of ancient darkness who commands repulsive vermin such as spiders, insects, slugs, and serpents. Because Namira is the mistress of small pests, the Reachmen call her \"the Children's God\" (they are not without humor, though their jests are always malicious). At every two-moons'-dark Kloavdra would draw lots at random from the children of the clan, both Reach and slave, to select a sacrifice to the Goddess of the Dark. The chosen child would end up on the Ever-Oozing Altar where Kloavdra would cut out its heart as an offering to Namira. Every time I was sure it would be me, but the name-feather drawn was always of another.\nKloavdra's hag-husband was a crude and vicious man named &lt;a href=\"Cointthac\"&gt;Cointthac&lt;/a&gt;. He was a gravesinger, a witchman shaman who could command the dead\u2014in our land we'd call him a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. He was always looking sidewise at Voanche and licking his lips, as at a savory roast fowl. Though he had power in the clan and was feared by all, Voanche treated him with disdain, which would sometimes provoke him into sending hoot-haunts into her tent at night, or hexing the horses' oats with writheworm. Voanche never turned a hair, just threatened to complain about Cointthac to his hag-wife Kloavdra, which always sent him packing.\nLife was hard in the Reach. Crow-Wife was a hunting clan, so our life was following the herds across the wastes. It was a rugged and perilous existence, where life could be snuffed out in a heartbeat by the antlers of an elk buck or the fangs of a sabre cat. But what I feared most were the semi-annual crossings of the &lt;a href=\"Karth%20River\"&gt;Karth River&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the tundra herds. It was my job to help Voanche and her useless daughter swim the horses across the ice-cold, swirling current, and every time I was certain would be my last. How I wished I had learned to swim in the Bjoulsae, like my two brothers, whenever the Karth had me in its grip!\nOccasionally during a crossing one of the horses would panic and break free of us, which usually meant drowning and death for it. Then Voanche and I would search far downstream until we found where its body had washed up, so we could skin and unmake the dead horse for its valuable fat, flesh, and bones. Nothing was wasted among the Reachmen.\nIt was during my sixth summer as a slave of the Crow-Wives\u2014I had crossed the hated Karth eleven times!\u2014that I began to attract the unwanted attentions of &lt;a href=\"Aiocnuall\"&gt;Aiocnuall&lt;/a&gt;, the loutish son of Kloavdra and Cointthach. He expressed his attraction by pushing me into mud puddles or putting dead voles in my stew. He was a year younger than me, but soon I knew he would want me to the object of more than just practical jokes. As the son of the hagraven he could do pretty much whatever he wanted with impunity, and Voanche couldn't protect me by complaining to Kloavdra\u2014the old virago would just cackle and wave her away.\nSo at night, when I should have been sleeping in my pile of furs, I started making a spear."}

{"id": "9154", "revid": "43878910", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=9154", "title": "A Life of Uriel Septim VII", "text": "A Life of Uriel Septim VII is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in and .\nContents.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20368\"&gt;3E368&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;389&lt;/a&gt;: Strategist and Conciliator.\nThe early decades of Emperor &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel's&lt;/a&gt; life were marked by aggressive expansion and consolidation of &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; influence throughout the empire, but especially in the East, in &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire's&lt;/a&gt; power was limited, Imperial culture was weak, and native customs and traditions were strong and staunchly opposed to assimilation. During this period Uriel greatly from the arcane support and shrewd council of his close advisor, the , &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe story of Uriel's marriage to the Princess &lt;a href=\"Caula%20Voria\"&gt;Caula Voria&lt;/a&gt; is a less happy tale. Though she was a beautiful and charming woman, and greatly loved and admired by the people, the Empress was a deeply unpleasant, arrogant, ambitious, grasping woman. She snared Uriel Septim with her feminine wiles, but Uriel Septim thereafter soon regretted his mistake, and was repelled by her. They heartily detested one another, and went out of their ways to hurt one another. Their children were the victims of this unhappy marriage.\nWith his agile mind and vaunting ambition, Uriel soon outstripped his master in the balanced skills of threat and diplomacy. Uriel's success in co-opting &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; as an advance guard of Imperial culture and economic development in Morrowind is a noteworthy example. However, Uriel also grew in pride and self-assurance. Jagar Tharn fed Uriel's pride, and hiding behind the mask of an out-paced former master counselor, Tharn purchased the complete trust that led finally to Uriel's betrayal and imprisonment in Oblivion and Tharn's secret usurpation of the Imperial throne.\n3E &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;389&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;399&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Betrayed and Imprisoned&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known of Uriel's experience while trapped in Oblivion. He says he remembers nothing but an endless sequence of waking and sleeping nightmares. He says he believed himself to be dreaming, and had no notion of passage of time. Publically, he long claimed to have no memory of the dreams and nightmares of his imprisonment, but from time to time, during the interviews with the Emperor that form the basis of this biography, he would relate details of nightmares he had, and would describe them as similar to the nightmares he had when he was imprisoned in Oblivion. He seemed not so much unwilling as incapable of describing the experience.\nBut it is clear that the experience changed him. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; he was a young man, full of pride, energy, and ambition. During the Restoration, after his rescue and return to the throne, he was an old man, grave, patient, and cautious. He also became conservative and pessimistic, where the policies of his early life were markedly bold, even rash. Uriel accounts for this change as a reaction to and revulsion for the early teachings and counsel of Jagar Tharn. However, Uriel's exile in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; also clearly drained and wasted him in body and spirit, though his mind retained the shrewd cunning and flexibility of his youth.\nThe story of Tharn's magical impersonation of the emperor, the unmasking of Tharn's imposture by Queen &lt;a href=\"Barenziah\"&gt;Barenziah&lt;/a&gt;, and the roles played by King &lt;a href=\"Eadwyre\"&gt;Eadwyre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt;, and her &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; in assembling the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the renegade Imperial Battlemage Jagar Tharn, and restoring Uriel to the throne, is treated at length in &lt;a href=\"Stern%20Gamboge\"&gt;Stern Gamboge&lt;/a&gt;'s excellent three-Volume &lt;a href=\"Biography%20of%20Barenziah\"&gt;BIOGRAPHY OF BARENZIAH&lt;/a&gt;. There is no reason to recount that narrative here. Summarized briefly, Jagar Tharn's neglect and mismanagement of Imperial affairs resulted in a steady decline in the Empire's economic prosperity, allowed many petty lords and kings to challenge the authority of the Empire, and permitted strong local rulers in the East and the West to indulge in open warfare over lands and sovereign rights.\n3E &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;399&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20415\"&gt;415&lt;/a&gt;: Restoration, the Miracle of Peace, and &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Restoration, Uriel Septim turned from the aggressive campaign of military intimidation and diplomatic accommodation of his earlier years, and relied instead on clandestine manipulation of affairs behind the scenes, primarily through the agencies of the various branches of the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. A complete assessment of the methods and objectives of this period must wait until after the Emperor's death, when the voluminous diaries archived at his country estate may be opened to the public, and when the Blades no longer need to maintain secrecy to protect the identities of its agents.\nTwo signal achievements of this period point to the efficacy of Uriel's subtle policies: the '&lt;a href=\"Miracle%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Miracle of Peace&lt;/a&gt;' [also popularly known as '&lt;a href=\"The%20Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;The Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;' that transformed the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; region from an assortment of warring petty kingdoms into the well-ordered and peaceful modern counties of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, and the colonization of Vvardenfell, presided over by the skillful machinations of King &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and Lady Barenziah, the Queen-Mother, which brought Morrowind more closely into the sphere of Imperial influence.\n&lt;a href=\"3E%20415\"&gt;3E 415&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"3E%20430\"&gt;430&lt;/a&gt;: The Golden Peace, King Helseth's Court, and the Nine in the East.\nFollowing the 'Miracle of Peace' (best described in &lt;a href=\"Per%20Vetersen\"&gt;Per Vetersen&lt;/a&gt;'s ), the Empire entered a period of peace and prosperity comparable to the early years of Uriel's reign. With the Imperial Heartland and West solidly integrated into the Empire, Uriel was able to turn his full attention to the East -- to Morrowind.\nExploiting conflicts at the heart of Morrowind's monolithic religion and the long-established Great House system of government, and taking advantage of the terrible threat that the corrupted divine beings at the heart of the Tribunal religion presented to the growing colonies on Vvardenfell, Uriel worked through shadowy agents of the Blades and through the court of King &lt;a href=\"Helseth%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Helseth&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; to shift the center of political power in Morrowind from the Great House councils to Helseth's court, and took advantage of the collapse of the orthodox Tribunal cults to establish the Nine Divines as the dominant faiths in Hlaalu and Vvardenfell Districts.\n treatment of the establishment of the Nine in the East in his four-volume &lt;a href=\"Life%20and%20Times%20of%20the%20Nerevarine\"&gt;Life and Times of the Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0is comprehensive; however, he fails to resolve the central mystery of this period -- how much did Uriel know about the prophecies of the Nerevarine, and how did he learn of their significance? The definitive resolution of this and other mysteries must await the future release of the Emperor's private papers, or a relenting of the Blades' strict policies of secrecy concerning their agents."}

Boots sloshing through the blackened muck, he could hardly make the gleam out through the mist ahead of him.\nUndeterred, he pressed forward, with hardly a thought for his own mortality. \"Surely they can hear me now,\" he thought, then cried out once more.\n\"Ho, good friend! The road lies this way!\"\nAgain hearing no response, he took a moment to look around. Mist was all he found there, in the dark. He could see neither his horse nor his barrow, where he had staked it. Shivering there in his own lamplight, hopelessly lost, he wondered whether he would ever return to the road.\nDeciding two lost souls would fare better than one, and up to his chest in peat and putrid water, he pressed on toward the light.\nOne by one, he lost his boots to the marsh, buried deep in the sucking pits that marked his passage. Bootless, he continued until he could go no further.\nIt was then, coming around a copse of trees, that he came upon a small glass lantern hanging from a tree branch. Searching for any sign of its owner, he spied a wide-brimmed bonnet where it lay abandoned on the ground. As he stood there wondering, the bright yellow flame of the tiny lantern flickered, then guttered out.\nHe looked to his own lantern, bobbing happily in the water above his shoulders, and took another step only to find he couldn't. Indeed, he could barely shift his waist, so thick was the muck he'd mired in.\nLooking skyward, he reached for the grasping, wooden fingers of the trees above, only to find them beyond his grasp.\nSo he stood there, in the dark, until the murky waters swallowed his throat, his mouth, and his funny white cap. His final breath bubbled up through the muck, and that was the last of the pilgrim.\nWalking one night along the rain-sodden roads that mark passage through the Glenumbral moors, a merchant spied a lantern in the mist.\n\"My, my,\" he said, as he stopped to stare, pushing up his broad visor to get a better view, \"Some poor fellow's lost his way!\""}

He is the Captain of the Camlorn Guard and if they could reach him, their chances of retaking the city will improve dramatically.\nHe has the master key to the gates and with it, they can open both gates at the same time and attack the werewolves from two directions.

There are caches of Camlorn Guard supplies hidden around the city, find all four and bring some weapons and armor here.\nHead outside and find all four caches, collect the weapons and armor and get back to the inn afterwards. He is grateful and says that when they get out of here, the first drink will be on him. Now he has some good news and some bad news. The good news is that he actually have the master key and the bad news is that with the thrilling exploits, the Vestige has attracted Faolchu's attention."}
