They are known for their colossal height and immense strength. They are usually seen herding their &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt;s through mountains and tundras, processing their mammoths' milk into cheese while eating cooked &lt;a href=\"skeever\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe giants have been around since possibly old Atmora. There is an old story about how &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;, while still in Atmora, collected the laments of the giant-wives and fashioned them into a bowstring for his fable bow, Long Launcher. There is also an account about their origin, talking of a \"Great Calamity\" that drove one group of Atmorans into hiding and when the rest saw them again, they had changed. It is said that Atmorans were quite large but when this \"Great Calamity\" transpired, one group retained intelligence and became smaller while another grew larger and lost some.\nOnly one giant is particularly well known and that was &lt;a href=\"Sinmur\"&gt;Sinmur&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Giant of legend\". Sinmur fought Ysgramor and his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; with his giant clans but was eventually cornered in his barrow and killed by &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt;. He was buried in what became known as &lt;a href=\"Redbelly%20Mine\"&gt;Redbelly Mine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shor%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Shor's Stone&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the present day of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, giants mostly keep to themselves at their camps as they had done for most of history. Though sometimes local &lt;a href=\"jarls\"&gt;jarls&lt;/a&gt; will get annoyed at their presence such as in &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt; where there are quite a few of them and subsequently issue bounties to cull the herd.\nAnatomy.\nGiants are eleven to twelve feet in height, and are mostly humanoid in appearance; they have long, powerful limbs, thick skin, with large hands and feet, and decorative scars on their chest that are mainly tribal or religious symbols. Giants' hair is braided with decorative beads and their faces are wrinkled. Their &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Toe\"&gt;toes&lt;/a&gt; appear to have &lt;a href=\"alchemical\"&gt;alchemical&lt;/a&gt; properties. &lt;a href=\"Giantess\"&gt;Female giants&lt;/a&gt; are scarcely seen, but the reason behind this is unknown. \nTechnology.\nGiants' weapons are crudely made as they are simply a large stone and wood &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Club\"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;. For clothing, giants wear &lt;a href=\"pelts\"&gt;pelts&lt;/a&gt; of fur and bones or a simple loincloth. Due to herding mammoths, they typically eat mammoth cheese, but apparently do eat other forms of food, as dead &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wolves\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and skeevers sometimes appear on their cooking spikes. The giants are also among the rare races who have the ability to grind mammoth tusks into powder.\nBehavior and intelligence.\nGiants are at least moderately intelligent, able to herd mammoths and fashion clothing out of furs and bones. They are nomadic, but tend to occupy the same camps repeatedly over a period of time. They speak a deep, guttural &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, although it is unknown to anyone how to translate it. In &lt;a href=\"3E%20405\"&gt;3E 405&lt;/a&gt;, some members of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resolution%20of%20Z%27en\"&gt;Temple of Zenithar&lt;/a&gt; were known to offer lessons in &lt;a href=\"Giantish\"&gt;Giantish&lt;/a&gt; language, though it is unclear if this knowledge was lost during the &lt;a href=\"Warp%20in%20the%20West\"&gt;Warp in the West&lt;/a&gt;. They can however learn tamrielic. Giants have also been noted by &lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt; to have been the first to refer to the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; as \"dwarves\" on account of their natural difference in height and apparently having had an affectionate regard for them. Giants are known to organize clans led by a chieftain or a matriarch. Chieftain rule is indisputable and they lead organized attacks. \nGiants have intricate beliefs regarding death, as they have specific burial grounds; as such, when a giant is dying, they go to said location to die. Also, if a giant was not at the burial grounds during death, then other giants will transport the body to the burial grounds. When in battle, giants use their brute strength to kill their foes, often crushing them with their clubs or simply stomping on them. They will often carve intricate patterns into the tusks of mammoths belonging to them; whether this serves a ceremonial, decorative purpose or another form of marking is currently unknown. They appear to have a rudimentary concept of trade, as evidenced that they will on occasion purchase animals from non-giant humanoids. Ceremonial sites are used by them to gather in where they trade, mate or communicate with whatever simple methods they have developed. Villagers will sometimes attempt to appease giants from attacking their lands by making a voluntary offering, typically livestock, decorated in a blue dye mimicking their tribal patterning, which they seem to recognize. Giants are also known for making spiral motifs on rocks and trees. speculations range from female enticement to territorial markings."}

Gideon is a traditional Imperial settlement, somewhat sunken into the marshes of Black Marsh. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, Gideon shares nodes to both the Argonians and the Imperials.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike its faraway cousin, the city of &lt;a href=\"Stormhold\"&gt;Stormhold&lt;/a&gt;, Gideon was originally built by the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, a fraction of the &lt;a href=\"Heartland%20Elves\"&gt;Heartland Elves&lt;/a&gt; that revere the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; which had caused their exile from the main group. The original Ayleid settlement's name is currently unknown, but it was abandoned through time, as the Barsaebics were very disconnected from the Cyrodilic Ayleids, as they were not affected by the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Slave%20Rebellion\"&gt;Alessian Slave Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Barsaebic Gideon was really disconnected from Cyrodiil, that when &lt;a href=\"King%20Glinferen\"&gt;King Glinferen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Atatar\"&gt;Atatar&lt;/a&gt; attempted to seek aid, the King of Old Gideon rejected him. Modern-day Argonia/Gideon would be built in the years following their demise, sometime during the First Era. From then on, Gideon's history would be tied to the Empires of Cyrodiil, especially the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Empire\"&gt;Second Empire&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Elissia%20Mallicius\"&gt;Elissia Mallicius&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently initiated the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Burn\"&gt;Great Burn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"1E%202828\"&gt;1E 2828&lt;/a&gt;, Gideon was greatly affected, being at the edge of the fire's proximity. In the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Lucinia%20Falco\"&gt;Lucinia Falco&lt;/a&gt; took over the &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20War\"&gt;Blackwater War&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Regulus%20Sardecus\"&gt;Regulus Sardecus&lt;/a&gt;, and used the city-state of Gideon as her base of operations. Her campaign proved to be successful as she conquered both the land and the seas. Black Marsh had been claimed by the Empire.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, the Imperial city-state of Gideon had already been a well-established settlement, with some of the architecture and streets sunken into the marsh, albeit not entirely. &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Giovesse\"&gt;Castle Giovesse&lt;/a&gt;, despite being the seat of power for Gideon was used as a prison for many figures but most notably, for &lt;a href=\"Empress%20Tavia\"&gt;Empress Tavia&lt;/a&gt;, the former-lover of &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt;, who was sentenced there in &lt;a href=\"1E%202899\"&gt;1E 2899&lt;/a&gt; for accusations of treason. Reman III was a very paranoid person, believing something small such as someone accidentally stepping on his foot as an act of defiance and treason, going so far as to analyze the person's apology. Tavia was imprisoned in Castle Giovesse, only left with her &lt;a href=\"Orchid%20Nixad\"&gt;Orchid Nixad&lt;/a&gt; and her entrusted knight, the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt; warrior, &lt;a href=\"Zuuk%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Zuuk&lt;/a&gt;. It was by Tavia's request that Zuuk would call for the assassination of Reman Cyrodiil III at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Miramor\"&gt;Miramor&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bodrum\"&gt;Battle of Bodrum&lt;/a&gt;. However, Miramor would accidentally kill the Crown Prince and Tavia's child, &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Juilek Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dorsza%20Pass\"&gt;Dorsza Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Tavia was utterly devastated by the news, and so she disappeared from Gideon, never to be seen again.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Gideon in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Gideon was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Demia\"&gt;Queen Demia&lt;/a&gt;."}

They dedicated me to the temple, so that I might one day become a priest, too.\nThere were only three other children in the temple when I was growing up. The others made fun of me until I was ten years old because one of my legs was shorter than the other and I had a limp.\nOne day, we were running through the cave (something that was forbidden, but the priests often looked the other way, letting children be children) and I tripped and fell face down into the water. I hit my head and blacked out. The other children were far ahead of me already, so they didn't see.\nLater, the priests told me that one of the Nereids had lifted me out of the water. I said I didn't remember that happening, but later on, I did recall the feeling of floating and also a kind of terror, like I had seen something I was not supposed to see, something that was too beautiful for mortal eyes.\nThe priests instructed us in our relationship to the Nereids. We were required to memorize the gifts of the Nereids and repeat them back every day:\nThe gifts of the Nereids are three-fold:\nthe beauty of their form,\nthe sweetness of their singing,\nand protection from harm.\nThe older children got to help the priests with the rituals. Meat was brought to the central altar to feed the Nereids, and once a year, one priest would go deep into the cave to meditate among their singing. When he would emerge, he would give a prophesy.\nWhen he comes of age, each child has a choice to stay and become a priest or to go into exile. After so many years living in the cave, I could not imagine another life, and so I chose the priesthood. But sometimes I long for sunlight and wonder where a different path might have taken me, and what sights I might have seen if I had chosen exile."}

Gil-Var-Delle is infamous throughout Valenwood, considered a cursed place ever since &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the city many years ago.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nGil-Var-Delle is one of the bigger settlements in the province of Valenwood, being built from the large trees that inhabit the province. Gil-Var-Delle itself is located west of the city of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Winter%20Site\"&gt;Falinesti Winter Site&lt;/a&gt;, and north of the city of &lt;a href=\"Southpoint\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;. The ruins of Gil-Var-Delle are vast and is an utter wasteland when compared to the lush greens of the Tarlain Heights. Some paths cut through the ground, where bones and soddy water lurk, as well as, lowlife creatures of &lt;a href=\"Coldharbour\"&gt;Coldharbour&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Daedrat\"&gt;Daedrat&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hoarvor\"&gt;Hoarvor&lt;/a&gt;. The upper grounds of Gil-Var-Delle have roots jutting out of the ground, as well as, ritual stones from &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; groups. Southwest of Gil-Var-Delle is a large pit infested with &lt;a href=\"Harvester\"&gt;Harvester&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Daedroth\"&gt;Daedroth&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"1E%202920\"&gt;1E 2920&lt;/a&gt;, sometime around the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; was named &lt;a href=\"Dro%27Zel\"&gt;Dro'Zel&lt;/a&gt;, who was infamous for being the Mad King of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt; and having the mentality of a child. One fateful day, Dro'Zel was visited by a bard from Gil-Var-Delle, who told a story of &lt;a href=\"Polydor\"&gt;Polydor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eloisa%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Eloisa&lt;/a&gt; and the story of &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Day\"&gt;Heart's Day&lt;/a&gt;, which had a grim ending. This ending left Dro'Zel furious and devastated that the Bard told him such a sad tale. Through dark magic, Dro'Zel summoned &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and ordered him to destroy the city of Gilverdale. Molag Bal arrived into Gil-Var-Delle through a powerful red mist, which engulfed the buildings throughout the township. The town of Gil-Var-Delle was left ablaze and in utter ruins. Unfortunately, some people believed that the situation in Gil-Var-Delle was a hoax and that Molag Bal did not destroy the town, but a large fire burned it to the ground. The Devouring of Gil-Var-Delle brought interest to &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. This event led them to the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Dreaming%20Cave\"&gt;the Dreaming Cave&lt;/a&gt; to discuss with the Daedric Prince about future endeavors such as the one in Gil-Var-Delle. This pact would last for quite sometime until &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20578\"&gt;2E 578&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt; began to inhabit the ruins of Gil-Var-Delle and establish their ritual sites throughout the wasteland. &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt; had made Gil-Var-Delle the base of operations for the Worm Cult in Valenwood and had at one point, captured the Bravilian scholar named &lt;a href=\"Flaccus%20Terentius\"&gt;Flaccus Terentius&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged the province of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and the besieged the city of &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; with his massive army of &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;. Mannimarco had already expanded his followers throughout the provinces of Tamriel, ranging from the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; to the Grand &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. Terentius had unfortunately died in a ruined house in Gil-Var-Delle, where his notes were discovered by a courier from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Legion\"&gt;Fourth Legion&lt;/a&gt;, who then passed the notes to &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; in Cyrodiil.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Ordinators\"&gt;High Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; were sent to the ruins of Gil-Var-Delle to force the Worm Cult out of the area and to diminish Molag Bal's influence. &lt;a href=\"High%20Ordinator%20Danys\"&gt;High Ordinator Danys&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Gil-Var-Delle by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; herself to deal with the situation. Danys was in a dire situation and needed help with the situation in ruins, luckily he met a warrior known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and both ended the Worm Cult's scheme in the ruins of Gil-Var-Delle. There was a weaker version of a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchor\"&gt;Dark Anchor&lt;/a&gt; situated in the middle of Gil-Var-Delle that was used to bring an army from Coldharbour. The Vestige defeated the Harvester guarding the Dolmen, and destroyed the Dark Anchor, relieving the area of the Cult. Danys would return to Mournhold with the mission to Gil-Var-Delle complete."}

You always were good at that.\"\nThe memory in the Balmora Valley:\nBravora Faren: \"Oh, Gilan, look! A Dwemer gear. It's in remarkably good condition.\"\nGilan Lerano: \"Yes, wonderful, I'll mark it down.\"\nBravora Faren: \"And here, another.

I so regret not being there as you grew up. What I could never tell you is why my life was not my own.\"\nNeria Lerano: \"Sssh, Mils. I think this is a memory.\"\nGilan Lerano: \"Soon, I'll be able to share the truth with you. To share everything with you. Thanks to the efforts of this kind traveler, I have archived my memories on this stone.\"\nGilan Lerano: \"I hope one day \u2026 you will find it in your hearts to forgive me. And find the father, and mother, you never had here.\"\nGilan Lerano: \"I love you. I have always loved you. You've both made me so proud.\"\nNeria Lerano: \"Father \u2026.\"\nMils Lerano: \"Why? Why couldn't you just fade away like you always do? Why couldn't you just let me forget you?\"\nNeria Lerano: \"Because it's not just about him, Mils, or you. Its about all of us.

Gilane is most well-known for being the seat of power for &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who thwarted the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Queen\"&gt;Wolf Queen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tavan Wave &amp; the Kingdom of Gilane.\nThe city-state of Gilane was one of the many settlements founded amidst the waves of the &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Ra Gada&lt;/a&gt;, which began their movement in &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt; from the island of &lt;a href=\"Herne%20%28Island%29\"&gt;Herne&lt;/a&gt;. The wave that moved across the southern coast was known as the &lt;a href=\"Tavan\"&gt;Tavan&lt;/a&gt;, worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Tava\"&gt;Tava&lt;/a&gt;, the Bird Spirit of Air, who guided the survivors of doomed &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; to Hammerfell. The Tavan sailed across the southern waters of Hammerfell, landing in places such as &lt;a href=\"Stros%20M%27Kai\"&gt;Stros M'Kai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taneth\"&gt;Taneth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Khefrem%27s%20Boot\"&gt;Khefrem's Boot&lt;/a&gt;. Gilane was in the path as well. Gilane's affiliation is unknown, but based considering &lt;a href=\"the%20Forebears\"&gt;the Forebears&lt;/a&gt; control over the southern coast, Gilane is likely a city of the Forebears. The ancient capital of the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken Clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Volenfell\"&gt;Volenfell&lt;/a&gt; was founded not far from Gilane.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Cephorus Septim I; the Rising Kingdom.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%2098\"&gt;3E 98&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Gilane was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20Septim\"&gt;Cephorus Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who assumed the throne at the age of 21, where he married &lt;a href=\"Bianki\"&gt;Bianki&lt;/a&gt;, a Redguard noble of Gilane. Cephorus' control over Gilane was very prosperous, with a hearth of children to inherit the throne and continue the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The triad of rulers that directly descend from &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Uriel Septim II&lt;/a&gt; had ruled exponentially, improving relations throughout the continent. The Kingdom of Gilane was one such Kingdom that was at the forefront of this movement. But when &lt;a href=\"Potema%20Septim\"&gt;Potema Septim&lt;/a&gt; had denounced &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20II\"&gt;Kintyra Septim II&lt;/a&gt;'s claim to the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;, talks of war had arrived and so in &lt;a href=\"3E%20120\"&gt;3E 120&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; had occurred, between the joint kingdoms of the north, and the Septim Empire. The Kingdom of Gilane and King Cephorus I were the leading force against the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Kingdom of Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, specifically at their armies in High Rock.\nKing Cephorus Septim I; War of the Red Diamond.\nThe tides of battle would shift when in &lt;a href=\"3E%20127\"&gt;3E 127&lt;/a&gt;, King Cephorus defeated &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Uriel Septim III&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt;, to which the Prince was taken to Gilane for trial. In the middle of travel, Uriel III's caravan was wrecked, killing the Wolf-Queen's son and was proclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; of Tamriel. Cephorus Septim I continued the fight against Potema Septim, until at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Solitude\"&gt;Siege of Solitude&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20137\"&gt;3E 137&lt;/a&gt; where Potema Septim had died of old age amidst the barrage on the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Palace\"&gt;Blue Palace&lt;/a&gt;. Emperor Cephorus Septim I later died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20140\"&gt;3E 140&lt;/a&gt; after falling off a horse, his brother, &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Septim\"&gt;Magnus Septim&lt;/a&gt; assumed the throne. Queen Bianki, had died in &lt;a href=\"3E%20136\"&gt;3E 136&lt;/a&gt;, as did Cephorus' children, heirs to the throne of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and most likely the Kingdom of Gilane. Though it was not explicitly told, one of Cephorus' children could have inherited the throne of Gilane, until their untimely death.\nGilane during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Gilane in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Gilane was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Coc\"&gt;King Coc&lt;/a&gt;."}

Speaking with either &lt;a href=\"Emul-Ran\"&gt;Emul-Ran&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kashtes%20Ilabael\"&gt;Kashtes Ilabael&lt;/a&gt; about 'stolen hides' will cause them to attack. The stolen hides will be found on the corpse of Emul-Ran; they are unique, and normal hides will not suffice for a replacement.\nAfter slaying the two bandits head due west to meet with Athanden Girith again and inform him that the bandits have been dealt with. The 10 hides will be automatically removed from the inventory. Next, following Athanden's advice, head to Tel Mora and speak with Berwen for a reward. &lt;a href=\"Berwen\"&gt;Berwen&lt;/a&gt; owns a trader shop in\u00a0Tel Mora.

The Now of the songs that fill me consider the sea and skies, and that sea and sky beyond those of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;\u2014&lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt;. So I may speak on any of these concerns\u2014for now.\"\nTell me a story about the seas.\"&lt;a href=\"Y%27ffre\"&gt;Y'ffre&lt;/a&gt; taught the birds to sing and the waves to lap against the beach. Through Y'ffre's song, he also gained sight-perception of all that occurs within the sight of birds and the reflection of waters, and he echoes their songs and crashing waves.\"\"\nIs there anything he doesn't hear or see?\"Of course. He sees and hears nothing, for Y'ffre is now the Earth-Bones, the frame upon which Nature is laid or woven. His sight-perception and song-echo instead are loomed through his bones and woven into tapestries of song for we mortals study.\"\nHow does this relate to the sea?\"The Sea is all-enclosing, the water that encircles all of Mundus. The birds call out that which occurs over land to the sea, which reflects and echoes that song. Through the study of the Sea's mystery is it possible to interrupt Y'ffre's song-tapestry.\"\nHow would I do that?\"You already do, as do all mortals. Your frame of perception of the world is your own Bones, akin to the Earth-Bones. It is all possible to see into your own future and world as it is to immerse the Self in hysteria with no fear.\"\nWhat does that mean?\"To sing a law, and then Speak into the heart of that law, convincing it of a subtle error and how it must change its own Self. This is how Nature's course\u2014its own Sea\u2014is shaped and reshaped over time. Such changes can affect the whole of Mundus.\"\nWhat stories can you tell about the skies?\"\"The sky mirrors the sea, and the sea also reflects its mirror. Day, night, and the places between are the realm of the sky, as Y'ffre interpreted the time-law &lt;a href=\"Anui-El\"&gt;Anui-el&lt;/a&gt; established with &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the sky bridges time and nature, and measures both.\"\"\nWhat does that mean?\"Within each half of the sphere of reflection lies half of the potentialities of Nirn's way in any given moment. Each instant is a sea-state or sky-state. Each individual sees one or its other as weal or woe, and each moment can be turned on its side.\"\nWhat does turning a moment on its side achieve?\"\"Each moment so turned becomes an island in your path. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, united, had their way in &lt;a href=\"Dwemeris\"&gt;Dwemeris&lt;/a&gt;. But one clan\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Rourken%20Clan\"&gt;Rourken, the wayward clan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014struck anchor and sailed across the sky. Why do this? Mired in a sea, they sought the sky.\"\"\nCreating an island is a good thing?\"Yes. Change is wrought in Nirn in six ways, and the turning of islands is one of these, often described by others in other terms. Of course, it is possible to acknowledge these ways without understanding them\u2014to spin them is all I can do.\"\nI want to hear a story about Aetherius.\"Aetherius is the sea of light, the Immortal Plane, the origin of magic. Y'ffre sings not of Aetherius, but to it, weaving a song so beautiful that stars were compelled to dance and tinkle and sway. They still wink and blink in memory of that song.\"\nHow do the stars relate to Aetherius?\"They are Aetherius. Rather, the sun and stars are holes pierced into the veil of night by Magnus\u2014and other spirits\u2014seeking to escape Nirn. These holes permit Aetherius' light to enter our world. From theirs to ours does Magicka trickle.\"\nHow do they twinkle and move across the sky, then?\"Well, consider this. As Oblivion is a realm composed of realms, so, too, is Aetherius a bright sea with many realms within. Each of the stars is a window into these realms, and as realms move, so do they move. Or close, like doors.\"\nWhat realms do you mean?\"Now, that is an enormous question I cannot answer. Many souls of morals become spirits of another sort in that place - and that is all I can say with certainty. As difficult it is to travel to Oblivion, it is far more to go to Aetherius.\""}

However, this can be bypassed\u00a0by\u00a0using\u00a0the fast travel arrow on the corner of Solstheim's and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;'s world map to alternatively traverse the two regions.\nDialogue.\n\"If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, you won't find a finer vessel than the Northern Maiden.\"\nIf approached again:\n\"Seeking passage to Solstheim?\"\nWhen approaching Raven Rock:\n\"Well, here we are. Welcome to Raven Rock. Just... be careful here. Things aren't what they used to be.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, too bad.

You know we don't have that much coin.\"\nGjalund: \"\"Look, the &lt;a href=\"East%20Empire%20Company\"&gt;East Empire Company&lt;/a&gt; didn't give me a choice.

Poisons applied to weapons proc (programmed random occurrence) periodically, meaning that there is a 20% chance for a poison to be used each time a &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Attack\"&gt;Heavy Attack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Light%20Attack\"&gt;Light Attack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Ability\"&gt;Weapon Ability&lt;/a&gt; is used; not all attacks will have a poison applied to them. Poisons have a 10 second cooldown between each proc. Poisons can be &lt;a href=\"Crafting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt; at an &lt;a href=\"alchemy%20station\"&gt;alchemy station&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"reagents\"&gt;reagents&lt;/a&gt; and poisonous &lt;a href=\"solvents\"&gt;solvents&lt;/a&gt;, purchased from &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;, looted from &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Online%29\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Crates\"&gt;Crown Crates&lt;/a&gt; and defeated &lt;a href=\"Characters%20%28Online%29\"&gt;characters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Online%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt;, purchased from the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Store\"&gt;Crown Store&lt;/a&gt;, or obtained as &lt;a href=\"Daily%20Rewards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;daily rewards&lt;/a&gt;.\nA weapon can only be equipped with one poison at a time, and an equipped poison will disable any &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Online%29\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt; the weapon has. With the exception of Crown Store poisons, all poisons are leveled from level 1 to 160 and are designated I to IX according to what solvent is used to make it. A character cannot equip a poison to a weapon if the level of the poison exceeds the character's own level. Higher level poisons deal more damage, last longer, and are more expensive. A character will only ever loot general poisons that are appropriate to their level, but higher-level poisons can be purchased, traded or transferred to lower-level characters. Like potions, up to 200 of the same poison takes up a single inventory slot. \nGeneric poisons.\nGeneric poisons can be found as loot from containers and creatures or bought from merchants. Cloudy Damage Health Poisons deal a high amount of &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Poison Damage&lt;/a&gt; over a short period of time, while Cloudy Gradual Health Poisons deal a low amount of Poison Damage over a long period of time. Cloudy Hindering Poisons do not deal any damage, but reduces the target's &lt;a href=\"Movement%20Speed\"&gt;Movement Speed&lt;/a&gt; by 50% for the duration.\nCrown Store poisons.\nCrown Store poisons can be purchased from the Crown Store or found in Crown Crates. They are also given for free as daily rewards. Each Crown Store poison only has one level and can be used by any character regardless of level, making them particularly effective for low-level characters. Crown Store poisons cannot be sold to merchants and, because they are bound, cannot be traded between players. They can, however, be stored in a &lt;a href=\"Banks%20%28Online%29\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; and moved between characters belonging to the same account. Crown Store poisons obtained from Crown Crates can be converted into Crown Gems.\nCrafted poisons.\nPoisons can be crafted the same way as potions at an alchemy station. At least two reagents and a poisonous solvent must be used to create a poison. With &lt;a href=\"Laboratory%20Use\"&gt;Laboratory Use&lt;/a&gt;, three reagents can be used. Two of the reagents must share a trait to produce a poison, otherwise the poison will be inert, consuming the materials. The solvent that is used defines the level of the poison, and each level requires the appropriate &lt;a href=\"Solvent%20Proficiency\"&gt;Solvent Proficiency&lt;/a&gt; rank (the first is unlocked for all characters). The maximum level for crafted poisons is 150. The appearance of the poison depends on its level and effects, similar to generic poisons. Unlike potions, poisons are create in batches of four at a time, i.e. one solvent and two reagents will create four poisons instead of one. Each rank of &lt;a href=\"Chemistry\"&gt;Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; adds an addition four poisons made per batch up to a maximum of 12.\nThe following are solvents are used to make poisons:"}

I was sent here from my post in &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; by Emperor &lt;a href=\"Leovic\"&gt;Leovic&lt;/a&gt; himself to aid Markarth and provide a conduit between &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; and the Reach. Though I have received no new orders from the person who now sits on the Ruby Throne, I had assumed to take my leave and return home. Ard Caddach decided he wanted to retain my administrative skills, and in case the new Emperor is interested, I decided to record what I have learned in my decade of service.\nFirst, it is best to think of the Reach as not one land, but two: Markarth and the wilds. Traditionally, whoever rules in Markarth exercises little power over the wilds, while the strong clans of the wilderness lack the strength or the inclination to govern the city of the Reach. When Markarth is under the rule of a weak leader-or no leader at all, as happens sometimes-its circle of influence shrinks. When a strong leader holds Markarth, the city's power extends into the nearby land, and the clans of the western Reach must acknowledge Markarth's authority in fact, if not in name, The centuries-old story of the Reach is the story of Markarth attempting to form a realm, and the clans outside of Markarth fiercely resisting the encroaching authority of the city.\nThe great difficulty in dealing with the Reach is the fact that each individual clan sees itself as its own polity: free to raid, trade, make war, or agree to peace with anyone it chooses. To forge a lasting peace with the Reach, one would have to negotiate with dozens of different clans, some of whom hate each other so much that they would never agree to honor a peace their enemies choose to accept. Ard Caddach, ruler in Markarth, as it would be for a foreign ruler such as the new Emperor. To the chiefs of the various clans, Ard Caddach is simply one more chief, due no more deference than they should show any of their peers. In fact, they regard him with great suspicion, believing that he intends to rule them as well.\nFortunately, not all &lt;a href=\"Reachfolk\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; seek to make enemies of everyone and everything. Ard Caddach is judicious in dealing with the free clans. He moves against them only when Markarth's interests are directly threatened-for example, when a vicious clan such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadefeathers\"&gt;Shadefeathers&lt;/a&gt; makes travel to and from Markarth too dangerous, or when a border clan such as the &lt;a href=\"Boneshapers\"&gt;Boneshapers&lt;/a&gt; seems likely to provoke a neighboring realm to retaliate indiscriminately against all Reachfolk. Likewise, most of the larger Reach clans maintain a tenuous peace with one another. Clans that instigate reckless feuds are all too likely to proveoke an alliance of the other clans against them. And all Reachfolk believe that Makrarth should be neutral territory, free to any wilder who wishes to go there and trade. A rough, wary sort f peace suits a good number of people in the Reach.\nWhile the power in the wilds of the Reach lies mostly in the hands of a half-dozen or so of the strongest clans (the &lt;a href=\"Eagleseers\"&gt;Eagleseers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Six-Fords\"&gt;Six-Fords&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"River-Elks\"&gt;River-Elks&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thornroots\"&gt;Thornroots&lt;/a&gt;, and a few others), there is one more Reach tradition to consider when dealing with the clans beyond Ard Caddach's walls: the Chief-of-Chiefs. This is usually a clan-chief who has won the respect of both friends and enemies, earning a sort of \"chief emeritus\" title. The Chief-of-Chiefs wields a great deal of moral authority over all but the most stubborn and xenophobic clans. Currently, the clans recognize a former River-Elk chief by the name of Cannear as the Chief-of-Chiefs. Cannear is an arbiter of disputes and a peacemaker who spends her time settling feuds and mending alliances. Some of the more hostile clans see her as a meddler and would rather follow a warlord, but until Cannear dies or chooses to give up her place, her voice is a powerful one in the wilds.\nWhen the clans need to work together, such as to engage in a particularly dangerous hunt or to repel a particularly strong invader, the Chief-of-Chiefs temporarily takes command of the participating clans' forces, coordinating a strategy and response until the threat has passed.\nThese are but a few of the political realities I have come to understand in my time working with Ard Caddach and the people of Markarth."}

I need to find out what's going on.\"\"\nWalkthrough.\nWanum is encountered in the western side of the Town, and asks the Fugitive to investigate a nearby town. Upon arriving at the town's docks, the mayor is quickly encountered, starting the following dialogue:\n\"Who are you?\"\nUpon leaving conversation, the mayor provides the Fugitive with a key. Approaching the mayor again will result in her saying \"Malanwen went into the woods to the north and never returned. Stay safe, Warrior.\"\nUsing the key, the doors leading out of the town can be opened, and one must travel through the forest encountering spriggans and wolves along the way, eventually stumbling upon a camp with two Bosmer Hunters. Approaching the male hunter triggers the following dialogue:\n\"Be warned, traveller. This land is blighted.\"\nThe hunter will then provide a key, needed to open the nearby gates leading deeper into the forest. Approaching the hunter again will unlock more dialogue:\n\"What do you need?\"\nAfter advancing deeper into the forest, the hero comes across a cave, entering it will lead to a locked door, to which a nearby cultist holds the key. Speaking to the cultist results in him attacking the hero. Opening the door with the key leads to &lt;a href=\"Malanwen\"&gt;Malanwen&lt;/a&gt;, who will have to be spoken to to advance the quest further. In dialogue, Malanwen states that the cave is home to a cult, who have been sacrificing people in the local waters, corrupting it and the nearby land. She tasks the hero with destroying the cult. Deeper into the cave, a large chamber is found where the sacrifices take places. After defeating three cultists, the cultist doing the sacrifices speaks to the hero:\n\"A vengeful being has come to inhibit progress.\"\nSlaying the cult leader completes the quest."}

Sometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt; a former spy by the name of Talym Rend had struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; which demanded Porcia be turned mad. During this time, Porcia was actively serving with Breton Legionnaires in Skyrim, who were engaging with &lt;a href=\"Reachmen\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; invaders at &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to turn Porcia mad, Talym had ambushed a Reachman courier, and planted fake intel in Bthardamz for Porcia to discover, however, while doing so, Talym had also activated a number of traps in the ruin, putting the Reachmen on high alert, and resulting in the capture of Porcia. As such, Talym had to save his former mentor. The Spymaster did, however, find the fake intel, and assumed it was legitimate. The intel pointed towards a nearby Grove of &lt;a href=\"Mara\"&gt;Mara&lt;/a&gt;, where a sacred flower grew which was required to combat the Reachman poison, according to the intel.\nWhen the Legionnaires arrived at the grove and demanded the sacred flowers, the priests of Mara refused. As such, Poria ordered her men to attack the grove, resulting in the deaths of numerous priests and the Legion obtaining the flowers. Imperial alchemists refined the flowers into a gas, but due to the low quantity of the gas, Porcia ordered it only to be used when the Reachmen poison would be used on the bulk of the Imperial force. The fighting took place in a passage leading to Bthardamz, and when the combat between the Reachmen and the Legion became heavy, the Reachmen unleashed the poison. In response, Porcia unleashed her antidote.\nThe antidote was, however, not an antidote. When the gas of the sacred flowers was used to combat the poison, large explosions and fires would break out, resulting in great casualties among both the Legion and the Reachmen. While technically a success for the Legion, Porcia could not bear witnessing both the murder of the priests and the massacre at Bthardamz, and left the Legion. Since then, Porcia refused to speak, afraid to accidentally reveal a secret, or utter a command, that might hurt someone."}

When they come to the end, there will be a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr&lt;/a&gt; to their left, waiting. Once they kill it, they should proceed down the winding hallway and up the stairs, When they reach the top there, will be a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; waiting for them in the middle of the room. There are three levers, and beyond that three revolving doors.\nEach lever controls the corresponding door wheel; the levers move back and forth between \"rotate clockwise,\" \"stop,\" and \"rotate counterclockwise.\" Align them all to their open position (this will take patience as they spin quite slowly, but they don't need to be perfect, just enough space for one's character to proceed through).\nAfter setting the levers so there is an opening, one can walk through the doors into the next room. Directly in front of them, they will be able to see through another window to a room with a chest and other lootable items in it; they will be able to get to this by activating the lever behind the coffin in the preceding room.\nOne will want to be very careful in this room, as fireballs will begin shooting out of the walls once they pass the pillar in the middle of the room. One technique is to use the &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; to effectively navigate the room and remove the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;. Another method of getting past the fire defenses is to stand out of range, and dislodge the gems with arrows.\nOnce past this, they should move through the next two hallways and proceed through the door at the end. They should be ready for combat, as there is a &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt; fledgling and a Draugr of radiant difficulty on the other side. The vampire fledgling holds the key to Potema's Sanctum. Once the vampire is dead, they should loot them for the key, and the player will then will be able to proceed through the door to Potema's Sanctum. There is also a key on the throne the Draugr sits on.\nIt is not necessary to kill the Draugr in this room, as Draugr cannot open doors; however, it is necessary to kill the vampire (it is possible to do this before the Draugr engages), and then loot the key and proceed through the door using shouts to keep the Draugr at bay - and close it before it can follow. (Enter Sneak once the door is closed to leave combat with the Draugr; this is necessary, otherwise the Draugr and player are still engaged, and it may spawn with the player once they enter Potema's Sanctum)."}

She was tutored, and had also found the time to sneak around the Imperial Palace and pick locks, stealing documents that she used to blackmail members of her family.\nCourtship and marriage.\nBy the age of 14, Potema was a famous beauty with many suitors, but she was married to cement relations with King &lt;a href=\"Mantiarco\"&gt;Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, potentially following the misplacing of a marriage document to her aunt Galana, which Potema herself stole. Despite the arranged nature of their marriage, the elderly King Mantiarco loved her, ceding her \"all the power she wished.\"\nNew Emperor and the birth of a son.\nIn &lt;a href=\"3E%2097\"&gt;3E 97&lt;/a&gt;, after many miscarriages, the Queen of Solitude gave birth to a son, whom she named Uriel after her grandfather. Potema planted suspicion in Mantiarco's mind that his son by his first wife was not his, causing Mantiarco to proclaim Uriel his heir.\nPotema and Antiochus.\nTwo years later, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20II\"&gt;Pelagius II&lt;/a&gt; died, and Antiochus, Potema's brother, became Emperor. Potema allegedly threatened to blackmail him with a forged letter claiming him to be a bastard, but she was rebuffed. Mantiarco died the springtime after Pelagius, and Uriel ascended to the throne of Solitude, ruling jointly with his mother. During this time, Potema spent much of her time entertaining nobles from across &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; gaining allies and spreading discontent against the Emperor.\nBoth Potema and Uriel were visiting the Imperial Court in &lt;a href=\"3E%20112\"&gt;3E 112&lt;/a&gt; when Antiochus died, and Potema immediately challenged the rule of his daughter and heir, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20II\"&gt;Kintyra II&lt;/a&gt;, claiming her to be a bastard. Potema's appeal to the Elder Council was ignored, and she returned to Solitude to assemble troops for war.\nWar of the Red Diamond.\nPotema directly led troops for much of the war, including, in one account, the attack that led to the Empress' capture in High Rock, and may have been involved in her execution at Castle Glenpoint. She also led troops in the subsequent rally of Imperial troops, commanding armies in Skyrim during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Falconstar\"&gt;Battle of Falconstar&lt;/a&gt; in 3E 127. During this battle, she received word that Uriel had been captured at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Ichidag\"&gt;Battle of Ichidag&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year, he was burnt alive in a prison carriage by an angry mob while en route to the Imperial City to face trial. On hearing the news, many of Potema's allies deserted and swore allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Cephorus%20I\"&gt;Cephorus I&lt;/a&gt;.\nDecline and death.\nThe War of the Red Diamond may technically have ended at Uriel's death, but Potema fought on for another ten years, summoning daedra and undead to fight for her. She is documented as dying after a long siege in 3E 137. Some claim that she either infected her castle at Solitude with her evil, or passed a charmed wolf pendant on to her nephew, who would become &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20III\"&gt;Pelagius III&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these are attempts to explain his later madness.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Falk%20Firebeard\"&gt;Falk Firebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;, sent the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to investigate inexplicable phenomenon in &lt;a href=\"Wolfskull%20Cave\"&gt;Wolfskull Cave&lt;/a&gt; near Solitude. Penetrating into the deepest reaches of the cave, the Dragonborn discovered a cult of Necromancers, attempting to summon Potema and bind her soul for their own purposes. The player then intervenes and terminates the antagonists, who are initially believed to be unsuccessful, until Firebeard subsequently summons the Dragonborn to the Blue Palace where the two converse. The Dragonborn is then sent to retrieve Potema's remains to prevent any such dark ambitions from again being actuated. &lt;a href=\"Styrr\"&gt;Styrr&lt;/a&gt;, a priest at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Divines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Temple of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;, led the Dragonborn to Potema's catacombs below the temple, where her skull sat.\nWhen the Dragonborn located the remains, it was discovered that although necromancers were stopped, Potema's spirit was summoned successfully and she was able to exist as a hostile specter, a ghostly apparition of her former self. Returning the skull to Styrr after defeating the Wolf Queen, the Dragonborn learned that Potema dabbled in necromancy while still alive, explaining why she was able to escape and stay as a ghost with free will after the ritual of the cultists failed. The priest also mentioned that had Potema been successfully resurrected, she would have the most legitimate claim to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Cyrodilic throne&lt;/a&gt;, which would have effectively ended the &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Dynasty\"&gt;Mede Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and revived the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Dynasty\"&gt;Septim Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nRitual Master: \"Wolf Queen.

Using &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Anchors\"&gt;Dark Anchors&lt;/a&gt; crafted in the Black Forge to weaken the barrier between worlds, the metaphysical chains will allow us to merge &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; and Coldharbour into a singular domain ruled by the Lord of Schemes himself.\nIt takes considerable power to form the connection across the chaos of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this energy isn't as easy to acquire as the raw materials used to create the planar hooks and chains. Powerful mortals, especially powerful magic-users, provide the cleanest, most effective source of energy. On the other end of the spectrum, the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shriven\"&gt;Soul Shriven&lt;/a&gt; are practically worthless for this purpose, as the amount of energy we can draw from them is barely enough to start the melding process let alone carry it to fruition. Unless an unlimited source of powerful mortal mages suddenly makes itself available to us, we will have to explore other alternatives.\nOur various experiments have finally paid off. We have discovered (through much trial and error) that &lt;a href=\"atronach\"&gt;atronach&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to supply enough energy to power the Dark Anchors and may even be capable of powering the ultimate Dark Anchor\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Shackle\"&gt;Great Shackle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;frost atronachs&lt;/a&gt; work well, but the most power by far is provided by the violatile &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Atronach%20%28Online%29\"&gt;storm atronachs&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures of wind and lightning will need to be acquired in great numbers to provide the energy we need to launch the Dark Anchors and the Great Shackle into Nirn.\nThis appears to be our best solution\u2014at least until we can acquire a steady source of powerful mortal mages to draw from. We will continue to work on that avenue, as well. For the glory of Molag Bal!"}

For example, a practice arrow may be used with a weak bow (such as a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Long%20Bow%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;long bow&lt;/a&gt;) and a &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frenzy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; to increase the chance the poison will be delivered without killing the target. A &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralysis&lt;/a&gt; poison can also be used on them as a way for the player to safely get close to the target to cast &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Soul Trap&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, standing while firing will avoid receiving a sneak damage bonus.\nDespite the base damage being 0, with a high &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Skills%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; and a high-powered &lt;a href=\"Bows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;, large amounts of &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; can be inflicted on a foe; one-shot kills are also possible."}

The Countess and all of her invited guests suddenly found themselves altogether\u2026in the altogether.\nThe spell apparently stripped everyone affected of all of their possessions, including the clothes on their backs. From all reports, the frightened guests handled the situation calmly, maintaining proper decorum at all times.\n\"Everybody was acting like ladies and gentleman,\" said one palace staffer who asked not to be identified. \"I don't think they was trying to sneak no glances at anyone's naughty bits.\"\nAs to the identity of the assailant, castle guards have remained silent. Some reports maintain that the culprit was apprehended at the scene; others claim that he was able to escape without detection. One witness even claims that the assailant was affected by his own spell, and fled the scene in haste when he realized he, too, had been a victim.\nWhatever the case, castle security has been on high alert since the incident. It is not known as of press time whether Countess Caro has any dinner parties planned in the near future."}

Soars-in-Laughter is located by the side of the festival grounds smoking a pipe while leaning on a cart and is easily identified by the repeatable quest giver icon that will appear above her and on the compass when close enough. When spoken to, she will invite you to pull a prank on one of her three friends. The target each time the quest is repeated is different.\n\"Now you look like someone who knows what the Jester's Festival is really about. I can spot a true prankster just by the way they walk. And you, my friend, I was coming from very far away! What do you say? Are you up for a little mischief?\"\nIf the Vestige has previously completed a prank for her, she will offer a shorter familiar greeting.\n\"Ah, my partner in hilarity! Back for more pranks? I have a great one for you today. A big laugh!\"\nKlumbert.\nKlumbert is one of the three possible targets Soars-in-Laughter may direct you to, in which case, she will request that you plant a book that is rigged to coat the target in glitter when opened, knowing that Klumbert cannot resist an unread book.\nWho's the target? \"Klumbert is so very easy to prank. He can never resist a new book. The possibility that he hasn't read something will torture him if he tries to ignore it. I bet he's never read a book with a plot twist like this one!\"\nYou will need to head to the &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; to find Klumbert who will be located at the &lt;a href=\"Market-Side%20Meadery\"&gt;Market-Side Meadery&lt;/a&gt; where he walks back and forth between his cart and the stalls. When Klumbert is looking towards the market stalls and away from his cart, you will be able to plant the prank book on his cart. When he next approaches the cart, he will see the book, open it, and fall victim to the prank.\nLejikeh.\nLejikeh is one of the three possible targets Soars-in-Laughter may direct you to, in which case, she will request that you plant a slime kit at her stall that will fall on her when she walks underneath.\nWhat's the prank, and who is the target? \"The target is my good friend, Lejikeh. She also happens to be a carpenter with a little workbench that she's always huddled under. Set up the prank kit over her awning and the second she gets under it, blech! Slime catastrophe!\"\nYou will need to head to the &lt;a href=\"Towns%20%28Online%29\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dhalmora\"&gt;Dhalmora&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bal%20Foyen\"&gt;Bal Foyen&lt;/a&gt; to find Lejikeh who will be located by the southwest gate to enter the town, nearby &lt;a href=\"Target%20Trades\"&gt;Target Trades&lt;/a&gt; where she walks back and forth from her carpentry and supplies. When Lejikeh is not tending to her supplies, you will be able to plant a bucket precariously on the roof covering the stores. When next she walks over, the bucket will fall and cover her in slime.\nSkurnd.\nSkurnd is one of the three possible targets Soars-in-Laughter may direct you to, in which case, she will request that you plant a stinkpot underneath his seat when he gets up to dance.\nWho's the target? \"Skurnd is a talented dancer with a great sense of humor. I rigged my most recent contraption to release a potent stink when activated. While Skurnd is dancing, find his seat and place the prank kit under it! It will smell awful. I hope someone faints!\"\nYou will need to head to the city of &lt;a href=\"Mistral\"&gt;Mistral&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt; where you will find Skurnd on the second-floor balcony of &lt;a href=\"The%20Boatman%27s%20Tail\"&gt;The Boatman's Tail&lt;/a&gt;. Skurnd will alternate between sitting to drink mead and dancing. When he gets up to dance, you will be able to plant the stinkpot under his seat which will trigger the next time he sits back down.\nConclusion.\nAfter the target has been successfully pranked, you will be able to return to Soars-in-Laughter at the Jester's Festival in Stonefalls where she will express her joy and gratitude at your success, followed by the completion of the quest and its associated rewards."}

Gems come in three qualities: flawed, flawless, and an unmarked standard quality. Value is ranged from flawed, standard, and flawless respectively.

In the aftermath, violent poachers seized control of the area. If left unchecked, these reckless hunters could ruin this hunting ground for generations.\"\nWalkthrough.\nIn order to start this quest, speak with &lt;a href=\"Elhalem\"&gt;Elhalem&lt;/a&gt;, who can be found in &lt;a href=\"the%20Prowl\"&gt;the Prowl&lt;/a&gt; hunting grounds. He needs help, as poachers have moved in the Prowl and have been killing the animals. Alternatively, one can head directly to &lt;a href=\"Numaia\"&gt;Numaia&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Welcome to the Prowl, friend! Lovely, eh? We sure could use some help to keep it that way.\"\nAfter listening to Elhalem, go and talk to Numaia. She can be found in her ranch, which can be found following a path east of where Elhalem is located. She is wary of poachers, as she explains that they have set camp in the Prowl, after a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; attack drove her people out. She says that animals in her care are in danger, since the poachers use her stolen training whistle to lure them out, and she asks the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; for help retrieving it. She also requests to destroy the camps of the &lt;a href=\"Bonechime%20Gang\"&gt;Bonechime Gang&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Hold there, poacher! One more step, and my sweet boy will tear you apart! Come on, Milkshop! Get up! Ah! You're useless.\"\nAfter talking to her, head to the Prowl to the east of Numaia's ranch. Her whistle can be found inside a crate with stolen goods outside of the poachers' camps, guarded by the Bonechime Gang. There are a total of three camps that need to be destroyed, all marked on the map. Once you head to the location, destroy the two crates of Poacher Supplies and burn the Poacher Tent on each site by interacting with them. Once that is done head back to Numaia.\nApproaching the ranch, flames are seen coming from the buildings, and Numaia with her workers are in a state of distress. Talking to Numaia, she will reveal that they were attacked by the Bonechime poachers while you were destroying the camps, and the animals stolen. She will instruct you to head to Bonechime Outpost, where the poachers have taken her animals, and rescue them. Numaia will let her monkey, &lt;a href=\"Marmalade\"&gt;Marmalade&lt;/a&gt;, tag along for help, and give you her whistle in order to instruct her should it be necessary. &lt;a href=\"Elhalem\"&gt;Elhalem&lt;/a&gt;, Numaia's best farm hand will also act as a follower.\n\"Thank the Moons, you are back. The poachers! They\u2014they took them!\"\nAfter talking to Numaia, head to the &lt;a href=\"Bonechime%20Outpost\"&gt;Bonechime Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Two of her animals, the jackal &lt;a href=\"Honeydew\"&gt;Honeydew&lt;/a&gt; and the senche-panther &lt;a href=\"Lavender%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lavender&lt;/a&gt; are being held outside the outpost, guarded by members of the Gang. Although Elhalem is a follower for this portion of the quest, he will not help in combat, instead cowering once one of the enemies attacks. Of the two animals, Lavender is the easiest to get to, locked inside a cage. In order to free her, simply activate the cage, and she will run away towards the ranch.\nElhalem: \"Hold on, Lavender. We'll get you out!\"\n\"She'll find her way home. We have more work to do.\"\nHoneydew's cage is on top of an elevated platform, so you will need to use Marmalade's help in order to rescue him. Once close enough, a prompt will show up for you to use the whistle. Once it is activated, Marmalade will show up, unlocking the cage and freeing Honeydew.\nElhalem: \"Honeydew! Bit high up, though. Maybe Marmalade can unlock it for us.\"\n\"Well done! Let's keep moving.\"\nAfter freeing the two animals, you must head inside the outpost to find the rest of the beasts. The door to enter is locked, so you will need to use the whistle again so that Marmalade can help you. She will slip through the planks next to the door, and pull a lever inside, unlocking the door. \nElhalem: \"Door's locked eh? Damn. Maybe Marmalade can fit through the crack, there.\"\n\"Ha! She did it! The door's unlocked Let's head in.\"\nAfter entering the outpost, more poachers can be found guarding it. &lt;a href=\"Sugar-Belly\"&gt;Sugar-Belly&lt;/a&gt;, the senche lioness, can be found in a cage inside, which can simply be unlocked by activating it. After rescuing her, the path to Rahti's Command Post is blocked by a locked door. There is a drunken guard standing guard on top of a platform, who in his state is unable to see you. Use the whistle in order for Marmalade to steal the key for the door. She will drop it on the ground below the platform, and you can then pick it up.\nElhalem: \"Off with you, Sugar-Belly! Now, another locked door, eh? I bet Marmalade could nick a key off that drunken guard.\"\nAfter entering the command post, head further inside. &lt;a href=\"Milkshop\"&gt;Milkshop&lt;/a&gt;, the last of Numaia's beasts, can be found inside a cage at the very end. The senche lion is guarded by the leader of the poachers, &lt;a href=\"Rahti%20the%20Peeler\"&gt;Rahti the Peeler&lt;/a&gt;.\nElhalem: \"Milkshop! He's alive! Let's set him loose!\"\nAfter defeating Rahti, unlock the cage of Milkshop and set him free to go back to the ranch. After all the animals are rescued, Elhalem will leave and head back to Numaia.\nElhalem: \"That's all of them! Meet you back at the ranch, hero!\"\nGo back to the ranch and talk to Numaia. She will thank you and reward you for your help.\n\"There is Numaia's favorite ranch hand! When Milkshop and sneaky Marmalade returned, this one knew you would not be far behind.\""}

The ruined halls extend into the mountain, with small hallways leading into the large mining tunnel. Nchuleft Depths has a large Dwarven tower, with bridges that spiral down into the other levels. Eventually, the lava bed appears on the ground.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Second%20Planting\"&gt;Second Planting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ihlendam\"&gt;Lord Ihlendam&lt;/a&gt; visited the city-state of Nchuleft to meet with several figures which included &lt;a href=\"General%20Rkungthunch\"&gt;General Rkungthunch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalen-Zanchu\"&gt;Dalen-Zanchu&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Bluthanch\"&gt;Bluthanch&lt;/a&gt; and her sons, the people of the meeting were talking about a treasonous plot against the Council of Dwarves. Eventually, in the spring, the Dwarven leaders met with each other at the halls of &lt;a href=\"Bamz-Amschend\"&gt;Bamz-Amschend&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating with each other. Amidst the party, Ihlendam proclaimed himself to be above everyone, and Bluthanch got angry, challenging him to battle. Fortunately, the less drunk party-goers were able to keep them calm, and everyone left for their respective colonies. Bluthanch eventually invited Ihlendam to a parlay at &lt;a href=\"Hendor-Stardumz\"&gt;Hendor-Stardumz&lt;/a&gt;, though Ihlendam's people were suspicious. Ihlendam ignored their warnings and was killed in &lt;a href=\"Chinzinch%20Pass\"&gt;Chinzinch Pass&lt;/a&gt;. People blamed Bluthanch's sons with the death of Ihlendam. The Lord was later buried in &lt;a href=\"Leftunch\"&gt;Leftunch&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Exiles\"&gt;Red Exiles&lt;/a&gt; utilized Nchuleft as a redoubt when they drove out the &lt;a href=\"Zainab%20Tribe\"&gt;Zainab Tribe&lt;/a&gt; from Nchuleft. &lt;a href=\"Barilzar\"&gt;Barilzar&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20Apostles\"&gt;Clockwork Apostles&lt;/a&gt; was seeking out a manual clockwork shaft in the ruins of Nchuleft, which was need to build his &lt;a href=\"Tonal%20Inverter\"&gt;Tonal Inverter&lt;/a&gt;. Barilzar hired &lt;a href=\"Leona%20Blasio\"&gt;Leona Blasio&lt;/a&gt; to find the item at Nchuleft, but she was unable to find it. With no one left, Barilzar tasked an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Outlander&lt;/a&gt; with finding the various items for the Inverter, so they traveled to Nchuleft and found it. With the necessary components, Barilzar was able to build the Tonal Inverter. At one point, the Zainab Tribe needed the Dwarven scraps of Nchuleft, so they called upon the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hall of Justice&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt; to drive them out.

Whether you have parties who are already in agreement with one another, or groups who would love nothing more than to rip out each other's throats, navigating talks between them must be orchestrated with care.\nNo matter if you are an accomplished diplomat or a businessperson, negotiating is an essential skill. Anyone can learn it, but it must be practiced and refined. Here, I will list a few techniques that are invaluable to the skilled negotiator.\nPatience! Negotiations can be incredibly frustrating. Maintaining a level head throughout the proceedings, even when others seem to be doing their best to vex you, will undoubtedly help everyone reach an agreement. If you find yourself raising your voice or unable to calm down, you might consider taking a break until such emotions subside.\nMake sure you have a comfortable and spacious meeting area. Cramped and disagreeable places tend to foster the same qualities in the negotiations. You want people to feel at ease while broaching the topic under discussion. Make sure it's not too hot wherever you are, as that's bound to increase tensions. If it cannot be helped, make sure to provide cool refreshments.\nEnsure that everyone is heard during the meeting. Negotiations are most often snuffed out before they ever get the chance to start because of one group feeling misunderstood or even outright ignored. If you ensure that everyone has time to state their case, and that their words are understood, then your negotiations will run much smoother!"}

Necrom is colloquially known as the \"City of the Dead\", as many great warriors and leaders of the province are buried here so that their spirits can be comforted against the deafening chill of the mortal plane. Despite this, Necrom is a thriving metropolis controlled by either &lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Indoril\"&gt;Indoril&lt;/a&gt;, built on a hierarchy of Temple priests who in turn govern the vast necropolis.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nNecrom is situated along the Central Highlands, in an area where the &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20District\"&gt;Indoril District&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dres%20District\"&gt;Dres District&lt;/a&gt; meet each other, but since it has a complex hierarchy of priests and attendants it may be the property of the Tribunal Temple and therefore Temple Territory. It is also suggested that Necrom's house affiliation is &lt;a href=\"Dres\"&gt;Dres&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. Necrom sits on cliffsides that are known to be treacherous and outright dangerous. The area in question is a peninsula that juts out, being south of the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt;. The city is surrounded in white, gleaming towers that protect the city, as well as the necropolis of which Necrom is known for. Underneath the earth that Necrom stands on is a series of caves that catacomb around the area. This is where the dead can also be buried, but even then their bones are transferred to the Ghostfence on Vvardenfell. The city palace has many dark, twisted hallways. The towers against the eastern coastline of Necrom, even with the morning sun shining through, looked like the desiccated tusks of some ancient beast. Supposedly, there is a race of &lt;a href=\"Bat-Lizards\"&gt;Bat-Lizards&lt;/a&gt; to exist around Necrom and Gorne, but do not exist in modern-day.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe City of the Dead &amp; GULGA MOR JIL.\nThe city-state of Necrom's origins are unknown, but the city itself contains ties to the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; themselves. But even before that, the region that would contain both Necrom and the island of &lt;a href=\"Gorne\"&gt;Gorne&lt;/a&gt; was founded in the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; by the Aldmeri traveler, &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Pilot\"&gt;Topal the Pilot&lt;/a&gt;. According to legend, Necrom's foundation was created from the eighth monster known as GULGA MOR JIL, who was the most powerful of the eight that had escaped from &lt;a href=\"Muatra\"&gt;Muatra&lt;/a&gt;. GULGA MOR JIL was the last one to be located and slain, but instead of fighting he only questioned his death. &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the wielder of Muatra, told him that it was his nature to cast him back into &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. When the eighth monster was not satisfied with the answer, Vivec recited a poem which gave the monster the acceptance he needed to have his life taken from him. His bones would become the foundation of the city-state of Necrom. Ever since then, Necrom has been a city of the Tribunal Temple and the tradition had begun.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nBetween &lt;a href=\"2E%20573\"&gt;2E 573&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, before she was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; traveled the entire continent seeking adventure and glory, all the while learning of the culture that is presented here. One of her tales includes stealing the &lt;a href=\"Indigo%20Tomes\"&gt;Indigo Tomes&lt;/a&gt; (aka Indigo Scrolls) from the vaults of Necrom. She had done so by disguising herself as a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. The criminal Himandoril had been imprisoned for arson in Necrom some point prior to the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Angarthal\"&gt;Captain Angarthal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Ember-Eye%20Slavers\"&gt;Ember-Eye Slavers&lt;/a&gt; was contracted to bring slaves from &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; to Necrom.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nNecrom during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, which he split into nine pieces and scattered across Tamriel. The staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A hero, known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, escaped Tharn's clutches and traveled to all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces, one of the pieces being located in Morrowind. The Eternal Champion traveled to Necrom in search of the piece and, after recovering it at &lt;a href=\"Dagoth-Ur%20%28Arena%20Location%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt;, assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;.

The guild's disdain is so great that wearing &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Robes\"&gt;Necromancer's Robes&lt;/a&gt; inside one of the Mages Guild buildings will cause the resident members to ignore the wearer; they may even become hostile if the robes are worn around them for too long.\nEquipment and combat.\nNecromancers do not wear &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, but instead wear special &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Robes\"&gt;Necromancer's Robes&lt;/a&gt;.

They also carry several scrolls, and a few healing and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; potions.\nUsually, upon discovering the Hero, necromancers will summon an undead creature, and then &lt;a href=\"Drain%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;drain&lt;/a&gt; the Hero's abilities. Then they will run away leaving their summoned creature to engage in combat. They are fairly easy to beat on their own, but in groups they can be deadly. When groups are encountered, a good tactic is to draw them out one at a time with a target spell and draw them away from the others, taking them out one at a time. It is best to focus on killing the necromancer instead of trying to kill their summons, as the necromancer will likely summon another one soon after the first is defeated. They can be difficult for melee fighters as they retreat often and are quite fast.\nThey lack any kind of armor, so a &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;sneak&lt;/a&gt; attack arrow can often kill them instantly if the Hero has decent Sneak.

However, &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bound weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, which also falls under the school of Conjuration, consumes stamina when swung or shot. As such, mages with low stamina may find using the amulet for bound weapons less beneficial.

Necromancy particularly deals with enslavement and utilization of involuntary souls and their bodies. When employed to perform &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; burial rituals it has also been referred to as Spirit Magic.\nBackground.\nAccording to the Dunmer, animation or control of a deceased's flesh or spirit is righteous when practiced according to established cult ritual, but illegal and abominable in the hands of secular sorcerers.\nNecromancy is not illegal in the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, though body and spirit are protected as property, and may not be used without the permission of the owner, and public display of the living dead is widely prohibited. &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; is the only province of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in which necromancy has been banned and is illegal. Mages may purchase corpses and souls for philosophical research, and may do with them as they wish in private. Necromancers and &lt;a href=\"Vampires\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt; are widely confused in the public mind, and persecuted, but in remote locations, necromancers are free to pursue their studies without legal interference. Necromancy as a whole is still widely debatable throughout &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and different factions and cults have different reasons for why they approve of or reject this dark art. Necromancy also involves animating the dead (as shown by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Worms\"&gt;Staff of Worms&lt;/a&gt;) and the creation of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;s, capable of &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Trap\"&gt;imprisoning the souls&lt;/a&gt; of humanoids. The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; bans the art of necromancy under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently why many mages left the guild. However, &lt;a href=\"Falcar\"&gt;Falcar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt; still studies it until he leaves (though without the Guild's knowledge), judging by the Black Soul Gems found in his room. Most necromancers strive to become &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es, but very\u00a0few have the means and the knowledge of how to do so. There are many books on the subject of necromancy, such as \"&lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Moon%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Necromancer's Moon&lt;/a&gt;\", a book about the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;, a necromantic cult, and \"&lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Preparation%20v%20I\"&gt;Corpse Preparation&lt;/a&gt;\", which describes ways of acquiring and preparing corpses for necromantic purposes.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0allows (to some degree) the practice of Necromancy, as many of the spells in the &lt;a href=\"Conjuration\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; field of magic are spells that reanimate fallen corpses. Skyrim as a whole technically permits the practice of necromancy, but the population, already mistrustful of magic,\u00a0is very disapproving of its practice and might even treat necromancers with hostility."}

In provinces such as &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, where Necromancy was illegal, Guild mages practicing it were forced to operate out of sight and mind of the Morrowind government, as well as the Mages Guild. It is unknown if the Ban extended to the other provinces, or whether it was specific to Cyrodiil. What is known is that, in Cyrodiil, once the ban was posted, the Guild lost scores of mages. Half of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Mages\"&gt;Council of Mages&lt;/a&gt; resigned in protest. Though the Guild continued to function without difficulty, it was severely weakened.\nReasons.\n&lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; Traven wrote a book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Arts%20On%20Trial\"&gt;The Black Arts On Trial&lt;/a&gt;\", which gave insight into his beliefs on Necromancy and his reasons for enacting the ban. In the book, Traven drew heavily on the old doctrines of both the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the book presented two Magisters of the Guild debating the issue, providing good reasons for and against Necromancy. The Magister for Necromancy, Ulliceta gra-Kogg, was later discovered to be a Necromancer herself. Traven still used her arguments in the book, and in the end drew the conclusion that \"the risks of studying Necromancy outweigh its usefulness.\" On the basis that the Black Arts were corrupting and wicked in their nature, and that their use would pollute the Guild beyond recall, Traven banned the practice of Necromancy.\nEffects.\nWhile at first the Ban seemed to have done little harm to the Guild, save decreasing its number, it would backfire on the Guild eventually. That backlash came in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm\"&gt;Order of the Black Worm&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, King of Worms and Tamriel's most powerful Necromancer. Traveling to Cyrodiil, Mannimarco gathered to him the Mages that had been cast off by the Guild for their practice of Necromancy. He proceeded to launch an all out attack on the Mages Guild, with the intent of destroying the institution once and for all. Though the Attack was foiled by Arch-Mage Traven and his protege, the &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Champion of the Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;, the Guild was left in a severely weakened state. Traven himself perished in the struggle.\nFollowing his death, the Champion became the new Arch-Mage of the Mages Guild. The Champion did not lift the Ban, and during and after the attack, opinions on Necromancy were shifted to a more negative outlook."}

{"id": "3322", "revid": "44917185", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3322", "title": "Nede", "text": "Nedes, also known as Nedic people, were an ancient &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"men\"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; long extinct who existed throughout &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adabal-a\"&gt;The Adabal-a&lt;/a&gt;\" reveals they consisted of several indigenous tribes in Cyrodiil, including the &lt;a href=\"Kothringi\"&gt;Kothringi&lt;/a&gt;, the Al-Gemha, Men-of-Ge, Al-Hared and Men-of-Ket. While Nedes are often considered a single race of man, it has been said that they are more accurately a wide panoply of extremely varied mannish cultures and tribes who eventually would become more united through interactions within Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; race can trace their roots to the Nedic people after they bred with the &lt;a href=\"Atmorans\"&gt;Atmorans&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most notable of Nedes is &lt;a href=\"St.%20Alessia\"&gt;St. Alessia&lt;/a&gt;, who defeated the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; forces which &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;enslaved&lt;/a&gt; her people.\nPhysical appearance.\nNot much is known about the Nedes as they had all died in the ninth century of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. In when the Vestige travels back in time they meet multiple Nedic warriors. The Nedes have a similar appearance to modern Imperials and look slightly Nordic. They have skin tone that of &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;, and have greenish-blue eyes.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nWhere exactly the Nedes originated from remains a mystery throughout history. The most commonly believed theory is that the Nedes originated from &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; and migrated to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; in a varying waves that took place during the early-mid &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;. However, according to the famed Imperial scholar, &lt;a href=\"Hasphat%20Antabolis\"&gt;Hasphat Antabolis&lt;/a&gt;, the theory that the Nedes came from Atmora has little to no archaeological evidence supporting it. It is speculated that the idea had been implanted in Imperial culture with the coming of the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt; and its \"Nordic Fatherland\" principles. The earliest known documented history on the Nedes, within Tamriel, is believed to date back to around &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;ME 1000&lt;/a&gt;. Some theories even say that the Nedes were always on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLiving in the Deathlands of Hammerfell.\nDuring their time the Nedes lived in the area that is now called &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. They received numerous invasions from the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Despite the attacks the Nedes survived and prospered within their region. They were skilled in stonework and constructed entire cities made of stone. Some ancient cave paintings found in &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; seem to imply there were relations between the Nedes and the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; of the region until war broke out between the two races, with the Orcs seemingly being defeated.\nThey disappeared from the deathlands after the &lt;a href=\"Yokudans\"&gt;Yokudans&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0(Ra Gada) came and wiped them out, although their culture had been slowly disappearing for a long time already.\nEnslavement Under the Ayleids.\nIn the early First Era, the Ayleids had control over central Tamriel, or Cyrodiil. They conspired with &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; to provide armies for them, and used this power to enslave the races of men, keeping them in line, or murdering them.\nA Nedic woman by the name of Alessia sought Divine aid. Sources vary on whether it was &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt; who answered her prayers. &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; (who was said to be the son of Kyne), as well as &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, was sent to help her. Nords from Skyrim and rebel Ayleid also helped the slaves overthrow their elven masters.\nAlessia received the &lt;a href=\"Amulet%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Amulet of Kings&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;, and blessed her with the blood of dragons. So long as Alessia and her descendants kept true to the Dragon blood, the worship of the &lt;a href=\"Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonfires\"&gt;Dragonfires&lt;/a&gt; remained lit, and bore the Amulet of Kings, Akatosh would keep the barriers between &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt; sealed.\nPeace with the Ayleids.\nBy the time none of the Nedes who suffered from enslavement by the Ayleids were still alive, there was an uneasy peace between the two peoples. A servant of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Culanwe\"&gt;Culanwe&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with brokering peace between the Ayleids and the Nedes. At first the negotiations did not yield positive results and Culanwe feared the Nedes will break off negotiations. At some point during the negotiations an Ayleid messenger was murdered and the Ayleids suspected the Nedes were responsible. Realizing escalations between the two peoples might lead to another war, Culanwe used her voice to adjust reality to forestall conflict. Around the same time a Nede and an Ayleid joined together to solve the mystery, they discovered that a servant of Molag Bal murdered the Ayleid messenger in an attempted to ruin the peace negotiations. After the mystery was solved hostilities between the Nedes and the Ayleids ceased, and peace was established when the two heroes wed.\nWar with the Chimer.\nDuring the early First Era, the Nedes were known to have had a war with the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; after they had recently arrived in Morrowind.\u00a0After a few years, the Nedes controlled an area known as the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt;. Then the Chimer army came from the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt; and brought reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Brothers &lt;a href=\"Balreth\"&gt;General Balreth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Legate%20Sadal\"&gt;Legate Sadal&lt;/a&gt; were with a small elite force that took refuge in a &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20ruin\"&gt;Daedric ruin&lt;/a&gt;. The brothers sacrificed themselves to create the Brothers of Strife and defeated much of the Nedic army, but had killed many of the Chimer in the process.\u00a0Because the Chimer had turned into the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura's&lt;/a&gt; curse in &lt;a href=\"1E%20700\"&gt;1E 700&lt;/a&gt;, it can be known that this battle had taken place prior to that.\nDisappearance.\nMany events caused the Nede population to shrink in Tamriel, and as of the ninth century of the First Era they had been confined to the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0When the Ra Gada of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt; had arrive in &lt;a href=\"1E%20808\"&gt;1E 808&lt;/a&gt;, they attacked the Nedes. The Nedes had fled to &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; but were quickly annihilated by the invaders.\nWhile the Nedic people have long since disappeared from Tamriel as a distinct culture and ethnicity, their bloodline still persists through the Imperials of Cyrodiil and to a lesser extent through the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim. Many Nedes became the ancestors of today's Cyrodilic Imperials, while northern Nedic tribes interbred with the newly arrived invaders from Atmora in the Merethic Era, giving rise to the modern-day bloodlines of Skyrim's Nords.\nLegacy and descendants.\nTheir legacy is passed on by their descendants; mainly the Imperials of Cyrodiil. Despite playing a large part in eradicating the race, much of Nedic culture was also adopted by the Redguards.\u00a0The most notable Nedic legacy was the slave queen St. Alessia's \"Amulet of Kings,\" which was eventually sacrificed by &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;third&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fourth%20era\"&gt;fourth era&lt;/a&gt;s. The Nedic people are still remembered for their profound feats in &lt;a href=\"Metallurgy\"&gt;Metallurgy&lt;/a&gt;.\nFew Nedes are known to have survived beyond the First Era, and even fewer remained sane. The most notable was &lt;a href=\"Lamae%20Beolfag\"&gt;Lamae Beolfag&lt;/a&gt;, or Lamae Bal, a young tribeswoman who was transformed by the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; into the first known &lt;a href=\"vampire\"&gt;vampire&lt;/a&gt;. Her state of undeath caused her to persist well into the later stages of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, as well as some of her clan members, who were also Nedic vampires. Another was &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Valerius\"&gt;Titus Valerius&lt;/a&gt;, who came from the First Era. He was brought into the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Warrior\"&gt;The Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, who later returns him to his own time once his task is done. The Nedes in &lt;a href=\"Shada%27s%20Tear\"&gt;Shada's Tear&lt;/a&gt; lived as undead due to a curse, though only &lt;a href=\"Nhalan\"&gt;Nhalan&lt;/a&gt; remained conscious out of all of them. A Nedic vampire known as &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Durac\"&gt;High King Durac&lt;/a&gt; lived into the Second Era as well, but was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; in 2E 582.\nThe Imperials are believed the most direct modern descendants of the Nedes. The &lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; are descendants of both Nedes and elves, though they are more prominently men. It is claimed that the most traditionally Nedic area of Tamriel is &lt;a href=\"Nibenay%20Valley\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Nibenese people are the closest thing to purebred Nedes.\nCulture.\nReligion.\nThe Nedes were known to have originally worshiped the star-oriented beings known as the &lt;a href=\"Celestials\"&gt;Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, having a particular fascination with the &lt;a href=\"Birthsigns\"&gt;constellations&lt;/a&gt; and their aspects. The earliest Cyrodiilic Nedes were known to primarily venerate &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt; as their patron deity, until they were conquered and enslaved by the elves, eventually taking up the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Pantheon\"&gt;Aldmeri Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;.

That buried beneath rock and sand, hidden from view by the monuments of conquering &lt;a href=\"Ra%20Gada\"&gt;Yokudans&lt;/a&gt;, is more than just the detritus of a barbaric and underdeveloped people?\nThis is the claim Sali'ma at-Muhay makes in his latest work of scholarship on the &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt; and their presence in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;, and he presents some compelling new evidence to support this claim. In studying the mage towers in &lt;a href=\"Elinhir%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elinhir&lt;/a&gt; closely, he has concluded that these towers are not of the right age to be of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;n fabrication, nor do they use the same stone-crafting techniques employed by the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt;s. In some regards, they resemble &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; handiwork, but only in a crude way. From this, at-Muhay concludes that these towers were not a lost form of high Yokudan architecture transplanted from the Yokudan homeland, but are in fact, the remnants of a Nedic civilization.\nIf at-Muhay's conclusions are right, then the Nedes were much more organized and advanced than historians have previously thought. Elinhir's towers could only have been crafted by an advanced culture adept at stonework.\nThese towers have been occupied since the Blackcaster mages established their academy in Elinhir\u2014so why is at-Muhay the first to propose this startling theory?\nThis author posits that historians are not without their blind spots, and that the Nedes are certainly among the biggest. The reasons for this are many:\nIn the first, the Nedic people had a history of falling prey to conquering armies. The Dwemer, the Ayleids, and the Yokudans all proclaimed themselves masters of the Eastern Hammerfell Nedes at some point. It was in the interests of these conquering peoples to justify their conquests by proclaiming the Nedes a backward people worthy only of enslavement.\nIn the second, the Nedes as a distinctive people disappear from the historical record shortly after Ra Gada, and by then the records that exist are few and scattered. By the time the first Yokudans set foot on the shores of Hammerfell, the Nedic culture was already fading, and the people were scattered and broken. Most of the Nedes had long since migrated and intermingled with the other &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Online%29\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, virtually fading from existence.\nIt's vital that we take this new theory about the Nedes seriously. I suspect that the remote region of &lt;a href=\"Craglorn\"&gt;Craglorn&lt;/a&gt; will bear much fruit for future researchers interested in exploring the extent of Nedic civilization, as it has undergone the least change in the time since the last Nedes disappeared."}

Requiring a bit of &lt;a href=\"Speech\"&gt;persuasion&lt;/a&gt;, intimidation, or gold, Nelacar reveals that a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Malyn%20Varen\"&gt;Malyn Varen&lt;/a&gt; stole Azura's Star from the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; and retreated to &lt;a href=\"Ilinalta%27s%20Deep\"&gt;Ilinalta's Deep&lt;/a&gt;, where he sought to achieve a measure of immortality by trapping his soul within the contraption.\nAftermath and rewards.\nAfter recovering the star, he can transform the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Broken Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Star%20%28Item%29\"&gt;The Black Star&lt;/a&gt;, an unlimited &lt;a href=\"Black%20Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Black Soul Gem&lt;/a&gt;.

He gives me privacy, and I make sure my experiments don't blow up his inn.\"\nUpon returning with the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Azura%27s%20Star\"&gt;Broken Azura's Star&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"Stendarr's Mercy. You found it. Azura's Star. Maybe this is my chance to make things right. I can finish Malyn's work, the way we had meant to before his madness. It would mean cutting the Star off from Azura. Only black souls would be able to enter it once we finished.\"\nInside the Star:\n\"Malyn's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself.\"\nUpon returning:\n\"Easy there. The numbness will pass. Just don't strain yourself. We've done it. The Star has been cut off from Azura, and Malyn's soul finally has some measure of peace, even if it is in non-existence.\"\nConversations.\nNelacar: \"I'm sorry, could you describe the smell?\"\nDagur: \"Like some horrible monster was turned inside out, and then exploded. What did you do?\"\nNelacar: \"It was a minor miscalculation. I've already corrected it for future experiments.\"\nDagur: \"This, this is why people have a problem with your college, Nelacar.\"\nDagur: \"Is everything well, Nelacar?\"\nNelacar: \"Oh yes, quite fine. My accommodations here continue to be just what I need.\"\nDagur: \"And there haven't been any... problems?\"\nNelacar: \"Are you referring to your other customers? No, everything is quite all right. I expect a bit of animosity now and then.\"\nDagur: \"I see. Well, let me know if things get out of hand.\"\nNelacar: \"I say, you didn't hear any loud noises last night, did you? No, ahh... explosion sounds?\"\nDagur: \"No, I certainly didn't! Is there a reason you're asking me?\"\nNelacar: \"No, certainly not. A small experiment may have gone awry, but clearly with no discernable consequences.\"\nDagur: \"I... see.

Neloth managed to survive and went on to become the most powerful wizard of House Telvanni. Some even consider him to be the most powerful wizard in all of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point before the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2005\"&gt;4E 05&lt;/a&gt;, Neloth left the island and moved to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, where he grew his citadel, &lt;a href=\"Tel%20Mithryn\"&gt;Tel Mithryn&lt;/a&gt;, and the surrounding buildings with cuttings he brought from &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. He also transplanted a few &lt;a href=\"Silt%20Strider%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;silt striders&lt;/a&gt; when he arrived.\nIt was around this time he began studying the ash and molten rocks that landed on the shores of Solstheim from Red Mountain. He named them &lt;a href=\"heart%20stone\"&gt;heart stone&lt;/a&gt;s and learned that they had the capacity to raise &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt; from pieces of bone buried in the nearby ash. Neloth deduced that because they lay next to the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; for millennia, some vestige of its power must have seeped into them. It led him to believe they held secrets that have the potential to unlock great power.\nUsing his knowledge of heart stones, he created a &lt;a href=\"staff%20enchanter\"&gt;staff enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, an exceptional feat beyond the skill of many wizards and mages. Powered by a large heart stone, it was capable of enchanting staves from all schools of magic, providing a heart stone was used in the imbuing process.\nIn addition to his arcane research, Neloth also pursued an interest in acquiring Daedric Artifacts, particularly those attributed to &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;. He spent many years searching for the &lt;a href=\"Oghma%20Infinium%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Oghma Infinium&lt;/a&gt; without success; however, he managed to recover a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;, one of the many tomes of esoteric knowledge scattered throughout the world. Using the book, he located another in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Ruins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwemer Ruin&lt;/a&gt; on the east coast of Solstheim. After exploring a small part of the ruins, he discovered the book was sealed within a protective case that he was unable to open. He elected to seal the ruins shut to keep out any meddlers until he could find a way to unlock the case.\nDecades later he took on the services of a mycologist named &lt;a href=\"Elynea%20Mothren\"&gt;Elynea Mothren&lt;/a&gt;, who became responsible for nurturing his tower, and later an apprentice named &lt;a href=\"Ildari%20Sarothril\"&gt;Ildari Sarothril&lt;/a&gt;. Ildari was headstrong with a keen interest in magic; however, her lust for power caused her to continually push Neloth to teach her more.\nContinuing his research into heart stones, Neloth began performing necropsies on &lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spriggans&lt;/a&gt;, which led him to believe that a heart stone could be implanted in a person's chest, granting them great power. He considered replacing his own heart with a heart stone; however, Ildari was coaxed into becoming his test subject with promises of power and glory. Neloth maintains the idea that Ildari volunteered to let him operate on her first. However, it is suggested that she actually had no choice in the matter. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20181\"&gt;4E 181&lt;/a&gt;, Neloth performed the surgery that resulted in Ildari's heart being replaced with a heart stone. The experiment failed and Ildari died as a result. Neloth, mildly annoyed by the setback, had her buried in the cemetery behind Tel Mithryn. It was after this he took on &lt;a href=\"Talvas%20Fathryon\"&gt;Talvas Fathryon&lt;/a&gt; as his new apprentice, as he continued his research.\nPersonality.\nNeloth is an eccentric, self-absorbed, tyrannical taskmaster with little to no regard for the safety of others, including his apprentices or employees. He cares little for sentimentality or manners, not because he deliberately sets out to be malicious, but rather because he sees little value in it; a fact that makes many of his workers disgruntled.\nHe views gratitude as a tool for the weak and foolish, but is not above rewarding those who perform their duties admirably. In fact, the only thing that seems to garner his attention is when efforts made are not wasted; believing that if a person fails, it is because they simply did not try hard enough.\nHe almost never accepts responsibility for his own flaws and does not accept the limits of others. He will often blame them for anything that goes wrong, yet is a profound genius at the art of enchanting and many other magical fields. He also has a special skill with enchantment in general; being a staff enchanter himself. He is also a collector of magical staffs, especially those crafted by &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt; and has a strong affinity for &lt;a href=\"Canis%20Root%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;canis root&lt;/a&gt; tea.\nThough many view him with disdain, none can deny his mastery over the arcane was a trait that he had earned; entitling him to his arrogance.\nDespite his ability, Neloth hints very briefly at a possible insecurity of being bested in a test of ability. If asked for training in Enchanting with a skill of 90 or above, he will say that he will not teach the player further, saying: \"\"It wouldn't do to have you become better than me after all.\" \" \nSchedule.\nNeloth is initially found at the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt;, observing the entranced townsfolk of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt;. He will remain here until he is spoken to or once the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;\" has been completed. He then moves to his home in Tel Mithryn where his daily schedule focuses mainly around his work. He often paces back and forth around his laboratory, sits down to read or engages in a brief conversation with his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Talvas%20Fathryon\"&gt;Talvas Fathryon&lt;/a&gt;. He also casts the &lt;a href=\"Candlelight%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Candlelight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Healing\"&gt;Fast Healing&lt;/a&gt; spell on himself from time to time.\nDespite there being several beds in Tel Mithryn, Neloth never seems to sleep. A trait best summarized by Talvas when he remarks: \"I don't know how he does it, but he never rests for even a moment.\"; although on other occasions he reveals that Neloth apparently sleeps with his eyes open.\nThe only time he breaks this schedule is when he travels with the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt; during the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;The Path of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf approached at the Earth Stone, he will ask why the Dragonborn is here. If asked about &lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;Miraak&lt;/a&gt;, he mentions that Miraak has been dead for thousands of years. He then suggests the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Miraak\"&gt;Temple of Miraak&lt;/a&gt; may hold some answers. See &lt;a href=\"%23Earth%20Stone\"&gt;Quotes&lt;/a&gt; for the full dialogue.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Path%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;The Path of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Skaal\"&gt;The Fate of the Skaal&lt;/a&gt;, cleansing the Wind Stone and freeing his people, &lt;a href=\"Storn%20Crag-Strider\"&gt;Storn Crag-Strider&lt;/a&gt; suggests Neloth may know the location of the Black Book that gave Miraak his &lt;a href=\"Bend%20Will\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; over the dragons. Upon meeting him, the Telvanni wizard reveals his vast knowledge of the tomes of esoteric knowledge created by Hermaeus Mora and explains that is located in the Dwarven ruin of &lt;a href=\"Nchardak\"&gt;Nchardak&lt;/a&gt; and may be related to Miraak in some way. Neloth travels with the Dragonborn to the sunken city to recover the Black Book from its depths.\n&lt;a href=\"Heart%20Stones%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Heart Stones&lt;/a&gt;.\nPursuing his study into the ash from &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Neloth explains that he is running low on heart stone and requires the Dragonborn to bring him one. This can happen repeatedly.\n&lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Research\"&gt;Telvanni Research&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeloth reveals he is working on &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;a new spell&lt;/a&gt; that would allow him to conjure &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn\"&gt;Ash Spawn&lt;/a&gt;. He requires the Dragonborn to obtain &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Spawn%20Sample\"&gt;a sample&lt;/a&gt; of ash from the remains of one such creature using his &lt;a href=\"ash%20extractor\"&gt;ash extractor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;Reluctant Steward&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeloth's steward, &lt;a href=\"Varona%20Nelas%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Varona Nelas&lt;/a&gt;, has gone missing. After some investigation, it is discovered that she was attacked and killed on a supply run to Raven Rock by &lt;a href=\"ash%20spawn\"&gt;ash spawn&lt;/a&gt;. Neloth, mildly annoyed by the inconvenience, tasks the Dragonborn to find him a suitable candidate from Raven Rock, then expresses mild discontent with the &lt;a href=\"Drovas%20Relvi\"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href=\"%23Old%20Friends\"&gt;later revealed&lt;/a&gt; that his steward's death was not merely bad luck, but something more sinister was afoot.\n&lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Subject%20%28Neloth%27s%20Health%20Boost%29\"&gt;Experimental Subject (Neloth's Health Boost)&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeloth offers the Dragonborn the opportunity to become a test subject for &lt;a href=\"Neloth%27s%20Health%20Boost\"&gt;a new spell&lt;/a&gt; that supposedly increases the target's vigor. Once the spell is cast, he remarks that if any side effects are apparent, he should be notified straight away. The spell itself provides a small permanent boost to health, however, coming into contact with water in turn permanently reduces health a similarly small amount, until Neloth is informed and the spell is reversed.\n&lt;a href=\"Briarheart%20Necropsy\"&gt;Briarheart Necropsy&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttempting to reach a breakthrough in his research into heart stones, Neloth reveals he is having difficulties with his experiments. He explains that a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt; uses a technique which involves removing their own heart and replacing it with a large briar seed. He believes this puts their life spark in direct connection to the natural forces and grants them great power. Neloth wishes to mimic this deadly procedure with a heart stone, which, he hopes, will be able to connect a living being to the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s power seared into the material of Red Mountain.\nIn order to learn more about the methods the savage Briarhearts use, he asks the Dragonborn to examine one with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Neloth%27s%20Memory%20Spell\"&gt;memory trace spell&lt;/a&gt; he casts beforehand. He also requires the Briarheart to be killed so that their&lt;a href=\"Briar%20Heart\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; can be examined properly.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Friends\"&gt;Old Friends&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;the death&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=\"Varona%20Nelas%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;, recurrent ash spawn assaults, and the &lt;a href=\"Healing%20a%20House\"&gt;withering of his tower&lt;/a&gt;, even falsely accusing dragons of purposely attacking him, Neloth asks the Dragonborn to investigate the matter further as he suspects someone deeply hateful of him is responsible. After uncovering the empty grave of his former apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Ildari%20Sarothril\"&gt;Ildari Sarothril&lt;/a&gt;, Neloth discovers that she is indeed still alive and is likely the one behind the attacks.\nAfter casting a divination, Neloth reveals &lt;a href=\"Highpoint%20Tower\"&gt;her location&lt;/a&gt; and asks the Dragonborn to go kill his former apprentice. Upon completion of the grim task, Neloth honors the Dragonborn by naming them a member of House Telvanni. If asked about what this means, he replies: \"\"For now, not much. But in a few decades when I return to Vvardenfell, you would be seen as Morrowind nobility. In the mean time, we would keep a bed and chest here for you.\" \"The bed and chest is a lie.\n&lt;a href=\"Azra%27s%20Staffs\"&gt;Azra's Staffs&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a break from his research into heart stones and ash spawn, Neloth makes a more personal request. He explains he is a collector of &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magical staffs&lt;/a&gt;, with an especially sentimental value for those made by the legendary &lt;a href=\"Azra%20Nightwielder\"&gt;Azra Nightwielder&lt;/a&gt;. Through some divination, he believes he has located one and would like it retrieved. Once Azra's staff is retrieved, Neloth rewards the Dragonborn with a staff from his own collection.\n&lt;a href=\"Experimental%20Subject%20%28Silence%29\"&gt;Experimental Subject (Silence)&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing his research into the arcane, Neloth believes he has discovered a new form of silence and he requires a test subject to test this. Allowing him to precede unexpectedly results in the Dragonborn's blindness. Eventually, the spell wears off and he rewards the Dragonborn with some gold as a way of thanks.\n&lt;a href=\"Wind%20and%20Sand%20%28Dragonborn%20Quest%29\"&gt;Wind and Sand&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeloth reveals he has been trying to adapt Redguard magic to his studies of the ashes. He believes the key concept he is missing is recorded in &lt;a href=\"Afa-Saryat\"&gt;Afa-Saryat's&lt;/a&gt; book, \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%20and%20Sand%20%28Dragonborn%20Book%29\"&gt;Wind and Sand&lt;/a&gt;\". According to one of his associates, he has located the book and asks the Dragonborn to retrieve it for him.\nAfter acquiring the book and returning it to Neloth, he will remark that although the book was not the answer he was looking for, he can still adapt the knowledge he has learned into a spell that creates &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Cloak\"&gt;a cloak with the power of a whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;. He mentions he will write out the specifics into a spell tome and have Talvas put it out for sale in a few days.\n&lt;a href=\"At%20the%20Summit%20of%20Apocrypha\"&gt;At the Summit of Apocrypha&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the main questline has been completed and Miraak defeated, visiting Neloth in Tel Mithryn results in him approaching the Dragonborn and holding a conversation.\n&lt;a href=\"Lost%20Knowledge\"&gt;Lost Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeloth reveals that he knows of the location of a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Book\"&gt;Black Book&lt;/a&gt;. Excitedly, he asks the Dragonborn to retrieve it, hoping it might contain the final secrets of &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the book has been recovered, Neloth grants a reward and makes a copy for himself, remarking that it is far too dangerous to carry the real book around, allowing the Dragonborn to carry the book instead.\nServices.\nEnchanting training.\nIf asked about &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; training, Neloth reveals himself to be a true master of the art. If Enchanting skill level is less than 90, he reluctantly agrees to give a lesson. If skill level is equal to or higher than 90, he becomes defensive and refuses to train the Dragonborn, a sharp contrast to all other &lt;a href=\"Trainers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skill trainers&lt;/a&gt; who, in the same circumstances, simply state that they do not have the knowledge to train the Dragonborn any further.\nStaves merchant.\nIn addition to providing training, Neloth also serves as a magical goods merchant. Most notably, he sells &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Dragonborn%29%23Staves\"&gt;unenchanted staves&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to regular &lt;a href=\"Staves%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;enchanted staves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt;. Provided he has granted use of his &lt;a href=\"staff%20enchanter\"&gt;staff enchanter&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;finding him a new steward&lt;/a&gt;, the unenchanted staves can be enchanted.\nHe typically carries 1000 on hand for trading, but this can be increased to 2000 with the &lt;a href=\"Master%20Trader\"&gt;Master Trader&lt;/a&gt; perk.\nCombat.\nIn battle, Neloth proves himself to be a powerful mage. He typically activates his &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Cloak\"&gt;Whirlwind Cloak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ebonyflesh\"&gt;Ebonyflesh&lt;/a&gt; as battle begins, and the core of his arsenal consists of shock-related spells, such as &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderbolt\"&gt;Thunderbolt&lt;/a&gt;, which are 50% more powerful thanks to his &lt;a href=\"Augmented%20Shock%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Augmented Shock&lt;/a&gt; perk. He also conjures a powerful &lt;a href=\"Ash%20Guardian\"&gt;Ash Guardian&lt;/a&gt; to aid him, which benefits from his &lt;a href=\"Atromancy\"&gt;Atromancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Potency\"&gt;Elemental Potency&lt;/a&gt; perks.\nFor defense, he uses a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Ward\"&gt;Greater Ward&lt;/a&gt; and heals himself with &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Healing\"&gt;Fast Healing&lt;/a&gt; which is also augmented with the &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Regeneration&lt;/a&gt; perk.\nHis &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Robes\"&gt;robes&lt;/a&gt; grant him 150% increased &lt;a href=\"Regenerate%20Magicka%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;magicka regeneration&lt;/a&gt;, while his &lt;a href=\"Telvanni%20Shoes\"&gt;shoes&lt;/a&gt; give him a 70% &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Shock%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;resistance to shock&lt;/a&gt;. His passive &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance\"&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/a&gt; perk blocks 20% of incoming spell's effects. Should his large magicka supply run dry, he switches to his &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ebony dagger&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nNeloth can be first encountered at the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Earth Stone&lt;/a&gt; during the quest &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, where he will give the following dialogue. However, if this first initial meeting is skipped, he can later be met at his home in Tel Mithryn after the first quest has been completed, where his dialogue will vary slightly.\nTraveling to the Earth Stone, several townsfolk can be seen working on the structure. Neloth, who is observing nearby.\n\"Ah, so you appear to be able to resist the effect by exerting your will. Fascinating! I would not advise touching the stone again. The effects of repeated contact could be... Unless of course you'd like to contribute to my investigation. It could be very enlightening to observe you.\"\nEither after the meeting at the Earth Stone or once the quest &lt;a href=\"Dragonborn%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; has been completed, Neloth returns to Tel Mithryn. If he was met during the aforementioned quest he asks: \"\"You again. Didn't I see you in Raven Rock?\" \" If this is first time meeting him, he will instead remark: \"I don't recall inviting you into my tower. I do hope you make this worth my while.\"\nVisiting Tel Mithryn at night, before completion of the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20the%20Stones\"&gt;Cleansing the Stones&lt;/a&gt;,\" reveals everyone in the settlement has gone to work at the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Stone%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Sun Stone&lt;/a&gt;, under Miraak's spell.\nWhere is everyone? \"They are off working on their pillar. Happens every night.\"\nDuring \"&lt;a href=\"Old%20Friends\"&gt;Old Friends&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Briarheart%20Necropsy\"&gt;Briarheart Necropsy&lt;/a&gt;,\" Neloth can be asked about heart stones:\nWhat is a heart stone? \"When Red Mountain erupted almost two hundred years ago, it flung ash and rocks for hundreds of miles. Among the debris were heart stones. Even two centuries later, they still smolder with the heat of the mountain. These are the molten rocks that lay next to the Heart of Lorkhan for millennia. Some vestige of its power must have seeped into them. I do know that heart stones sometimes raise ash spawn from the bits of bone buried in the nearby ash.\"\nNeloth and Talvas occasionally partake in several brief conversations that can be heard when visiting Tel Mithryn. They typically result in Neloth berating his apprentice for one reason or another.\nTalvas: \"I've prepared the staff maker like you asked.\"\nNeloth: \"Good, good. As soon as I'm done here, I'll try it out.\"\nTalvas: \"May I keep this one, master?\"\nNeloth: \"We'll see. If the power levels aren't too high you may have it.\"\nTalvas: \"Master, you promised to teach me a new conjuration spell.\"\nNeloth: \"That was before you ruined that staff. Fix the staff and I'll teach you the spell.\"\nTalvas: \"Yes, master. Thank you, master. I'll fix it right away.\"\nNeloth: \"Your enchanting has improved despite your best efforts.\"\nTalvas: \"Thank you, master. It's all because of your brilliant teaching.\"\nNeloth: \"Don't think your false flattery will work on me, Talvas. You're still going to give me that skin sample.\"\nTalvas: \"Yes, master.\"\nNeloth: \"Did you fill those soul gems like I asked you?\"\nTalvas: \"Yes, master. Although the grand soul gem only has a common soul in it.\"\nNeloth: \"Idiot! Those are hard to find. Next time don't fill it at all if you can't do it properly.\"\nNeloth's steward, &lt;a href=\"Varona%20Nelas%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Varona Nelas&lt;/a&gt; will converse with him during the day, however, these conversations can only be heard before the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Reluctant%20Steward\"&gt;Reluctant Steward&lt;/a&gt;\" has began.\nOnce &lt;a href=\"Drovas%20Relvi\"&gt;Drovas Relvi&lt;/a&gt; becomes Neloth's new steward, the following conversation can be heard:\nNeloth: \"Drovas, where's my tea?\"\nDrovas: \"I'll go fetch some, Master Neloth. Canis root, right?\"\nNeloth: \"Yes, yes. Canis root tea. And don't let Ulves water it down.\""}

One day, his village was attacked and his daughter, Olga, was killed. He blames the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt; for her death because they did nothing to stop the attack.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Whodunit%3F%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Whodunit?&lt;/a&gt;.\nA client has arranged a party in order to kill off some enemies with the Dark Brotherhood's help. The goal is to kill all the guests, and a bonus is given if nobody witnesses any murder.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; first enters the building and head upstairs, they will see Nels and &lt;a href=\"Neville\"&gt;Neville&lt;/a&gt;, a former member of the legion, having a conversion about what they plan on doing with the money. This conversation will soon become heated and they will go their separate ways.\nIf the Hero speaks to Nels he will state he feels slightly protective of &lt;a href=\"Dovesi%20Dran\"&gt;Dovesi Dran&lt;/a&gt; because she reminds him of his late daughter. If Dovesi is killed before Nels is, he will say its like watching his daughter die all over again.\nIf Nels is one of the last two guest to be murdered, and the other is either Neville or &lt;a href=\"Primo%20Antonius\"&gt;Primo Antonius&lt;/a&gt;, he will think they're the killer and attack them. If Dovesi and Nels are the last two guests, and both trust the player, Nels will assume the killer is coming through the window.\nDespite the fact that most of the guests see him as nothing more than a drunk, he is the only guest to conclude that somebody was hired to kill them.\nConversations.\nNeville and Nels.\nNeville: \"\"So, Nord, if you find the gold, what will you spend it on? Wait, let me guess -- a sleazy whore and a nice new &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Axes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;battle axe&lt;/a&gt;. Am I right?\"\"\nNels: \"I'm going to open a tavern. Not that I'd welcome your patronage. No pigs allowed inside, you see. You Legion types tend to stink up a place.\"\nNeville: \"\"A tavern! Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I should have known! Leave it to a &lt;a href=\"Barbarian%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt; to spend an entire chest full of gold on &lt;a href=\"Beer\"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mead%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mead&lt;/a&gt;. How pathetic.\"\"\nNels: \"You can call me a barbarian. It's true and I'm proud of the fact. But you call me pathetic again and I'm going to show you just how barbaric I am.\"\nNeville: \"With every word you speak you're just proving me right, Nord. Your kind has contributed nothing to our Empire, and never will!\"\nNels: \"\"Ha ha ha ha ha! \"My kind,\" as you like to call us, are plenty happy serving our own needs while your useless Empire crumbles down around you!\"\nNeville: \"Your words border on treason, Nord, and I will not tolerate them! You will respect the Empire! You will respect the memory of our dear &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;!\"\"\nNels: \"Bah! Don't get your linens in a bunch. You have no authority in this house, or anywhere else. You're not even in the Legion anymore!\"\nNeville: \"Nevertheless, I still serve the Empire in my heart and will not abide such talk! Walk away from me now, barbarian, or you'll regret your arrogance.\"\nNels: \"Pfft. I was done with you anyway. I can only talk to an ex-Legion pig for so long before my ears start bleeding.

When Vestige meets Neramo, he suggests that the outer defenses of the site could be suppressed by the control station.\nVestige helps Neramo to solve the lock on the automaton control center and Neramo makes sure that the Graystone Quarry can be safely worked in again, but tells Vestige, that he has something else to do in the ruin.\nShortly after Vestige leaves the Graystone Quarry Depths, Neramo emerges with a small army of automatons, that he was able to gain control of with the help of his knowledge and the control center.\nIt is possible that Vestige persuaded the Orcs to keep the automatons as workers, for all the lost lives in the quarry.\nClockwork City quests.\n&lt;a href=\"In%20Search%20of%20a%20Sponsor\"&gt;In Search of a Sponsor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeramo made his way to Mournhold, who took the opportunity to enter the cave entrance to the Clockwork City when it was suddenly opened. Meeting the Vestige at the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Brass%20Fortress\"&gt;Brass Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, he wishes to gain a sponsor from one of the Apostles to gain citizenship."}

A suffocating fog accompanied them, some sort of defensive measure. The quarry workers tried to fend them off with shovels and picks, but they were overwhelmed in short order. So many cries. So much confusion. I survived only because of my intimate knowledge of construct capabilities. Luckily, I was able to use that knowledge to keep &lt;a href=\"Shabon\"&gt;Shabon&lt;/a&gt;, the hunt-wife's daughter, safe as well.\nEven so, it seems I am incapable of learning my lesson.

It is a scholarly retelling of a tradition transmitted through the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt;s concerning the battle at Red Mountain and subsequent events. The Ashlanders associate this tale with the telling of &lt;a href=\"Alandro%20Sul\"&gt;Alandro Sul&lt;/a&gt;, a shield-companion of &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; who came to live among the Ashlanders after the death of Nerevar and during the ascension of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt;. There are many variant treatments of this story, but the primary elements are consistent throughout the tradition. The murder of Nerevar, the tragic fate of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;, and the profane source of the Tribunal's divine power are denied by Temple doctrine as ignorant Ashlander superstition, and not widely known among civilized &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\"]\n&lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, present day &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, was contested ground between two very different types of &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;, who worshipped &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, who worshipped a profane and secret power. These two people warred with each other constantly until their lands were invaded by a young, vibrant, and violent alien culture, the &lt;a href=\"Nords\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwo heroes, one from the Chimer and one from the Dwemer, &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dumac\"&gt;Dumac&lt;/a&gt; Dwarf-Orc, made peace between their people and together ousted the alien invaders. Then these two heroes worked long and hard to maintain that peace thereafter, though their counselors thought it could not last or, worse, that it shouldn't. Nerevar's queen and his generals-- &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; --told him to claim all Resdayn for his own. But Nerevar would not listen, for he remembered his friendship with Dumac. There would be only peace.\nUntil &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth-Ur&lt;/a&gt; arrived. &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; had discovered the source of the profane and secret power of the Dwemer: the legendary &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, which Dumac's people had used to make themselves immortal and beyond the measure of the gods. In fact, one of the their high priests, &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;, was building a &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;New God&lt;/a&gt; so that the Dwemer could claim Resdayn for their own.\nThe Tribunal urged Nerevar again to make war on the Dwarves. Nerevar was troubled. He went to Dumac, his friend of old, and asked if what Dagoth-Ur said was true. But Kagrenac and the high priests of the Dwemer had kept their New God secret from their King, and Dumac said the Dwemer were innocent of any wrongdoing. Nerevar was troubled again and made pilgrimage to &lt;a href=\"Holamayan%20Monastery\"&gt;Holamayan&lt;/a&gt;, the sacret temple of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, who confirmed that all that Dagoth-Ur said was indeed true and that the New God of the Dwemer should be destroyed for the safety of not only Resdayn, but for the whole world. When Nerevar went back and told his Tribunal what the goddess had said, his queen and generals felt themselves proved aright and again counseled him to war. There were reasons that the Dwemer and Chimer had hated each other forever.\nFinally, Nerevar, angered that his friend Dumac would lie to him, went back to &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. This time the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; King was arrayed in arms and armor and had his hosts around him, and he spoke harshly to Dumac Dwarf-Orc, King of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. \"You must give up your worship of the Heart of Lorkhan or I shall forget our friendship and the deeds that were accomplished in its name!\" And Dumac, who still knew nothing of &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac's&lt;/a&gt; New God, but proud and protective as ever of his people, said, \"We shall not relinquish that which has been our way for years beyond reckoning, just as the Chimer will not relinquish their ties to the Lords and Ladies of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. And to come at my door in this way, arrayed in arms and armor and with your hosts around you, tells me you have already forgotten our friendship. Stand down, my sweet Nerevar, or I swear by the fifteen-and-one golden tones I shall kill you and all your people.\"\nAnd so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war. The Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but the bravery and cleverness of Nerevar's queen and generals drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and kept them there, so that Nerevar and Dagoth-Ur could make their way into the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20Chamber\"&gt;Heart Chamber&lt;/a&gt; by secret means. There, Nerevar met Dumac and the Dwarf King and they both fell from grievous wounds. Dagoth-Ur slew Kagrenac and took the tools the Dwemer used to tap the power of the Heart. He went to his dying lord Nerevar and asked him what to do with these tools. And Nerevar summoned Azura again, and she showed them how to use the tools to separate the power of the Heart from the Dwemer people.\nAnd on the fields, the Tribunal and their armies watched as the Dwemer turned into dust all around them as their stolen immortality was taken away.\nBack in Red Mountain, Nerevar told Dagoth-Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned. Dagoth-Ur said, \"But shouldn't we destroy these tools at once, so that they might never be used for evil again?\" But Nerevar was confused by his wounds and his sorrow (for he still loved Dumac and the Dwemer people) and so went to the fields outside of Red Mountain to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. \"I will ask the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth-Ur, until I return.\"\nThen Nerevar told his queen and generals all that had transpired under Red Mountain and how the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and of the wondrous power of the Heart of Lorkhan. The Tribunal decided that the Chimer should learn how to use this power so that Nerevar might claim Resdayn and the world for their people. Nerevar did not expect or want this, so he asked his queen and generals to help him summon Azura yet again for her guidance. But the Tribunal had become as greedy as Kagrenac upon hearing of the power of the Heart and they coveted it. They made ritual as if to summon Azura as Nerevar wanted but Almalexia used poisoned candles and Sotha Sil used poisoned robes and Vivec used poisoned invocations. Nerevar was murdered.\nThen &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; came forth anyway and cursed the Tribunal for their foul deeds. She told them that she would use her powers over dusk and dawn to make sure Nerevar would come back and make things right again. But the Tribunal laughed at her and said that soon they would be gods themselves and that the Chimer people would forget their old ways of worship. And Azura knew this would be true and that it would take a long time before her power might bring Nerevar back. \"What you have done here today is foul beyond measure and you will grow to regret it, for the lives of gods are not what mortals think and matters that weigh only years to mortals weigh on gods forever.\" And so that they might know forever their wicked deeds Azura changed the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, and their skin turned ashen and their eyes into fire. \"Let this mark remind you of your true selves who, like ghouls, fed on the nobility, heroism, and trust of their king.\"\nAnd then the Tribunal went into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth-Ur. Dagoth-Ur saw what had been done, for his skin had changed as well, and he tried to avenge the death of Nerevar but to no avail. He was driven off and thought dead. The Tribunal found the tools he had been guarding and, through study of Kagrenac's methods, turned themselves into gods.\nThousands of years after their apotheosis, the Tribunal are still the gods of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; and the old ways of worship are remembered only by a few. And the murder of Nerevar is known to fewer. But his queen and generals still fear his return, for the words of Azura linger long and they see the mark of her curse on their people every day."}

Thus, knowledge of what the Tribunal had done and pre-Tribunal worship dwindled. Despite this, several &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; continued to believe in Nerevar's return despite opposition from the Temple.

The cult has not much influence with most Ashlander tribes. It is most strongly connected to &lt;a href=\"Urshilaku%20Tribe\"&gt;Urshilaku Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;. Their relations to other important factions in Morrowind are strained, the &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; being the only ones not disclaiming the cult's beliefs altogether. The cult plays an important part in the main questline of .\nBackground.\nThe Nerevarine Cult must be seen in the context of the Ashlander's ancestor cult practices: Before the department of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people into Ashlander and settled Dunmer, the ancestor cults were the traditional cults of the Dunmer's forefathers, the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt;. Now, these practices live only within the Ashlander customs.\nIn this context, the Nerevarine cult can be understood as an ancestor cult worshipping the great khan and warleader of the House People, Nerevar. Nerevar himself, although not born as an Ashlander, honored the ancestor cult practices and the traditions and laws of the tribes.\nThe events surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and its aftermath, leading to the disappearance of the Dwemer, the transformation of &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; into gods and that of the Chimer into Dunmer, can be seen as the historical background of the Nerevarine cult. Different traditions and interpretations of these events form the foundation both of the Temple and the Nerevarine cult beliefs. Most importantly, the Ashlander accuse the three gods of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of murdering Nerevar and ignoring Nerevar's promises to the Ashlanders.\nBeliefs.\nNerevarine cultists believe that the incarnated Nerevar, the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;, will return to honor ancient promises to the Ashlanders. The foundation of this belief can be seen in the written records about the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; cursing the &lt;a href=\"ALMSIVI\"&gt;ALMSIVI&lt;/a&gt; directly upon their transformation into gods, and also her foretelling the return of Nerevar through her own powers. The foretellings express themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20prophecies\"&gt;Nerevarine prophecies&lt;/a&gt;, that are passed on by the Ashlander tribes. The wording of &lt;a href=\"Sharn%20gra-Muzgob\"&gt;Sharn gra-Muzgob&lt;/a&gt; in her \"&lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20cult%20notes\"&gt;Nerevarine cult notes&lt;/a&gt;\" suggest that hese prophecies derive from dreams or vision of Ashlander &lt;a href=\"wise%20women\"&gt;wise women&lt;/a&gt;. The importance the cult lies on these prophecies and the interpretation of dreams by seers show that it can be considered as a mystical cult.\nIn the context of the Battle of Red Mountain, great general Nerevar convinced the Ashlander tribes to join the House people in the field, promising them to honor the ways of the Spirits and rights of the Land in return. According to the Ashlander's tradition, the Tribunal gods murdered Nerevar in the course of the events and neglected Nerevar's promises to the tribes. The Nerevarine cult believes that Nerevar will return and restore the glories of ancient &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt; and reestablish the traditions of the prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;. They believe that he will cast down the false gods of the Tribunal. He will also make good his promises to the tribes, honoring the Spirits and driving the outsiders from the land, all with the help of his magic ring, &lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpread of the Nerevarine cult.\nAs the Nerevarine cult is a secret cult, it is hard to judge how widespread it is among the Ashlander, or whether it may even have followers outside of the tribes.\nHowever, the return of the reincarnated Nerevar appeals to many Ashlanders. For them, it symbolizes a longed for and largely romanticized Golden Age of Nerevar's Peace, when the nomadic tribes enjoyed equality with the settled Dunmer, and before the Dunmer people had for the most part abandoned traditional &lt;a href=\"ancestor%20worship\"&gt;ancestor worship&lt;/a&gt; for the autocratic theocracy of the Tribunal Temple. But although this is true for most Ashlander people, the majority doesn't seem to believe in the Nerevarine prophecies and don't follow the Nerevarine cult. Thus, the cult is of small consequence in the Ashlander culture.\nThe cult has most influence with the Urshilaku tribe, a group residing in the forbidding regions of the northern &lt;a href=\"Ashlands\"&gt;Ashlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. Their &lt;a href=\"Ashkhan\"&gt;Ashkhan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sul-Matuul\"&gt;Sul-Matuul&lt;/a&gt; is the Warrior-Protector of the Nerevarine cult, while their wise woman &lt;a href=\"Nibani%20Maesa\"&gt;Nibani Maesa&lt;/a&gt; is their seer.\nRelation to other factions.\nEmpire.\nThe Ashlanders generally tend to have a hostile attitude towards all outlanders, which have come to Morrowind following the occupation by the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Nerevarine cult anticipates a time, in which the Nerevarine will drive all the outlanders, including the Empire, from the land. Thus, the cult sees the Empire and the &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt; as their foes and is hostile to both.\nThe Empire obviously can not accept the existence of a cult openly hostile to them. For this reason, they outlaw the cult, repress its practices, and threaten its members with death or imprisonment. The Empire also grants the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; a free hand when dealing with the Nerevarine cult.\nTribunal Temple.\nThe Ashlander in general and the members of the Nerevarine cult in particular have always seen the worship of living Dunmer as an abomination, thus suspecting the Temple of heresy and accusing the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; of being false gods. The &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine%20Prophecy\"&gt;Nerevarine prophecies&lt;/a&gt; even foretell the downfall of the Temple upon the return of the true Nerevarine, thus making clear that the Nerevarine cult is hostile to the Tribunal Temple.\nThis fact influences the Temple's attitude towards the Nerevarine cult: While generally rather intolerant, they are inclined to tolerate Ashlander ancestral cult practices. But the Nerevarine cult to them is not only a primitive superstition, but due to their hostile attitude towards the Temple a possible threat. As a consequence, they punish Nerevarine claimants with the approval of the Empire with death or imprisonment.\nDespite this negative relations, the Temple honors Saint Nerevar, not least as a companion of the three Almsivi gods, Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec. What they reject, apart from the hostile attitude towards the Temple, obviously, is the cult's mysticism and prophecies, which they consider primitive superstition, and the notion that the Incarnate Nerevar will walk the earth.\nDissident Priests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; are a group that have separated themselves from the Temple, criticizing many of their practices and dogmata. One point where their opinion differs from that of the Temple is the handling of the Nerevarine cult: They reject the persecution of the Nerevarine and the Nerevarine cult, and condemn this persecution as being unjust and politically motivated. This does not mean that the Dissident Priests follow the Nerevarine cult themselves or believe in the Nerevarine prophecies. In fact, there is no consensus within the group about the genuineness of the prophecy. But they acknowledge mysticism, revelation and prophecy as part of the religious experience, and many amongst them have started to study the Ashlander's ancestors cults, in particular the rites of the Ashlander seers and wise women, the Nerevarine prophecies and other prophecies recorded in Temple archives.\nDuring the events of , the support of the Dissident Priests for the notions of the Nerevarine Cult increases. As their leader, &lt;a href=\"Gilvas%20Barelo\"&gt;Gilvas Barelo&lt;/a&gt; states, the order's interest in the cult started as a matter of principle, a willingness to consider the validity of the mystical insights connected with it. However, while &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; gets stronger, they see the Incarnate Saint Nerevar as the best hope for salvation.\nSources.\nCharacters.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; has reached a specific point in the questline, many citizen and Ashlander on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; can give them some information about the Nerevarine cult. The following are characters with unique information about the cult:"}

The Tribunal dismissed this proclamation, saying that they were now more powerful and influential than the Daedric Princes, and that their time as gods to the people of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; had come to a close, even as Azura cursed the Chimer and changed them into the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. The realization of this proclamation was known as the Nerevarine Prophecy, and it came to pass at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to its fulfillment, the Nerevarine Prophecy was denounced as heresy by the Tribunal, and those groups that believed in them (Ashlanders, Dissident Priests, and some others) were heavily persecuted. Occasionally, a potential candidate would appear, and until recently, each one had met an untimely end through a variety of means and circumstances.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20Crisis\"&gt;Vvardenfell Crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the Nerevarine was rumored to have left Morrowind on an expedition to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt;. What became of the Nerevarine is unknown.\nThe Prophecy.\nAccording to the prophecy, \"A prisoner born on a certain day to uncertain parents\" would be sent, under guard, to Morrowind, would overcome numerous trials, and, eventually, unite the province and cast down the Tribunal as false gods. The gender and race of &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; was, and remains, unknown, though it is well known that they would not be a native of Morrowind. This was the most widely known part of the prophecy; the remaining parts are detailed in the work \"Seven Visions of Seven Trials of the Incarnate\".\nSeven trials: What he puts his hand to, that shall be done. What is left undone, that shall be done.\nOne Destiny: He speaks the law for Veloth's people. He speaks for their land, and names them great.\nThe first trial suggests that the Nerevarine would be an unknown person, born on a specific day.\nThe second trial speaks of a seemingly unique and great power of the incarnate, being immune to all disease and even aging (&lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt;, also known as the Curse-of-Flesh, does grant these traits, at the expense of the victims' sanity and appearance, to say the least).\nThe third trial is, at first glance, somewhat puzzling, but it is now known that the Nerevarine traveled to a hidden shrine known as the \"Cavern of the Incarnate,\" was acknowledged as Nerevar's reincarnation, and was blessed with his legendary ring, \"Moon-and-Star,\" or \"One-Clan-Under-Moon-And-Star,\" which, besides giving bonuses to Speechcraft and Personality, gave Nerevar unmistakable identity, as anyone besides him who tried to wear the ring would die instantly.\nThe fourth and fifth trials are quite similar, and detail the Nerevarine's duty and ability to unite all of Morrowind to their cause. The four civilized &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; tribes would all acknowledge him as 'Nerevarine' and the Three Great Houses of Morrowind (&lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"House%20Redoran%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;) would name him 'Hortator', a title given to a leader of the people of Morrowind during wartime/great emergencies. Both refer to the 'stranger', so the Nerevarine could not be born into either the Ashlander tribes or Great Houses, making him/her an outsider (foreigner, or, as the Nerevarine is commonly referred to as in-game, \"outlander\").\nThe sixth trial suggests that the Nerevarine would learn all that could be learned of the history of Nerevar and his time, and would pity and understand the plight of the 'tribe unmourned', which could either refer to &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt; (as suggested in a conversation in Morrowind) or the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, or possibly both. At the realization of the Nerevarine Prophecies, the Nerevarine defeats his old friend Dagoth Ur and \"destroys\" the Heart of Lorkhan that corrupted him and the Tribunal, ending the Blight and the Tribunal's false godhood. They, beside understanding and mourning them, would right the wrongs they had brought upon the world and thus release them from sin and honor their memory.\nThe seventh trial almost undeniably points to the disappearance of the Tribunal at the end of the Third Era, as the Nerevarine had severed their source of &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;divinity&lt;/a&gt;. After the fulfillment of the prophecy &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; (one of the members of the Tribunal) was murdered by &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; (another member of the Tribunal, and formerly the wife of Indoril Nerevar), who in turn was destroyed by the Nerevarine. The fate of &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, the final member of the Tribunal, remains unknown and possibilities run rampant. Some include:\nAt any rate, none of the Tribunal remain in the public's eye, and as such the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt; has been weakened considerably, and Morrowind has come under more direct supervision of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;."}

Both &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Temple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire outlaw&lt;/a&gt; the cult, but it persists among the Ashlanders, despite Imperial and Temple repression and continuous drawback of &lt;a href=\"Great%20Houses\"&gt;the Houses&lt;/a&gt;. Because it is persecuted, it remains a secret cult, and it is hard to judge how widespread it is among the Ashlanders, or whether it has any following outside the Ashlander tribes.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ashlanders firmly believe that Nerevar will return to restore the glories of ancient &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;. [Morrowind was called 'Resdayn' before the Imperial Occupation.] The Ashlanders say the Great Houses and the Temple have abandoned the pure teachings of the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Veloth\"&gt;Veloth&lt;/a&gt;, forsaking ancestor worship for the false gods of the Tribunal, and embracing the comforts of civilization that corrupted the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt;. The Temple, on the other hand, venerates Saint Nerevar, but rejects the disgusting notion that the False Incarnate will walk the earth like a ghoul.\nNerevar.\nThe Temple honors Saint Nerevar as the greatest &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; general, &lt;a href=\"First%20Council\"&gt;First Council&lt;/a&gt;or, and companion of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, who united the Dunmer Houses to destroy the evil &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt;, the treacherous &lt;a href=\"House%20Dagoth\"&gt;House Dagoth&lt;/a&gt;, and their Western allies at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. But the &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt; say Nerevar promised to honor the Ancient Spirits and the Tribal law, and that he will come again to honor that promise. To the Ashlanders, this means destroying the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;false Temple&lt;/a&gt; and driving the Imperial invaders from the land.\nNerevarine Prophecies.\nDream visions and prophecies are a respected tradition in Ashlander culture. Their wise women and shamans take careful note of dreams and visions, and pass on the tribe's legacies of vision and prophecy to their successors. By contrast, the Temple and the Western faiths are suspicious of &lt;a href=\"Mysticism%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;mysticism&lt;/a&gt;, and they regard interpretation of dreams and visions as primitive superstition.\nThe most common version of the Nerevarine Prophecy is THE STRANGER. The verses are obscure, as are most prophecies. But two observations are in order.\nFirst, many less-well-informed scholars assume that the phrase \"journeyed far 'neath moon and star\" is just a cliche to suggest a very long journey, but the Nerevar of legend was known to possess a magical ring named \"&lt;a href=\"Moon-and-Star\"&gt;One-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star&lt;/a&gt;,\" upon which Nerevar is supposed to have sworn his promise to honor ancient Ashlander traditions and land rights.\nSecond, the reference to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Curses\"&gt;seven curses&lt;/a&gt;\" must certainly refer to the lost prophetic verses known to the Ashlanders as the SEVEN CURSES.\nThe Stranger.\nWhen earth is sundered, and skies choked black,\nAnd &lt;a href=\"Dreamer\"&gt;sleepers&lt;/a&gt; serve the seven curses,\nTo the hearth there comes a &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;stranger&lt;/a&gt;,\nJourneyed far 'neath moon and star.\nThough stark-born to sire uncertain\nHis aspect marks his certain fate.\n&lt;a href=\"Ash%20Creatures\"&gt;Wicked&lt;/a&gt; stalk him, &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;righteous&lt;/a&gt; curse him.\nProphets speak, but all deny.\nMany trials make manifest\nThe stranger's fate, the curses' bane.\nMany touchstones try the stranger\nMany fall, but one remains.\nLost Prophecies.\nAshlander elders complain of prophecies which have been lost to tribal memory due to the carelessness or ineptitude of earlier generations of wise women and ashkhans. Suspicious scholars wonder whether these prophecies might have been deliberately forgotten or suppressed. Three Nerevarine prophecies in particular are said to have been lost: 1. The Lost Prophecies; 2. &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Curses\"&gt;The Seven Curses&lt;/a&gt;; and 3. &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven%20Visions\"&gt;Seven Visions&lt;/a&gt; of Seven Trials of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps these lost prophecies will someday be found, either in forgotten accounts written by literate travelers, or in the memories of isolated &lt;a href=\"Ashlanders%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ashlanders&lt;/a&gt;, or in the secret traditions of the wise women and shamans."}

He died at &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;, where his undead skeleton remains after a curse.\nHistory.\nHe was illegitimate, born to \"a poor &lt;a href=\"House%20Tamrith\"&gt;Tamrith&lt;/a&gt; cousin,\" and had to compete with his legitimate younger brother Prince &lt;a href=\"Phylgeon\"&gt;Phylgeon&lt;/a&gt; for their father Hurlburt's throne. The fourteen-year-old Phylgeon was descended from &lt;a href=\"House%20Montclair\"&gt;House Montclair&lt;/a&gt;, and his claim was supported by the codicil to the \"Bretonnick Natalitie,\" which declared \"Howse Mount Clayre\" the royal house of Shornhelm. However, the codicil was missing when the Council of the North met to discuss the two claimants. Prince Ranser presented a long-lost\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; decree that named House Branquette their \"Breton Royal Delegates\" in\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, winning the crown by the vote of the Council.\nHe had a daughter named Princess &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, whom &lt;a href=\"High%20King%C2%A0Emeric%20%28Online%29\"&gt;King Emeric&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0courted before marrying\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the spring of\u00a02E 566. Furious, he called back his ambassador from Wayrest, staying in &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt; when he was invited to Emeric's wedding. In &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; of the year, he launched a surprise siege on Wayrest, sparking what is now called\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0His army consisted of mercenaries and his own people,\u00a0along with the noble houses of &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; that he forced to fight under his banner. House Tamrith was the first to cease its support and called for peace, followed by &lt;a href=\"House%20Dorell\"&gt;House Dorell&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"House%20Ravenwatch\"&gt;House Ravenwatch&lt;/a&gt; remained neutral throughout the war. House Montclair only surrendered to Wayrest right before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Traitor%27s%20Tor\"&gt;Battle of Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0Unsure if his brother's actions were righteous, Count Phylgeon offered to serve as a peace envoy to both Emeric and Ranser, but the latter angrily refused,\u00a0insistent on winning the war.\u00a0Overcome by the combined forces of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Bretons\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt;, Ranser's remaining troops were slain at &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;, and the end of the conflict gave rise to the Greater\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0The Crown of Shornhelm as well as the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; decree has not been seen since the Battle of &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Traitor's Tor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Ranser himself is thought to be dead, \u00a0he fled from Markwasten Moor with a small troop of his most loyal soldiers. He prepared a ritual given to him by &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt; atop a then-nameless tor overlooking &lt;a href=\"Hoarfrost%20Downs\"&gt;Hoarfrost Downs&lt;/a&gt;, during which he was murdered by his own general, &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;Dathieu&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser's blood served as the sacrifice needed for the ritual, transforming him and his warriors into skeletal &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and the tor from which he ruled became known as Traitor's Tor.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Scholar%20Cantier\"&gt;Scholar Cantier&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; explored the ruins in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, General Dathieu took the Vestige into a vision of the past, showing what happened during the final hours of King Ranser's life. After the Vestige and Cantier collected Dathieu's bones, they reassembled his animated skeleton. Dathieu and Ranser's undead skeletons then fought, and Ranser was slain once again, lifting the curse.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Traitor%27s%20Tale\"&gt;A Traitor's Tale&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Dathieu sends the Vestige into the past, Ranser can be found on the upper floor of the central tower. Once Reezal-Jul's packets have been poured into the braziers, Ranser will order the Vestige to inform Dathieu and Taern that he plans on charging towards the Orcs and taking out their ranks. Dathieu will instead order to prevent Taern from leading the charge in order to prevent any needless deaths, and will head towards the north tower. Ranser is killed by Dathieu, but rises up as an undead skeleton and kills his general. With Ranser's sacrifice, his blood powers the curse that keeps his soldiers at the Tor restless.\nOnce Dathieu is reassembled, he will ask the Vestige to meet with him at the north tower, where he slew the king sixteen years ago. He will then charge at Ranser. Their skeletons will duel, with Dathieu attacking Ranser with his sword and Ranser using a combination of melee and magic to attack Dathieu. Once Ranser is defeated, the curse is lifted.\nDialogue.\n\"Get back to the fight, Lieutenant!

Emeric had been courting her, but in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, instead married Princess &lt;a href=\"Maraya\"&gt;Maraya&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinel. In response, Ranser recalled his ambassador from Wayrest's court. While Ranser was invited to the wedding, the King refused, as he had been gathering his armies for the war to come.\nThe Siege of Wayrest.\nFor over a year, King Ranser had been gathering his forces, launched a surprise attack on Wayrest in the &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, quickly advancing through &lt;a href=\"Menevia\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;, and advancing up to the very gates of Wayrest itself while the militias of Wayrest were still outside. Had the attacking Oldgate Lancers managed to break through the militia defending the gate, they could have taken the city within an hour. King Emeric was personally present at the gate, and charged with the Wayrest military and his household guard out to meet the Oldgate troops in battle. Now having to face fully-armored veterans, the fight began to turn in the favor of Wayrest, and when a thunderstorm shocked the horses of the lancers, the Oldgate soldiers eventually turned around and fled. By the time the main army of King Ranser arrived at the city, the gates had been fully shut, so King Ranser besieged the city. In contrast to &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; years earlier, King Ranser did bring siege equipment for the occassion. While Count Phylgeon Montclair had attempted to sue for peace between the two parties, Ranser furiously refused, and the Montclairs were forced to back his side.\nKing Emeric reached out to his allies in the Daggerfall Covenant and to the kingdom of his new Queen, Sentinel. He also reached out to the Orcs of Wrothgar, and offered them Orsinium in return for their aid. The forces of the Covenant, combined with the Redguards' aid, caused the army of King Ranser to withdraw from Stormhaven within weeks. When King Ranser returned to Shornhelm, he found the city already razed by the Orcs of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;. In response, King Ranser ordered his spymaster and head of security, &lt;a href=\"Gerard%20Althen\"&gt;Gerard Althen&lt;/a&gt;, to murder hundreds of Orcish citizens.\nThe Battle of Markwasten Moor.\nWhen almost a year had passed, and Ranser's army had been pushed back to Markwasten Moor, his army prepared to make a final stand, being caught between the Breton armada and Orcish troops. Just before the battle, the Montclair nobles who had supported King Ranser, surrenderd to Emeric's forces. During the battle, the bulk of King Ranser's army fell, but the King himself as well as some of his best soldiers and his King's Guard, fled to an &lt;a href=\"Traitor%27s%20Tor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unnamed tor&lt;/a&gt;. The defeat at Markwasten Moor was said by &lt;a href=\"General%20Dathieu\"&gt;General Dathieu&lt;/a&gt; to have changed Ranser, with the King being consumed by his rage for Emeric.\nThe end of the War at Traitor's Tor.\nComing closer to the end of the war, King Ranser had lost most of his forces and gone mad, believing that he would never retreat and would come out victorious with his forces, and win the war. Here, King Ranser started to work on his ultimate plan to defeat his opponents. Through an arcane ritual provided by &lt;a href=\"Reezal-Jul\"&gt;Reezal-Jul&lt;/a&gt;, the court magician, the King managed to transform himself and his most loyal and devoted soldiers into a skeleton army following the sacrifice of King Ranser himself by a general who turned traitor.\nIn order to accomplish this goal, four braziers had to be lit with a special bag. While at first nothing happened, the King refused to surrender, believing that the mere lighting of the braziers had been sufficient. General Dathieu considered this plan madness, and managed to use a Lieutenant to stop &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Taern\"&gt;Captain Taern&lt;/a&gt; of the King's Guard to advance on the Orcish ranks. Believing the King had truly gone mad, the General attempted to murder the King in order to make peace. After the slaying of the King, however, King Ranser rose again, and slew the General who had betrayed him. The rest of the forces at the tor were cursed with undeath until the curse was lifted with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath for Rivenspire.\nFollowing the conflict, a triumvirate of the three noble houses of the region was formed, consisting of House Dorell, Tamrith, and Montclair. The idea came from Baron Tamrith, who had emerged as a powerful force for peace and cooperation. The triumvirate would rule over Rivenspire in the High King's name, with each of the noble houses pledging their loyalty to the High king. King Emeric approved of the triumvirate, but also promised to select a new king of Shornhelm at the first opportunity. In reality, Emeric did not crown a King or Queen for years, as he mistrusted the nobility of the region.\nThis triumvirate would not last, however, as the ambitious &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Wylon%20Montclair\"&gt;Baron Wylon Montclair&lt;/a&gt; saw himself as the rightful heir to the throne of Shornhelm. He claimed that he was the legitimate heir to Shornhelm's throne, due to his grandfather being King Hurlburt of Shornhelm, and him being a descendend from him in the direct and legitimate line of succession, a claim only Baron Wylon could make. This connection also made him the sole living heir to the domain of the Branquettes, though this territory had already been split among noble houses Tamrith and Dorell. These tensions would continue to rise until they escalated following the death of the Baron, after which he took up arms to take control over the region."}

His first choice was Rayelle, daughter of King Ranser of &lt;a href=\"Shornhelm\"&gt;Shornhelm&lt;/a&gt;, but before the marriage contracts were wrought, Emeric instead married Maraya, Redguard princess of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. This stunned couriers across the land, and prompted bards to sing songs of Maraya's bewitching beauty. However, strategists saw the move as strengthening the trade between &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. After Emeric's wedding in &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;566&lt;/a&gt;, High Rock readied itself for a golden age of . Three moons later, it was bracing itself for a bloody &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt; was known as the backwater of High Rock. Ranser was one of these surly hillmen, a child of the north, known for his bitter temper and brutal rule. Emeric's slight was too much to bear. With an army of Northern Tamriel's surliest mercenaries and a host for his own people, he descended from the mountains to cut a bloody swath to the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Emeric was caught unprepared. It was only the spirited defense of his &lt;a href=\"Lion%20Guard\"&gt;Lion Guard&lt;/a&gt; that saved Wayrest from being razed. Rancer hoped for a swift victory. Instead, he was forced into a prompted siege.\nThe long siege dragged on into spring, when the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;--a mutual defense pact, sworn by all the Breton Kingdoms at the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20Invasion\"&gt;Reachmen Invasion&lt;/a&gt;--finally paid dividends, drawing &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt; into the fray. Some counseled letting Wayrest fall, but trade with the richest city in the regoin was too important to allow that. Attacked from the city and the surrounding countryside, Ranser's army stood firm; his mercenaries were well paind and prepared for bloodshed. But the crimson sails and battalions of elite &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; warriors fron across the bay turned the tide. Ranser's forces were routed, and Shornhelm was already ablaze when Ranser returned. This was the work of &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; under the blood-rule of &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaught between the Breton hammer and the Orcish anvil, Ranser's troops were utterly annihilated by the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Battle of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Markwasten%20Moor\"&gt;Markwasten Moor&lt;/a&gt;. Ranser hadn't counted on Emeric's canniness; the King of Wayrest had sent emissaries into the Wrothgar mountains with a pledge to return Orsinium to the Orcs if they attacked their hated enemy in Shornhelm. Rivenspire was despoiled, and some Orcs remembered how the Bretons of Shornhelm had led the assault that toppled Orsinium some 135 years before. These debts were repaid to Shornhelm in full. Ranser's War built the Daggerfall Covenant as it is today; &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt; are all indelibly marked by these events."}

When you reach a stream, head over to the other side to face the first boss of this dungeon, &lt;a href=\"Tazkad%20the%20Packmaster%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Tazkad the Packmaster&lt;/a&gt;. He has a pack of &lt;a href=\"Durzog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;durzogs&lt;/a&gt; with him; it is wisdom to kill those first so that you will not be overwhelmed while fighting the boss himself. Tazkad has no projectiles, so as long as you can keep your distance, this is not a difficult fight.\nOnce Tazkad is dead, proceed on through the caves. Do not free the dreugh caught in the cages; they will be hostile. Once you reach a room with a large pool of water in the center, it is time to face off against the Goblin war chief. You will have to face all the goblins here before &lt;a href=\"War%20Chief%20Ozozai\"&gt;War Chief Ozozai&lt;/a&gt; makes his entrance. Ozozai is a tough boss, and he has several area-of-effect (AoE) attacks. He also has various ways to try and immobilize you, so take care when fighting him.\nOnce Ozozai is dead, take his head and mount it on a spike on the rocks in the northwest of the room. This will signal to the goblins that you are their new leader. You can now safely pass by the goblins in the passage to the north, until you reach the border with dreugh territory. Lead the goblins into battle against the dreugh. After you and your goblin allies face off against several dreugh, you will reach the next boss, the &lt;a href=\"Broodbirther\"&gt;Broodbirther&lt;/a&gt;. It is very likely that your goblin allies will not survive this battle. The boss is powerful and has attacks that can pull you in, so keeping your distance will be hard against this one. The Broodbirther is an optional boss and can be ignored by continuing left.\nAfter you kill or pass the Broodbirther, head on and fight your way through more dreugh. Across the bridge to the south waits another boss but be sure to not get overwhelmed by the swarming mudcrabs that attack you the moment you cross the bridge. The boss &lt;a href=\"Clatterclaw\"&gt;Clatterclaw&lt;/a&gt; likes to summon hordes of these little guys, so make sure to have your AoE abilities at the ready. Goblin reinforcements will appear during the battle to help you out; it is quite possible for these guys to survive the whole battle. Either way, once the big crab is dead, head on across the bridge to the west to face off against the dreugh king.\nIt is possible to skip all of the bosses and enemies after Tazkad the Packmaster when entering the large cavern by jumping into the water and swimming towards were Kra'gh the Dreugh King. There are no enemies on the land above that are close enough to become hostile while swimming. To the right side of the bridge leading to Kra'gh are steep rocks that can be jumped up on to reach the top. This typically requires several jumps up, but it can be done consistently.\n&lt;a href=\"Kra%27gh%20the%20Dreugh%20King\"&gt;Kra'gh the Dreugh King&lt;/a&gt; will kill your goblin allies the moment the battle starts, and you will have to face him by yourself. He is the toughest opponent you have faced yet; during the battle, he will pull you in, throw you around, use AoE around himself and dig up swarming mudcrabs to harass you. Try to keep your distance when he uses his lightning AoE and kill the crabs the moment they appear. Once you have successfully killed the king, head to the southeast to the shrine entrance and speak with Vila Theran again. This will finish the quest."}

I'm sure &lt;a href=\"Proxy%20Queen%20Alwinarwe\"&gt;Proxy Queen Alwinarwe&lt;/a&gt; will appreciate having documentation concerning who we permitted to stay and who we sent away. I keep saying that Summerset is sacrosanct. Let &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt; deal with the other races.

The common folk believe that the kinlord, in the days before his cruelty and sadism became well-known, brokered a deal that reigned in \"dangerous mages\" and somehow put binders in place to keep the commonalty safe. This is simply not the case.\n&lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt;, student of &lt;a href=\"Iachesis\"&gt;Iachesis&lt;/a&gt;, did indeed flout prevailing thought when it came to magical experimentation in large cities. He drew together numerous students and artificers to the city of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time, he sought to prove the benefit of spellcasters working in close proximity. Not for a mighty ritual, but for study, experimentation, and a sense of camaraderie.\nThis simple premise so terrified the people of Firsthold that they turned to their ruler, Kinlord Rilis the XII. Now known by many less polite titles, Rilis was first and foremost a political animal. He saw in \"Galerion's Folly,\" as it was known at the time, a chance to play the mages and common folk off against each other.\nThe much-speculated-upon \"&lt;a href=\"Charter%20Conclave\"&gt;Charter Conclave&lt;/a&gt;\" brought together Rilis, Iachesis, Galerion, and other notables from across the Isles and the &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic Order&lt;/a&gt;. By common agreement, it is true, no records were kept of that meeting. But mark my words here, adept: Rilis allowed the meeting, allowed Galerion to do what he did, to further his own ends.\nIn retrospect, of course, the legacy of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; is the proud heritage of the new Mages Guild. We now boldly gather together under the Guild banner, and will no doubt do so for many centuries to come. Just let it be remembered: Rilis the Twelfth was a dangerous mer. Even at the time of the Conclave, he trafficked with dark powers and made pacts with &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe proud order we all now serve is here despite his best intentions. Not because of them."}

Kintyra's fate was less than kind, and she ended up executed in Glenpoint. The exact year she was abducted and killed is debated, but the people of Glenpoint, along with those of &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20Moors\"&gt;Glenumbra Moors&lt;/a&gt;, instigated an enormous manhunt for her killers in an event still remembered every 23rd of &lt;a href=\"Frostfall\"&gt;Frostfall&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Diamonds%20%28Holiday%29\"&gt;broken diamonds&lt;/a&gt;."}

Her brother Raynor and her plan to use their findings to get invited into either &lt;a href=\"Shad%20Astula\"&gt;Shad Astula&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWalkthrough.\nUpon completing &lt;a href=\"In%20Search%20of%20Kireth%20Vanos\"&gt;In Search of Kireth Vanos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kireth%20Vanos\"&gt;Kireth Vanos&lt;/a&gt; will tell the Vestige what she is researching in &lt;a href=\"Mzulft%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mzulft&lt;/a&gt;. She is looking for a &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; lore vault, but she needs a key to access it. She proposes that you keep the dwemer automatons busy while she digs for the key. \nHead into the Ice Tunnels to the east and start exploring the area. Kireth will occasionally stop to dig somewhere. The succesful digging spot will be in the northeastern room. Once you have the key, head to the dwemer vault, a bit to the south. There, you will see a structure with two crystals, which Kireth describes as a Dwemer memory device. You will also find an old research journal here. Read it, and you will discover that the Dwemer used certain orbs to store information when magically charged, and that whoever wrote the journal left one of those orbs in one of the sacks surrounding the vault. \nThe orb will be on the sack to the left of the table. Once you find it, &lt;a href=\"Raynor%20Vanos\"&gt;Raynor Vanos&lt;/a&gt; will appear, and he and his sister will discuss what they should use the orb for. There are two pieces of information they might take from here, but the orb can only hold one. Raynor wants to use the orb to carry information about soul gems and get accepted into the mages guild, whereas Kireth wants to take information about the locations of other Dwemer ruins. They will ask you to help them decide what they should do. You will then have to convince the one you did not side with that the other one was right. This will complete the quest. "}

The Nerevarine travels to the Druscashti Ruins to confront Kjeld, leading to his demise.\nServices.\nKjeld's services are available only to members of Clan Quarra.

He also favors &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Uthol\"&gt;Wrath of Uthol&lt;/a&gt;, which simultaneously damages his opponent's &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt; in addition to creating a &lt;a href=\"Weakness%20to%20Magicka%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;weakness to magicka&lt;/a&gt;.\nConversations.\nClan Quarra.\nThe following dialogue with Kjeld is available only to a vampire Nerevarine who is a member of Clan Quarra:\nVampires:\u00a0 \"We are the dark walkers, those who prey on the warm blooded. Our gifts are many, and weaknesses few. There are three major clans: Aundae, Berne, and Quarra. There are others in this world as well, living like cattle in tombs under the ground.\"\nAundae: \"Weak, pathetic creatures. They use their powerful magic as a crutch, never experiencing the joy the dark gift brings--the sheer physical power we are given.\"\nBerne: \"They are not unlike us in many ways. But, though gifted physically, they prefer the shadows, stalking their prey from the darkness. It is cowardly and weak, and they are not to be trusted.\"\nQuarra: \"Above all clans, we stand alone! We have few limitations to our power, so great is our gift. Our dark powers make us prefect predators, perfect warriors. Those who live in the sunlight fear our name.\"\nLimitations to our power: \"We are shunned by almost all who live in the sunlight. While some mages will tolerate us, all others consider us abominations. And the sunlight...do not walk in the sunlight. It will be your death.\"\nOur dark powers: \"As a Quarra, you are gifted above all. Your strength and fighting skills are unmatched by any. Throw away your armor and weapons, for so great is our skill, that they are unneeded.\""}

They can be detected by using a &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;detect life&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; or by equipping an item that has the ability to detect life, such as the &lt;a href=\"Gray%20Cowl%20of%20Nocturnal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Gray Cowl of Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, Will-o-the-Wisps are able to vanish and reappear at will, making them even harder to fight. Will-o-the-Wisps look similar to a cloud of shimmering dust, and are treated as ghosts in combat; only &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;silver weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;daedric weapons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted weapons&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Honorblade%20of%20Chorrol\"&gt;Honorblade of Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0hand-to-hand combat (provided that the fighter is at least a journeyman), and &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; can harm them.\nAttacks.\nWill-o-the-Wisps use touch-based absorption spells, making them hard to kill for low-level players, especially when fighting a group of them. The player will need to be able to deal large amounts of damage quickly before the Wisp heals itself. One good option for a low-level player without any of the listed special weapons, is to cast a fire spell directly onto the Will-o-the-Wisps.\u00a0A good enough strike should be enough to take one down.\u00a0A tactic to get around their invisibility is to use a water-walking spell or item to lure them onto the water. Once on top of the water, the ripples denoting the locations of the Will-o-the-Wisps should become visible.\nHabitats.\nWill-o-the-Wisps can be found in greater numbers at specific places in Cyrodiil (e.g., The &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Azura%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Shrine of Azura&lt;/a&gt;) or on specific quests (e.g., &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20at%20Harlun%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Mystery at Harlun's Watch&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Atronach.\nWill-o-the-Wisps can be used by players who chose &lt;a href=\"The%20Atronach\"&gt;The Atronach&lt;/a&gt; as their birthsign as a means of recharging magicka, as Will-o-the-Wisps only have a magical attack, which will be absorbed half the time."}

North of Wind Keep is the &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Falls\"&gt;Cumberland Falls&lt;/a&gt;, which flows into the Wind Keep Basin located north of the township. The largest building in Wind Keep is the &lt;a href=\"Wayside%20Inn\"&gt;Wayside Inn&lt;/a&gt;, where many travelers go to rest from in between Evermore and &lt;a href=\"Wayrest\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the town of Wind Keep was under the control of &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Ilise%20Manteau\"&gt;Countess Ilise Manteau&lt;/a&gt;, who after the death of her husband, had suitors coming from all corners of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, even from faraway &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Supernal%20Dreamers\"&gt;Supernal Dreamers&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group of &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt; worshippers has terrorized the denizens of Stormhaven from as far as &lt;a href=\"Alcaire\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt;.

A traveler known as the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; arrived into Wind Keep and was tasked to find out what happened to Lady Manteau.

The mirror was a gift from &lt;a href=\"Sirion%20Guerat\"&gt;Sirion Guerat&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Dreamers, who planned the assassination of Ilise.

Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;.

It is the capital of both the &lt;a href=\"Giant%27s%20Run\"&gt;Giant's Run&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; region of Skyrim. Windhelm is one of the oldest Tamrielic cities and is a shining example of how great the original Empire of Humans was in its prime.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nWindhelm is one of the larger cities of Skyrim and is located in a rather strategic location. Windhelm is situated on the &lt;a href=\"Yorgrim%20River\"&gt;Yorgrim Estuary&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. It is because of this, Windhelm serves a trading post and a gateway between the Sea transport and the mainland of Skyrim. Windhelm is built on the steep hills north of the Yorgrim River in Eastmarch, in a pocket area of the Winterhold Mountains, which shows just how amazing the Atmorans were in their architecture. To connect Windhelm, to the southern river edge, there is a large stone bridge that towers over the Yorgrim River. It is also the first line of defense in Windhelm. The Nords of Windhelm had utilized the frozen land around them for various purposes, ranging from a Nordic Tomb for the Windhelm Family with &lt;a href=\"Morvunskar\"&gt;Morvunskar&lt;/a&gt; and the various farms along the road towards the &lt;a href=\"Dunmeth%20Pass\"&gt;Dunmeth Pass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blacklight\"&gt;Blacklight&lt;/a&gt;. Windhelm is one of the oldest cities in Tamriel, and it is surprising to see it withstand the test of time, looking the same as it did several thousands of years ago. The Atmorans had also created caves and catacombs underneath Windhelm that is said to house the tomb of Ysgramor himself.\nWindhelm city itself is vast and easily coordinated. The central district of Windhelm is known as the Stone Quarter, which consists of southwestern Windhelm and the main street. The Stone Quarter houses the town square in front of &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28Windhelm%29\"&gt;Hall of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Talos\"&gt;Temple of Talos&lt;/a&gt;. Various shops are held in this area among other businesses. The town square is in between each separate part of the city and leads to the outside and the Great Bridge of Windhelm. The Gray Quarter, formally known as the Snow Quarter, has currently been used by the displaced Dark Elves from the province of Morrowind. The Gray Quarter takes up the eastern portion of Windhelm and is considered the slums of Windhelm. As you through the streets, you see all sorts of Dunmeri memorabilia. The &lt;a href=\"New%20Gnisis%20Cornerclub\"&gt;New Gnisis Cornerclub&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most well-known inns in the area.\nThe district known as Valunstrad, which translates to the Avenue of Valor, is essentially the nobles district of Windhelm. The Nordic Clans of Eastmarch have a home in the Valunstrad Quarter, and other estates inhabit the area like &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Clan%20Shatter-Shield\"&gt;House of Clan Shatter-Shield&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; is the seat of power in the city of Windhelm and is one of the most massive structures in the region. It was built as a Palace for Ysgramor himself. The Windhelm Docks are located along the Yorgrim River, just before the Sea of Ghosts. It is where the Argonian population lives in, all of them live in the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Assemblage\"&gt;Argonian Assemblage&lt;/a&gt;, one of the worst homes in Skyrim. Many different families are crammed into this large hall.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAtmoran Expansion into Skyrim; Founding of Windhelm.\nWith the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;Saarthal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; and his people had traveled back to &lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt; in an event known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Return\"&gt;the Return&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor amassed his &lt;a href=\"Five%20Hundred%20Companions\"&gt;Five Hundred Companions&lt;/a&gt; to purge the &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; of the land for betraying their trust in this new land. During their voyage back to Skyrim, the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;Storm of Separation&lt;/a&gt; had occurred and in the end, &lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Ysgramor had perished at the mighty hands of &lt;a href=\"Kyne\"&gt;Kyne&lt;/a&gt;. The Companion Yngol would be buried in a &lt;a href=\"Yngol%20Barrow\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; along the Yorgrim Estuary. After one of the last battles against Snow Elves, many of the Companion groups had separated, beginning to settle all across the province. Ysgramor, stricken with grief, looked south where the river met the sea and saw the site of a great city. Ysgramor declared that this city would be a monument to the glories of mankind and that his new palace would look over Yngol Barrow. He felt that his line would bring peace to the land, something that was denied to them on Atmora.\nThe Construction of Windhelm, the City of Kings.\nThe Elven captives would soon go to work for the construction of Windhelm. Many prisoners had died during the process, either through excessive work or by the hands of the Ylgermet crew. Ysgramor drove them to work harder by constructing the great bridge in between the city and the rest of Eastmarch. The &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of the Kings&lt;/a&gt; was built with large spires jutting out of the clouds, to show its dominance over the province. Deep underneath Windhelm, there is a large tomb designed to house the deceased Five Hundred Companions and Ysgramor should they be called to &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;. However, Ysgramor was buried in an &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;ancient tomb&lt;/a&gt; along the Sea of Ghosts, so that the crypt would look towards Atmora. Although his spirit has passed, the heart of his dynasty yearns for the still-green fields of Atmora, before it had frozen over. And so, the city-state of Windhelm was created, and it lives on, even before its creator.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First Empire of the Nords &amp; the Nordic Conquest.\nAs time went on, the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; had ruled out from the city-state of Windhelm. The 13th of the Ysgramor line, &lt;a href=\"Harald\"&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt; had accomplished many things for the people of Skyrim and made the province what it is to this day. Harald's forces had eliminated the last &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt; and had relinquished all holdings from Atmora, then making the centralized Kingdom of Skyrim, naming Windhelm as the capital of Skyrim. As Harald became the first king of the Nords, the Atmoran Companions returned to their homeland, and the Nordic Kingdom expanded themselves as a militaristic power. The Nords finally looked towards their destiny and sought to conquer the whole continent of Tamriel. Within a few years, the Nordic Empire had conquered land beyond the traditional borders of Skyrim, to modern-day &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, to the &lt;a href=\"Nibenay\"&gt;Nibenay&lt;/a&gt;, and to the Western Front of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on,\nhis youngest son, &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Gifted\"&gt;Vrage the Gifted&lt;/a&gt; had assumed the throne and established Windhelm as the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Nordic%20Empire\"&gt;First Empire of the Nords&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise and Fall of Jarl Elgryr the Unminded.\nSometime during the Second Era, the city-state of Windhelm was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Elgryr%20the%20Unminded\"&gt;Jarl Elgryr the Unminded&lt;/a&gt;, whose rule was despised throughout the land. While his people were freezing to death, the Palace of Ysgramor would be the place of hearth and revelry. Elgryr would give little to no attention to the denizens of Windhelm. The Court Wizard was mysterious and fear-inducing to the people, he would visit peoples homes at strange times, only to leave a bloody mess on the floor, murderous and demented. Windhelm's people were starving, growing insane with a lack of food. The people of Windhelm have demanded justice, taking arms and preparing the breach the gates of the Palace. The residents of Windhelm stormed the Palace of the Kings, it is unknown how the revolution had ended, but Elgryr's time as the Jarl would pass. The date of this is left unknown, but the letters detailing the events were recovered in the third era.\nThe Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim &amp; Queen Freydis.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Jagged%20Crown\"&gt;Jagged Crown&lt;/a&gt; was an ancient helm that was created by King Harald, as a symbol of sovereignty in Skyrim. It was however lost to time when &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. The Crown was replaced by the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Verity\"&gt;Crown of Verity&lt;/a&gt;, a mystical crown that chooses the heir to the throne of the High King. During the reign of &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Logrolf\"&gt;High King Logrolf&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim was assassinated, leaving the throne of the High King to his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Freydis\"&gt;Freydis&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm. But controversy would arise when &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Svartr\"&gt;Jarl Svartr&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Freydis was an illegitimate heir to the throne, even though the Crown of Verity had chosen Freydis. Instead of a civil war, a &lt;a href=\"moot\"&gt;moot&lt;/a&gt; was created where it ended in favor of Svartr. These contradictions caused a schism between the Nords of &lt;a href=\"West%20Skyrim\"&gt;West Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and the Nords of the Old Holds which resulted in the province separating into the independent Kingdoms of Western Skyrim and Eastern Skyrim. With the latter being ruled by High Queen Freydis. Her descendants would rule across the Kingdom for generations.\nThe Second Akaviri Invasion; Fall of Queen Mabjaarn.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20572\"&gt;2E 572&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Eastern Skyrim was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;, who resided in the city-state of Windhelm and had three children. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt; had commenced under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. It had begun with the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Windhelm\"&gt;Sack of Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; when the Akaviri army had besieged the southern gate for a brief second. After that, the city of Windhelm was razed by the invaders, resulting in the death of both Mabjaarn Flame-Hair and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Nurnhilde\"&gt;Princess Nurnhilde&lt;/a&gt;. One of the twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Strong-Prince\"&gt;Fildgor Strong-Prince&lt;/a&gt;, was present in the battle, showcasing his battle prowess alongside the &lt;a href=\"Stormfist%20Clan\"&gt;Stormfist Clan&lt;/a&gt;. The other twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Jorunn%20the%20Skald-Prince\"&gt;Jorunn the Skald-Prince&lt;/a&gt; had arrived into Windhelm, joining the fray with his companions, the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20of%20Bards\"&gt;Pack of Bards&lt;/a&gt;. A new leader was needed to rule over Eastern Skyrim and to force the Akaviri Army out of Tamriel. Fildgor stepped in and claimed the throne, expecting Jorunn to comply. However, the Skald-Prince refused to accept such a man of war onto the throne of Eastern Skyrim.\nThe Brothers' War; Enter Jorunn the Skald-King.\nFildgor Strong-Prince did not take Jorunn's defiance lightly, so he rallied the Stormfist Clan to prepare for an attack. Realizing that a Civil War was being conceived before him, Jorunn challenged Fildgor to a &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Nordic%20Duel\"&gt;Traditional Nordic Duel&lt;/a&gt;, whoever succeeded, would be crowned the High King of Eastern Skyrim. It was the most prolonged three-hour fight in history, being dubbed the Brothers' War. The duel was brutal, weapons clashed, and blood was drawn but in the end, the newly-proclaimed Jorunn the Skald-King had garnered victory by shattering Fildgor's weapon during the battle and demanding him to surrender. Fildgor was forced to surrender, and he was exiled from Eastern Skyrim, the Stormfist Clan were also chastened for supporting him. Fildgor would live out in the territories of the &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, cursing his brother's name. Now that Jorunn was the leader of Windhelm, he gathered his forces and traveled to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; alone, to seek aid from &lt;a href=\"the%20Greybeards\"&gt;the Greybeards&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle of Stonefalls &amp; the Ebonheart Pact.\nJorunn traveled to High Hrothgar with the intent to seek aid from the Greybeards. However, the religious group were pacifists and did not help the Nordic Army in their battle, although, Jorunn did not leave empty-handed. The Greybeards summoned &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, to aid Jorunn the Skald-King in his attack against the Akaviri. With everything in their grasp, Jorunn amassed a Nordic Army from the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Riften\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, one that was inspired by Wulfharth's presence and fueled by anger against the Akaviri. Dir-Kamal's forces had traversed onto &lt;a href=\"the%20Rift\"&gt;the Rift&lt;/a&gt;, besieging &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Greenwall\"&gt;Fort Greenwall&lt;/a&gt; along the way, after witnessing the Nords at Riften, Dir-Kamal bypassed the city, entering the &lt;a href=\"Stonefalls\"&gt;Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; Ashlands, assuming the Nords would not follow. This was a fatal mistake. Dir-Kamal's forces would be cornered at &lt;a href=\"Vivec%27s%20Antlers\"&gt;Vivec's Antlers&lt;/a&gt; by the Nords to the west, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; to the east, and the &lt;a href=\"Argonians\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; to the south. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Stonefalls\"&gt;Battle of Stonefalls&lt;/a&gt; would end with the utter devastation of the Akaviri Invaders and the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows Over Windhelm &amp; the Konunleikar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Windhelm celebrated the &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt;, an annual event celebrating the inauguration of Jorunn the Skald-King, ever since the Brothers' War. &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Mera%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Thane Mera Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; had hosted the Konunleikar, all the while protecting the city from any threat. Oddly enough, the Stormfist Clan had begun to appear throughout Windhelm, raising suspicion for Thane Mera and the Windhelm Guard. Mera Stormcloak had tasked the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, an Agent of the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt;, to uncover the reappearance of the Stormfists. Events during the Konunleikar have had various injuries and deaths, resulting in the search. It was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Leimaer%20the%20Raven\"&gt;Leimaer the Raven&lt;/a&gt;, an Agent of the Stormfist had planned an assassination attempt, by having members of the Clan win the events of the Konunleikar, to gain an audience with the Skald-King. The Vestige had uncovered caches that helped the Stormfist cheat in the games.\nEnter the Stormfist Brigade; Fildgor's vendetta.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Footrace%20of%20the%20Nine%20Holds\"&gt;Footrace of the Nine Holds&lt;/a&gt;, many competitors were severely injured, some of them were killed like &lt;a href=\"Hadring%20the%20Swift\"&gt;Hadring the Swift&lt;/a&gt;, who passed away from a leg-related injury. Thane Mera Stormcloak had ordered the Vestige to travel along the outskirts of Windhelm, to seek the Stormfist encampment, where they would learn about their plot during the Konunleikar. When it was revealed that the Stormfist were to assassinate Jorunn from within the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Hall of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, the Ebonheart Pact had intervened, seeking out Leimaer the Raven before she kills the High King. At the Hall of Trials, Jorunn and his entourage were ambushed by the Stormfist Clan, prompting a battle inside the Nordic Halls. Leimaer was defeated, but the struggle against the Stormfist would soon grow. Fildgor Orcthane had returned back to Eastmarch, to seek his revenge, by uncovering his eldest sister's corpse in the royal tombs of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Morvunskar\"&gt;Fort Morvunskar&lt;/a&gt;, so that he can enter to the Nordic afterlife known as &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt;, to claim his supposed birthright.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWindhelm during the Imperial Simulacrum.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city of Windhelm in their quest to recover the pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nUlfric's chronicles in Skyrim &amp; Jarl Hoag Stormcloak.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"4E%20176\"&gt;4E 176&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Windhelm was ruled by &lt;a href=\"Hoag%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Hoag Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, who was known as the Great Bear of Eastmarch. Hoag was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Clan\"&gt;Stormcloak Clan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most prominent Nordic Clans throughout Eastmarch and the Old Holds. His only son, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; had an impressive record ranging from being a veteran of the Great War to being a former student of &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; had captured the city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; under the name of &lt;a href=\"Madanach\"&gt;Madanach&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric Stormcloak and his militia of warriors had retaken Markarth. While the Legion was still fathered in Cyrodiil, Ulfric reclaimed the city without Imperial assistance. Ulfric demanded that the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt; would be permitted in Markarth as they were promised, despite the laws set forth by the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;. This was, however, put under the rug when the Imperial Legion and Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hrolfdir\"&gt;Hrolfdir&lt;/a&gt; of Markarth were forced to imprison Ulfric and continue the ban over the worship of Talos, by order of the Thalmor. While Ulfric was in prison, Hoag Stormcloak of Windhelm had perished, leaving Ulfric to inherit the throne of Windhelm. The Empire's failure to honor the agreement was one of the catalysts for Ulfric, for an impending conflict, believing that the Empire had abandoned the people of Skyrim. At Jarl Hoag Stormcloak's funeral, Ulfric was forced to deliver his eulogy via a smuggled letter from prison. After Ulfric's release, he inherited the throne of Windhelm.\nThe Death of Torygg &amp; the Skyrim Civil War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim at the time was &lt;a href=\"Istlod\"&gt;Istlod&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled from the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, located on the other side of the province, he passed away from old age, and new ruler needed to take his place. And so, a moot was held in Skyrim, which ultimately led to his son, &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; to assume the throne as the High King. Jarl Ulfric of Windhelm was present at the moot, where he would make calls for independence, just shy of treason, which Torygg respected. Ulfric viewed Torygg as a symbol of the Empire, a symbol of the betrayal he felt after the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Ulfric traveled to Solitude and sought an audience with the High King himself. In the aftermath of their meeting, Ulfric had slain Torygg in a &lt;a href=\"Traditional%20Nordic%20Duel\"&gt;Traditional Nordic Duel&lt;/a&gt; and fled back to Windhelm. Several moments later, the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; had commenced, Ulfric amassed the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak Army&lt;/a&gt;. As time went on, Jarl Ulfric would be captured at &lt;a href=\"Darkwater%20Crossing\"&gt;Darkwater Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced to death at &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt;, until the event was intervened by a large &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, causing the Civil War to continue.\nRacial Strife in Windhelm; Dunmeri Discrimination.\nDuring his reign as the Jarl of Windhelm, Ulfric Stormcloak gave more compassion to his fellow Nords in Windhelm, rather than the Dark Elves or the Argonians in Windhelm. In the aftermath of both the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Accession%20War\"&gt;Accession War&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmeri-folk traveled to the west, residing throughout the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Holds\"&gt;Old Holds&lt;/a&gt; and other border regions. Windhelm became a prime target for the Dark Elven Migration. Many of the immigrants took refuge in the Snow Quarter of Windhelm, a place that is now considered the slums of Windhelm. Because of this, the Snow Quarter was delicately called the Gray Quarter, for the gray skin elves that inhabit the district. When Ulfric became Jarl, all Dunmer of Windhelm had to live in the Gray Quarter. The Argonians were forced to live in poverty at the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Assemblage\"&gt;Argonian Assemblage&lt;/a&gt; but were more respected by the Nords, serving as dockmasters under the employment of the &lt;a href=\"Shatter-Shield%20Clan\"&gt;Shatter-Shield Clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cruel-Sea%20Clan\"&gt;Cruel-Sea Clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Elves were treated poorly by the Nords, constantly being bullied and looked down on by the Nords of Windhelm. With the Civil War commenced, many Nords would accuse the Dark Elves of being supporters of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood on the Ice; Murder Strings in Windhelm.\nDuring the Skyrim Civil War in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, the city-state of Windhelm has experienced several murders that prompted a search by the Windhelm Guard. &lt;a href=\"Jorleif\"&gt;Jorleif&lt;/a&gt;, the Housecarl of Jarl Ulfric was in charge of the search, hiring anyone to uncover the murderer, including an &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;estranged warrior&lt;/a&gt; from parts unknown. When the warrior arrived in town, the last person to be murdered was &lt;a href=\"Susanna%20the%20Wicked\"&gt;Susanna the Wicked&lt;/a&gt;, a barmaid from the &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;Candlehearth Hall&lt;/a&gt;, her body was found outside of the Hall of the Dead in Windhelm. Whoever killed Susanna, left a blood trail to &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;, an estate in Valunstrad. Investigating Hjerim, the warrior discovered a hidden room filled with bloody bones and the &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Necromancer's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact from &lt;a href=\"Mannimarco\"&gt;Mannimarco&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms. With the help of two other citizens, &lt;a href=\"Viola%20Giordano\"&gt;Viola Giordano&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calixto%20Corrium\"&gt;Calixto Corrium&lt;/a&gt;, the Windhelm Court Wizard, &lt;a href=\"Wuunferth%20the%20Unliving\"&gt;Wuunferth the Unliving&lt;/a&gt; was arrested, accused of the killings. Things would take a turn for the worst when another murder happened, while Wuunferth was imprisoned. This prompted another search between the traveler and Viola Giordano, in the end, it was revealed that Calixto Corrium was the murderer. The raw bones in Hjerim were collected for a necromantic ritual, to revive the long-dead body of Calixto's sister. Calixto Corrium was killed by the warrior."}

It reveals King Jorunn's brother, &lt;a href=\"Fildgor%20Orcthane\"&gt;Fildgor&lt;/a&gt;, is the one who ordered the assassination of Hadring as part of his plan to assassinate his brother. Upon returning to Mera and presenting her with the evidence, she will say the following.\n\"The guards found more caches of weapons hidden around the city, but nothing else. I hope you had better luck.\"\nUpon which the quest will be completed."}

While Windhelm is not &lt;a href=\"Saarthal\"&gt;the oldest city in Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, it is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement of men, and is possibly the oldest inhabited settlement in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; altogether.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; arrives at Windhelm during the annual festivities of the &lt;a href=\"Konunleikar\"&gt;Konunleikar&lt;/a&gt;, where the whole kingdom celebrates the 10th year of Jorunn's reign and where clans from all the holds and visiting dignitaries engage in revelry, festivities and contests. The Pact also holds a council with all its members convening for the future of the Pact.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fighters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;s have chapters in the city.\nHistory.\nDuring\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Return\"&gt;The Return&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the late\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Yngol\"&gt;Yngol&lt;/a&gt;, the son of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic warrior &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt;,\u00a0was separated from the rest of the fleet in a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Storm%20of%20Separation\"&gt;terrible storm&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor eventually found the shipwreck of Yngol's longboat, the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Harakk\"&gt;Harakk&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered that his son and his crew had been slain by the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Sea-Ghost\"&gt;Sea-Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nYsgramor, in grief, decided to build a great city where the nearby river met the sea. It was built as a monument to mankind. The city was built in\u00a0traditional &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; fashion and was constructed by\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; prisoners.\u00a0Ysgramor ordered for a great bridge to be constructed. Forever striding the &lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;river&lt;/a&gt; so that no elf might sneak through to avenge his brethren. As the bridge was built long, so too was the palace built high, spires reaching the sky to show domination even over the very winds.\nOnce Ysgramor and his men had settled in this new land, the reign of the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0began, and Windhelm served as the capital city of the\u00a0First Nordic Empire. It is said that a huge tomb was prepared for Ysgramor in the deep hallows beneath the city. However, Ysgramor chose to be buried at sea, facing his homeland,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Atmora\"&gt;Atmora&lt;/a&gt;. Ysgramor's burial place is known simply as\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ysgramor's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1E 369, Windhelm was sacked in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;. Over 3000 years later in 2E 572, it was sacked once again by the &lt;a href=\"Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt; and his forces in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Akaviri%20Invasion\"&gt;Second Akaviri Invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nToday, Windhelm is a bustling center for commerce and war activity. While most of the town's buildings have been restored since the Akaviri invasion, King Jorunn requested that the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20of%20the%20Kings\"&gt;Palace of Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; be repaired last.\nIt is home to &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Mera%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Thane Mera Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;'s ancestor and daughter of the city's former captain of the guard. The Stormcloaks are said to have helped establish Windhelm in ages past along with Ysgramor.\nGeography.\nThe city sits on the northern bank of the great\u00a0&lt;a href=\"White%20River\"&gt;White River&lt;/a&gt; which flows out into the frigid &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. It also has a port, accessible via a gate in the southeastern part of the city. Windhelm is located near the northern border of the hold, near\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Region%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;The Pale&lt;/a&gt;. It is also close to the border with\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, but there are no roads leading into the ash-cloaked province from &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe city has very cold weather, being in the frigid, snowy tundra of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, however travelers heading toward\u00a0&lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Online%29\"&gt;The Rift&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0or\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt; will see the landscape turn green and lush almost immediately south of the city limits. Travelers to the city are greeted by the ice-covered bridge leading to the main gate, but it is the ancient, majestic Palace of Ysgramor, towering over all other structures in the city, that is truly breathtaking. The palace is considered to be one of the oldest human-constructed buildings still standing in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the only First Empire structures remaining.\nThe city slopes slightly northward and has different levels of elevation, with the Palace located at the city\u2019s highest point, making it even more visible and striking. The streets have high, thick walls around them, giving the city something of a claustrophobic feel; the sky is almost always white or overcast, and fierce blizzards batter the city with alarming regularity. It is within these snow-strewn streets and icy alleys that Windhelm's hardy inhabitants live.\nNotable items.\nQuest-related:"}

It serves as the capital of &lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Eastmarch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hold\"&gt;Hold&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the oldest city in Skyrim, possibly the oldest city of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;man&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; that is still standing, dating back to the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSegregation.\nAfter the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; fled to Windhelm and settled in an area known as the \"Snow Quarter.\" The area has since been renamed the \"Gray Quarter,\" as all of the Dunmer have congregated in this area. Reasons as to why vary depending on who is spoken to within the city. Some say that the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; of Windhelm sequestered the Dunmer from the other citizens in this \"Gray Quarter\" in reference to the Dunmer skin color.\n&lt;a href=\"Argonians%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt; are also segregated from the Nord population and are forced to live at the &lt;a href=\"Argonian%20Assemblage\"&gt;Argonian Assemblage&lt;/a&gt; at the city docks. A decree by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; forbidding the Argonians from living within the city's walls also exists. If the Imperial Legion takes over Windhelm, &lt;a href=\"Brunwulf%20Free-Winter\"&gt;Brunwulf Free-Winter&lt;/a&gt; becomes Jarl, as a supporter of both the Dunmer and Argonians, he believes that the Argonians should remain outside of the city for their own safety, \"because most of the folk in the city believe as Ulfric did, that outsiders should not be trusted.\" As a result of the treatment they face at the hands of the Nords, the Argonians point out how their lives are difficult, and how the Nords do not appreciate them. Other Argonians are also warned about the living conditions in the city for Argonians, being warned that they should not want to live in Windhelm.\nDialogue with Ulfric Stormcloak, Windhelm's current Jarl, reveals that he does not attend to the issues occurring in the Gray Quarter due to being too busy with the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloak%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; seldom patrol the Gray Quarter and their reasons vary, depending on the characters spoken to within the city.\nDespite the claims of Ulfric's racism towards anyone who is not Nord, &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; seem to manage living in the city much better than the Dark Elves, despite the fact that the High Elves are the head of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Niranye\"&gt;Niranye&lt;/a&gt;, an Altmer citizen of Windhelm, implies that it is because the Dark Elves refuse to conform, rather than because of Nordic racism. She manages to attain a moderate amount of wealth and owns a stall in the market. Likewise, the Dunmer &lt;a href=\"Belyn%20Hlaalu\"&gt;Belyn Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; is allowed to own a successful farm on the outskirts of the city where he employs an elderly Nord woman, and likewise shares the view that his kin need to stop complaining and work harder to make a home for themselves, though he also acknowledges that the Dunmer are mistreated. However, despite all of this, Belyn still has to live in the Gray Quarter.\nDuring the Skyrim Civil War, many Windhelm locals believe that they have been too lenient with the non-Nord population. The Dunmer are said to contribute to the city's high crime rate, and are allowed to remain neutral in the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt;, some think that the immigrants are more of a burden to Nord society than a benefit and that Ulfric should start imposing heavier taxes on them as compensation. It is suggested through dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Viola%20Giordano\"&gt;Viola Giordano&lt;/a&gt; that the Dunmer's taxes can be raised at the Jarl's whim.\nCivil War.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; rages on, Skyrim becomes a nation divided, and Windhelm becomes the new capital of the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloak Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the main center of the entire Nord revolution against the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Windhelm is governed by Jarl &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Stormcloaks. Ulfric was chosen by the public as the new Jarl of Windhelm after his &lt;a href=\"The%20Bear%20of%20Eastmarch\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;, the previous Jarl, died. At least three of Skyrim's other eight holds pledged loyalty to Ulfric and his Stormcloak Rebellion during this time: the &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;Pale&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, along with their Jarls, &lt;a href=\"Skald%20the%20Elder\"&gt;Skald the Elder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korir\"&gt;Korir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Laila%20Law-Giver\"&gt;Laila Law-Giver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;Whiterun Hold&lt;/a&gt; remains neutral ground as &lt;a href=\"Balgruuf%20the%20Greater\"&gt;Balgruuf the Greater&lt;/a&gt; refuses to take a side in the conflict, while the &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Reach&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20Hold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;, remain loyal to the Empire alongside &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; Hold and the provincial capital, &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt;'s widow, &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt;.\nUlfric believes that Skyrim should secede from what he believes is a corrupt and crumbling Empire. This stance came about due to the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; and the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; by the Aldmeri Dominion, though it was not until the &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20Incident\"&gt;Markarth Incident&lt;/a&gt; that Ulfric's rebellion truly started.\nInteractions.\nJoining the Empire during the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Main Quest&lt;/a&gt; will set Windhelm as the location of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Windhelm\"&gt;last battle&lt;/a&gt; of the Civil War.\nQuarters.\nWindhelm is composed of three quarters:\nStone Quarter.\nThe Stone Quarter is Windhelm\u2019s central district; the one visitors first enter when passing through the Main Gate into the city. It contains the &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20Marketplace\"&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;, the most important shops, and the city's &lt;a href=\"Candlehearth%20Hall\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gray%20Quarter\"&gt;Gray Quarter&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gray Quarter was so named because of the large number of Dunmer that reside here. It was once named the \u201cSnow Quarter,\u201d but that was a long time ago. But, to the elves, the name \u201cGray Quarter\u201d is one of derision, cruelty, and discrimination. They believe the Nord people of Windhelm have always seen them as outsiders and hated them because of it.\nValunstrad.\nTranslated from ancient Nordic, \"Valunstrad\" means \"Avenue of Valor.\" It is the oldest section of Windhelm and has the largest buildings in the entire city, including the ancient and majestic Palace of the Kings and the only purchasable property in the city, &lt;a href=\"Hjerim\"&gt;Hjerim&lt;/a&gt;.\nPurchasable property.\nAfter completing \"&lt;a href=\"Rescue%20from%20Fort%20Neugrad\"&gt;Rescue from Fort Neugrad&lt;/a&gt;\" for the Stormcloaks, or the full Civil War &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Skyrim%29%23Civil%20War\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt; for the Empire, the house in Windhelm, Hjerim, can be purchased from the Jarl's steward for 12,000 .

Follow the stairs that lead to the bow (the front of the ship). Here a long wooden beam protruding from the bow (Bowsprit) is located. Carefully walk up the beam to the top where Windshear will be visible, wedged into the wood.\nEnchantment.\nThe enchantment of Windshear is described as, \"Bash attacks made with this weapon have a chance of knocking enemies down.\" In combat, this translates to block-bashing having a 39% chance to &lt;a href=\"Paralyze%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;paralyze&lt;/a&gt; an enemy for 0.1 seconds. The brief paralysis results in the target entering rag doll mode, and it takes several seconds for them to get back up. Block-bashing is only possible when the off-hand is unarmed.\nAdditionally, Windshear inflicts a powerful stagger effect when used regularly in combat. This effect is more powerful than the aforementioned enchantment; rather than chance, every attack staggers any enemy 100% of the time, unless they possess &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Tower of Strength&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Reflect Blows&lt;/a&gt; from the heavy armor skill tree. The first reduces stagger by 50%, making the effect weaker, the latter can reflect the stagger effect back onto the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmithing.\nWindshear can be upgraded with a &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;steel ingot&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt;, and also benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Steel%20Smithing\"&gt;Steel Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk, which doubles the improvement."}
