The stories both fascinated and frightened me. Here was a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; who had gained power and notoriety, whose very name was whispered with fear and a healthy dose of respect. I admit it. I had been pondering the risks and benefits of life as vampire even since I was a child. Now, with each tale I heard, every rumor I digested, I realized the goal that was set before me.\nI had to find Zalar-do and convince her to turn me into a vampire.\nWhy do I want to be a vampire? That's a good question. I've certainly asked myself that very same thing on more than one occasion since this obsession grabbed hold of me. I suppose it has something to do with the allure of power and the correlation between vampirism and sex that some scholars go on and on about (yes, I've read every book and letter I could find pertaining to the subject). But if I can be totally honest - and since this is my private journal, I suppose I have to be - the real appeal has to do with the longevity of the species. I've read that ancients can survive hundreds, even thousands of years. As a child who saw both of his parents die much too young, this \"immortality\" has become a very attractive to me.\nI'm not extremely keen on the idea of drinking blood, however, but I suppose every advantage comes with its own set of disadvantages. Such is the way of the world. I might be squeamish at fist, thought I expect with time and practice I could even grow to enjoy a daily feast of the crimson liquid. I wonder if it needs to come from an intelligent creature? Or if it has to be fresh? I guess that's what the protruding fangs are for.\nBefore I could locate Zalar-do's lair or otherwise introduce myself to the vampire lord, the hunter appeared in town. He asked about disappearances and mysterious deaths, and he even mentioned Zalar-do by name while I eavesdropped on his conversation with one of the town guards. He was going to ruin my chance to meet and offer myself as an apprentice to the vampire lord. I followed the hunter around, watching how he searched for traces of Zalar-do's passing and tracked her to her lair. It was empty, of course. She was much too smart to be caught by the likes of Mel Andrys.\nI spent the next few months staying as close to the vampire hunter as I could without revealing my presence. I figured that he'd have a better chance of locating Zalar-do than I would, and once we got close to the vampire lord I was sure I'd be able to figure out how to help her avoid Mel Andrys and convince her to reward me with the power of the vampire. It was this dream that kept me moving, following the hunter from &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Greenshade\"&gt;Greenshade&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;, until we eventually made out way to the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nHere, luck was with me. The vampire hunter was indisposed after we docked in &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. The rough storm our ship traveled through seems to have made the poor man ill. That gave me time to search for Zalar-do and get a few steps ahead of Mel Andrys. I believe that she has established her lair in &lt;a href=\"Hrota%20Cave%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hrota Cave&lt;/a&gt; - the perfect location from which to stalk prey in Anvil when the hunger comes upon her. I've made my way to the cave and plan to present myself to the vampire lord forthwith. I can't wait to become one of her apprentices."}

Because of this, casters of all types make use of the school of Conjuration. Dedicated casters, players who enjoy having creatures to draw enemy fire, and heavy fighters who employ the freedom of movement that conjured armor provides, all benefit from Conjuration. &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;Mages&lt;/a&gt; specializing in Conjuration are referred to as &lt;a href=\"Conjurer\"&gt;Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nConjuration connects the caster's mind with that of the summoned thing. It is a tenuous link, meant only to lure, hold, and dismiss; but in the hands of a Master, it can be much stronger. The &lt;a href=\"Psijics\"&gt;Psijics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; can (in the Dwemer's case, could) connect with the minds of others, and converse miles apart - a skill that is sometimes called telepathy.\nConjuration spells are composed of two essential effects; a summoning incantation and a binding rune. These two effects can be cast as two individual spells but doing so puts the caster in danger as summoned entities, especially inteligent &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, resent being summoned and may pose a threat to the caster before being bound. &lt;a href=\"Corvus%20Direnni\"&gt;Corvus Direnni&lt;/a&gt; heavily contributed to the advancement of the school by discovering how to interweave the summoning incantation and the binding rune into a spell that will inflict both effects simultaneously, thus reducing the risks a conjurer might face. However, despite Corvus' innovations, the art remained a somewhat dangerous practice, especially for those who are not knowledgeable about the art. For instance, willingly accepting a gift from the summoned being will break the binding effect and allow it to turn on its summoner, however, trading items for currency or taking back items that were given to the summoned being will not allow this to happen.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, a sub-specialization of Conjuration, focuses exclusively on &lt;a href=\"Resurrection\"&gt;reanimating the corpses&lt;/a&gt; of the dead humans and animals. The practice is generally considered unethical by the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;, although the practice was only officially made illegal when &lt;a href=\"Hannibal%20Traven%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Hannibal Traven&lt;/a&gt; became &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage\"&gt;Arch-Mage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the practice of conjuration can be used to summon &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Daedra\"&gt;Lesser Daedra&lt;/a&gt; as well as the spirits of the deceased, minor Aedric spirits were never successfully contacted."}

If they attack an innocent, the &lt;a href=\"Crime%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;crime&lt;/a&gt; reflects back on the summoner, potentially forcing them to pay fines or do jail time.\nRace and class.\nTypically, the skill belongs to mage-based classes such as &lt;a href=\"Witchhunter\"&gt;Witchhunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;pure mage&lt;/a&gt;. Because these mage classes (with the exception of Sorcerer, which does have &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;) rely upon &lt;a href=\"Alteration%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shield%20%28Oblivion%20Spell%29\"&gt;shield spell&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Light Armor&lt;/a&gt; to deflect physical blows, conjuration allows the summoning of &lt;a href=\"Creatures%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;creatures&lt;/a&gt; which can distract foes from attacking the mage, while dealing small amounts of additional damage. &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; do not &lt;a href=\"Races%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;racially&lt;/a&gt; gain a bonus to &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; magic, meaning their fire, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;shock spells&lt;/a&gt; noticeably weaker than those of &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; mages; their boosts to Conjuration help compensate that weakness.\nBound items.\nLacking &lt;a href=\"Endurance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Endurance&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension, &lt;a href=\"Encumbrance%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;carrying capacity&lt;/a&gt;, mages generally do not carry heavy weapons and armor. &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Weapons and armor summoned by Conjuration magic&lt;/a&gt; weight nothing, doing damage and protecting equal to &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20weapons\"&gt;Dremora weapons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;. One downside is that the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Warhammer%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedric warhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;weapon of that set&lt;/a&gt; damage-wise, cannot be conjured.\nThrough &lt;a href=\"Bugs%20%28Oblivion%29%23Permanent%20bound%20items\"&gt;an exploit&lt;/a&gt;, bound items can be kept permanently.\nDremora Lord.\nThe spell Summon &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Lord%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Dremora Lord&lt;/a&gt; cannot be learned after the quest \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Plot%20Revealed\"&gt;A Plot Revealed&lt;/a&gt;\" starts, as &lt;a href=\"Volanaro%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Volanaro&lt;/a&gt;, the only &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Merchants%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;seller&lt;/a&gt; of the spell, is dead once the &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Bruma Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; is entered.\nLeveling.\nThe Conjuration skill levels each time a Conjuration spell is successfully cast. Because simple and low-level spells like &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Skeleton\"&gt;Summon Skeleton&lt;/a&gt; cost less &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;, casting them repeatedly can help raise the skill. Summoning constructions, then summoning &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bound Weapons&lt;/a&gt; to attack them is an effective way to level the skill. Mounting a horse dispels conjurations; after dismounting they can be cast again.\nBooks.\nThe following books raise the Conjuration skill once, the first time they are read.\nLeveling text.\nApprentice.\n\"Through steady practice you have discovered more creatures to summon from the planes of Oblivion.

This is a quest that can be initiated once the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; reaches &lt;a href=\"Conjuration%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Character%20Level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt; 90, which presents the ability to summon even more powerful creatures.\nBackground.\n\"Phinis Gestor has told me that in order to inscribe powerful Conjuration spells, he'll need a sigil stone from an Oblivion gate. To get one, I'll need to summon an Unbound Dremora and bend it to my will.\"\nWalkthrough.\nOnce level 90 Conjuration is reached, the Dragonborn may ask &lt;a href=\"Phinis%20Gestor\"&gt;Phinis Gestor&lt;/a&gt; if there is anything else they can learn about Conjuration magic. Gestor says he requires a &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sigil stone&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt; to develop more powerful spells that the Dragonborn can learn by summoning an &lt;a href=\"unbound%20Dremora\"&gt;unbound Dremora&lt;/a&gt;:\nWhat else can be learned about Conjuration magic? \"How quickly you've advanced. Most impressive. There are spells yet to be learned, powerful spells that can more closely and more permanently bind creatures to your will. But there are risks. There are always risks. You must summon and command an unbound Dremora. Summoning an Unbound Dremora is not like other Conjuration spells. It will not simply do your bidding. You must first prove you are in control. Here is the spell you need. Go to the top of the Hall of Attainment; I have prepared a place for you there.\"\nHe then teaches the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Unbound%20Dremora\"&gt;Summon Unbound Dremora&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt;. He tells the Dragonborn to climb up to the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Attainment\"&gt;Hall of Attainment&lt;/a&gt;, use the spell, then defeat the summoned unbound Dremora.\nBattle.\nAlthough many tactics for destroying the dremora are available, &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; are vulnerable to &lt;a href=\"Shock%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;shock damage&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, entering the battle with &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lightning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons imbued with electricity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;Dragon Shouts&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Call\"&gt;Storm Call&lt;/a&gt; will optimize damage output, and as such the battle will take less time. Once summoned, the unbound dremora attacks the Dragonborn, regardless of the dialogue choice.\nHaving a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; present helps, as the dremora prefers close combat. The follower can serve as a decoy while the Dragonborn casts spells or shoots &lt;a href=\"Arrows%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;arrows&lt;/a&gt; from afar. Casting &lt;a href=\"Banish%20Daedra%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Expel%20Daedra\"&gt;Expel Daedra&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly drains the dremora's &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; but does not destroy it immediately as it would with lesser Daedra. Having the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Binding\"&gt;Oblivion Binding&lt;/a&gt; perk and using bound weapons on the dremora does not banish it as it would any other Dremora or &lt;a href=\"Atronach\"&gt;Atronach&lt;/a&gt;. Without a follower, a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Atronach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Flame Atronach&lt;/a&gt; or other conjured beings can serve as shields or distractions while the Dragonborn unleashes lethal Destruction spells, and a powerful enough summon such as another &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Lord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora Lord&lt;/a&gt; could defeat it with relative ease. Also, &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; may be used to throw it off the tower which will finish it off instantly.\nThe dremora will need to be defeated twice before it will submit. Each time it is defeated, it must be summoned again. After the second defeat, it submits. If the unbound dremora cannot be summoned again before it submits, be sure that its soul has not been captured and the dialogue preceding each round of battle has not been skipped.\nWhen the unbound Dramora is summoned for the first time, he will say:\n\"You dare bring me here? You must be punished.\"\nYou will do as I say! \"I serve no mortal!\"\nI summoned you. I control you now. \"You control nothing, mortal!\"\nWhen the unbound Dremora is summoned for the second time, he will say:\n\"I am not your plaything, worm!\"\nAre you ready to submit? \"Never!\"\nAdmit that I control you \"I'll tear out your heart first!\"\nWhen the unbound Dremora is summoned for the third time, he will say:\n\"I am not yours to toy with!\"\nDo you submit, or do I need to banish you again? \"I... I submit. What is your bidding, master\"\"\"\nI can do this all day. \"No, I... I submit. No more. What is your bidding?\"\nWhen the unbound Dremora is summoned after submitting:\n\"Your sigil stone. Lord Dagon is less than pleased at its loss.\"\nConclusion.\nAfter defeating the dremora, the Dragonborn orders it to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sigil stone&lt;/a&gt;. When it is summoned again, the stone can be accepted, then brought to Gestor. Making this quest an active quest helps with locating him. When the Dragonborn speaks to Gestor with the sigil stone, he will have the following dialogue:\nI have your sigil stone \"Mine? Oh no, the stone is yours. I simply need to borrow it a moment... Now, let's see what these is to see.\"\nGestor will return the sigil stone, plus reward the Dragonborn with a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Thrall\"&gt;Flame Thrall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spell tome&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Gestor offers the other thrall spells for a considerable fee. All these spells summon thralls with no expiration.\nThe sigil stone can also be used at the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"The%20Midden\"&gt;The Midden&lt;/a&gt; underneath the College. It can be placed on the pedestal, allowing the crafting of &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedric armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Daedra hearts&lt;/a&gt;. The unbound dremora remains at the College."}

When using this spell, it should be cast as close to the enemy as possible, as the Dremora Lord's heavy armor slows it down considerably, and they will use melee weapons but not bows. Once within striking distance, there are few enemies that can best the Dremora Lord in combat. Despite their lower health, they are roughly an even match for a &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20Deathlord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Draugr Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; due to their superior &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weaponry&lt;/a&gt;; however, they do appear to be vulnerable to magic. If the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt; has been acquired, it is somewhat redundant to buy the spell tome and learn this spell, though it does remove the need to carry the extra 10 units of weight the Sanguine Rose has and the need to carry soul gems to recharge the staff."}

Coupled with its relatively low cost in magicka, it can quickly prove itself one of the most versatile spells in the game.\nThis spell is particularly useful against enemies that can turn other summons, since the familiar is immune to being banished or turned."}

The first known Ruling King was &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, followed by &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAccording to Vivec, in order to become a Ruling King one must \"suffer much that cannot be suffered\" and \"weigh matters that no astrolabe or compass can measure.\" An individual cannot be a Ruling King if they consider any other person equal in stature to themselves as a person who sees another as their equal rules nothing. However, each Ruling King has a double that they must overcome who is identical in a manner that if they were to switch roles, they would not know. This occurrence is associated with the number \"11\" in Vivec's Lessons, which is the Number of the Master.\nA Ruling King is redeemed by each action they take, and are drawn back to the world upon death. It is stated by Vivec that with the rising of the next Ruling King, Vivec will confront them and kill them over and over again so that they can learn from his punishment and achieve his form, as the Ruling King must remove its maker. It is implied that &lt;a href=\"CHIM\"&gt;CHIM&lt;/a&gt; may be required to accomplish this, as the Ruling King must \"reach heaven by violence.\" Vivec is believed to have used this obscure teaching technique with Tiber Septim.\nVivec states in his lessons that the &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Void Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; deals are only for Ruling Kings."}

He's always been a bit pinched, but his expression today seemed more genuine, like he's really worried, for the first time in a long while. He's more tight-lipped than usual as well. Normally he would relish the opportunity to comment on just how busy and indispensable he is, but I can't get a word out of him. Perhaps father will care to share the details over supper.\nFather was gone nearly all day yesterday. It was well after dark when he returned to the estate and the clamor roused me from my bed. He must have had a few dozen people in tow, mostly sailors by the look, and nearly as many among the town guard. I thought, perhaps, he intended to move heirlooms abroad under cover of darkness. He led them all down into the family vaults. It all seemed rather clandestine. I waited for nearly an hour by the window in the dark, hoping to catch a glimpse of something that would make sense of it, but when he reemerged he was alone.\nI woke this morning to find the house guard posted by my door. I was informed that my father has ordered the entire family to remain within the manor until further notice. I did not receive the news graciously. I hoped to appeal his tyrannical measure by planting myself before his chamber and ambushing him the moment he returned. I skipped breakfast, lunch, and dinner pacing the hall like a lion in a cage, but he never appeared. Tonight I'm sleeping in front of his door.\nI have a knot on my head from father's chamber door. A rude awakening, courtesy of my baffled mother. After a scolding for my ridiculous behavior, she took pity on me and shared what she knew of my father's sudden strange behavior. A deep sea fishing fleet arrived in port with a king's bounty worth of catch some days ago, but many of their number have taken ill in the time since. Father has them all quarantined underground while he studies their condition.\nThe steward paid us another visit. His expression told me that he did not have good news to deliver. More arrivals were led from town to the vaults under our estate.\nFather has not come to see us in nearly two weeks. Not since all this began. Come to think, I'm not sure he's seen the sun either. That can't be healthy. I hope he's not ill. I don't know how he stands it. I, for one, am going stir crazy in this gilded prison, but at least there are a windows to remind me that there's a world beyond. He should have just put those sailors back out to sea.\nMaybe it's the loss of my sense of time speaking, but I feel like the trickle of townsfolk coming from town is growing more rapid. What I wouldn't give for some wine to settle my nerves, but there's not a drop left here. I can't remember the last time water filled a cup in this house. Dark times.\nI heard some of the house guards gossiping about unrest in the town. It appears we aren't the only ones trapped here. My father issued a decree that none may enter or leave &lt;a href=\"Corgrad%20Wastes%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Corgrad&lt;/a&gt; until this &lt;a href=\"Thrassian%20Plague\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; has passed. Given that it's been months, I can understand where these kindred souls are coming from. All we can do is wait and hope the disease doesn't come for us.\nThose brought from the town in the later stages of the disease barely seem &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Mer&lt;/a&gt; at all. Even draped in cloaks to preserve their dignity, it's easy to tell they are misshapen as the stretchers bear them to the vaults. What happens to the ones who've surely passed by now? I don't care to think about it.\nI hate to drink at my writing desk, but I've been feeling parched all day. Seems like I can hardly go a moment without wetting my tongue or it starts to feel like I'm filing down the backs of my teeth with it. We're fortunate to be able to draw our own water here. If I had to walk to the town well every time I needed a drink today, I'd either be very fit or stricken with exhaustion.\nMerciful &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;, please help us. I can't stop. I drink until I vomit, but I'm so thirsty. Make it stop!"}

Ancient fears run deep\u2014deeper even than cherished traditions or historical enmities. While few &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; will admit to fear of any kind, I've found one topic that reliably sets a northerner on edge: the \"&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;snow ghosts&lt;/a&gt;.\" At first, I thought they referred to &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Wraith%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ice wraiths&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Wispmother%20%28Online%29\"&gt;wispmothers&lt;/a&gt;, but I've come to learn these \"snow ghosts\" bear no similarity to those monsters. Alternatively referred to as \"bogles,\" \"&lt;a href=\"riekr\"&gt;riekr&lt;/a&gt;-kin,\" or \"clatter-coats,\" they plague herders and traders alike\u2014stealing livestock, stabbing wandering merchants in their sleep, and spoiling root cellars with poisonous slime. I gathered the following testimonials in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. I leave it to you, dear reader, to parse the fact from the fiction.\nBonbetta, a Morthal fishmonger, had this to say: \"Aye! I've seen those scamps more than once! Skulking around the docks they were. Snatching up our nets and tearing out the fish. They only come out on the moonless nights, you know. So's you can't see them proper. My eyes aren't what they used to be, mind, but seemed to me they had sharpish ears like an &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt;, they hunched over like &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;, and they had skin like the underbelly of a dead trout. All white, you see? My husband set out to run them off, but they're quick as a whip, and Ralmig's knees creak like a dead pine nowadays. Probably for the better. Way I hear it, they'll kill a person as soon as look at them.\"\nI met a herdsman near the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Bridge%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon Bridge&lt;/a&gt; who could barely contain his contempt for the creatures\u2014shaking his fist often as he gnawed on a dried kilnr root. He asked not to be identified. \"To &lt;a href=\"Sovngarde%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Sovngarde&lt;/a&gt; with those bastards! Used to be that you'd only hear about them once or twice your whole life long. Now, they've snatched up three of my best cows in the last six months alone. Can't hardly get a wink of rest anymore. It's bad enough we've got to compete with damned &lt;a href=\"Mammoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;mammoths&lt;/a&gt; for grazing space. Now I'm wringing my beard day and night worrying about clatter-coats cutting my livestock to pieces. My brother tells me it's just rustlers in black leathers, but I've seen them. No Nord could hunch the way they do. And the clothes they wear\u2014I've never seen the like. Like it's carved off one of those damned cave-bugs you see near Morthal every now and again. Next time I'm in Solitude, I'm going to fetch a good, sturdy bow and pierce one of those cow thieves right between the eyes.\"\nGilse Tistar, a surprisingly pleasant &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dark Elf&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Bards%20College%20%28Online%20Faction%29\"&gt;Bards College&lt;/a&gt;, dismissed these testimonies as local superstition and nothing more. \"You know how these Nords are. Honestly, they'll blame any misfortune on bizarre creatures or foreigners. Just the other day, some pale-eyed merchant blamed me for putting an \"Elf hex\" on their &lt;a href=\"Dog%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt;. I mean, what is that? And why would I care about their dog? It's all nonsense. That said, nonsense often makes for entertaining verse! Just last night I wrote a farce about a five-eyed &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28Online%29\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;. It will land with a splash. Guaranteed.\"\nI met a wild-eyed vagrant in &lt;a href=\"Karthwatch\"&gt;Karthwatch&lt;/a&gt; who offered a truly outlandish claim, flapping his hands about as he spoke. \"They're Elves! Snow Elves! These people \u2026 Goblins some say! And Riekr. Riekr! Can you imagine? Feh. I've seen these things, missy. Got a real good look. They're paler than the palest Nord, with pointy ears and noses like a bat! You say, 'Elves don't have noses like bats!' But you'd be wrong, missy. Dead wrong! Ole &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; cut their noses off so you could tell them apart from other Elves and drove them underground like the worms they are. Now they're all hunched and squinty from living in caves and never seeing the sun! And they're coming back. Mark me! They aim to take &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; back, just like they did back on the &lt;a href=\"Crying%20Night\"&gt;Crying Night&lt;/a&gt;. Beware, missy! Beware!\"\nReal or imagined, these creatures grant us a fascinating glimpse into Nordic folklore and serve as a perfect example of how ancient &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20%28Online%29\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;-stories still plague the northerners today."}

And that's all of us, isn't it, my lion-hearts, because admit it: nothing makes our tails twitch like a moon-sugar-glazed sweet roll!\nIf you're like Rathuni, this one knows you were positively reeling last &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Dawn\"&gt;Sun's Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Abbess%20Mizzi\"&gt;Abbess Mizzi&lt;/a&gt;'s song-paper, in which she reported that it's not just the vile drug &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt; that's bad for you, but our beloved moon-sugar itself! She declared that over-consumption of the Queen of Sweets is responsible for anxiety, droop-ear, sudden weight gain, and even the panting quivers. Imagine!\nHer song-paper spread panic across the kitchens of cat-kind, as we all tried to find substitutes for moon-sugar molasses and granule loaves. Prices of moon-sugar-cane plummeted, while sorghum and sweet-beets suddenly vanished from the markets! Personally, this one was beside herself when she was tapped to provide the sweetcake provender for the &lt;a href=\"Riverhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Riverhold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mid%20Year%20Celebration\"&gt;Mid Year festival&lt;/a&gt;.

(One can only conclude that the abbess\u2014who is getting on in her lives, poor dear\u2014made an error in her calculations somewhere.) My research shows that consumption of moon-sugar in normal moderation does not generate any of the dire effects alleged in that scary Sun's Dawn song-paper.\nIn fact\u2014and here's the best part, though I fear the title of my song-paper has spoiled the surprise, hasn't it?\u2014regular consumption of non-distilled moon-sugar derivatives is actually what gives a Khajiit the gloss in her fur! Yes, my lion-hearts: we can have the sweets we love, as well as shiny, split-end-free coats. (And no wonder my pelt was looking so dull lately!)\nSo there you have it, kitten darlings! Isn't it Rathuni-la who always brings you the catnip? You know it is, leopard-loves. This one will just leave you with a quick recipe for my clan mother's Moon-Sugar Biscuits.

However, the unthinkable has happened, and the very beasts the Order has sworn to destroy have managed to infiltrate the keep and overwhelm its defenders.\nNow, the ancient werewolf known as &lt;a href=\"Vykosa\"&gt;Vykosa&lt;/a&gt; controls Moon Hunter Keep, and from her new base of operations, she has begun to draw her fellow lycanthropes to her cause.

Moon Hunter boosts &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Damage\"&gt;Spell Damage&lt;/a&gt; when using &lt;a href=\"Poisons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;poisons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jailer%27s%20Tenacity\"&gt;Jailer's Tenacity&lt;/a&gt; gives a buff to &lt;a href=\"healing%20received\"&gt;healing received&lt;/a&gt; after being damaged heavily.\nFinally, this dungeon also offers a &lt;a href=\"Monster%20Mask\"&gt;Monster Mask&lt;/a&gt;.

These beasts include lycanthropes, including giant hulking werewolves, but there are also other wild and magical creatures, too.\nIn addition to the beasts, this dungeon features five bosses. This includes the monstrous werewolf &lt;a href=\"Mylene\"&gt;Mylene&lt;/a&gt;, who summons packs of wolves to fight for her and gradually becomes more and more dangerous as the battle progresses.\nGeneric:\nElite:\nBosses:"}

The holiest of substances to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, moonsugar is a daily part of their lives and Elsweyr's chief export, although it is also a potentially dangerous and addictive drug.\nMoonsugar is illegal under the laws of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and many merchants will refuse to do business with anyone in possession of it. Conversely, moonsugar was legal under the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, as most of its uses are benign, and just satisfy the Catfolk\u2019s insatiable craving for sweets.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Khajiit believe moonsugar to be \"crystallized moonlight,\" which is caught in the &lt;a href=\"Topal%20Sea\"&gt;Topal Sea&lt;/a&gt; and brought to the sugarcane groves of the Tenmar by its twin tides. This is said to be a blessing that the Khajiiti gods regularly bestow upon their chosen people. According to the \"&lt;a href=\"Words%20of%20Clan%20Mother%20Ahnissi\"&gt;Words of Clan Mother Ahnissi&lt;/a&gt;\", the light from the moons shone down on Elsweyr's marshes and became sugar when &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;h spoke the Third Secret to the first Khajiit on &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Riddle%27Thar\"&gt;Riddle'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, the cosmic order deity of the Khajiiti, is also known as the Sugar God.\nThird Era.\nThe moonsugar trade in Elsweyr increased multifold between 3E 412 - &lt;a href=\"3E%20432\"&gt;3E 432&lt;/a&gt;. Ya'Tirrje, the Gold Cat, runs a drug-smuggling business in &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corinth\"&gt;Corinth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rimmen\"&gt;Rimmen&lt;/a&gt;, all the while operating out of &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;, which has turned from a principle port of the drug trade, to a coastal resort for wealthy, powerful Khajiit. Moonsugar is scarce in northern Elsweyr, but plentiful in Rimmen. The price of moonsugar in Rimmen is fixed by the office of the Imperial &lt;a href=\"potentate\"&gt;potentate&lt;/a&gt;. Under the laws of the Empire, selling or attempting to sell moonsugar in Rimmen is subject to a fine of triple the worth of the moonsugar. Attempting to sell more than two pounds of moonsugar is punishable by execution.\nUsage.\nAlthough moonsugar is a drug, the Khajiit are more naturally tolerant to it because they consume moonsugar in some form every day. &lt;a href=\"Humans\"&gt;Humans&lt;/a&gt; are more susceptible to the effects of moonsugar, and as such are cautioned against partaking of any native food in Elsweyr.\nMoonsugar is used in a number of invariably sweet foods that make up the staple of the Khajiit diet, including candies, sweet cakes, puddings, and sugarmeats. It is also used as seasoning, and a magical ingredient for communion with the holy moons. By partaking of the sugar, the Khajiit believe they are consuming small portions of their gods' eternal souls.\nA particularly hazardous derivative of moonsugar, known as &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;, is often smoked in raw form through a water-pipe. Its victims are addicted for life, and in constant, alternating states of euphoria and lethargy. It is widely known to all Khajiit that there is no cure for skooma addiction."}

Built to last and utilizing the finest local materials, this place of worship is central to Khajiiti society. Although the Cat-Man deems the Divines as preeminent (and their sanctuary offers prayers to bastardizations of our own &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Eight&lt;/a&gt;), they believe the Lunar Lattice\u2014or the movement of &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt;\u2014influences all matters of luck, destiny, and happenstance, a belief Venustinius Perquitienus has termed a \"hybrid heresy.\"\nKhajiiti dogma reveres the moons as divine, furnishing life into the bodies of the Cat-Man by ingestion of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Sugar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;moon sugar&lt;/a&gt;, a sacred ingredient that can also be refined into a hallucinatory contraband. Although used for both culinary and ritualistic purposes, it can be easily distilled to form &lt;a href=\"skooma\"&gt;skooma&lt;/a&gt;, a wretched and illegal narcotic. Such wanton delirium seems to be kept in check by a hierarchy of Moon-Bishops who regulate these ingestions, which play a small part in Khajiiti ceremonies. The clergy mainly concerns itself with conducting services, rounding up fallen followers, and ruling on theological matters. If an impasse is reached, the issue is resolved by the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nThe absolute rulers of the Lunar Lattice, Manes are the most powerful of the Khajiit outside the clan-chiefs and king of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. They may be a key official to bribe, corrupt, or remove should forthcoming hostilities occur to our southern border. Of further interest is the succession ritual for the Mane; when one expires, a sacred ritual determines his successor. A Moon Herald is appointed to shepherd the potential aspirants on what Khajiiti text describes as an epic and dangerous quest to the surface of the Two Moons themselves, with the sole returning candidate declared the new Mane.\nThe assumption that the lay Cat travels astrally to our moons is preposterous; Venustinius Perquitienus has termed it \"nauseous balderdash,\" and rightly so."}

He will tell you that Daedra have been coming out of the nearby Ayleid Ruin, and will ask you to save his commanders, who have been captured by them. \nYour first objectives is not to save the commanders, but rather to save the other scouts. You will find Scout Kilolemar just past the palisades; release him, the head directly north for Scout Thiirel. Follow the path southwest from here and you will find the final scout, Scout Khurra. Once all three are free, head north from where you saved Khurra to rescue Sergeant Galandir. Upon being rescued, Galandir will head further up the path towards the Ayleid Ruin; speak with him there and he will tell you that &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Ethrel\"&gt;Captain Ethrel&lt;/a&gt; and the other scouts are trapped on the other side of the Daedric portal here. The main portal here has been sealed by protective crystals; destroying these will allow you to go through the main portal and rescue everyone. \nThere are three crystals surrounding the portal. Each of them will have a smaller portal nearby that Daedra will come out of, so be ready for a fight. These Dremora also help to keep the seal intact, so even if you manage to destroy the crystals without alerting them, you will still have to kill them. Once all the crystals have been destroyed and the dremora have been killed, head through the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Isles%20of%20Torment\"&gt;Isles of Torment&lt;/a&gt;. You will see a woman named &lt;a href=\"Sinien\"&gt;Sinien&lt;/a&gt; up ahead, standing over the deceased Captain Ethrel; speak with her and she will suggest that in order to close the portal, you need to get through the gateway to the north. For this, you need to find two keys, the Key of Strife and the Key of Discord. Sinien will ask you to get these keys, and to send any other survivors her way\nHead down the path, then turn south to find &lt;a href=\"Nara\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt; hiding behind a piece of wall. Send her back to Sinien, then continue west and you will find a Dremora named &lt;a href=\"Codaermet%20the%20Wicked\"&gt;Codaermet the Wicked&lt;/a&gt;. He has the Key of Discord; kill him and take it from him. Once you have it, head north until you see a giant staircase. Hazazi will be hiding under this staircase; send him back, then head up the stairs and kill &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Atris\"&gt;Overseer Atris&lt;/a&gt; to get the Key of Strife from his body. \nYour next objective is to head to the west of the area. Your target is a floating island, so you will have to use the roads to get there; you cannot parkour. Here, you will find Sinien and the people you rescued; Sinien will tell you to hold the keys to the pillars here. Activate both the Pillar of Strife and the Pillar of Discord, and another portal will appear; head through and proceed ahead to find this plane's Sigil Stone. It will be protected by a Harvester; kill the Harvester, then proceed to take the Sigil Stone. The plane will now change colour to a shade of red; speak with Sinien again and she will tell you that in order to permanently close the link between here and the Moonhenge, a spell needs to be cast using the Sigil Stone that will destroy this plane's version of the Moonhenge. The person casting the spell will be trapped here though, unable to return. \nChoose which character has to stay behind (&lt;a href=\"Sinien\"&gt;Sinien&lt;/a&gt;, Hazazi or &lt;a href=\"Nara\"&gt;Nara&lt;/a&gt;). However, if the Vestige has the &lt;a href=\"Intimidate\"&gt;Intimidate&lt;/a&gt; perk enabled, it is possible to save all three characters. If you do not intimidate, . If you do intimidate, Sinien will agree to leave you behind. She will give you the Scroll of Sigillic Annihilation to destroy this Moonhenge. Use it, then head northwest to find a gateway back to the Moonhenge, but beware of the fire falling from the sky. Once you are back in Tamriel, talk to Sergeant Galandir to finish the quest."}

Moonmont is a revered temple to the twin moons, &lt;a href=\"Jone\"&gt;Jone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;. It is where the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mane\"&gt;Dark Mane&lt;/a&gt; was sealed away. It is one of the Temple of Two-Moons Dance that are scattered throughout Elsweyr and surrounding areas.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nMoonmont is situated in &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;, the border region between the provinces of Valenwood and Elsweyr, the latter giving influence on Moonmont. The temple settlement is built in Ancient Khajiiti architecture and has memorabilia to the twin moons, Jode and Jone. In fact, Moonmont is sacred in this regard, having pilgrims throughout that side of &lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt;. Moonmont itself is situated on the lowermost end of the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20River\"&gt;Crescent River&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the border between the two provinces, just before &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. There is one main temple along the waterfalls where monks congregate. East of the Temple is several prayer mounds, with pillars in each of them. The southern end of Moonmont is the Temple Vault, with various artifacts collected throughout the eras. The nearest settlement to Moonmont is the town-brewery, &lt;a href=\"Willowgrove\"&gt;Willowgrove&lt;/a&gt; and the forest of &lt;a href=\"Selene%27s%20Web\"&gt;Selene's Web&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, the temple of Moonmont was left abandoned. It was when the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20the%20West%20Weald\"&gt;Legion of the West Weald&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt; had invaded Reaper's March; the Two-Moons Clergy was forced to flee until the conflict was resolved and pilgrims stopped coming. But the Temple of Moonmont was still being used when the time came to seal the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Mane\"&gt;Dark Mane&lt;/a&gt; away for good. After the rebellion in &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Mane fled to Moonmont and corrupted the beacons that made the site holy. The &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Champions\"&gt;Lunar Champions&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;Khali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shazah\"&gt;Shazah&lt;/a&gt; met with the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Moon Hallowed&lt;/a&gt; at Moonmont, to deal with the Dark Mane once and for all. The Moon Hallowed traveled throughout the site and purifying the beacons. With the corrupted power gone, the three entered Moonmont and confronted the Dark Mane. After a heated battle, the Moon Hallowed was forced to seal one of the Lunar Champions with the Dark Mane. In the end, one of them was sealed inside Moonmont, and the other went on to become the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict continued in the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt;, where Javad Tharn was ultimately defeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the town of Moonmont in their quest to recover the pieces."}

Over the years, however, the Moot became permanent and acquired an increasing amount of power. By the reign of King &lt;a href=\"Borgas\"&gt;Borgas&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20Dynasty\"&gt;Ysgramor Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;, the Moot had become partisan and ineffective.\nAfter the murder of King Borgas by the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, the Moot's failure to appoint Jarl &lt;a href=\"Hanse\"&gt;Hanse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterhold\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; sparked the disastrous &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Succession\"&gt;War of Succession&lt;/a&gt;, during which Skyrim lost control of its territories in &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, never to regain them.\nThe war was finally concluded in 1E 420 with the &lt;a href=\"Pact%20of%20Chieftans\"&gt;Pact of Chieftans&lt;/a&gt;; henceforth, the Moot was convened only when a King died without direct heirs.\nOne source claims that this type of Moot is more of a formality and theater than an actual meeting to choose a king, only because in recent times the High Kings have sworn fealty to the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt; is the city most directly influenced by Imperial culture and politics, the Jarl of Solitude has served as High King for generations.\nFourth Era.\nIn the intervening millennium, the Moot had only been called upon three times when the throne was in dispute, and succession has never been decided on the field of battle\u2014even when Skyrim became part of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen High King &lt;a href=\"Istlod\"&gt;Istlod&lt;/a&gt; of Solitude died, a moot was convened to name his son and legitimate heir &lt;a href=\"Torygg\"&gt;Torygg&lt;/a&gt; as the next High King, despite the fact that Torygg held the right to the position regardless.\nHowever, in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, High King Torygg was killed by &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; in a challenge to the throne. This event worsened the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; waging in Skyrim.\nDuring the Civil War in Skyrim, the &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;s demanded the Moot to meet. Ulfric, however, would not allow it, because he did not want to risk Torygg's widow &lt;a href=\"Elisif%20the%20Fair\"&gt;Elisif the Fair&lt;/a&gt; becoming High Queen."}

Mor Khazgur has been the epicenter of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish culture since the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, but similar to the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Orsinium\"&gt;Kingdom of Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, it has been sacked constantly by their neighbors.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nMor Khazgur is situated along the northern border of &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;, near the region of &lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and somewhat close to the provincial border towards &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance to the Khazgur stronghold is to the north, with a path leading into Haafingar and the western woodlands. In the middle of the stronghold is the Chieftain's Longhouse, where the local Orcs had lived in Mor Khazgur. All along the wooden walls were different towers that overlook the Reach countryside, and another overlooking the stronghold. Continuing the path in Mor Khazgur leads into the &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum\"&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/a&gt; mineshaft, to which the Orcs used as their primary source of income. The entrance to the mine is located above and behind the Longhouse.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe original Mor Khazgur was built during the Merethic Era, deep within the &lt;a href=\"Druadach%20Mountains\"&gt;Druadach Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of the Reach. This city-state has preceded the original &lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; by several years before the Orcs were driven out of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. However, Mor Khazgur would be sacked by their neighbors countless times, re-surfacing ever single time only to be destroyed every single time. The history of Mor Khazgur is largely unknown, but it was a significant settlement, likely connecting the Orcs of Ancient Skyrim and the Orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Wrothgarian%20Mountains\"&gt;Wrothgarian Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20583\"&gt;2E 583&lt;/a&gt;, Mor Khazgur was abandoned by the Orcs and claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Champions%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Circle of Champions&lt;/a&gt;, an enclave of gladiators that utilized ruins throughout Tamriel as their personal &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;. Mor Khazgur had already been the sight of various battles during the Second Era, which prompted its abandonment. Many gladiators had traveled to the ruins of Mor Khazgur to partake in battles such as Capture the Flag and Deathmatches. This would remain for several years until the settlement was until abandoned, along with the Circle of Champions and the Battlegrounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Skyrim%20Civil%20War\"&gt;Skyrim Civil War&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, Mor Khazgur had been ruled by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Larak\"&gt;Chief Larak&lt;/a&gt;, where the stronghold was primarily used to mine &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum\"&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby mining site. With the Sack of Orsinium during the early fourth era, many Orcish Clans were forced to migrate to the east and south, where many clans established newer settlements. The &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Orsinium\"&gt;Fourth Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; was built somewhere in Hammerfell, while other strongholds such as &lt;a href=\"Largashbur\"&gt;Largashbur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dushnikh%20Yal\"&gt;Dushnikh Yal&lt;/a&gt; were built in Skyrim. Mor Khazgur was rebuilt once again with the arrival of the Orcs, though it had lost the significance it had once held during the Merethic and Second Eras.

It recoils upon one, and one lets out a yip as all of one's fur stands up straight and sparks jolt through one's form and out the tip of one's tail. And one wonders seriously for the first time: lightning -- what is it?\nListen to Mora'at, for this one is in a position to explain. After much hard study and many repetitions of the entrance exam, Mora'at is now an officially-recognized Journeyman of the &lt;a href=\"Corinthe%20Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Corinthe Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;hall, and therefore in a position to speak with some authority on &lt;a href=\"magical\"&gt;magical&lt;/a&gt; matters. I have been doing research on this matter of lightning -- specializing, as we scholars of the arcane do -- and have also given the matter a not-inconsiderable amount of thought on my own.\nAs a result, this one has a Theory.\nShock, like &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt;, is an expression of magical power that takes the form of a natural force. Everyone has played with this force when one was a ja'&lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;, scuffing one's feet across a rug and then stinging a sibling with a small spark from an extended claw, or rubbing an inflated rat's bladder against one's fur until the hairs stand up and the bladder \"sticks\" to one's chest or arm.\nSo it is apparent to this one, even from an early age, that shock was an inherent property of fibrous matter, a property stimulated by friction into sparks. This also explains lighting, as clouds, which resemble nothing so much as huge &lt;a href=\"Tenmar%20Forest\"&gt;Tenmar&lt;/a&gt; cotton-balls, generate shock when storms cause friction through colliding masses of buoyant fiber.\nTherefore, when one of we mighty wizards of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; casts a Shock spell, what is actually happening? This one explains it as follows: the reality of the &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt; is a great tapestry woven of strands of matter and &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Online%29\"&gt;magicka&lt;/a&gt;. A Shock spell channels and manipulates magicka through the local warp and weft of the tapestry, agitating its fibers. This generates sparking, which coalesces into magical lightning. Yes?\nPerceptions such as these come easily once one is a skilled mage. When I present this theory to our magister, this one anticipates well-earned praise and encouragement. In fact, now that Mora'at is a bona fide magical scholar, this one may even have another theory tomorrow!"}

{"id": "1506", "revid": "26459635", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=1506", "title": "Morag Tong", "text": "The Morag Tong, also known as the Forester's Guild or Forest Guild, is a guild of assassins operating out of Morrowind. The Empire, during their occupation of Morrowind, sanctioned the guild to perform public, private, and House War executions, and while the Empire opposes murder, the Morag Tong was considered a legitimate means to assassinate a target, with even the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; showing respect for the guild. \nThe Morag Tong are considered to be a powerful threat due to their connection to Morrowind's government. The Morag Tong is believed to have originated under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;, who they also call the \"Night Mother\" or \"Black Hands Mephala\". Morrowind &lt;a href=\"Great%20House\"&gt;Great House&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Redoran\"&gt;Redoran&lt;/a&gt; disapproves of the Morag Tong, seeing them as criminals and murderers, and refuses to do business with them. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; is the sworn enemy of the Morag Tong.\nBackground.\nRules and requirements.\nThe Morag Tong looks for people who are able to appear different from who they are. They prefer members to be experienced in illusion magic, light armor, short blade, acrobatics, and sneaking. In order to join the Morag Tong, one must find the Grandmaster, who remains hidden, traditionally in Vivec. Members of the Tong are only allowed to assassinate their target while carrying the proper writ, and have no way to choose which writ they will have to execute.\nHarming or stealing from a fellow member of the Morag Tong results in expulsion, with the same punishment being applied for the betrayal of secrets or betrayal of identities. Those who are expelled must speak with a Master of the Tong in order to regain their status, or risk being targeted by a writ. Murdering civilians is seen as dishonorable and incompetent, while killing a target is seen as sacred and honorable.\nDuties.\nThe Morag Tong concerns itself with honorable executions. Writs from as early as the First Era exist, and offer an insight into their philosophies. The early writs provided hints towards where and when the target was to be executed, and also made direct references to &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;. The Tong executes writs and performs special duties by the command of the ruling Great Houses. Upon retirement, members of the Morag Tong are sent to Vounoura.\nRanks.\nMorag Tong assassins, primarily those of Knower rank or above, typically keep an assassination journal, from which the Thralls can learn. Writs are created by the Grandmaster of the Tong, who reads petitions which are sent to him by those who wish to hire their services, if the petition is accepted, a writ is signed.\nBy tradition, when a new Grandmaster arises, he honorably executes the previous Grandmaster before taking their position.\nArtifacts.\n&lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Blade\"&gt;Ebony Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the artifacts associated with the Morag Tong is the Ebony Blade, a weapon belonging to the Daedric Prince Mephala.\n&lt;a href=\"Threads%20of%20the%20Webspinner\"&gt;Threads of the Webspinner&lt;/a&gt;.\n27 belts, rings, shoes and amulets are part of the artifacts of the Morag Tong. They had been lost for a long time during the Third Era, until being retrieved during the rise of Dagoth Ur. They were created during a pact between &lt;a href=\"Sanguine\"&gt;Sanguine&lt;/a&gt; and Mephala, being given to the members of the Morag Tong, but the Dark Brotherhood stole them.\nEquipment.\nMorag Tong armor is made from chitin, leather, and other materials gathered from animals. They form a very distinct outline for the assassin. Their weapons are often in the shape of a crescent.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Morag Tong is believed by some to have found its origins alongside the founding of Morrowind, as during the early days of Resdayn the province was rife with assassinations. The Tong was founded to prevent violence, through keeping House politics from escalating into House Wars.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the First Era the government of Morrowind officially sanctioned the Morag Tong to operate within the province. During the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt;, the Morag Tong was responsible for the assassination of both &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Cyrodiil%20III\"&gt;Reman Cyrodiil III&lt;/a&gt; and his son, &lt;a href=\"Juilek%20Cyrodiil\"&gt;Juilek Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, and thus brought about the end of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;. The death of Reman was ordered by the Duke of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, and despite the attempts of &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the assassination from coming through, it did occur.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of the Second Era the Morag Tong rose in popularity, until they killed the ruler of the Empire, this time killing Potentate &lt;a href=\"Versidue%20Shaie\"&gt;Versidue Shaie&lt;/a&gt; in the Senchal Palace. After his assassination, the Morag Tong was said to have written their name in the blood of the Potentate, though it has also been argued that this was merely an attempt to frame the Morag Tong for his death. With the death of the Potentate, as well as other high nobility of Tamriel, the Morag Tong began to fall apart, and the Dark Brotherhood gained new members in the form of former assassins of the Morag Tong. Whether they truly killed the Potentate or not is irrelevant, as the Morag Tong was blamed, and in &lt;a href=\"2E%20324\"&gt;2E 324&lt;/a&gt;, the Tong became outlawed throughout Tamriel, with the exception of Morrowind.\nAfter the fall of both the Reman Empire and the Longhouse Emperors, the reputation of the Morag Tong was on the rise again, though it was far from the respect they once commanded.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the Third Era, House Wars were greatly limited through the usage of the Morag Tong, which enabled public peace and rule of law to continue to exist within the province. During the rise of Dagoth Ur, the Morag Tong fought a shadow war against the Dark Brotherhood on Vvardenfell, as well as the cult of Mehrunes Dagon. They successfully killed both the local Night Mother, as well as another leading figure on Vvardenfell. They also assassinated several prominent figures, including Mistress &lt;a href=\"Therana\"&gt;Therana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baladas%20Demnevanni\"&gt;Baladas Demnevanni&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;, General &lt;a href=\"Larrius%20Varro\"&gt;Larrius Varro&lt;/a&gt; of the Imperial Legion, Councilor &lt;a href=\"Dram%20Bero\"&gt;Dram Bero&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;, and various other Great House members. A total of four attempts were made on the life of &lt;a href=\"Athyn%20Sarethi\"&gt;Athyn Sarethi&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known about the Morag Tong during the Oblivion Crisis, except that they attempted to assassinate the commander of the &lt;a href=\"Drothmeri%20Army\"&gt;Drothmeri Army&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sundercliff%20Watch\"&gt;Sundercliff Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which was commanded by a member of House Telvanni who aimed to overthrow the Empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupted during the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, the Morag Tong scattered, vowing to one day reunite. This occurred sometime before, or during, &lt;a href=\"4E%20201\"&gt;4E 201&lt;/a&gt;, when the Morag Tong was hired by &lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Lleril%20Morvayn\"&gt;Lleril Morvayn&lt;/a&gt; of House Redoran, due to the death of Vilur Ulen. The Great House had sent some Redoran Guard to their headquarters in an attempt to kill the assassins, but the guardsmen had failed, and were instead killed themselves. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; eventually wiped out their presence on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;, by killing the assassins at &lt;a href=\"Ashfallow%20Citadel\"&gt;Ashfallow Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, and thus saving Councilor Morvayn. Even so, it did result in writs being signed on the Dragonborn."}

As \"Tong\" means guild in the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; language, the usage \"Morag Tong Guild\" translates to \"Forester's Guild Guild.\" They worship the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe Morag Tong is quite unique in Tamriel, as it is the only legally sanctioned organization for assassins. It was said to have been founded by the Daedric Prince Mephala. In Dunmeri legends, she teaches the early &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; nomads, who were emigrating from &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;, how to evade their adversaries and destroy them with conspiracy and secret plots of murder, their \"sphere of influence\" upon Morrowind being conspiracies and secrets. A small faction of Chimer continued to adhere to these principles, and, thus, the Morag Tong was born.\nAs a means of resolving conflicts of such a grievous nature between Chimer groups that no other course of action was appropriate, the Chimer were to approach the Morag Tong and offer money for an \"honorable execution.\" Because of its official sanction, the Morag Tong has the authority to print legal bills known as \"Writs of Execution,\" which excuse a guild agent of all legal misgiving associated with any Morag Tong related business. These writs are to be presented to any arresting guard or soldier, and immediately and completely absolve the assassin for the murder. As such, Morag Tong executioners are expected to give themselves up immediately following an execution even if the death itself would have remained a mystery, in order to legally absolve themselves and avert any possible long-term ramifications. Executioners who fail to do so are considered suspect by their order and may be subject to major internal investigations, as the Morag Tong does not harbor criminals. Note also that other crimes committed in the completion of an assignment are not excused by a writ \u2014 for example, theft or secondary killings.\nThe Splintering of the Morag Tong.\nAlthough the Morag Tong is a society of murder and assassination, they have strict internal laws and ways of governing themselves. Early in the history of the order a splinter group broke away, calling itself The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, who turned from the original intent of the society: to prevent massive bloodshed with selectively calculated killings. The Brotherhood transformed into a \"death cult,\" turning from the original worship of the patron Mephala to the worship of &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt;, the avatar of death. Their matron became the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt;, an old woman supposed to be fervently loyal to their Dread Father, Sithis. Their murders were no longer motivated by altruism; they weren't even motivated by money. They frequently abducted innocents, whose souls served as sacrifices in &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromantic&lt;/a&gt; ceremonies.\nCriticisms.\nSince its creation, to the outside world, the people of Morrowind, the Morag Tong has become less of a sacred institution and more of a secularized enterprise of revenge. This is largely because of the Dunmeri abandonment of &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20worship\"&gt;Daedra worship&lt;/a&gt;. The Morag Tong resents this fact, still taking its role as upholder of traditional Dunmeri law very seriously, and feels, on the whole, that its services are undervalued: anyone with a minor grievance and enough wealth can order the murder of another person because the Morag Tong, taking their traditional role as the impartial middle-man, is always obliged to accept the contract.\nOuter Operations.\nAlthough the Morag Tong is largely restricted to activity within Morrowind Province, due to the fact that no other Imperial governments recognize them as a legal faction, this does not mean that fleeing Morrowind will protect a target. Tong executioners have been known to track their prey all across Tamriel, thanks in part to an extensive network of informants and contacts maintained by the Guild. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor%20%28Plug-in%29\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor (Plug-in)&lt;/a&gt; for offers a chance to encounter a Morag Tong Assassin who has been captured while hunting a target in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Dark Brotherhood has a monopoly on illegal assassination outside of Morrowind, and Brotherhood assassins have been known to abduct Tong agents wherever they find them.\nFall.\nDuring the events of , the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; learns from &lt;a href=\"Ravyn%20Imyan\"&gt;Ravyn Imyan&lt;/a&gt;, that the Morag Tong was dissolved after the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;. They apparently made a pact to eventually reunite somewhere in Tamriel, but Ravyn states he doesn't believe it to be anytime soon. Despite this, however, the events of prove that the Morag Tong has been reformed somewhere between the Red Year and 4E 201.\nMorrowind.\nJoining the Morag Tong.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; joins this guild after finding their secret base of operations in &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, Arena hidden area, then later becomes the Grandmaster of the Guild.\nGuildhalls.\nThey have guildhalls located in the cities of &lt;a href=\"Balmora%2C%20Morag%20Tong%20Guild\"&gt;Balmora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ald%27ruhn%2C%20Morag%20Tong%20Guildhall\"&gt;Ald'Ruhn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Hidden%20Area\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sadrith%20Mora%2C%20Morag%20Tong%20Guild\"&gt;Sadrith Mora&lt;/a&gt;.\nOblivion.\nIn , there is one appearance of the Morag Tong.

He has a set of unique &lt;a href=\"Morag%20Tong%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; that can only be acquired here.\nDragonborn.\nThe Morag Tong make a reappearance in the add-on \"Dragonborn\" during the side quest \"&lt;a href=\"Served%20Cold\"&gt;Served Cold&lt;/a&gt;\" in which they are encountered as enemies.

These Ra Gada interlopers were received into &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and began to make short work of their local Orsimer neighbors, presuming so far as to call themselves the Forebears, while in fact the lands had occupancy precursors in the Orsimer, Dwemer, Ayleids, and even the Goblins!\nIt should be known by now that the Redguards are thusly not the legal inheritors of Hammerfell, nor are they owed any claim upon the territories of &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;.

She will ask you to deliver a letter to the King of Worms in &lt;a href=\"Scourg%20Barrow\"&gt;Scourg Barrow&lt;/a&gt; in the Dragontail Mountains, and come back with his reply, \u00a0and gives you one month to complete the task. Once outside Castle Wayrest, simply fast travel to the location provided by Morgiah.\nEntering the barrow, there will be a room with 7 coffins. lifting the lids of the coffins will reveal that two of them have empty bottoms, one directly in the center and a second one to the left. the coffin in the center leads to a room with three mummies, resistant to any physical attack. That room contains treasure, though, so with a silver weapon or magic, the mummies can be killed. Levitate may also be required to leave the room through the hole, as it is not possible to climb out.\nThe other coffin to the left holds the destination. Jumping down most likely results in taking damage as the player usually does not have a high aerobics skill. After jumping, follow the hallway to the first room. There will be two &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;zombies&lt;/a&gt; here, and after defeating them, go into the door left of the entrance. Keep following that hallway until you reach a t-intersection, and take a left.\nAt this point, the hallways end and the cave begins. At the beginning of the cave, there will be two skull candles on each side of the entrance. Walk along the cave until you come across a second set of skull candles, and a few feet beyond that the cave forks into a passage to the behind and right and one leading straight ahead. The tunnel leading behind and right leads to the Worm King, the other one leads to an empty room. Travel down the tunnel leading west, and walk until you reach a new section of hallway and a t-intersection. Turn left at the intersection, and you will encounter a locked door, pick the lock or break the door by attacking it. Inside will be a throne room, with the Worm King standing on a dias to the far right. Activate him to receive his reply, and exit the barrow by the way you came in, climbing out the coffin by walking into the wall and jumping. After exiting the Dungeon, fast travel to Wayrest and receive your reward from Morgiah.\nAfter some time, a letter will be received saying Morgiah has is having a wedding to the King of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; soon."}

Silvenar is the spiritual home of the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, being the home of &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of Valenwood.\nDescription.\nGeography.\nThe city-state of Silvenar is situated in a region called the &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20Vale\"&gt;Silvenar Vale&lt;/a&gt;, which is in the northern area of Malabal Tor. Silvenar is nestled along the western banks of the &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River\"&gt;Xylo River&lt;/a&gt;, a long river that runs down towards the reaches of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;. The roots of Silvenar extend beyond the city-state, with a cave located inside the Graht-oak along the Xylo River. Despite the dense forest, Silvenar can be seen miles away, since it is the only other Graht-oak in Malabal Tor. There are several ruins found around Silvenar, a lot of them hold significance. The ruins of &lt;a href=\"Ouze\"&gt;Ouze&lt;/a&gt; are found in the east, and it is where those who break the oath of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; go when they perish. To the west is the &lt;a href=\"Chancel%20of%20Divine%20Entreaty\"&gt;Chancel of Divine Entreaty&lt;/a&gt;, which is an Ayleid ruin and a temple of some sorts.\nSilvenar city itself is a rather simple layout. The entrance to Silvenar is a large bridge and an area where the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Silvenar\"&gt;Guardian of Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, a hulking &lt;a href=\"Lurcher\"&gt;Lurcher&lt;/a&gt;. In the center of the city is a large &lt;a href=\"Graht-oak\"&gt;Graht-oak&lt;/a&gt; tree. This is where &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady&lt;/a&gt; resides. It is also the most massive building in Silvenar. At the base floor of the Graht-oak is the marketplace, which leads to the rest of the city. Inside the tree are vine ladders that lead to upper levels, which connect to the other trees. There are three other trees in Silvenar, one in the northwest that overlooks the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Coast\"&gt;Broken Coast&lt;/a&gt;, one in the south that looks towards the &lt;a href=\"Xylo%20River%20Basin\"&gt;Xylo River Basin&lt;/a&gt;, and the one in the east that looks towards the rest of Silvenar Vale. At the base of these trees are other merchants and even Guildhalls. Silvenar is built atop of a hill, so walking out of Silvenar, other than the main entrance would lead to steep slopes and sunken valleys that surround Silvenar.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike other settlements, the city-state of Silvenar was birth from the &lt;a href=\"Green-Sap\"&gt;Green-Sap&lt;/a&gt;, one of &lt;a href=\"the%20Towers\"&gt;the Towers&lt;/a&gt; of yore, and it eventually became a fully-fledged settlement. It is unknown whether the city-state or &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; title came before the other but both became related. The Silvenar represents the people of Valenwood and is the overall leader of the Wood Elves. In its earliest years, Silvenar, among other cities like &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceyatatar\"&gt;Ceyatatar&lt;/a&gt; flourished with the construction of the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, within modern-day &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The trade deriving from the tower gave these settlements mass amounts of power.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Borgas\"&gt;High King Borgas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; invaded Valenwood when they denied the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt; and killed amidst the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;, the province of Valenwood under the &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Dynasty\"&gt;Camoran Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Empire\"&gt;Alessian Empire&lt;/a&gt; waged war with each other for several years. Once the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Reform\"&gt;Alessian Reform&lt;/a&gt; was dispelled, the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt; would join the Alessians in their battle against the Camoran's Valenwood. Although in &lt;a href=\"1E%202714\"&gt;1E 2714&lt;/a&gt;, a plague from distant &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt; had hit Valenwood, leading to Valenwood's defeat at the hands of the Alessian Empire. But the Camoran Dynasty was still a notable figure, and so to prevent a rebellion, the Empire granted the &lt;a href=\"Treethane\"&gt;Treethane&lt;/a&gt;s of the Dynasty full independence in the Empire. One of these settlements was Silvenar, &lt;a href=\"Archen\"&gt;Archen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Eldenroot\"&gt;Eldenroot&lt;/a&gt;. These settlements grew from simple trading posts to fully-fledged power.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Interregnum\"&gt;Interregnum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, a group known as the &lt;a href=\"Houndsmen\"&gt;Houndsmen&lt;/a&gt; had surfaced throughout &lt;a href=\"Malabal%20Tor\"&gt;Malabal Tor&lt;/a&gt;, waging war against &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;. After the Silvenar was freed from the longhouse of &lt;a href=\"Jathsogur\"&gt;Jathsogur&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled to the city-state of Silvenar, to begin the &lt;a href=\"Handfasting\"&gt;Handfasting&lt;/a&gt;, the formal wedding between the Silvenar and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady&lt;/a&gt;. But the leader of the Houndsmen, &lt;a href=\"Ulthorn%20the%20Hound\"&gt;Ulthorn the Hound&lt;/a&gt; had entered Silvenar first, declaring a new order, with the intent of marrying &lt;a href=\"Gwaering\"&gt;Gwaering&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Lady, some people took to his side. Some of them did not, including &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Thalrinel\"&gt;Treethane Thalrinel&lt;/a&gt;, who resisted his advances and was swiftly killed by Ulthorn. The Houndsmen captured the city of Silvenar until the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, and the Silvenar intervened. Around the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; had ravaged the continent all over, the &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20Pact\"&gt;Ebonheart Pact&lt;/a&gt; had made advancements into Dominion territory. Under the command of &lt;a href=\"Adavos%20Dren\"&gt;Adavos Dren&lt;/a&gt;, the Pact had created a tunnel from the &lt;a href=\"Roots%20of%20Silvenar\"&gt;Roots of Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to collect samples of the Graht-oak. Fortunately, he was killed and the operation ended in disaster for the Pact.\nThe Aldmeri Dominion had surrounded the city-state of Silvenar, holding off the bridge entrance. With the help of an &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt; of the Dominion, the Guardian of Silvenar was taken down, and the Dominion had gained entrance of the city streets. Ulthorn had imprisoned the three Spinners of Silvenar at each corner of the city, prompting the Agent to free them. Eventually, entrance to the Silvenar's Audience Hall was achieved and the Agent confronted Ulthorn and the enthralled Gwaering. After subduing the Green Lady, the Agent killed the Hound. With Ulthorn dead, the Agent retrieved the Handfast and the ceremony had begun. Indaenir had officially been named the Silvenar of Valenwood, succeeding &lt;a href=\"Edhelorn\"&gt;Edhelorn&lt;/a&gt; before him. Although, a strange anomaly occurred when the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt; had succumbed to dark magic, slaughtering Khajiiti guards with him in Silvenar and escaped for &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldmeri Dominion followed suit.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the passing of &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20I\"&gt;Pelagius Septim I&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%2041\"&gt;3E 41&lt;/a&gt;, a new Emperor was needed to fill the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt; however, Pelagius I had died without any heirs, leaving the throne to his first cousin, &lt;a href=\"Kintyra%20Septim%20I\"&gt;Kintyra Septim I&lt;/a&gt;. Kintyra I was the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Agnorith%20Septim\"&gt;Agnorith Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who was the brother of the Great &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;. Before she was the Empress, Kintyra I was the Queen of Silvenar, working alongside &lt;a href=\"the%20Silvenar\"&gt;the Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; as they watched over the city-state. Kintyra I's reign was prosperous and filled with a bountiful harvest. It was known that she was a patron of the arts, including music and dance. According to legend, &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiiti%20Pantheon\"&gt;Khajiiti Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; had stolen a tattoo off of Kintyra I's neck, this was before he was made a member of the Pantheon. In &lt;a href=\"3E%2048\"&gt;3E 48&lt;/a&gt;, Kintyra I had passed away, leaving the throne to her son, &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20I\"&gt;Uriel Septim I&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the city in their quest to recover the pieces. The city of Silvenar was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"King%20Paligorn\"&gt;King Paligorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the faraway &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt; had concluded, &lt;a href=\"Pelagius%20Septim%20III\"&gt;Pelagius Septim III&lt;/a&gt; ascended to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Solitude\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, as he descended into severe madness. Before his reign, when it was &lt;a href=\"King%20Mantiarco\"&gt;King Mantiarco&lt;/a&gt;, the Silvenar was &lt;a href=\"Varbarenth\"&gt;Varbarenth&lt;/a&gt;, ruling out of the city-state of Silvenar. Not much is known about his time as Silvenar but considering that they rule until death, Varbarenth was likely the Silvenar during Pelagius III's time. There have been stories surrounding Pelagius III regarding his madness. One such legend was when he would lock the Princes and Princesses of Silvenar in a room, slipping declarations of war underneath the door. Considering how demented he was and both Solitude's and Silvenar's location, there was likely no wars between them. Eventually, Pelagius III assumed the Ruby Throne, although his wife, &lt;a href=\"Katariah%20Ra%27athim\"&gt;Katariah Ra'athim&lt;/a&gt; assumed the role of Regent Empress, issuing the golden years of the Empire."}

The item in question was taken by a group of bandits led by Rigel Strong-Arm and brought to their hideout at Pinewatch.\"\nWalkthrough.\nAfter completing five small jobs for &lt;a href=\"Delvin%20Mallory%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Delvin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vex\"&gt;Vex&lt;/a&gt; that are set in Markarth, Delvin will request that the Dragonborn travel to Markarth to find a man with great influence in the city. Travel to Markarth and enter the &lt;a href=\"Silver-Blood%20Inn\"&gt;Silver-Blood Inn&lt;/a&gt;. Endon is the initial quest giver.\nThe Dragonborn must retrieve a silver mold from a group of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; in Pinewatch shack just to the east of &lt;a href=\"Falkreath%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falkreath&lt;/a&gt;. Once through the door to the shack, go to the basement and find the bandit named\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Rhorlak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Rhorlak&lt;/a&gt;. If Rhorlak is bribed, he will reveal the location of the button. He can also be killed if the conversation option \"tell me where it is, or else\" is chosen. He is a relatively weak character.\nTo the right of the eastern bookshelf and behind the table is a small red button on the wall. When pressed, the bookshelf will open (there is a note on the table that will tell you there is a hidden room behind the bookshelf).\nThere are two possible ways the Dragonborn can go through the caves to get to the mold: simply kill all the bandits on the way there or sneak past. Due to Pinewatch's varied pathways, the Dragonborn can sneak past most, if not all the bandits with only minor issue. One of those is presented toward the end, where the bandit leader &lt;a href=\"Rigel%20Strong-Arm\"&gt;Rigel Strong-Arm&lt;/a&gt; is sleeping in the last room but is surrounded by bone chime alarms; one rattle will cause her to wake up to investigate.\nEither method takes the Dragonborn into Pinewatch Bandit's Sanctuary. On a broken sarcophagus in the last room is the silver mold, along with some leveled loot. Right in front of the sarcophagus is a pressure plate, which triggers a spike trap. Exit back into Pinewatch through the door behind the sarcophagus."}

It is one of the shrine sergeant quests given by &lt;a href=\"Kaye\"&gt;Kaye&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nYears ago, an acolyte of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Cult\"&gt;Imperial Cult&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Linus%20Iulus\"&gt;Linus Iulus&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Ebonheart%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebonheart&lt;/a&gt; to find a traitor. He has not been seen since. &lt;a href=\"Lalatia%20Varian\"&gt;Lalatia Varian&lt;/a&gt;, the oracle of the Imperial Cult on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, has had dreams lately about a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Staff%20of%20Shaming\"&gt;Silver Staff of Shaming&lt;/a&gt; lying near &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kand\"&gt;Mount Kand&lt;/a&gt;. As she has given such a staff to Linus Iulus before his departure, she suspects that Linus Iulus' remains can be found there. The shrine sergeant Kaye asks the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; to find what is left of Linus Iulus and bring back the Silver Staff of Shaming and what else is left of his possessions, in particular his &lt;a href=\"Maran%20Amulet\"&gt;Maran Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stendarran%20Belt\"&gt;Stendarran Belt&lt;/a&gt;. As his death is a burden on Lalatia Varian's conscience, it would be good to have this artefacts back at the chapels. Kaye gives the Nerevarine an &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Enchantment%20Ring\"&gt;Detect Enchantment Ring&lt;/a&gt; who should help them detect the items.\nIf asked about this situation by talking about \"Silver Staff of Shaming,\" Lalatia Varian will say:\n\"As I told Kaye, I believe the Silver Staff of Shaming, and the remains of Linus Iulus, will be found in the shadow of Mount Kand. I do not think the time of day is important. I believe the shadow is symbolic, symboling the shadow of death that has fallen over Linus Iulus. I hope you retrieve the staff. And I hope you find other of his personal effects so that we may honor them in token of one who has fallen in our service.\"\nDetailed walkthrough.\nAfter accepting the quest the Nerevarine should travel to Mount Kand in the &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Amur%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Molag Amur&lt;/a&gt; region. Linus Iulus skeleton lies on top of the mountain, which can be reached by means of levitation or by foot coming from east. He carries the asked for Silver Staff of Shaming as well as Linus Iulus' Maran Amulet and Linus Iulus' Stendarran Belt on him. The Nerevarine can take the effects and should now return to the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Chapels\"&gt;Imperial Chapels&lt;/a&gt; in Ebonheart to deliver them.\nUpon giving Kaye the Silver Staff of Shaming and Linus Iulus' other possessions, he thanks the Nerevarine, suggesting that they keep the staff in honor of Linus Iulus' sacrifice. He also rewards them with a &lt;a href=\"Restoration%20Shirt\"&gt;Restoration Shirt&lt;/a&gt;. He says that the amulet and the belt will be given to other new lay servants."}

At higher levels, a death overlord and/or a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; will be guarding the word wall.\nWalkthrough.\nFinding a way through this dungeon/crypt can be quite difficult, not just because of the traps, but also because of the location of the switches used to open certain doors. The best method is to check all posts for a handle to activate. These are very small and hard to notice if not knowing what to look for, most notably at the junction where there are two swinging traps and two draugr.\nThe first room entered is a kitchen of sorts, with two dead bandits. A passage leads east to a junction with a dead bandit and a draugr. There are paths to the north and east, but the wall to the northeast is actually a large column with a &lt;a href=\"coin%20purse\"&gt;coin purse&lt;/a&gt; behind it. The path to the east leads to a door that is barred from the other side. The path to the north turns east and leads to an iron door, beyond which is a room with a draugr, shelves on both sides, and straight ahead, a table with several potions and the &lt;a href=\"Two-Handed%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Two-Handed&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Words%20and%20Philosophy\"&gt;Words and Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;\". There are openings on either side of the table that lead to the second level of a large central chamber with bridges, wooden ramps, wooden platforms, and several more draugr.\nAcross the bridge on the north side of the table are two circular stone platforms with wooden spiral ramps leading down to the bottom floor. Down the first ramp (around the northern pillar) to the lower level, there are two urns against the east wall. Proceeding to the right around the room is a throne, a fire pit with various animals hanging waiting to be eaten, an apprentice-locked chest with leveled loot, and then a chest against the west stone wall behind a wooden wall. To the right of that is a passage leading to the west (See the Secret path section below for more information). Finally, in the northeastern corner is another door that is barred from the other side, which leads from the hidden path.\nBack up on the second level, continuing on east is another bridge where there is a trigger for a swinging gate trap at the end. Beyond that is another swinging gate trap and two more draugr. Beyond that are two stone posts\u2014the one on the right (south) side has a handle that opens a spike gate straight ahead. Before that gate, though, on the south end of the room is a platform with an enchanted helmet\u2014taking it causes a spike trap to rise from the floor, so care should be exercised.\nBeyond the now-opened spike gate to the east is an iron door with a draugr, a dead bandit, and a table to the northeast with a chest with leveled loot and a potion. To the north is an adept-locked jail cell that is empty. To the south is a gate with a pull chain to open it, but when opened, a swinging log trap is triggered. Beyond that, the passage climbs steps up and around, eventually heading north to a room with a long table and two more draugr. A passage continues north, then west and north up more stairs, then down to a room with another draugr, a chest with leveled loot, and the &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; skill book \"&lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;\" on the right (west) side of the room between skeletal hands coming out of stone.\nAnother passage from the south end of the room leads west down stairs to an unlocked gate that opens into a cage-protected bridge high above the central room previously seen. At the other end of the bridge is another draugr. The path turns south and leads up stairs, then forward to an iron door. Behind it is a large room with the word wall with a word for &lt;a href=\"Disarm\"&gt;Disarm&lt;/a&gt;, two more draugr, and at high levels, an unnamed dragon priest. There is a fire trap straight ahead. Up the stairs on the right side is an upper level for the room that has no notable loot. Facing the word wall, the steps to the left side are protected by a fire trap.\nTo the right (west) is an iron door leading to a room with urns and a chest containing lots of loot. To the left of the chest is a chain that, when activated, opens the gate to the north. Beyond the gate are steps leading down and to the left to a door with a wooden bar blocking it. Activating the bar and opening the door leads back to the first junction entered in this dungeon (the one with the dead bandit).\nSecret path.\nThere is an easily missed secret path which originates in the large main chamber. At the very bottom, along the western wall, there is an opening into a puzzle room. There the Dragonborn will find a snake and a whale pillar, each with its own handle. One handle opens the stone door and the other triggers a fire trap. The solution is hidden by a hanging lantern, obscuring a whale symbol.\nThe path that opens leads to the west, then north into a room with two draugr and a chest. If The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal creation is installed, the chest will contain the Ancestral Sword of Clan Ice-Blade. At the north end of that room, a path leads east to a crypt with two more draugr. To the right (east) is an expert-locked chest on a table. At the north end of this room is a doorway leading east to another crypt. In the center immediately ahead is a post with a handle that, when activated, opens the door directly ahead to the east where another high-level draugr waits, but which has no other exit points. To the north is another post with a handle that, when activated, opens another door to the east. Behind that door are multiple coin purses, armor, a weapon, and a chest with leveled loot. To the south is another post with a handle that opens a third door to the east. This one leads to a passageway south to a barred door. Activating the door bar and opening the door leads back to the lowest level of the central room."}

They can then speak to Arch-mage &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; outside of the Mages Guild.\nWalkthrough.\nGoing to the Isles.\nUpon meeting with Valaste, she will direct the hero to Shalidor. Shalidor will open a portal to the Shivering Isles. Upon entering, the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; will be greeted with a gloomy area that bares resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Glade%20of%20the%20Divines\"&gt;Glade of the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. Haskill will be in front of the main building. He will tell the Vestige that the Fork of Horripilation and Wabbajack need to be retrieved. A portal will open to Vuldngrav where the Fork is located. Shalidor the Vestige that he will aid them as a follower.\nThe Fork in Vuldngrav.\nUpon arriving to the portal destination, the Vestige and Shalidor will be in Vuldngrav, a Nordic tomb. Progressing further down the hallway will be a door. Opening the door will lead to a large room with many urns and an ice barrier at the gate. A box will lie at the right side of the room guarded by two Draugr. Opening the box will reveal that there is nothing in it and Korthor will begin speaking. He will send out three waves of Draugr in an attempt to kill the Vestige. Upon defeating the Draugr, Korthor will challenge Shalidor and the Vestige to face him. He will remove the ice barrier from the gate.\nUpon going through the gate, a stairway will lead up to a corridor. Two Draugr will be stationed there, and can easily be killed. To the left and right will be two small hallways, though they will both lead to the same place. Upon going to the meeting place of the hallways, three Draugr can be seen. These Draugr can easily be bypassed if the Vestige goes invisible and walks by them from their left or right or can be killed in combat. Behind them will be a staircase leading up to a large room with Korthor.\nA Draugr can be found walking back and forth patrolling the small hall in front of Korthor and can be defeated easily. Korthor will be found levitating on a Daedric rune. Once he notices the Vestige and Shalidor, he will get on his feet and pull out his sword. He will then summon a bone-like Daedra to help him fight and will cast spells against the two. Once he is defeated, the Fork of Horripilation can be found on his body. Haskill when then appear with a portal behind him.\nThe Wabbajack in Asakala.\nAfter entering the portal, the Vestige will find themselves in a desert. It is revealed that this is &lt;a href=\"Asakala\"&gt;Asakala&lt;/a&gt;, an old Yokudan ruin and resting place for Prince Maleel, the Scythe of &lt;a href=\"Yokuda\"&gt;Yokuda&lt;/a&gt;. There will be towering statues, floating essences and skeletal warriors. Speaking to Shalidor will give the Vestige a special aura needed to capture the essences. It is suggested to defeat the skeletal warriors beforehand so that they don't get in the way later; and it should be noted that they won't respawn. Once four essences have been retrieved, activate a scarab seal for one of the statues closer to the portal. Four more essences will need to be retrieved, and the second scarab seal must be activated for the remaining statue of the two.\nWhen speaking to Shalidor, he will mention the sand barriers blocking the two corridors to the left and right. He will say that now that the scarab seals have been activated, the barriers should be lifted and Maleel's generals will be in both corridors. In order to activate the other two statues, the generals must be defeated so that their essences can be used to activate the statues. &lt;a href=\"Rashomta%20the%20Spider\"&gt;Rashomta the Spider&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the passage to the left and will be armed with a bow. Defeating them will grant their essence which can be used on the spider seal. &lt;a href=\"Sahdina%20the%20Scorpion\"&gt;Sahdina the Scorpion&lt;/a&gt; will be found in the passage to the left and will be armed with a bow. Defeating them will grant their essence which can be used on the scorpion seal. Upon activating the last seal, the four statues will concentrate all their essences onto the brazier in the middle.\nThe brazier will then concentrate the light to the fifth statue located on top of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Maleel%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Prince Maleel's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, revealing the key ritual orb. The Vestige will then need to retrieve the key ritual orb from the brazier to enter the tomb. The undead Prince Maleel can be found inside, armed with a sword. After being defeated, the Wabbajack can be found on his body. Haskill will then appear outside the tomb back at the portal.\nTesting the Wabbajack in the Isles.\nOnce the portal is traveled through, Sheogorath can be seen with the floating tomb. He will take the Daedric artifacts, but ask for the Vestige to try out the Wabbajack. Make sure at least one inventory slot is open and ask Sheogorath for the Wabbajack back. Then try out the Wabbajack on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Acolyte\"&gt;Temple Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s in the area. It should be noted that this must be done to acolytes within the given range. Once the Wabbajack has been tested on five acolytes, Sheogorath will ask for the Wabbajack back.\nHe will then allow the Vestige to collect the book and return to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. Once the portal has been entered, the Vestige will end back where they were before entering the Isles. Valaste will take the book and give the Vestige their reward."}

The seemingly innocuous item will be found lying on the floor on its own, although when the Agent touches it a voice will utter:\nThe source of this voice is a &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Seducer\"&gt;Daedra Seducer&lt;/a&gt;, which has appeared in place of the object as the real source of the Evil. The Seducer will offer the Agent the &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; item in return for the Seducer's survival, leaving the Agent with a tough choice.\nRejecting Temptation.\nShould the Agent reject the Seducer's offer, then the latter will become hostile, with its death the only method of destroying the Evil. When first struck the Seducer will shout:\nOnce the daedra, and its randomly spawning minions, have been destroyed, the Agent must escape the dungeon and return to the Missionary before the time limit expires to complete the quest.\nA Successful Seduction.\nShould the Agent instead choose to accept the Seducers offer, the Seducer will disappear, having first given the Agent an item, enchanted with an unknown power. This will effectively end the quest, for the Missionary will not accept the item as evidence of the Evil's destruction. Furthermore, the Temple's God will be aware of the Agent's brief corruption, meaning there will be a severe penalty to their reputation within the Temple.\nRewards.\nThe Agent will receive a random &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; with an equally random, and unknown, &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; if they accept the Seducers offer, at the expense of a severe drop in reputation.

Judge, endure, and reflect. A careless life is not worth living.\" That's all well and good until different-looking folks come along. Then it's time to lie and strut for the commoners.\nLoose Coins: Redoran troops are humorless, but greedy. Offer one enough, and he'd sell you his own mother. Never insult a Redoran to his face. In fact, never insult a Redoran. They have a tendency to hear things in the training yard. If you're going to &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;pick a pocket&lt;/a&gt;, a Redoran is a good target. Just make good your escape, or you'll be meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt; sooner than you planned.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Hlaalu%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Hlaalu&lt;/a&gt;\nYou have to hand it to the Hlaalu. They actually walk the talk when it comes to Pact togetherness. It's not because they suddenly love our ancient enemies and slaves, though. No, Hlaalu's &lt;a href=\"grandmaster\"&gt;grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; is just smarter than most of the rest. An open hand makes it harder to notice the dagger behind your back. Am I right?\nWhile Indoril holds claim to the most powerful positions, Hlaalu has a snake's grip on Deshaan. &lt;a href=\"Narsis%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Narsis&lt;/a&gt; is one of their greatest cities, and even in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, they have a lot of clout. Hlaalu public houses and plantations are everywhere south of Stonefalls. Learn their layouts well. A lot of the builders use the same plans over and over. When you learn the hiding places in one Hlaalu public house, you've learned them all.\nLoose Coins: Hlaalu troops are like kwama queens in Deshaan. Use that against them. Outside Deshaan, Hlaalu housemembers are likely to feel like they're standing in an ashstorm. No matter where you see them, yellow hats make good marks. Take them for all they're worth.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Dres%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Dres&lt;/a&gt;\nYou probably think you know the Dres, right? Heartless slavers with rigid class roles. Arrogant nobles who'd just as soon sell you as look at you.\nYou're pretty much right. \"Don't cross Dres\" is a good bit of coin you can roll around in your head. I can hear you now, though. \"Tel, they have more money than they know what to do with.\" You're right again. Your average Dres noble has enough jewelry on display to tempt even the most seasoned cutpurse.\nRestrain your nimble fingers, friend. Dres justice doesn't bother with &lt;a href=\"Ordinator%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; or local guardsmen. You cross the Dres, you disappear. You're dead or a slave on some noble's plantation.\nLoose Coins: The coins are all tied up in a slavemaster's purse. Don't cross the Dres.\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Telvanni%20%28Online%29\"&gt;House Telvanni&lt;/a&gt;\nThere's only one good thing about this house of mages: they don't give a &lt;a href=\"Guar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;guar&lt;/a&gt; about the Pact. They only care about their sanctuary on the Telvanni coast. When the Pact formed, they got their robes in a twist and tossed out every other house trooper they could find. They're no friends of the lizards or the Nords. They wouldn't walk to the other side of the road to save another house's grandmaster. In short, they're the classic ivory tower wizards.\nEverything else about the brown hats is bad news. They move almost as many slaves as House Dres. To become a noble in House Telvanni, you need serious power. Look at a well-dressed brown hat the wrong way, and they'll melt your face off. They value fabulous magical treasures just as much as books you couldn't trade for a stale loaf of bread.\nLoose Coins: Rampaging &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; couldn't make me assault a mage's tower, but if you're desperate to leave &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, I suggest buying &lt;a href=\"Armor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; enchanted against &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Damage%20%28Online%29\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt;. Then observe the tower as long as you can. If the mark has any magical defenses in place, he'll probably have to come outside to restore them. You might have better luck on the street, but examine your new loot carefully. Some treasures have their own defenses built in."}

I myself commanded the &lt;a href=\"Tenth%20Legion\"&gt;Tenth Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; until I was wounded in &lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;175&lt;/a&gt; during the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the full truth of some events may never be known. I have done my best to fill in the gaps with educated conjectures based on my experience as well as my hard-earned knowledge of the enemy.\nThe Rise of the Thalmor.\nAlthough it is not well known, &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isle\"&gt;Summerset Isle&lt;/a&gt; suffered from the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; as much as Cyrodiil did. The elves made war upon the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; invaders, occasionally even crossing over to close down Oblivion gates. As a nation they had more successes than Cyrodiil did, although the limitless &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; hordes made the outcome a foregone conclusion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; had always been a powerful faction within Summerset Isle, but had also always been a minority voice. During the crisis, the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; was forced to give the Thalmor greater power and authority. Their efforts almost certainly saved Summerset Isle from being overrun. They capitalized on their success to seize total control in &lt;a href=\"4E%2022\"&gt;4E 22&lt;/a&gt;. They renamed the nation &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, which hearkens back to an earlier age before the ascendency of man. Most people outside of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; still call it Summerset Isle, either out of peevishness or ignorance.\nIn &lt;a href=\"4E%2029\"&gt;4E 29&lt;/a&gt;, the government of &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; was overthrown by Thalmor collaborators and a union with Alinor proclaimed. It appears that Thalmor agents had formed close ties to certain Bosmeri factions even before the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire and its &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; allies, caught completely off guard, were quickly defeated by the much-better prepared &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; forces that invaded Valenwood on the heels of the coup. Thus was the Aldmeri Dominion reborn.\nShortly afterward the Aldmeri Dominion severed all contact with the Empire. For seventy years they were silent. Most scholars believe there was some sort of internal strife in Alinor, but very little is known of the factional struggles that went on inside the Dominion while the Thalmor consolidated its power in Summerset and Valenwood.\nIn 4E 98, the two moons, &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Secunda\"&gt;Secunda&lt;/a&gt; vanished. Within most of the Empire, this was viewed with trepidation and fear. In &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt; it was far worse. Culturally the moons are much more influential to the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;. After two years of the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt;, the moons returned. The Thalmor announced that they had restored the moons using previously unknown Dawn Magicks, but it is unclear if they truly restored the moons or just took advantage of foreknowledge that they would return.\nRegardless of the truth of the matter, the Khajiit credited the Thalmor as their saviors. Within fifteen years, Imperial influence in Elsweyr had so diminished that the Empire was unable to respond effectively to the coup of &lt;a href=\"4E%20115\"&gt;4E 115&lt;/a&gt; which dissolved the &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr%20Confederacy\"&gt;Elsweyr Confederacy&lt;/a&gt; and recreated the ancient kingdoms of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Anequina\"&gt;Anequina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pelletine\"&gt;Pelletine&lt;/a&gt; as client states of the Aldmeri Dominion. Once more the Empire failed to stop the advance of power.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Titus%20Mede%20II\"&gt;Titus Mede II&lt;/a&gt; ascended the throne in &lt;a href=\"4E%20168\"&gt;4E 168&lt;/a&gt;, he inherited a weakened empire. The glory days of the Septims were a distant memory. Valenwood and Elsweyr were gone, ceded to the Thalmor enemy. &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; had been lost to Imperial rule since the aftermath of the Oblivion Crisis. &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; had never recovered fully from the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Mount&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. Hammerfell was plagued by infighting between &lt;a href=\"The%20Crowns\"&gt;Crowns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forebears\"&gt;Forebears&lt;/a&gt;. Only &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;, Cyrodiil and &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; remained prosperous and peaceful.\nEmperor Titus Mede had only a few short years to consolidate his rule before his leadership was put to the ultimate test.\nThe War Begins.\nOn the 30th of Frostfall, &lt;a href=\"4E%20171\"&gt;4E 171&lt;/a&gt;, the Aldmeri Dominion sent an ambassador to the Imperial City with a gift in a covered cart and an ultimatum for the new Emperor. The long list of demands included staggering tributes, disbandment of the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;, outlawing the worship of &lt;a href=\"Talos\"&gt;Talos&lt;/a&gt;, and ceding large sections of Hammerfell to the Dominion. Despite the warnings of his generals of the Empire's military weakness, Emperor Titus Mede II rejected the ultimatum. The Thalmor ambassador upended the cart, spilling over a hundred heads on the floor: every blades agent in Summerset and Valenwood. And so began the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt; which would consume the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion for the next five years.\nWithin days, Aldmeri armies invaded Hammerfell and Cyrodiil simultaneously. A strong force commanded by the Thalmor general &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Naarifin\"&gt;Lord Naarifin&lt;/a&gt; attacked Cyrodiil from the south, marching out of hidden camps in northern Elsweyr and flanking the Imperial defenses along the Valenwood border. &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; soon fell to the invaders, while &lt;a href=\"Bravil\"&gt;Bravil&lt;/a&gt; was cut off and besieged.\nAt the same time, an Aldmeri army under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Arannelya\"&gt;Lady Arannelya&lt;/a&gt; crossed into western Cyrodiil from Valenwood, bypassing &lt;a href=\"Anvil\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kvatch\"&gt;Kvatch&lt;/a&gt; and crossing into Hammerfell. Smaller Aldmeri forces landed along the southern coastline of Hammerfell. The disunited Redguard forces offered only scattered resistance to the invaders, and much of the southern coastline was quickly overrun. The greatly outnumbered Imperial legions retreated across the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert\"&gt;Alik'r Desert&lt;/a&gt; in the now-famous &lt;a href=\"March%20of%20Thirst\"&gt;March of Thirst&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20172\"&gt;4E 172&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;173&lt;/a&gt;: The Aldmeri Advance Into Cyrodiil.\nIt appears now that the initial Aldmeri objective was in fact the conquest of Hammerfell, and that the invasion of Cyrodiil was intended only to pin down the imperial legions while Hammerfell was overrun. However, the surprising initial success of Lord Naarifin's attack led the Thalmor to believe that the Empire was weaker than they had thought. The capture of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; itself and the complete overthrow of the Empire thus became their primary objective of the next two years. As we know, the Thalmor nearly achieved their objective. It was only because of our Emperor's determined leadership during the Empire's darkest hour that this disaster was averted.\nDuring 4E 172, the Aldmeri advanced deeper into Cyrodiil. Bravil and Anvil both fell to the invaders. By the end of the year, Lord Naarifin had advanced to the very walls of the Imperial City. There were fierce naval clashes in &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Rumare\"&gt;Lake Rumare&lt;/a&gt; and along the &lt;a href=\"Niben\"&gt;Niben&lt;/a&gt; as the Imperial forces attempted to hold the eastern bank.\nIn Hammerfell, the Thalmor were content to consolidate their gains as they took control of the whole southern coastline, which was in fact their stated objective in the ultimatum delivered to the Emperor. Of the southern cities, only &lt;a href=\"Hegathe\"&gt;Hegathe&lt;/a&gt; still held out. The survivors of the March of Thirst regrouped in northern Hammerfell, joined by reinforcements from High Rock.\nThe year &lt;a href=\"4E%20173\"&gt;4E 173&lt;/a&gt; saw stiffening Imperial resistance in Cyrodiil, but the seemingly inexorable Aldmeri advance continued. Fresh legions from Skyrim bolstered the Emperor's main army in the Imperial City, but the Aldmeri forced the crossing of the Niben and began advancing in force up the eastern bank. By the end of the year, the Imperial City was surrounded on three sides - only the northern supply route to &lt;a href=\"Bruma%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bruma&lt;/a&gt; remained open.\nIn Hammerfell, Imperial fortunes took a turn for the better. In early 4E 173, a Forebear army from &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; broke the siege of Hegathe (a Crown city), leading to the reconciliation of the two factions. Despite this, Lady Arannelya's main army succeeded in crossing the Alik'r Desert. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial Legion&lt;/a&gt;s under &lt;a href=\"General%20Decianus\"&gt;General Decianus&lt;/a&gt; met them outside &lt;a href=\"Skaven\"&gt;Skaven&lt;/a&gt; in a bloody and indecisive clash. Decianus withdrew and left Arannelya in possession of Skaven, but the Aldmeri were too weakened to continue their advance.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20174\"&gt;4E 174&lt;/a&gt;: The Sack of the Imperial City.\nIn 4E 174, the Thalmor leadership committed all available forces to the campaign in Cyrodiil, gambling on a decisive victory to end the war once and for all. During the spring, Aldmeri reinforcements gathered in southern Cyrodiil, and on 12th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, they launched a massive assault on the Imperial City itself. One army drove north to completely surround the city, while Lord Naarifin's main force attacked the walls from the south, east, and west. The Emperor's decision to fight his way out of the city rather than make a last stand was a bold one. No general dared advise him to abandon the capital, but Titus II was proven right in the end.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"Eighth%20Legion\"&gt;Eighth Legion&lt;/a&gt; fought a desperate (and doomed) rearguard action on the walls of the city, Titus II broke out of the city to the north with his main army, smashing through the surrounding forces and linking up with reinforcements marching south from Skyrim under &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, however, the capital fell to the invaders and the infamous Sack of the Imperial City began. The &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt; was burned, the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt; itself looted, and all manner of atrocities carried out by the vengeful elves on the innocent populace.\nIn Hammerfell, General Decianus was preparing to drive the Aldmeri back from Skaven when he was ordered to march for Cyrodiil. Unwilling to abandon Hammerfell completely, he allowed a great number of \"invalids\" to be discharged from the Legions before they marched east. These veterans formed the core of the army that eventually drove Lady Arannelya's forces back across the Alik'r late in 174, taking heavy losses on their retreat from harassing attacks by the Alik'r warriors.\n&lt;a href=\"4E%20175\"&gt;4E 175&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Red%20Ring\"&gt;Battle of the Red Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the winter of 4E 174-175, the Thalmor seem to have believed that the war in Cyrodiil was all but over. They made several attempts to negotiate with Titus II. The Emperor encouraged them in their belief that he was preparing to surrender; meanwhile, he gathered his forces to retake the Imperial City.\nIn what is now known as the Battle of the Red Ring, a battle that will serve as a model for Imperial strategists for generations to come, Titus II divided his forces into three. One army, with the legions from Hammerfell under General Decianus, was hidden in the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20Highlands\"&gt;Colovian Highlands&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Chorrol\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;. The Aldmeri were unaware that he was no longer in Hammerfell, possibly because the Imperial veterans Decianus had left behind led Lady Arannelya to believe that she still faced an Imperial army. The second army, largely of &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; legions under &lt;a href=\"General%20Jonna\"&gt;General Jonna&lt;/a&gt;, took up position near &lt;a href=\"Cheydinhal%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Cheydinhal&lt;/a&gt;. The main army was commanded by the Emperor himself, and would undertake the main assault of the Imperial City from the north.\nOn the 30th of &lt;a href=\"Rain%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Rain's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the bloody Battle of the Red Ring began as General Decianus swept down on the city from the west, while General Jonna's legionnaires drove south along the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Ring%20Road\"&gt;Red Ring Road&lt;/a&gt;. In a two-day assault, Jonna's army crossed the Niben and advanced west, attempting to link up with Decianus's legions and thus surround the Imperial City. Lord Naarifin was taken by surprise by Decianus's assault, but Jonna's troops faced bitter resistance as the Aldmeri counterattacked from Bravil and &lt;a href=\"Skingrad\"&gt;Skingrad&lt;/a&gt;. The heroic Nord legionnaires held firm, however, beating off the piecemeal Aldmeri attacks. By the fifth day of the battle, the Aldmeri army in the Imperial City was surrounded.\nTitus II led the assault from the north, personally capturing Lord Naarifin. It is rumored the Emperor wielded the famed sword &lt;a href=\"Goldbrand\"&gt;Goldbrand&lt;/a&gt;, although this has never been officially confirmed by the Imperial government. An attempt by the Aldmeri to break out of the city to the south was blocked by the unbreakable shieldwall of General Jonna's battered legions.\nIn the end, the main Aldmeri army in Cyrodiil was completely destroyed. The Emperor's decision to withdraw from the Imperial City in 4E 174 was bloodily vindicated.\nLord Naarifin was kept alive for thirty-three days, hanging from the White-Gold tower. It is not recorded where his body was buried, if it was buried at all. One source claims he was carried off by a winged &lt;a href=\"daedra\"&gt;daedra&lt;/a&gt; on the thirty-fourth day.\nThe &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; and the End of the War.\nAlthough victorious, the Imperial armies were in no shape to continue the war. The entire remaining Imperial force was gathered in Cyrodiil, exhausted and decimated by the Battle of the Red Ring. Not a single legion had more than half its soldiers fit for duty. Two legions had been effectively annihilated, not counting the loss of the Eighth during the retreat from the Imperial City the previous year. Titus II knew that there would be no better time to negotiate peace, and late in 4E 175 the Empire and the Aldmeri Dominion signed the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt;, ending the Great War.\nThe terms were harsh, but Titus II believed that it was necessary to secure peace and give the Empire a chance to regain its strength. The two most controversial terms of the Concordat were the banning of the worship of Talos and the cession of a large section of southern Hammerfell (most of what was already occupied by Aldmeri forces). Critics have pointed out that the Concordat is almost identical to the ultimatum the Emperor rejected five years earlier. However, there is a great difference between agreeing to such terms under the mere threat of war, and agreeing to them at the end of a long and destructive war. No part of the Empire would have accepted these terms in 4E 171, dictated by the Thalmor at swords-point. Titus II would have faced civil war. By 4E 175, most of the Empire welcomed peace at almost any price.\nEpilogue: Hammerfell Fights On Alone.\nHammerfell, however, refused to accept the White-Gold Concordat, being unwilling to concede defeat and the loss of so much of their territory. Titus II was forced to officially renounce Hammerfell as an Imperial province in order to preserve the hard-won peace treaty. The &lt;a href=\"Redguards\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt;, understandably, looked on this as a betrayal. In this, the Thalmor certainly achieved one of their long-term goals by sowing lasting bitterness between Hammerfell and the Empire.\nIn the end, the heroic Redguards fought the Aldmeri Dominion to a standstill, although the war lasted for five more years and left southern Hammerfell devastated. The Redguards say that this proves that the White-Gold Concordat was unnecessary, and that if Titus II had kept his nerve, the Aldmeri could have been truly defeated by the combined forces of Hammerfell and the rest of the Empire. The truth of that assertion can, of course, never be known. But the Redguards should not forget the great sacrifice of Imperial blood - &lt;a href=\"Breton\"&gt;Breton&lt;/a&gt;, Nord, and &lt;a href=\"Imperial\"&gt;Cyrodilic&lt;/a&gt; - at the Battle of the Red Ring that weakened the Dominion enough to allow the eventual &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%20180\"&gt;4E 180&lt;/a&gt; and the withdrawal of Aldmeri forces from Hammerfell.\nThere can be no doubt that the current peace cannot last forever. The Thalmor take the long view, as is proved by the sequence of events leading up to the Great War. All those who value freedom over tyranny can only hope that before it is too late, Hammerfell and the Empire will be reconciled and stand united against the Thalmor threat. Otherwise, any hope to stem the tide of Thalmor rule over all of Tamriel is dimmed."}

Do not harm the forest. Do not eat anything made from plant life. Eat only meat. When you conquer your enemies, eat their flesh. Do not leave them to rot. Do not kill wastefully. Do not take on the shape of beasts. You are Wood Elves. Your form is sacred.\nThis is the Green Pact. In exchange for keeping to this Pact, the forest, which we call the Green, has provided us with ample food and shelter. Y'ffre has given us the limited gift to ask the forest to shape itself to our needs. We have been amply blessed.\nBut now, we find ourselves in a new situation. Our new allies\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;High Elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;\u2014do not hold to the Green Pact. They live in houses made of thatch and timber. They eat all manner of fruits and berries and drink wine made from grapes. They find the devouring of one's enemies barbaric.\nHow are the Wood Elves of Valenwood to accommodate these new allies, while keeping to the Green Pact? It is a question that perplexes many Wood Elves today, especially in the newly-erected city of &lt;a href=\"Marbruk%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt;. In the past, we have fought wars over lesser defilement of the Green.\nAt the same time, we recognize that at the time of the Dominion's founding, &lt;a href=\"The%20Green%20Lady\"&gt;The Green Lady&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28Title%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt; spoke on behalf of the Wood Elves and the Green Pact. We remember that we have a powerful mouthpiece in the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Woodhearth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Woodhearth's&lt;/a&gt; own &lt;a href=\"Treethane%20Fariel\"&gt;Treethane Fariel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese are the leaders we should look to in this uncertain time. They have shown us through their actions an example which we can all follow. We must welcome these allies with true Wood Elf hospitality. We must not pick fights with them. We must try not to steal from them (many of them do not appreciate the rite of theft, but that is a subject for another essay). But at the same time, we should not shy away from speaking out in our own interests, and in that of the Green.\nBecause of Treethane Fariel's powerful voice, much of the timber and all of the thatch for Marbruk was brought into Valenwood from other parts. For many the fact that so many trees had to be felled to clear space for the city is unforgiveable [sic], but Fariel saw that accommodating our allies is the first step to a strong defense of Valenwood against those who would surely destroy it.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt;'s willingness to listen is a sign of her wisdom and respect for the Wood Elf people. We should repay her by being willing to trust her leadership."}

After entering through a wooden door, the Hero must defeat two bandits blocking the way, as well as a skeever in the following room. In the next area, a mercenary is blocking the path, and has to be killed to advance further.\nOn each side of the mercenary, two townsfolk are held in cages. Rescuing them results in the following dialogue:\n\"I can't wait to get out of here!\"\n\"Don't forget Saashi, the town's loremaster. Last I saw her she was with their leader... Here. I managed to steal this key from a drunken bandit. Maybe it'll help.\"\nThe second townsfolk provides a key required to advance to the next area, where yet another three bandits are found. In order to advance to the final room, a lever must be pulled. Saashi, the town\u2019s loremaster, is kept in a cage protected by a mercenary who has to be killed. In this same room, the secret area can be found by pulling a chain attached to a pillar. In the secret room, a skeever must be killed."}

{"id": "224609", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=224609", "title": "The Greybeards", "text": "The Greybeards are an ancient and honored order that dwell in their mountain sanctuary &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt;, which is located on the highest mountain peak in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World\"&gt;Throat of the World&lt;/a&gt;. As masters of &lt;a href=\"Thu%27um\"&gt;Thu'um&lt;/a&gt;, or \"the Voice,\" they live in absolute silence in order to better attune themselves to the voice of the sky. They are a peaceful order, not using their Thu'um to augment their martial skills, but to worship and honor the gods, as the \"&lt;a href=\"Way%20of%20the%20Voice\"&gt;Way of the Voice&lt;/a&gt;\" decreed.\nWhen the Greybeards speak, storms brew above High Hrothgar, and people are forced to evacuate due to the imminent danger of avalanches. When they even so much as whisper the word \"\"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dovahkiin&lt;/a&gt;,\"\" it rumbles through the world, and the mountains shake. Such is their power, the last time that they spoke was when they announced the greatness of &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Greybeards were founded by a powerful &lt;a href=\"Tongue\"&gt;Tongue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. After he suffered a disastrous defeat at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where his army was annihilated, he spent seven years pondering the meaning of his defeat. He finally concluded that the gods had punished the Nords for their arrogant and blasphemous misuse of the Thu'um.\nFollowing this revelation, Jurgen developed a pacifist creed called the \"Way of the Voice\" that thought that the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods, rather than military exploits. He built High Hrothgar, located near the peak of the Throat of the World in &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, which served as the monastery where he and his disciples meditated and perfected their voice.\nIt is unclear exactly when in the First Era that the Greybeards were formed, as the exact time of Jurgen Windcaller's seven-year meditation is not known. It occurred after a momentous defeat at Red Mountain, and the most well-known defeat of the Nordic forces at Red Mountain was the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Battle of Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, circa 1E 700. However, the Nords had been driven out of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of years earlier, around 1E 416, and the \"&lt;a href=\"Five%20Songs%20of%20King%20Wulfharth\"&gt;Five Songs of King Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;\" suggests that the Greybeards were already in existence before &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;'s first death in 1E 533.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; the Greybeards were silent for years until they spoke a name; &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt;, who was called to &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; to be blessed and named Dovahkiin. It was also during this time that Tiber Septim learned that he was destined to become Emperor of Tamriel.\nBy the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, there are only five members of the Greybeards. Four of the monks live in High Hrothgar. Their grandmaster, Paarthurnax, resides higher up on the Throat of the World in constant meditation. The leader of the Stormcloak rebellion, &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;, was once a student, learning the ways of the Thu'um.\nInteractions.\n&lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Main quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Greybeards are featured prominently in the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Quest%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt;. When the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Rising\"&gt;Dragon Rising&lt;/a&gt;\" is completed, they call out for the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;, summoning them so that they may meet and test them. They also help the Dragonborn understand the unique &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt; they wield. They do meet and test the Dovahkiin, then they give some training. Upon arrival, the Dovahkiin must prove they are Dragonborn by demonstrating the power of the Thu'um. They teach a couple of shouts and then, for the final test, they send the Dragonborn on a quest to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Jurgen%20Windcaller\"&gt;Horn of Jurgen Windcaller&lt;/a&gt;.\nWords of Power.\nArngeir will reveal the locations of &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Word Walls&lt;/a&gt; throughout Skyrim to the Dovahkiin if they favor the Greybeards, as opposed to the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt;. He mentions how the Dragonborn arrives, at this certain moment in time, at the turning of the age. If asked if it is a coincidence that they were brought here at the time of the dragons returning, he states that it is not a coincidence.\nCombat.\nUpon attacking a member of the Greybeards, they respond with the &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Form\"&gt;Ice Form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; to paralyze the attacker, as well as utilizing a plethora of other shouts and &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Tomes%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spells&lt;/a&gt;. Unsuccessful &lt;a href=\"pickpocket\"&gt;pickpocket&lt;/a&gt; attempts cause them to attack as well.\nThe Greybeards do not wield weapons and may engage in unarmed combat when foes reach melee range. Weapons dropped near the Greybeards may be picked up and used by them.\nFlagged as &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential&lt;/a&gt;, it is only possible to reduce their &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; to a low level. After this, they crouch down until their health regenerates and resume battle with their attacker. Knocking a Greybeard off the mountain using &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; or Vampiric Grip will result in them respawning in the monastery or courtyard in a short time.\nIf a &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; appears near High Hrothgar, a Greybeard may attack it only if they are outside. Should this occur, other Greybeards emerge from &lt;a href=\"High%20Hrothgar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;High Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; to assist in the battle.\nThe Greybeards will also initiate combat with the Dragonborn or follower if they are caught stealing in High Hrothgar."}

It takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, in the town of &lt;a href=\"Southpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"Southpoint's citizens are killing one another in the streets. Dominion soldiers cordoned off the town, but are in dire need of assistance.\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Soldier%20Garion\"&gt;Soldier Garion&lt;/a&gt; warns the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to stay away from Southpoint for their own safety, claiming the citizens are killing each other in the streets. The Vestige is then sent to speak with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Elonthor\"&gt;Captain Elonthor&lt;/a&gt; outside the town since he may need help evacuating the survivors. \nCaptain Elonthor informs the Vestige that he has no idea what is happening in Southpoint and he has lost three scouts sent in to investigate the situation. The disappearance of the scouts means he cannot call for reinforcements. When the Vestige offers to find out what happened to the scouts, Captain Elonthor directs them to a citizen who had previously offered to do the same thing. \nThe citizen in question is &lt;a href=\"Daraneth\"&gt;Daraneth&lt;/a&gt;, who has taken shelter in one of the tents. Daraneth informs the Vestige that she believes Sheogorath is behind the madness that has \"swept through Southpoint like a plague.\" However, Daraneth seems rather excited about this. She suggests going to find the scouts with the Vestige as a way of showing her concern for her home. \nAfter searching through Southpoint together, the Vestige and Daraneth enter &lt;a href=\"Pixot%27s%20House\"&gt;Pixot's House&lt;/a&gt; to discover &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Hervarion\"&gt;Lieutenant Hervarion&lt;/a&gt; tied up in a corner. Hervarion claims the mayor said they couldn't eat him until it's time for dinner. Once the Vestige reveals they have come to help him, not eat him, Hervarion is relieved. \nHe claims his decision to press on rather then hastily return to Captain Elonthor with a report has led his scouts, whom were brought before the mayor by the mad townsfolk, to be turned into bears. The mayor didn't turn Hervarion out of a desire to let the townsfolk eat him instead. \nHervarion informs the Vestige that the mayor has locked himself in the big cathedral with the doors sealed by magic. Afterwards, the Vestige frees Hervarion of his bindings so he can report back to Captain Elonthor. \nDaraneth recounts the various things they've learned from the scout and says she should be horrified but she still finds it all exciting. In order to rescue the scouts turned into bears, Daraneth believes she possesses the ability to reverse the magic done on them but requires the Vestige to act as bait. As for the mayor, she claims to have a scroll in the basement of her laboratory that can unlock the doors. \nThe Vestige tracks down the two bears and attacks each one while Daraneth casts the spell to restore them back to normal. Upon recovery, each scout will flee Southpoint to return to Captain Elonthor. Soon after, a storm erupts and Daraneth recommends visiting her laboratory.\nWith the storm and the lightning blocking their way, the laboratory cannot be entered. Daraneth deduces whoever conjured the storm must be located somewhere they could see everything in Southpoint. She suggests visiting an old Colovian tower nearby. \nAt the top of the Colovian tower, the Vestige discovers &lt;a href=\"Rufinus\"&gt;Rufinus&lt;/a&gt;, who admits to being the cause of the lightning. He is acting out of revenge against the townsfolk for calling him \"an angry drunk,\" and he threatens to attack the Vestige if they don't walk away. The Vestige has no choice but to knock Rufinus off the ledge he is standing on in order to end the storm he has conjured. \nWith the storm gone, the Vestige and Daraneth enter the basement of Daraneth's laboratory and retrieve the old scroll. They proceed to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20the%20Golden%20Path\"&gt;Cathedral of the Golden Path&lt;/a&gt; and use the scroll to undo the magic keeping the doors locked. Inside, they find &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Aulus\"&gt;Mayor Aulus&lt;/a&gt; on his own. Daraneth offers to speak to the mayor to try and talk some sense into him. \nMayor Aulus is delighted to see Daraneth and confesses Sheogorath had promised him power and the respect he deserved but instead cursed his tongue with madness and left him to make a mess of the town. Daraneth responds by calling Mayor Aulus pitiful, even for a mortal. To the mayor's horror, Daraneth transforms into Sheogorath himself. \nMayor Aulus apologizes to Sheogorath, thinking the Madgod had abandoned him. Sheogorath points out he had cursed the mayor's tongue to drive people mad but if he doesn't like his tongue, Sheogorath can take it from him and give it to his new favorite pet. Mayor Aulus is distraught over not being Sheogorath's favorite, after all the screams he caused in the Madgod's name. Sheogorath ultimately relents to Mayor Aulus's pleas. \nSheogorath then turns his attention to the Vestige and uses his magic to painfully transport them to the basement of the cathedral. The Vestige wakes up to find the real Daraneth with them in a cell. It turns out Sheogorath had possessed Daraneth the entire time, controlling her body while she was still conscious. She remembers visiting her laboratory and discovering Sheogorath already there. He began to dance and so did she, and then she blacked out. Sheogorath had possessed her from then onwards.\nDaraneth believes the only way to save the town and end the madness is to kill Mayor Aulus. Unfortunately, the bars to their cell seem unbreakable and Mayor Aulus has somehow bound Daraneth's magic. The only hope is to fight their way out when someone comes for them. \nSheogorath materializes outside the cell soon after. He recognizes the Vestige from the time they went hunting for books for &lt;a href=\"Arch-Mage%20Shalidor\"&gt;Arch-Mage Shalidor&lt;/a&gt;. Sheogorath admits to being disappointed in Mayor Aulus, especially after the mayor failed to destroy the hero he had brought along (referring to the Vestige.) As a result, Sheogorath wants the Vestige to kill Mayor Aulus. In exchange, Sheogorath will leave Southpoint forever. However, if the Vestige disappoints Sheogorath, Sheogorath will turn Daraneth into a goose. \nWith Daraneth forced to stay behind, the Vestige exits the cell and makes their way through the catacombs. Once they arrive at a drop-bridge, Sheogorath appears and raises the bridge, blocking their path. Sheogorath reveals he had done this to make the whole journey more challenging and turn the Vestige into a \"proper hero.\" \nThe Vestige must fight their way through more enemies as they try to locate the lever. Once they've succeeded, Sheogorath appears by the bridge again and raises it once more. Sheogorath reveals he wants the Vestige to fight a friend of his called \"Free Will\" or they'll be forced to pull another lever. By slaying Free Will, the Vestige can now enter the cathedral and confront Mayor Aulus.\nInside the cathedral, Sheogorath and Mayor Aulus have a brief exchange, during which Sheogorath laughs about watching the mayor die horribly. He also complains about the mayor's lack of a backbone. Mayor Aulus tries to reason with the Vestige, claiming he didn't want any of this and hopes to avoid death for it. Mayor Aulus further claims the Vestige has a choice not to kill him, unlike himself, who had no choice in harassing the townsfolk. He complains the townsfolk did not respect him and did not bow down to him even though his family had ruled Southpoint for generations. \nAfter the conversation, the Vestige fights and kills Mayor Aulus. Sheogorath congratulates them and remains true to their deal. After he rewards the Vestige, Sheogorath disappears from the cathedral."}

Within the wild, these beasts are deadly. Dangerous. They'd eat you sooner than look at you. There's many trainers in &lt;a href=\"Sunhold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sunhold&lt;/a&gt; who can attest to that. Even the chicks are known to peck off a finger or two, if you're not careful.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Welkynar\"&gt;Welkynar&lt;/a&gt;, you'll be expected to raise your gryphon from the time it hatches to the day it dies. Or you die, of course, given our line of work. This starts off by collecting an egg. Yes, you collect the egg, so don't expect to be handed one your first day. And I suggest you don't go killing the gryphon mother, either. It's hard to be bonded to a creature you've brutally orphaned. Trust me on that.\nOnce your chick has hatched, the bonding process can begin. You'll immediately begin to undergo magical rituals to create a bond. But other than that, your relationship must grow from familiarity. You'll feed, clean, and care for this chick. Expect a lot of pecks, scratches, and sleepless nights.\nOnce the bonding process has been complete, your gryphon will be trained to fight by your side. This gryphon will be your steed, protector, and steadfast friend. Their training will be just as stringent and hard as yours. And, by the end of it, the creature will become a soldier finer than most.\nNow remember, this isn't a commitment to be taken lightly. The bond you form with your gryphon will be unlike anything you've experienced. Rather than a mere companion, your gryphon shall become an extension of your very self. Your thoughts, your feelings, your needs, everything will be connected.\nShould you successfully accomplish this responsibility, you'll be welcomed within the ranks of the Welkynars. An honor that will change your entire course of life. So choose your egg wisely, candidate."}

He described an age long ago when dragons ruled over the whole world and were worshipped as gods by men. Presiding over this cult of dragon-worshippers were the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dragon Priests&lt;/a&gt;, powerful mages who could speak the dragon language and call upon the power of the thu'um, or Voice.\nAccording to the legend, one such Dragon Priest was seduced by a dark spirit named &lt;a href=\"Herma-Mora\"&gt;Herma-Mora&lt;/a&gt;, an unmistakable analogue for the Daedric prince Hermaeus Mora. Lured by promises of power, this treacherous priest secretly plotted against his dragon master.\n&lt;a href=\"Miraak\"&gt;The Traitor&lt;/a&gt;'s plot was discovered by one of his contemporaries, another Dragon Priest whom legend named &lt;a href=\"Vahlok%20the%20Jailor\"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. The two fought a mighty battle that lasted for days, each hurling terrible arcane energies and thu'um shouts at the other.\nSo great and terrible were the forces unleashed in this contest that Solstheim was torn apart from the mainland of Skyrim. Here, the myth clearly descends into the realm of pure fantasy.\nThe Guardian, whom the legend presents as a paragon of loyalty and nobility, finally defeats the despicable Traitor, who seems to represent all that is corrupt and evil in men. Their epic duel is clearly representative of a greater struggle between good and evil. Perhaps it is this timeless quality that has kept the tale alive for so long.\nUnlike many similar myths, the tale of the Guardian and the Traitor does not feature a suitably heroic ending. Herma-Mora snatches the Traitor away just as the Guardian is about to strike the killing blow.\nThe dragons appoint the Guardian ruler of Solstheim, but not before he is compelled to swear an oath of vigilance to watch for the Traitor's return. His reign is, by all accounts, a time of peace and prosperity for the people of the island, and he is remembered as a wise and just leader.\nNo further mention is made of the Traitor, but neither is he thought to be dead. The legend ends on a cautionary note that the people of Solstheim, the heirs of the Guardian, must remain wary, lest the dark influence of Herma-Mora, or even the Traitor himself, return someday.\nAlthough no physical clues exist now on Solstheim to suggest the presence of the dragon cult, is it hardly difficult to believe that it might once have flourished here. Perhaps some hidden tomb still waits to be discovered that will tell the truth of the tale.\nThere are other tantalizing clues, though perhaps these connections strain the bonds of credibility. For example, is it possible that the Skaal deity, the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt;, is some distant echo of mighty &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt;, the World-Eater of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Nordic%20Pantheon\"&gt;ancient Nord pantheon&lt;/a&gt;?\nPerhaps not, but one thing is certain: Solstheim's history is riddled with unanswered questions. Perhaps future generations will pull aside the veils of mystery and reveal the truth about the origins of the Skaal and the identities of the Guardian and the Traitor."}

The Halls overlooks an area called the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Divide\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt;, which runs along the southern coast of Tamriel, ideally the &lt;a href=\"Quin%27rawl%20Peninsula\"&gt;Quin'rawl Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. Considering the people that created it, the Halls of Colossus is a large fortress with sprawling walls and tall towers. The nearest city-state to the Halls is &lt;a href=\"Torval\"&gt;Torval&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Senchal\"&gt;Senchal&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Khajiiti\"&gt;Khajiiti&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Khunzar-ri\"&gt;Khunzar-ri&lt;/a&gt; tricked a band of &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kaalgrontiid\"&gt;Kaalgrontiid&lt;/a&gt; into the Halls of Colossus, after convincing them a portion of their lost power resides there. He then proceeded to lock them all within the Halls The dragons remained locked inside the Halls by a relic known as the &lt;a href=\"Wrathstone\"&gt;Wrathstone&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeking a means to end the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Abnur%20Tharn\"&gt;Abnur Tharn&lt;/a&gt; sought to recover a supposed \"demon weapon\" from the Halls of Colossus. At the same time, Abnur's half-sister &lt;a href=\"Euraxia%20Tharn\"&gt;Euraxia Tharn&lt;/a&gt;, also sought out the weapon to advance her goals in Elsweyr. Abnur Tharn traveled to the Halls alongside &lt;a href=\"Khamira\"&gt;Khamira&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; to stop Euraxia's forces from obtaining the weapon, but the Euraxians reached the Halls before them. Noticing the dragon imagery found throughout the Halls and bas reliefs that depicted the story of Khunzar-ri led Khamira to realize that the demon weapon is in fact the imprisoned dragons. After dispatching of the Euraxians Abnur Tharn attempted to use the Wrathstone to restore the barrier that kept the dragons locked, which the Euraxians attempted to destroy, however, bringing the Wrathstone to the Halls of Colosus already set the release of the dragons into motion and Abnur accidentally released them from their prison into Elsweyr.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; had fought against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Elves\"&gt;Dark Elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;, he signed the &lt;a href=\"Treaty%20of%20the%20Armistice\"&gt;Treaty of the Armistice&lt;/a&gt;, which officially made Morrowind a province of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Empire\"&gt;Third Empire&lt;/a&gt;. As a peace reward, &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal\"&gt;Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; had given Tiber Septim possession of the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, the Brass-God of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarves\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Numidium proved valuable to the Emperor, using the Halls of Colossus as a testing ground for the mechanical god. Tiber Septim was impressed with the results, using Numidium in his conquest against the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, where the Brass-God was used in destroying &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, the capital of the province.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Simulacrum\"&gt;Imperial Simulacrum&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"3E%20389\"&gt;3E 389&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"3E%20399\"&gt;3E 399&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Uriel%20Septim%20VII\"&gt;Uriel Septim VII&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned along with &lt;a href=\"Talin%20Warhaft\"&gt;Talin Warhaft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jagar%20Tharn\"&gt;Jagar Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. Tharn planned for months to capture the throne, and he was able to achieve so in the span of ten years. Tharn had a powerful weapon called the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Staff of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;, and he split it into nine pieces and scattered them across Tamriel, the staff was the only thing keeping Uriel Septim and Warhaft in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. A warrior escaped his clutches and traveled all corners of Tamriel to retrieve the missing pieces. The hero was known as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Champion\"&gt;Eternal Champion&lt;/a&gt;, and he assembled the staff and defeated Jagar Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Palace\"&gt;Imperial Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The Eternal Champion had at one point visited the Halls of Colossus in their quest to recover the pieces.\nThe Eternal Champion had retrieved the third piece of the staff from the forests of the &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Grove\"&gt;Elden Grove&lt;/a&gt;, continuing their quest throughout Tamriel. In their sleep, &lt;a href=\"Ria%20Silmane\"&gt;Ria Silmane&lt;/a&gt; came to the warrior through a dream, telling them where the next piece is, which was the Halls of Colossus in Elsweyr. The Champion had then traveled to the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Corinthe\"&gt;Corinthe&lt;/a&gt;, to get an idea on the Halls of Colossus' location, and was directed to &lt;a href=\"Turamane%20ap%27Kolthis\"&gt;Turamane ap'Kolthis&lt;/a&gt;, the Guildmaster of the &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt;. Before they were given the whereabouts of the Halls of Colossus, the mage gave the Champion a proposition, if they defeated the warriors from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Agamanus%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Temple of Agamanus&lt;/a&gt;, then he will give them what they need. And so, the Champion was able to get the coordinates for the Halls of Colossus and retrieve the fourth piece of the Staff of Chaos. The Champion would then set their sites for the province of the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt;."}

The First Level is composed by tens of complex corridors in which many creatures roam. There are six doors leading to the Second Level, however to reach the Third Level it is necessary to obtain seven keys which are scattered around the First Level: the Gold Key, Iron Key, Sapphire Key, Ruby Key, two Amethyst Keys, and the Diamond Key.\nHowever, it is possible to skip this part of the quest by using the spell Passwall to bypass the six doors of the Second Level or by using the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; to open the doors.\nThe main objective is to encounter and take the seven keys needed to open the doors to the Third Level. One key is immediately to the left of the entrance (\"north of the map\") behind a hidden door. Another key on a room in the front of the main entrance. On the center of the ruins a key remains close to a lake, surrounded by unbreakable walls. Southeast of the map, a key remains surrounded by more unbreakable walls guarded by &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20%28Arena%29\"&gt;Zombies&lt;/a&gt;. On the southwest of the map, a solitary key is stored on a little room which can be accessed easily by swimming. Two keys are located on the northwest, one guarded in a little room and another behind an abyss. It is necessary to use the Second Level's doors to explore the ruins without using Passwall (\"the map on the right is extremely useful for orientation\").\nThe Second Level is full of Rats, however at this point these creatures should not represent any danger. Once all the keys are obtained, it is possible to open the six doors of the Second Level and reach the last area.\nThe Third Level is small, but it is also the most dangerous. Upon entering, a locked door will request the remaining key. The next door will give a riddle to be solved:\n\"\"I am the architect of this hell,\"\n\"whose name is forgot in the dust of time.\"\n\"Yet, where there is no dust,\"\n\"where the river would speak\"\n\"there is my name.\"\n\"\"Find this place and then return,\"\n\"to tell me my name.\"\n\"Only then shall you pass this door.\"\n\"What is my name?\"\nA tribute to the architect is found on the southeast area of the First Level, protected by unbreakable walls and only reachable by water.

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with finding her and returning her to the stronghold. \nBackground.\n\"All is not right in Morkul Stronghold. Ashaka, the chief's eldest daughter, ran off to Morkul Descent without explanation.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhile visiting &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Stronghold\"&gt;Morkul Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, the Vestige may be approached by by Lazghal, who has the following to say to them:\n\"Children. Never have them!\"\nThe Vestige has to travel to Morkhul Descent, which is a little ways up the northern, mountainous area of &lt;a href=\"Wrothgar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wrothgar&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, they must enter through the wooden doorway and enter the cavern. Following the icy pathway deeper into the cavern will eventually lead the Vestige to Ashaka. She will be standing infront of several &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; ceremonial structures, claiming to be searching for the Hand of Morkul. The Hand is located in Morkuldin, the ancient home of the Morkul Clan, hidden deep underground. The way to Morkuldin, however, is blocked by a puzzle consisting of several statues. The Vestige will have to light beacons infront of every statue in a particular order in order to open the door to Morkuldin. The order is (starting from Ashaka's position): \nThe beacons will now turn blue and the way to Morkuldin is open. While exploring Morkuldin with Ashaka, the Vestige will eventually stumble upon a gigantic forge. Within it, the Hand of Morkul. But, the artifact appears to be trapped there and cannot be retrieved. Talking to Ashaka will reveal the following:\n\"The Hand of Morkul is held in something called the... I think it said \"heart-forge?\" Also, um... \"endless breath and untold rage lets purest heart release the hand.\" Huh. Poets.\"\nAll right. What should I do if I find them? \"Morkul clan prefers simple solutions that last. Look for switches or some kind of mechanism. We'll see what happens when you set things in motion. Oh, and stay alert. My ancestors wouldn't leave this place completely unguarded.\"\nThe Vestige will now have to find both a blast furnace and the bellows of the forge. Traveling further down into the abandoned ruins will reveal that they are not, in fact, as abandoned as they appear and the Vestige will be attacked by several groups of &lt;a href=\"Morkuldin%20Guardian\"&gt;Morkuldin Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and some &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Online%29\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating them, they must activate the furnace and bellows and return to Ashaka who is now able to retrieve the hammer. Speaking to her, however, will reveal that the hammer is not, in fact, the \"forge-hammer\". The cage around it is. The ancient Morkuldin word for \"heart\" also means \"blood,\" which means that the forge isn't a heart-forge but a blood-forge. Ashaka is shocked to find that her ancestors fed the forge with the blood of their enemies, and explains the ancient poems she referenced earlier weren't talking about the honor the Morkuldin clan lost when they left Morkuldin\u2014it was about the honor they gained when they buried their greatest shame beneath the ice. Either way, Ashaka decides to return the hammer to her clan. Vowing to use the forge in an honorable way from now on, as the forge doesn't actually require the \"blood of our enemies\", any type of blood will do. Like that of spiders. \nReturning to the &lt;a href=\"Morkul%20Stronghold\"&gt;Morkul Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, listening to Ashaka's speech and speaking to her will render the quest complete. The Vestige may now receive their reward."}

Progressing through the forest path, the Fugitive will encounter a &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Forest%20Spider\"&gt;Giant Forest Spider&lt;/a&gt; as well as several &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Spider\"&gt;Forest Spider&lt;/a&gt;s that may attack simultaneously. Further down the path, two &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Wolf\"&gt;Dire Wolves&lt;/a&gt; will be encountered and may also attack the Fugitive simultaneously if close enough together.\nAt the end of the path will be a cave with a &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20Wight\"&gt;Crypt Wight&lt;/a&gt; guarding the entrance. The cave will quickly lead into an open area of the ruined fort, Drachurst Keep, in which an &lt;a href=\"Outcast\"&gt;Outcast&lt;/a&gt; and another Crypt Wight will be found. Throughout the fort, there are many urns that can be broken for various loot as well as loose crafting materials, particularly &lt;a href=\"Lumber\"&gt;Lumber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Salts%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Void Salts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Salts%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fire Salts&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Salts%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Frost Salts&lt;/a&gt;. To the right is a lowered gate that may be opened with a lever directly next to it. The hallway past the gate will lead to another open area with a Crypt Wight, a gate to the left, and a door to the right.\nThe doorway will lead down a set of stairs directly to a room with two Outcasts. To the left walking into the room from the stairs is a weapon rack that may be activated. Doing so will reveal a hidden room, the quest's only secret, containing a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Chest\"&gt;Silver Chest&lt;/a&gt;. To the right of the room, opposite the secret passage is a breakable urn with better-than-average loot. Returning to the open room with the gate will lead further into the keep where several more Outcasts and Crypt Wights, as well as &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Skeever\"&gt;Giant Skeever&lt;/a&gt;s will be encountered. Eventually, a door will be reached leading into the main chamber were Celemaril is with the Elder Scroll.\nDecending down the stairs will lead directly to Celemaril. He must be fought and defeated to claim the Elder Scroll. He is weak to &lt;a href=\"Slashing%20Damage\"&gt;Slashing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Fire Damage&lt;/a&gt; and will use several &lt;a href=\"Magicka%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Magicka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Abilities%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href=\"Delayed%20Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Delayed Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siphon%20Life\"&gt;Siphon Life&lt;/a&gt; to deal damage, &lt;a href=\"Absorb\"&gt;Absorb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Resist%20Elements\"&gt;Resist Elements&lt;/a&gt; to avoid damage, as well as &lt;a href=\"Renewing%20Dodge\"&gt;Renewing Dodge&lt;/a&gt; that will recover his lost Magicka. Once defeated, the Elder Scroll can be taken and the quest will conclude. There are also several urns and loose materials than can be collected at the corners of the room and in a small room past the alter.\nUpon returning to the &lt;a href=\"Town%20%28Blades%29\"&gt;Town&lt;/a&gt;, Saashi will speak with the Fugitive.\n\"See? Khajiit knew this was the right one! And you found the Elder Scroll, too! That is amazing. Saashi must admit, it is tempting to open it and peek inside...\""}

As the reader is doubtless aware, we are the only temple in the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; that offers wound healing and illness curing for both the faithful and the heathen alike, for Stendarr is the God of Mercy. I have faced people at their most miserable and their most terrified. I have seen brave knights weep and strong peasants scream. I like to think that I've watched the masks drop from faces, and seen people as they truly are.\nA healer's job, after all, is more than simply binding wounds and stopping the flows of poison and disease. We are counselors and comforters for those who have given up all hope. Sometimes, it seems like our kind words and sympathy do more for our patients than our spells.\nI am reminded of a very sick young man who came to the temple, suffering from a variety of maladies. Once I had given him an examination, I told him the results, careful not to alarm him. I let him decide how he wanted to be told the news.\n\"I have some good news and some bad news, my child,\" I said.\n\"I better hear the bad news first,\" he said.\n\"Well,\" I said, gripping his shoulder in case he should faint. \"The bad news is that, unless I am wrong, you will sicken even more over the next day or two. And unless Stendarr chooses to be merciful to you, you will pass from this existence. I am sorry, my child.\"\nAs soft as the blow was, it stung nonetheless. The boy was, after all, very young. He thought he had his whole life ahead of him. Tears streaming down his face, he asked, \"And what is the good news?\"\nI smiled: \"When you came in, did you notice our proselytizer? She was the enchanting, voluptuous blonde in the antechamber by the foyer?\"\nColor returned to the young man's face. He had noticed her indeed. \"Yes?\"\n\"I'm sleeping with her,\" I said.\nIf more of the healers of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; would consider their patients' feelings, not just the quickest way to heal them up and get them out, we would have a far, far healthier society. I truly believe that."}

However, the Missionary does have a relative who is in need of treatment, and will be willing to support the Agent's wish to join the Temple if they agree to find a cure for their cousin. Upon accepting the quest the Agent is told to find the cousin in a nearby town to diagnose and find a cure.\nDiagnosis: Uncertain.\nAfter venturing to the stated town, the Agent must ask around the local populace to find out where the Missionary's cousin is staying. Upon speaking to the cousin, the Agent finds very little to diagnose them, making it near impossible to find a cure. Fortunately, an intense interrogation of the local population reveals that there is a healer visiting a nearby town who may know the cure.\nThe Not-so Common Cure.\nA short search of the second town will reveal that the healer is one of the town's alchemists, found in one of the local shops.

It's been prophesised that she lives in the village of Karthwasten, to the north of Markarth.\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Degaine\"&gt;Degaine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; will give the Dragonborn a quest to steal a Statue of Dibella from the Temple of Dibella. Talk to Degaine and receive the miscellaneous quest \"Steal the statue in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Temple of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;\" before picking the lock to the Inner Sanctum and getting caught by the priestesses and &lt;a href=\"Hamal\"&gt;Hamal&lt;/a&gt;. If the Dragonborn is caught by the priestesses and then tries to go talk to Degaine to receive the quest, the quest dialogue will not show. Degaine is usually at the market in front of the main door of Markarth, if not he is in &lt;a href=\"The%20Warrens\"&gt;The Warrens&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"What are you doing in here? Stay where you are. The mother will deal with you.\"\nBreak into the Inner Sanctum and sneak behind the priestesses. If caught while sneaking past the priestesses, Mother Hamal will give the Dragonborn this quest as a punishment for trespassing in the temple. Alternatively, sneak out, sell the statue to Degaine, and come back in to \"get caught.\"\nIf unable to sneak past Hamal, there are several other Statues of Dibella at the following locations:\nEither way, if you get caught trying to sneak past and Mother Hamal gives you the quest as punishment for trespassing in the temple, you can still attempt to steal the statue and just sell it to someone else other than Degaine.\nWithout Degaine.\nAnother way to acquire this quest without involving Degaine is to simply break into the Inner Sanctum. Make sure to be &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaking&lt;/a&gt; and undetected when picking the lock if one does not wish to start a fight. If successful, one can then sneak into the Inner Sanctum and let Hamal \"catch\" them (getting caught sneaking, or standing up and approaching her), where she will then start the quest.\nIf caught picking the lock (or one was not sneaking or did not have the Quick Hands &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; perk), the priestesses will be hostile, so one should utilize \"calm\" type &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; spells (&lt;a href=\"Calm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Calm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pacify\"&gt;Pacify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Harmony%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Harmony&lt;/a&gt;) or the &lt;a href=\"Imperials%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Emperor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Voice of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt; to calm the priestesses and to be able to speak with Hamal to get the quest from her.\nLooking for the Sybil.\nTalk to anyone in &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt; about a little girl, and they will direct the Dragonborn to talk to &lt;a href=\"Enmon\"&gt;Enmon&lt;/a&gt;, her father. Enmon will say that &lt;a href=\"Fjotra\"&gt;Fjotra&lt;/a&gt; was kidnapped by the Forsworn and taken to &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Tower%20Redoubt\"&gt;Broken Tower Redoubt&lt;/a&gt;. He offers to join in the rescue, but there is an option to go alone. Having Enmon joining offers no reward, except one or two lines of dialogue when his daughter is found. Unfortunately, Enmon can be killed easily, which has no consequences.\nTravel to Broken Tower Redoubt and fight or slip past the Forsworn found there while making the way to the top (if recently cleared, the only enemy present may be the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Briarheart\"&gt;Forsworn Briarheart&lt;/a&gt;). Eventually the Dragonborn will get inside a small tower with a Forsworn Briarheart boss guarding the cell in which Fjotra is being held captive. Kill him, then loot the key off his body to open the cell. After telling her she is the Sybil of Dibella, Fjotra will follow you. Take her back to the Temple of Dibella in Markarth.\nFjotra: \"Are you one of them? Please don't hurt me\"\nDragonborn: \"I'm here to take you to the temple of Dibella.\"\nFjotra: \"Then it is true what they said? I am touched by the gods?\"\nFjotra: \"I've heard stories about the wonders of the great Temple in Markarth. But I never dreamed that I would even get to see it. I am honored to be called for this duty. Please, lead on.\"\nIf the Dragonborn returns to Fjotra's House after rescuing her and approaches Enmon with Fjotra, he will address his daughter and tell her she has to go to the temple.\nEnmon: \"Fjotra!\"\nFjotra: \"Father!\"\nEnmon: \"Fjotra, dear. Did they hurt you?\"\nFjotra: \"Of course not. My spirit remains strong.\"\nEnmon: \"My little girl. Always strong. Do you know where you have to go?\"\nFjotra: \"I'm to go to the temple in Markarth. I... I'll have to leave you and mother.\"\nEnmon: \"It's our honor to have you there. This man/woman is going to take you to Markarth. Are you ready?\"\nFjotra: \"Of course.\"\nHamal tells the player to pray at the Altar of Dibella to receive the blessing. Note that the Altar of Dibella is the font-like object in the center of the top floor of the temple, not the normal Shrine of Dibella next to it. The Dragonborn will get a permanent effect called &lt;a href=\"Agent%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Agent of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the player to do more damage to the opposite sex.\nAfter praying at the altar, Hamal will be willing to train the Dragonborn in &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Senna\"&gt;Senna&lt;/a&gt; will become &lt;a href=\"Marriage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;marriageable&lt;/a&gt;."}

And today I have come to collect my prize.\nYes, it may only be my speculation that the Heart resides in Nchuleftingth, but my instinct has driven me to success before. I've researched many volumes pertaining to the myth, and all indicate that it lies beneath Red Mountan. This is where I will make my greatest find.\nThe fact that I believe in this &lt;a href=\"Aedric\"&gt;Aedric&lt;/a&gt; artifact should speak nothing of my faith to the Divines. Only a fool ignores myth. After all, every story holds some of truth to it. Legends are simply facts that have been expanded upon, morphed into the ridiculous. And I believe that the Heart, though clearly an object of great power, is merely that. A magical object I mean to obtain.\nI was surprised to find &lt;a href=\"Neramo\"&gt;Neramo&lt;/a&gt; here, of all the halfwits I could come across in &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;. He and his motley crew were easy enough to capture or run off, and I've found the control rod he's left behind quite useful. Naturally I have many modifications for the tool already in mind, but currently it's worked well in getting the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; constructs under my control.\nI'm not sure what the Heart of Lorkhan can achieve. Perhaps it will be a powerful potion ingredient, more potent than any &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra heart&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps it can grant magical attributes, such as boundless strength or resilience in battle. Perhaps it is a great soul gem, capable of powering something grander than &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; has ever seen. No matter its use, all I know is that it shall earn me enough gold to retire. I am far too sensible to ever attempt to use an item of great power. Too often, such greed leads to despair."}

He says the Ropefish can help, but that you cannot communicate directly with their leader, &lt;a href=\"Bothamul\"&gt;Bothamul&lt;/a&gt;. You must instead speak to &lt;a href=\"Atarga\"&gt;Atarga&lt;/a&gt; who you can meet at the inn.\nTravel to the inn located behind the main Telvanni Council tower. When you enter, you will see Atarga is a drunken mess and is going to her room to sleep it off. You are directed to speak with &lt;a href=\"Lagdabash\"&gt;Lagdabash&lt;/a&gt; instead, who will then point you to their leader. As you turn around to leave the inn, Sun-in-Shadow walks in and waves you over to her. She has obviously been following you, and she admits it once you speak to her. Upon speaking to Sun-in-Shadow, she asks if Eoki is planning something foolish. You have the option to tell her the truth, or lie and say he seemed fine.\nChoosing to tell her the truth, Sun-in-Shadow urges you to talk Eoki out of escaping. She also mentions \"If the truth of our relationship gets back to the Council...\", which feels a little telling of how her heart has changed since the start of the quest. She then says she will go to the main and try to talk him out of it. If you lie to her, she says that she will speak to him later, to try and convince him again.\nRegardless of whether you lie to her or not, you will head out to deliver Eoki's payment to Bothamul. Upon arriving at the location indicated by Lagdabash, you find that it was a trap. You are ambushed by Lagdabash and one of her colleagues. Dispatch the two and read the note on the ground titled \"&lt;a href=\"Bothamul%27s%20Orders\"&gt;Bothamul's Orders&lt;/a&gt;\". The orders make no mention of this ambush. They only state that the camp has been moved to prepare for the upcoming job.\nTravel to the actual &lt;a href=\"Ropefish%20Camp\"&gt;Ropefish Camp&lt;/a&gt; to meet Bothamul and deliver the payment. He will express that he is not surprised that Lagdabash conned you the way she did and hopes that you punished them for it. He then goes on to discuss the job and state where he will meet Eoki to start. You will then be indicated by quest markers to speak to Eoki.\nTravel to Eoki. He will express that he and his companions are ready for the fight, and give you the option of killing the guards at the entrance or knocking them out with smoke bombs. Once you make your choice, he will tell you to meet him at the mine. If you choose to kill the guards, you will see multiple dead guards around the entrance when you arrive at the mine. If you choose to knock the guards out, you will have the opportunity to throw powder on them by crouching behind them, in order to make them sleep. Sun-in-Shadow will then appear to try to talk Eoki out of his plan. He is not willing to switch his plan and tells Sun-in-Shadow, that their souls are very different now. He convinces her to enter the mine during the mission to see how the Telvanni treat their slaves. Follow Eoki and Sun-in-Shadow into the mine.\nMake your way through the mine, dispatching guards as needed and opening cages to free slaves. Once you reach the end of the tunnel, Eoki will attempt to get Sun-in-Shadow to go with him rather than stay with the Telvanni. She refuses and instead runs off into the next room yelling that she is being kidnapped.\nIn the next room you will find that the Slavemaster has magically chained down both Eoki and Sun-in-Shadow even as Sun-in-Shadow protests that she should not be chained because she is a Telvanni mage who was being kidnapped. This begins the fight with the &lt;a href=\"Slavemaster\"&gt;Slavemaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you defeat the Slavemaster, speak to Sun-in-Shadow who is now freed. She will express frustration with what Eoki has done. You will be given the opportunity to guide her to free Eoki or keep him as a slave."}

Speak with her and she will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; have invaded the Grotto, which is an important ritual site for the Wyrd. They have even turned the guardian bears against the wyresses. Linnae will ask you to help restore the grotto to the wyrd by reactivating the wards that protect the grotto. \nYou will find four wards around the area, to the northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest of the map icon for the grotto. You can reactivate them by luring a bear to them and then slaying the bear there. Once all four of them have been reactivated, head to the altar to Hircine at the center of the area and talk to Wyress Linnae there. She will ask you to sacrifice yourself in a ritual to Hircine so that the Wyrd can ask him why he abandoned them, but &lt;a href=\"Wyress%20Nyronie\"&gt;Wyress Nyronie&lt;/a&gt; will object and insist that she be the sacrifice. Speak with Linnae after this conversation and she will ask you to be the one to sacrifice Nyronie. She will give you a dagger and tell you to cut out Nyronie's heart when she gives the signal. \nAfter Linnae gives the signal, cut out Nyronie's heart and place it in the bowl on the altar.\nAfter placing the heart into the bowl, you will speak with the Statue of Hircine:\n\"You are not mere prey, mortal. Yet you aid the Wyrd who still lick their wounds of defeat. Their fall to Brinarch and his reachmen lost them my favor. To earn it back, you must prove yourself a true hunter.\"\nYou will be transported to Hircine's Hunting Grounds. There, your task is to defeat Hircine's Aspects of &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Speed\"&gt;Speed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20Guile\"&gt;Guile&lt;/a&gt;. You can speak with the spirit of Nyronie before you start hunting them, and she will offer tips on how to track each of the aspects down. The Aspect of Speed will be in the southeast of the area; it will take the form of a wolf. The Aspect of Strength is in the form of a bear, and can be found in the north of the area. Finally, the Aspect of Guile can be found in the south near the campfire; it will take the form of a hunter. Once all of the aspects have been defeated, head back to Hircine's shrine and speak with Hircine's &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Hunt\"&gt;Spirit of the Hunt&lt;/a&gt; there. Hircine will tell you that to win back the grotto, you must tear out the reachman &lt;a href=\"Brinarch\"&gt;Brinarch&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Briar%20Heart\"&gt;Briar Heart&lt;/a&gt; and present it to him. \nBrinarch's spirit will be standing next to the spirit of the hunt. Speak with him and he will accept your challenge; you will be transported back to Mundus after this conversation. Talk to Wyress Linnae there, then head out to defeat Brinarch. He will be in the south of the area, guarded by some reachmen. Kill him, then take his heart and return to Wyress Linnae. She will tell you to offer the heart to Hircine.\nAfter defeating Brinarch, you will speak with the Statue of Hircine once more to finish the quest:\n\"Ah, the proven hunter. I see you have the briar heart, torn from the chest of the Reachman. His punishment for failure is to roam the Hunting Grounds as prey. His chest, a gaping hollow, a reminder of his weakness.\""}

After joining one of the Eight Divine temples scattered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, the Agent will be assigned randomly determined quests to complete by one of the &lt;a href=\"Missionaries%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Temple's missionaries&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"[Quest giver's name] of [temple town] has sent me to investigate the life of [prophet's name], who claims to be a prophet.

I am to meet [him/her] at [tavern].\"\nWalkthrough.\nAccording to one of the temple &lt;a href=\"Missionaries%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;missionary&lt;/a&gt; there has been some discontent growing within, caused by the claims of a potential prophet to have heard the voice of their favoured Divine. An investigation involving some of the temple's priest(ess)es and clerics is already underway, although the missionary still requires the Agent to do some digging.\nAccepting the quest will reveal the name of the prophet, their current location, and the location of their supposed epiphany. However, the Agent is tasked with speaking with one of the temple's clerics, who has been doing some investigations in the prophet's hometown.\nA Loving Link.\nThe entire investigation revolves around the prophet's lover, who is hidden somewhere in the region. Two options are open to the Agent: the first being to follow their original instructions and speak with the cleric; the second to find the priest(ess) going through the prophet's dungeon of revelation.\nClerical Considerations.\nThe cleric can be found in the inn of the prophet's hometown, and will expect the arrival of the Agent immediately. Speaking with them will that they have been in contact with the prophet's lover, but they need the Agent to speak with the lover face to face to try and get a confession. The cleric will also produce a copy of the prophet's tract so the Agent will \"know what this [prophet's name]'s all about.\nRevealing Revelations.\nInstead, the Agent can head into the dungeon where the prophet allegedly spoke to the temple's God in order to speak with the priest(ess) who had already been sent there. After finding the priest(ess) they will reveal that there were some letter fragments detailing the prophet's lover in the dungeon, although there is little else to aid the investigation. They will therefore task the Agent with finding the lover, in hopes of getting a confession from them.\nThe Torn Heart.\nAfter one of the two paths has been followed, the Agent will have to ask around the lover's town to find them. Once found the Agent will receive one of two responses from the lover, based on the Agent's reputation within the lover's faction.\nA successful reputation check will see the lover hand the Agent a letter detailing the prophet's deception, as well as the following response:\nOn the other hand, a failed reputation check will result in the following dialogue:\nIf the letter was handed to the Agent, then they may return to the missionary who gave them the quest in order to complete it. If, however, the lover denied knowing the prophet, then a new avenue of investigation must be opened.\nMysterious Murders.\nBetween two and twenty two days after the quest was started by the Agent, one (or potentially two) messages will be handed to them. They will detail the deaths of either the cleric or the priest(ess), and it is up to the Agent to visit the scene in order to complete the investigation.\nA Clerical Correction.\nThe first letter received will be addressed from the tavern that the cleric was staying in. The letter itself reveals that the cleric was found dead, and that a replacement had been sent to continue the investigation. The Agent must head to the tavern and speak with the replacement cleric.\nThe replacement cleric will greet the Agent accordingly, detailing their predecessor's gruesome death. They will also hand the Agent an artefact, which was found buried in the former cleric's chest. They suggest that the Agent take the relic to the lover in hopes that they will recognise it.\nReturning to the lover and showing them the artefact will cause them to respond with shock, as well as acceptance that the prophet was not acting in their best interest. They will hand the Agent the letter, stating:\nThe letter may now be shown to the missionary who gave the Agent the quest in order to complete it.\nRitual Remains.\nThe second letter will reveal that the priest(ess), originally sent to the dungeon the prophet supposedly had their revelation, has failed to report their findings. The missionary has therefore decided to countermand the Agent's former orders, and instead sends them to try and find the priest(ess), or their remains, before reporting back directly to them. With little else to go on, the Agent will have to enter the dungeon and track down the lost priest(ess).\nA thorough search of the dungeon will reveal that the priest(ess) has vanished, although a single part of their anatomy remains. Indeed, a \"ritualistically stripped\" finger has been removed from their body, evidence that the priest(ess) has been killed.\nTaking the finger to the missionary will complete the quest.\nRewards.\nSuccessfully completing the quest within the time limit will see the agent given a random &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gem%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;Precious Gem&lt;/a&gt;, which may be &lt;a href=\"Enchantments%20%28Daggerfall%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; with an unknown power. The success or failure of the Agent in undertaking the quest will also affect their reputation in the Temple:"}

The Hero Cycle follows the pattern of a call to adventure that leads the hero to a strange and foreign world, a road of trials that tests the hero and prepares him for a severe challenge, and a boon at the end of the challenge that in some way betters the world.\nThe Monomyth can be seen in any number of popular stories, including \"Star Wars\", \"Lord of the Rings\", and \"Harry Potter\". While prominent in fantasy, it can also be found in any other number of genres. In series, the Hero Cycle can be seen in the main quests of the games, where the player is the hero.\nMore information on the Monomyth, including the various versions of the Cycle, can be found .

The &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; is tasked with ridding the towers of &lt;a href=\"Frostbreak%20Fortress\"&gt;Frostbreak Fortress&lt;/a&gt; of harpy nests and destroying the source of the &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Winterborn&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"briarheart\"&gt;briarheart&lt;/a&gt;s, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Eveli%20Sharp-Arrow\"&gt;Eveli Sharp-Arrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alinon%20the%20Alchemist\"&gt;Alinon the Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; army needs to get into Frostbreak Fortress to find and destroy the source of the briarheart warriors, but the Winterborn's defenses are too strong. Between the briarhearts and the &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, they can't breach the walls. I need to report to &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Commander%20Dulph\"&gt;Siege Commander Dulph&lt;/a&gt; within the siege camp to find out how I can help the Orc soldiers get into Frostbreak Fortress.\"\nWalkthrough.\nWhile progressing through the quest stages of \"For King and Glory,\" the Vestige is eventually tasked with finding a way to enter the besieged fortress of Frostbreak. &lt;a href=\"King%20Kurog\"&gt;King Kurog&lt;/a&gt; will tell them to speak to Chief Urgdosh, who will direct the Vestige to Siege Commander Dulph. When speaking to Dulph, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"You... You brought the king here? Then welcome to our siege camp. Sorry you had to see those damn harpies at work. I'm not sure King Kurog should be walking around in the open, but I've got a barrel full of my own worries to deal with.\"\nAfter learning of Siege Commander Dulph's troubles, the Vestige is now tasked with locating the two missing squads of troops. Accompanied by King Kurog, they must enter the fortress, where they will be met by Winterborn troops; one &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Mage\"&gt;Winterborn Mage&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Savage\"&gt;Winterborn Savage&lt;/a&gt; will be guarding the fortress gate. After defeating them, the Vestige must make their way to a partially destroyed tower, where they will find Sergeant Rorburz and his troops. He will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"You and the king have come to our aid? We're honored. But we've been trapped in here for too long. We still have a mission to complete!\"\nThe Vestige must now take the stone spiral staircase up the tower, and speak to Eveli Sharp-Arrow, the Wood Elf archer Sergeant Rorburz described. The Vestige must speak to her, and direct her arrows towards the harpy-infested fortress tower. Speaking to her will give the option to make Eveli \"Loose her arrow!,\" which will make her fire her arrow towards the fortress tower, setting the harpy nest alight. Having seen the signal, the Orsimer troops will fire their catapult towards the tower; a flaming projectile will hit the tower, destroying the harpy nest and all harpies present. This process must be completed twice in order to rid the towers of harpy nests. After successfully eliminating the harpy threat, the Vestige must now locate Alinon, the alchemist who is supposedly capable of putting an end to the Winterborn's briarhearts. Alinon is hiding in a camp on the higher grounds of the fort, in between some broken walls. When spoken to, he will tell the Vestige the following:\n\"I recognize that Orc standing beside you. That's King Kurog! I'm honored that you and the king came to find me. I just wish you had gotten here sooner, before the rest of my squad was lost.\"\nAnd you can put an end to the process? \"If I'm right and the briarhearts are grown, then I can destroy them. I'll know for certain once we get inside and look around. I want to make sure I mix the elixir correctly. Wouldn't want to inadvertently make them stronger, you understand.\"\nNow that the Vestige has found Alinon and heard him out, they must escort him into the fort so that can destroy the source of the Winterborn's briarhearts. Eveli will join them.\nOnce inside, the Vestige will stumble upon a perculiar sight; the roots of a tree growing out of a decaying corpse. Alinon has the following to say about it:\n\"Now there's something you don't see every day. A tree growing out of a corpse. I'd say this is what we were looking for. This sapling is but a root, however, a small part of a greater whole.\"\nLeaving Eveli and Alinon behind, the Vestige must now search for other briarheart saplings and burn them. While searching the fortress caverns for saplings, the Vestige will have to face several &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hagravens&lt;/a&gt; and Winterborn troops, this can include &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Archer\"&gt;Winterborn Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Icecaster\"&gt;Winterborn Icecaster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Winterborn%20Blade-Bearer\"&gt;Winterborn Blade-Bearer&lt;/a&gt;s. After burning all the briarheart saplings, the Vestige must return to Alinon and Eveli to determine their next step. However, once returned, the Vestige will find out Eveli has lost sight of Alinon:\n\"So... I don't suppose you... maybe... might have seen Alinon... on your way back. Maybe?\"\nWith that, the Vestige must now search through the caverns of Frostbreak Fortress for Alinon the Alchemist. Alinon can be found in a cage, lifted above a fire, urging the Vestige to aid him once they enter the room:\n\"Don't just stand there and watch me roast! Do something!\"\nThe Vestige must now speak with Eveli, who has found a way to rescue Alinon from the cage. With a few well-placed arrow, she should be able to break the chain holding the cage. Assured that Alinon is safe, the Vestige must now make their way to the briar heart tree and destroy it.\nWhile making their way to the central tree, one may run across \"&lt;a href=\"Ice-Heart%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Ice-Heart's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\", which contains Urfon's whereabouts and views on the Orsimer siege of Frostbreak Fortress.\nOnce the Vestige has reached the central tree in the courtyard of Forstbreak Fortess, they must apply the elixir on the tree and lower its &lt;a href=\"Health%20%28Online%29\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; by attacking it. This can be a quite challenging task, however, because it will constantly be defended by Winterborn troops. Additionally, the Winterborn have also placed Tree Tenders around the tree to heal it. The Vestige must defeat the Tree Tenders to ensure the tree gets destroyed. After a lengthy process of lowering the tree's health, the tree will be destroyed, causing it to burst into flames.\nAfter destroying the tree, the Vestige must exit the fortress and speak to Alinon:\n\"The Wood Elf got me out of that cage with a damn fine strike. Damn fine! And you, you handled the briarheart tree perfectly. Well done!\"\nAfterwards, the quest will be completed, and the Vestige will receive their reward."}

Their patron is &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt;, the scryer of the heavens and he who determines the Tides of Fate. These treasures have been sealed away far too long. Hoarding knowledge is worse than hoarding gold, or so our patron has decreed. Here is the &lt;a href=\"Dresan%20Index\"&gt;Dresan Index&lt;/a&gt; with names of all the volumes and scrolls the keep contains and give it to someone who can make use of it, such as a scholar of magic.\nLeave the vault through the now unsealed door and return to Richard Dusant. He is really disappointed that there was no fabulous treasure of jewels or gold and that he died for a bunch of moldy old books. A cruel fate, he wishes he had a book before all this that would have told him what was in the keep.

Upon entering, &lt;a href=\"Ja%27Fazir\"&gt;Ja'Fazir&lt;/a&gt; will approach and state that he knows the Hero is a Fighters Guild spy. He will immediately become hostile and attack with the others waiting in the hall.\nThere are three Blackwood Company guards in the room: a warrior, a spellsword, and an archer. Be sure to get &lt;a href=\"Jeetum-Ze\"&gt;Jeetum-Ze&lt;/a&gt;'s key off of Ja'Fazir's body. Go upstairs, and use the key to enter Jeetum-Ze's room. Kill him and obtain Ri'Zakar's room key.\nHead to the third floor, and open the door Ri'Zakar's room. Kill him and find the basement key on his corpse. Head back down to the first level, and open up the basement door.\nIn the basement, there will be two more guards, &lt;a href=\"Hears-Voices-in-The-Air\"&gt;Hears-Voices-in-The-Air&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sings-Like-Thunder\"&gt;Sings-Like-Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. Dispatch them, but be aware they both use invisibility rings in their favor.\nNow, the Hist tree must be dealt with. On the ground and on a table, there are two pipes. Pick them up, and then activate the two large gear boxes to jam the gears with the pipes. This will cause the machinery to break, and the tree to burst into flames. A quest update will indicate to head back to Chorrol and report to Modryn Oreyn. However, upon leaving the basement,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Maglir\"&gt;Maglir&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0will be waiting at the entrance. After commenting that the Hero has ruined everything, he will attack. Kill him and return to Chorrol.\nOreyn gives the Hero the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Oreyn%20Bearclaw%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt; and tells them to speak to &lt;a href=\"Vilena%20Donton\"&gt;Vilena Donton&lt;/a&gt;. Go see Vilena. At first, she will be angry because of the Hero and Oreyn plotting against the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; behind her back, and thus strips the Hero's Champion rank. However, she is happy that the threat of the Blackwood Company has been destroyed, and thus promotes the Hero to Master of the Fighters Guild. She will then suggest that Oreyn be named second-in-command.\nGo back to Oreyn's house, and tell him the news. He will inform the Hero that since they are in charge, they will receive a percentage of the monthly take for all contracts, as well as any useful items that the Guild finds. Afterwards, he can be commanded to concentrate on recruiting new guildmembers, who, when finding new contracts, will increase the useful items received,\u00a0which will increase the total earnings, or both equally."}

I believe &lt;a href=\"the%20Hist\"&gt;the Hist&lt;/a&gt; spoke to both of us, to ensure we would both be where we could not help but meet and fall in love. This despite my innermost belief I'd never marry.\nThe first stir caught me by surprise. I put away items in the shop, organizing what I could amongst the clutter, when suddenly I heard my own voice in my mind say, \"Wait for him.\"\n\"For ...?\" I asked aloud, startled out of my reverie.\nSilence.\nMy quiet sensibility replaced by confusion, I turned abruptly, knocking over the lamp, which flung an arc of burning oil across the room.\nOil landed everywhere, from the piles of fabric, to the litter of papers, and the straw scattered over the floor. In a single moment, a modest light source turned the crowded room into a fire pit.\nCoral tongues licked across the dried herbs hanging from the ceiling, and I realized I'd been standing still, slack-jawed, as smoke and heat and flame swirled around.\nThe hut had never seemed so large as it did then. Dark with smoke, bright with fire, its air filled with a dull, creaking roar. I squinted against the elements, my hand across my mouth, and staggered toward the ever-receding door.\n\"Anyone in there? Anyone?\"\n\"Me!\"\nI reached the door as it burst open, causing the flames to surge upwards and out with an almost celebratory leap. A dark hand grabbed mine, pulling me out and away.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\nCoughing, I shook my head. \"I'm all right. But the store \u2026.\"\nWe both turned to look. The fire, so unruly within the confines of the hut, had met its match with the wet thatch roof.\n\"Thank you for helping me,\" I said, turning to face my rescuer at last.\nOur eyes locked in recognition. The Hist had chosen us for each other, and neither of us would need to wait any longer."}

She commanded no great battles, conquered no powerful enemies. At just a glance, one would think her unremarkable, unworthy of further inspection. Certainly that has been the viewpoint of historians up to this point, given the lack of academia written on her. However, the fact that Zaan's story has been so ignored is what makes her such a fascinating subject.\nZaan was uncommonly young when chosen by her &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; Lord, the mighty Dovah &lt;a href=\"Thurvokun\"&gt;Thurvokun&lt;/a&gt;. It is said that her connection to Thurvokun was particularly strong. As we know, there is much speculation on the connection between a Dragon and their chosen priest, whether it be spiritual, magical, or perhaps merely political. Whatever the case, Zaan grew a rapid and robust attachment, which her followers took as a sign of great fortune. For a decade or so, all was well.\nThe turmoil began when Thurvokun left his temple, for reasons unknown to all but perhaps Zaan herself. By all accounts, it was this departure that led to the Dragon Priest's steady decline into a depressive state, though it is uncertain whether this was magically or psychologically induced. This depression brought about frequent seclusion, growing into a steady isolation.\nHer followers slowly grew discontent, and as time went by many became mistrustful. They believed that Thurvokun had abandoned them, and saw this with the despair that we today would see the loss of &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt;. They began to accuse Scalecaller of driving him away with her weakness. When confronted with these accusations, it is said that Scalecaller made no protest. Her followers took this as admittance, and killed her in their anger.\nThis lead us to Zaan's greatest mystery.\nWhen accused by her followers, why did she not defend herself?\nMy theory, though mostly speculative, is that the Dragon Priest simply was not able. The loss of her Dragon Lord had brought upon such misery that she had lost her will, or perhaps even her ability, to speak. Again, whether this was brought upon by magical means or mere psychological trauma, I am still unsure.\nI believe through studying this historical occurrence we may gain further insight into the link between Dragon Priests and their Dragon Lords. We must look past the rudimentary political aspects of such a relationship to see what lies beyond. What precisely was this spiritual connection, so highly revered? With Scalecaller's help, we can begin to answer that question."}

{"id": "84767", "revid": "17401442", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=84767", "title": "The Holds of Skyrim", "text": "The Holds of Skyrim is a &lt;a href=\"Books%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in .\nContents.\nWelcome, loyal officer of &lt;a href=\"Mede%20Empire\"&gt;the Empire&lt;/a&gt;. You have been given this guide to help you, and those men under your command, better understand the geography of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;. Since you will be serving in Skyrim for a lengthy period of time, this information should prove invaluable.\nSkyrim is organized into nine holds. A hold is a large area of land roughly equivalent to a county in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. Each hold is governed by a &lt;a href=\"Jarl\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt; who maintains his court in the hold's capital city.\nFour of these holds are fairly small and sparsely populated. As a result, the capitals are little more than towns. The five major cities of Skyrim act as capitals for the larger holds.\nFollowing is a detailed review of each hold.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastmarch%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;EASTMARCH&lt;/a&gt;: Located in the eastern reaches of Skyrim, Eastmarch shares a common border with &lt;a href=\"Morrowind\"&gt;Morrowind&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt; rules from the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt;, and he and his followers should be considered your most serious threat. Do not tread lightly in Eastmarch, for the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; are at their strongest and most organized in these lands. As an &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; soldier, you will find few friends here.\n&lt;a href=\"Haafingar\"&gt;HAAFINGAR&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; of Skyrim and the capital of Haafingar hold, has always welcomed the Empire with open arms. Much commerce flows along the rivers here, and you will find the folk of this hold to be among the most hospitable in Skyrim. As you venture forth in your campaigns, be sure to maintain a secure supply line back to Solitude. The Empire maintains ample provisions in &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Dour%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Castle Dour&lt;/a&gt;, from which &lt;a href=\"General%20Tullius%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;General Tullius&lt;/a&gt; commands all the legions stationed in Skyrim.\n&lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch\"&gt;HJAALMARCH&lt;/a&gt;: This hold is divided evenly between wind-swept tundra dotted with farms and a huge, stinking salt marsh. There is little of interest here, save perhaps for the hold's capital, &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl &lt;a href=\"Idgrod%20Ravencrone\"&gt;Idgrod Ravencrone&lt;/a&gt; has been cooperative enough with the Empire in the past, but will ultimately look out for her own if put in a difficult position. While the hold offers minimal strategic value to the Empire, it would make an ideal staging ground for a Stormcloak siege of Solitude, and so must be held against the enemy.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Pale\"&gt;THE PALE&lt;/a&gt;: The Pale is a barren realm covered by vast fields of ice and snow. Its boundaries stretch from the center of Skyrim all the way to its northern coast. Here, at the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt;, can be found one of the busiest parts in the province. With access to the coastal waterways of Skyrim, Dawnstar could prove vital in the war effort. Should the Stormcloaks choose to attack Solitude from the river, this port would make a tempting target due to its close proximity.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Reach\"&gt;THE REACH&lt;/a&gt;: Dominating the western border of Skyrim, the Reach is made up almost entirely of steep, craggy mountains. Little grows in this forbidding realm, but the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Markarth%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Markarth&lt;/a&gt; is a nigh-impregnable stone fortress that would make an excellent defensive position for either side in the war. Be aware that this dangerous region of Skyrim is home to the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, the rebellious natives of the Reach. They know the terrain, can strike without warning and count the Empire as an enemy. If they attack, you must neither give nor expect any mercy.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Rift%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;THE RIFT&lt;/a&gt;: This hold occupies the southest corner of Skyrim and much like the Reach in the west, is dominated by tall mountain peaks. The climate in is milder than in the northern holds and there is more vegetation to be found here. Farming thrives as a result. A word of warning about &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;, the hold's capital city. Our agents have reason to suspect that the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt; makes it home here even though it is has diminished from its strength of previous years. Nevertheless, mind that you men keep an eye on their coin purses should they have reason to spend any length of time in the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20Hold\"&gt;WHITERUN&lt;/a&gt;: This central hold is characterized by wide, grassy plains that are home to numerous farms. Many roads pass through Whiterun, joining the more distant holds together. The hold's capital city, also called &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, sits high on a rocky promontory amid a large, flat swath of scrubland. Among the wealthiest cities of Skyrim, Whiterun has usually proven friendly to the Emperor's soldiers.\n&lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20Hold%29\"&gt;WINTERHOLD&lt;/a&gt;: This bleak snow-blown hold in the northeast corner of Skyrim is utterly inhospitable. Perhaps the mages at the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; chose to make their home there because they knew they would be largely left alone. As with Whiterun, the name &lt;a href=\"Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%20City%29\"&gt;Winterhold&lt;/a&gt; describes both the hold and its capital city, though the word \"city\" hardly applies. The hold capital is a meager village built near the mages' college. Few other noteworthy settlements exist in this frozen waste and it is unlikely to play any significant part in the war."}

{"id": "6933", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=6933", "title": "The Old Ways", "text": "The Old Ways is a &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; in , , , and .\nContents.\nWe who know the Old Ways are well aware of the existence of a spiritual world invisible to the unenlightened. Just as one living in a kingdom but unaware of the political machinations underneath may see a new tax or battle preparation as the caprices of fortune, many observe floods, famines, and madness with helpless incomprehension. This is deplorable. As the great Cuilean Darnizhaan moaned, \"The power of ignorance can shatter &lt;a href=\"ebony\"&gt;ebony&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"glass\"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWhat, after all, is the origin of these spiritual forces that move the invisible strings of &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;? Any neophyte of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0knows\u00a0that these spirits are our ancestors -- and that, while living, they too were bewildered by the spirits of their ancestors, and so on back to the original Acharyai. The &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and gods to whom the common people turn are no more than the spirits of superior men and women whose power and passion granted them great influence in the afterworld.\nCertainly this is our truth and our religion. But how does it help us in our sacred duty of seliffrnsae, or providing \"grave and faithful counsel\" to lesser men?\nPrimarily, it is easy to grasp the necessity both of endowing good men with great power and making powerful men good. We recognize the multiple threats that a strong tyrant represents -- breeds cruelty which feeds the Daedra &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt; and hatred which feeds the Daedra &lt;a href=\"Vaermina\"&gt;Vaermina&lt;/a&gt;; if he should die having performed a particularly malevolent act, he may go to rule in &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;; and worst of all, he inspires other villains to thirst after power and other rulers to embrace villainy. Knowing this, we have developed patience in our dealings with such despots. They should be crippled, humiliated, impoverished, imprisoned. Other counsellors may advocate assassination or warfare -- which, aside from its spiritual insignificance, is expensive and likely to inflict at least as much pain on the innocents as the brutish dictator. No, we are intelligence gatherers, dignified diplomats -- not revolutionaries.\nHow, then, are our counsellors \"faithful\"? We are faithful only to the Old Ways -- it is essential always to remember the spiritual world while keeping our eyes open in the physical one. Performing the Rites of &lt;a href=\"Moawita\"&gt;Moawita&lt;/a&gt; on the 2nd of &lt;a href=\"Calendar\"&gt;Hearth Fire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vigyld\"&gt;Vigyld&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0on\u00a0the 1st of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; are essential means of empowering salutary spirits and debilitating unclean ones. How, then, are we at once faithful to those we counsel and to the Isle of Artaeum? Perhaps the sage Taheritae said it best: \"In Mundus, conflict and disparity are what bring change, and change is the most sacred of the Eleven Forces. Change is the force without focus or origin. It is the duty of the disciplined &lt;a href=\"Psijic%20Order\"&gt;Psijic&lt;/a&gt; [\"Enlightened One\"] to dilute change where it brings greed, gluttony, sloth, ignorance, prejudice, cruelty... [here Taheritae lists the rest of the 111 Prodigalities], and to encourage change where it brings excellence, beauty, happiness, and enlightenment. As such, the faithful counsel has but one master: His mind. If the man the Psijic counsels acts wickedly and brings oegnithr [\"bad change\"] and will otherwise not be counselled, it is the Psijic's duty to counterbalance the oegnithr by any means necessary [emphasis mine].\"\nA student of the Old Ways may indeed ally himself to a lord -- but it is a risky relationship. It cannot be stressed enough that the choice be wisely made. Should the lord refuse wise counsel and order the Psijic (to use Taheritae's outmoded word) to perform an act contrary to the teachings of the Old Ways, there are few available options. The Psijic may obey, albeit unwillingly, and fall prey to the dark forces against which he has devoted his life. The Psijic may abandon his lord, which will bring shame on him and the Isle of Artaeum, and so may never be allowed home again. Or the Psijic may simply kill himself."}

The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wheel\"&gt;Iron Wheel&lt;/a&gt; believes him dead, but Zeira does not believe that, and neither does &lt;a href=\"Magnifica%20Falorah\"&gt;Magnifica Falorah&lt;/a&gt;.

Depending on the Vestige's alliance, he is either in in Stormhold, Shornhelm, or Marbruk. Head there and look for the Falcon; you will find him in the tavern. The Falcon is in fact none other than Rhanbiq, the former Chief Inspector of the Iron Wheel. Talk to him and he will tell you the guild's actions at &lt;a href=\"No%20Shira%20Citadel\"&gt;No Shira Citadel&lt;/a&gt; forced him to resign from the Iron Wheel.

If you do not persuade him, \nThe notes in the strongbox will mention that someone named Bellulor Chatterbeak might know Nicolas's exact location. You can find this person in the outlaws refuge. Speak with him there; you can either persuade, intimidate or bribe him to reveal that Nicolas was heading to a manor near &lt;a href=\"Tal%27Deic%20Fortress\"&gt;Tal'Deic Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in Deshaan, &lt;a href=\"Haven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20Desert%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alik'r&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your alliance.

Inside the gardens, talk to Nicolas's new wife, &lt;a href=\"Volunidai\"&gt;Volunidai&lt;/a&gt;. She will tell you that her husband \"Vantus\" is busy and does not have time for you. You will thus have to get into the manor on your own; the front door has a lock that cannot be picked, but if you leave the garden and head around to the back, you can find a trap door to the kitchens. Head in there to find Nicolas; he will tell you that he is a changed man, and he just wishes to live quietly with his new wife. If pressed, he will tell you what his plan was for the Thieves Guild. At this point, you can either tell him to stay away from Abah's Landing, you can tell him that you will tell his wife everything, or you can kill him. If you elect to tell his wife, talk to her in the garden. You can advise her on what to do with Nicolas. \nWhatever you chose to do, head back to Abah's Landing and speak with Zeira to finish the quest."}

He asked me to acquire a deathbell flower, flawless ruby, silver ingot and some vampire dust.\"\nWalkthrough.\nThe quest is obtained in a random encounter with one of the &lt;a href=\"Afflicted\"&gt;Afflicted&lt;/a&gt; or by approaching &lt;a href=\"Kesh\"&gt;Kesh&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20to%20Peryite\"&gt;Shrine to Peryite&lt;/a&gt;, located near &lt;a href=\"Karthwasten%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Karthwasten&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Reach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; must be level 10 or above to get the quest from the Afflicted, and level 12 to get the quest from Kesh.\nKesh tells the Dragonborn that in order to speak to &lt;a href=\"Peryite\"&gt;Peryite&lt;/a&gt;, they must:\nAfter doing so, Peryite will appear to the Dragonborn as a spectral apparition, usually as some &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt;, and entreat their aid in cleansing the Afflicted, who are being led by Peryite's current champion Orchendor.

This will start the quest.\nIngredient collection.\nFlawless ruby.\nCollecting the flawless ruby can be the hardest part of the initial task. There are a few methods to be tried in order to get one for this quest:\nSpeaking to Peryite.\n\"Breathe deep, mortal. I would have you hear me well, so let these vapors fill your lungs.\"\nOnce all necessary ingredients have been gathered, they should be brought back to Kesh at the Shrine. Upon inhaling the fumes, Peryite will begin a conversation with the Dragonborn. He will give a task to kill his current overseer, &lt;a href=\"Orchendor\"&gt;Orchendor&lt;/a&gt;, who has forgotten his duty to Peryite.\nKill Orchendor.\nOrchendor is a powerful mage, mainly employing fire and ice spells, who resides deep within the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; underground fortress called &lt;a href=\"Bthardamz%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bthardamz&lt;/a&gt;. It will be quite a challenge to find him there because the area consists of several areas filled with afflicted (minions of Peryite that Orchendor guides) and Dwemer automatons. The article on Bthardamz provides a good guide to navigating the dungeon.\nOn the way to Orchendor, the Dragonborn may find the \"&lt;a href=\"Afflicted%27s%20Note\"&gt;Afflicted's Note&lt;/a&gt;\", stating that Orchendor has gone down to the \"Aerdrome.\" There is no place named Aerdrome in Bthardamz. Rather, what is meant is the Bthardamz Arcanex. At the Arcanex, Orchendor is guarded by numerous Dwemer Automatons, including a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven centurion&lt;/a&gt;; they can either be fought or &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sneaked&lt;/a&gt; past. Orchendor is in the large room past the centurion. He deals considerable Destruction damage and is completely immune to fire, frost, and shock spells, as well as absorption effects. He can even teleport and will often do so up to the upper tiers of the room. Physical weapons are recommended to slay him, and archery is useful for being able to continue attacking him as he teleports.\nAlternatively, one with the &lt;a href=\"Assassin%27s%20Blade%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Assassin's Blade&lt;/a&gt; perk, a decent dagger, an invisibility potion/spell and possibly the &lt;a href=\"shrouded%20gloves\"&gt;shrouded gloves&lt;/a&gt; should be able to kill him with a successful sneak attack. Using Fortify Archery and high sneak gear along with potent poisons could allow the Dragonborn to constantly hide and 'snipe' him using a bow or a crossbow - relevant perks such as increased damage in the Archery tree and also similar perks in the Sneak skill will heavily multiply the damage output. \nIf one is either a werewolf via the Companions questline or a Vampire Lord from the \"Dawnguard\" expansion, it will immensely simplify the fight with him, as will a pair of Dead Thralls, especially if one has reanimated two other magicians. &lt;a href=\"The%20Caller\"&gt;The Caller&lt;/a&gt; and Sild the Warlock are strongly recommended for they can counter Orchendor's teleportation skills with their own magical aptitude. Conjured &lt;a href=\"Dremora%20Lord%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dremora Lords&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Rose%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sanguine Rose&lt;/a&gt; are also very effective against him, because they distract him from attacking the Dragonborn and they can be continuously re-spawned if the Dragonborn possesses gear that minimises the cost of summoning them.\nAs for &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Essential%20Characters%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;essential&lt;/a&gt; characters such as &lt;a href=\"Frea\"&gt;Frea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serana\"&gt;Serana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mjoll%20the%20Lioness\"&gt;Mjoll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Erandur\"&gt;Erandur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Derkeethus\"&gt;Derkeethus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cicero\"&gt;Cicero&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20Initiate\"&gt;assassins&lt;/a&gt; can be formidable companions to keep Orchendor at bay. If the Dragonborn has not yet completed \"&lt;a href=\"A%20Daedra%27s%20Best%20Friend\"&gt;A Daedra's Best Friend&lt;/a&gt;\", then &lt;a href=\"Barbas%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Barbas&lt;/a&gt; can also distract Orchendor or even slay him outright due to the dog being a Daedra, and thus, invulnerable. Otherwise, beginning but not finishing \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20to%20the%20Ages\"&gt;Lost to the Ages&lt;/a&gt;\" features &lt;a href=\"Katria\"&gt;Katria&lt;/a&gt; who is also invincible as a spectral entity. Alternate summoned characters could include the &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Assassin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;spectral assassin&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"Karstaag%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Kaarstag&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce he is defeated, his valuables and loot should be taken, including the key to the Bthardamz Elevator. Exiting using the elevator will avoid retracing the long journey through Bthardamz.\n\"Well done, mortal. All things are in their order, and Orchendor roams the Pits. His betrayal will be punished, and your obedience is rewarded.\"\nUpon return, Peryite will reward the Dragonborn with the &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt; shield."}

The most ancient reference we have to this \"journaling onus\" comes from the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeriad\"&gt;Aldmeriad&lt;/a&gt;, the great origin saga of the &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt;, which quotes the god &lt;a href=\"Xarxes\"&gt;Xarxes&lt;/a&gt;, scribe to &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"As ye are true Children of the &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt;, thou shalt honor us by honoring thy own lives. For in each of you is housed the Divine Spark, and thus the record of thy actions is a sacred duty. Keep, therefore, each and every one of you, an &lt;a href=\"Oghma\"&gt;Oghma&lt;/a&gt;, an everscriven scroll which shall memorialize thy brief lives. Thus in at least this way shalt thy Spark be Immortal.\"\nIn the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt; culture hero &lt;a href=\"Ysgramor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ysgramor&lt;/a&gt; developed a runic alphabet based on Elvish principles, which enabled the written transcription of &lt;a href=\"Atmoran\"&gt;Atmoran&lt;/a&gt; speech. Ysgramor's first work in this new form of writing was a chronicle of his own life and its events, making Ysgramor the first human historian. Here is a quotation from the great hero himself, as recorded in \"&lt;a href=\"Songs%20of%20the%20Return\"&gt;Songs of the Return, Volume One&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Then, though I did feel a great ire against the perfidious Elves, and desired nothing more than to hie me hence to &lt;a href=\"Jylkurfyk\"&gt;Jylkurfyk&lt;/a&gt; and take ship back to Tamriel, where I could try the edge of &lt;a href=\"Wuuthrad%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wuuthrad&lt;/a&gt; against their all-too-many necks, yet I had beheld during my captivity that the wily Elves possessed much learning and knowledge, though they put it to ends both vile and dishonorable. And I bethought me that to defeat the Elves and scour them from the land, it would be well if Men also did wield such wisdoms. Therefore I strung Long-Launcher with the Woeful Bowstring and sought the marshes to the east, where dwelt &lt;a href=\"Faldrosta\"&gt;Faldrosta&lt;/a&gt; the great &lt;a href=\"Snow-Goose\"&gt;Snow-Goose&lt;/a&gt;. And I slew her with a hawk-fletched dart, and plucked of her a great quill, which I used to write down my speech as I had seen the Elves do. And I vowed that henceforth all Men would record their ideas and thoughts, just as &lt;a href=\"Shor\"&gt;Shor&lt;/a&gt; carved a record of his victory over &lt;a href=\"Sneggh\"&gt;Sneggh&lt;/a&gt; into the side of &lt;a href=\"Shivering%20Glacier\"&gt;Shivering Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. And in this way would the best ways of killing Elves be preserved.\"\nThis obligation was ratified again in the time of Saint &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt; and the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The demigod &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt;, \"The First Breath of Man,\" himself kept a chronicle that has come down to us as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Adabal-a\"&gt;The Adabal-a&lt;/a&gt;.\" One of its first precepts is \"On the Recordings of All that Haps\":\n\"Then Morihaus snorted, and spake fiercely against the Nonscriptionists, saying, 'Are then the deeds of the &lt;a href=\"Paravant\"&gt;Paravant&lt;/a&gt; to be forgotten by the men of hence-yore? Are the crimes of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Saliache&lt;/a&gt; to be erased, so that the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Pretexts%20for%20Mayhem\"&gt;Seven Pretexts for Mayhem&lt;/a&gt; shall seem all unjustified? Nay, by &lt;a href=\"Akatosh\"&gt;Akatosh&lt;/a&gt;! Nay, by the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20%28Lore%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; of Duration, who gave us Time so that events could unfold in their sequence, and thus be recalled as they happed! Never shall your ilk prevent our people from recording their tales, as did the overweening Saliache in the late torment-epoch!' And he did smite their heads from their shoulders, and their gore fell as words on the stones, recording then their several demises.\"\nSo, students, do not groan and complain of the burden, carping and caviling when your parents and teachers ask if you have written today in your journal. Because to do so is a right for which your ancestors paid in blood."}

Each reading of the Elder Scrolls is more profound than the last. Each leaves the priest blind for longer and longer periods of time. Finally, the last reading achieves a nearly sublime understanding of that scroll's contents, but the priest is left permanently blinded to the light of this world. No longer can he read the scrolls.\nThis monastery is dedicated to the service of these noble members of our order. They now live out their lives with the Ancestor Moths that they so love. Their underground demesnes are well suited to the moths. They raise and nurture the fragile creatures, singing to them constantly. They harvest the silk and spin it into bolts of cloth. They weave the cloth, embroidering it with the genealogies and histories of the ancestors that spun the silk. This is their new life.\nAs they tend the Ancestor Moths, so we tend the blind monks. While they toll in dark, we serve in the light. They need food and water. We provide. They need tools and furniture. We provide. They need secrecy and anonymity. We provide.

Both were trained on the Isle of &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt;, but when Galerion got Mannimarco expelled for his dabbling in forbidden necromantic arts, the self-styled Worm King simply relocated to continental &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; and took up his heinous pursuit in earnest. He is known to have sought out hidden manuscripts describing how the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Priests%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dragon Priest&lt;/a&gt; enthralled their &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Online%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt;, ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; tablets regarding the &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;summoning of spirits of the dead&lt;/a&gt;, and the Crimson Book of Skulls, which &lt;a href=\"Shalidor%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Shalidor&lt;/a&gt; himself had thought destroyed. Mannimarco has bragged of consorting with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra Lords&lt;/a&gt;, and may even have bargained with the Father of &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nMannimarco then set about spreading his blasphemous lore, enlisting unscrupulous mages, outcast witches, and vile &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt; into his necromantic network. He dubbed his new cult the Order of the Black Worm, in emulation\u2014or perhaps mockery\u2014of the monastic orders of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt;. In most parts of Tamriel, raising the dead was quite properly considered an atrocity, so the Worm Cult at first operated entirely as an underground, illicit organization. But Mannimarco, in addition to being a mighty necromancer, is a wise and wily diplomat, and in many jurisdictions he's persuaded, bribed, or intimidated the authorities into turning a blind eye to the Order's activities.\nWorse, in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, the King of Worms has even persuaded the ruling &lt;a href=\"House%20Tharn\"&gt;Tharns&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; to declare necromancy a legal magecraft, and the Order of the Black Worm has now taken the place of the Mages Guild as the authorized magical advisors to the Imperial Throne.\nA typical cell of the Order, known informally as a \"Worm Nest,\" is led by a necromancer who bears the title \"&lt;a href=\"Worm%20Anchorite\"&gt;Worm Anchorite&lt;/a&gt;.\" An Anchorite reports directly to Mannimarco, though their means of communication is as yet unknown. Beneath the Anchorite are Necromancer Adepts, Worm Warriors, and lackeys called Worm Thralls. New cultists are attracted by promises of great power for those who serve loyally, and all are sworn to secrecy on pain of &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Undeath&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegional plots are addressed in the secondary reports. An additional overheard rumor, at this time, is that the Order has opened negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;.

Some believe it is nothing more than a glorified social club for the movers and shakers of &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gideon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.

Harmless, they say. Just another amusement created in the back rooms of fancy inns and taverns. They could not be more wrong! The Order of the Waking Flame is much more than that. In reality, it is a dangerous &lt;a href=\"Daedric\"&gt;Daedric&lt;/a&gt; cult devoted to none other than the so-called Prince of Destruction, &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;!\nWhat do these fanatic Dagonists want? It's obvious, really. They seek nothing less than the total destruction of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps even of all of &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;! Allow me to explain in more detail.\nMy in-depth research has led me to the following conclusions. One: What appears to be a newly formed gathering of like-minded thinkers of wealth and means is, in fact, a large organization that has been operating in secret since at least the time of &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Moricar\"&gt;Emperor Moricar&lt;/a&gt;, and quite possibly even before that. Two: They are indeed a religious organization devoted to the tenets of a Daedric Prince. Three: The Daedric Prince they revere is Mehrunes Dagon, Prince of Destruction and Lord of Flood and Fire. Four: The cult has ties to the &lt;a href=\"Longhouse%20Emperors\"&gt;Longhouse Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, but unraveling that part of their history has been difficult, to say the least. Five: This humble chronicler believes the cult has come out of hiding because it is planning to perform some spectacular demonstration of its faith and devotion. I fear it will also be devastating, on the scale of a cataclysmic natural disaster.\nAs for the organization of the order itself, my research indicates that the group is led by a high priest whose identity has so far eluded me. Individual cells within the cult are under the command of powerful personages known as doombringers. Other high ranks include disastrix, razor, and devastator. Charming, am I right? If titles such as these don't speak to the true nature of this order, then allow me to pull back one final curtain.\nI was able to infiltrate a Waking Flame ceremony that took place in an old ruin near Gideon. It was a simple matter to follow a few suspected cultists, borrow one of their robes, and hang near the back to watch and observe. The ceremony I witnessed chilled me to the bone. A doombringer led the solemn ritual. It began with prayers and exultations to Dagon, though they mostly referred to him by one of his many overblown titles: O Exalted and Most Puissant Lord, Prince of Ambition, Father of Cataclysm, and the like. Then they called for Dagon to bless them with the power to accomplish his will on Nirn. Next came a complex and disturbing ritual that involved plumes of lava from nowhere, a violent storm that appeared over their altar, and curtains of fire and lightning rippling above the crowd. It was impressive and frightening at the same time.\nBefore I slipped away, I heard the doombringer proclaim, \"Lord Dagon, we stand ready! Lord Dagon, show us your Ambitions! Lord Dagon, your revolution is our revolution! Nirn shall be yours!\"\nI fear we've only heard the first verses of this chant. Destruction is coming, rapt readers. Be ready!"}

Their precise binding chants are still used to this day when summoning lesser &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;.\nNonbelligerent atronachs offered something of a boon to &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Direnni\"&gt;Clan Direnni&lt;/a&gt;, acting as protectors and occasionally servants or familiars. Even the naturally mischievous imp was easily coerced into behaving. But one can always count on the natural curiosity, and almost calamitous pomposity, of the Elves, who swung the door open still farther\u2014a door to the Daedric planes that became impossibly difficult to shut.\nLate into the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; acolytes first attempted to cajole enthrallment from Greater Daedra. Although the most skillful of conjurers succeeded reasonably against these chaotic agents, some Elves were weak, and the portal to Oblivion can now never be completely sealed. Subsequent catastrophic confrontations with &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20princes\"&gt;Daedric princes&lt;/a&gt; turned our lands to turmoil. Thus, it falls to every mage in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; to actively dissuade traffic with the Greater Daedra in the strongest possible manner. Communion with them is strictly forbidden."}

The Vestige needs to go to the Orrery and speak to &lt;a href=\"Daraneth\"&gt;Daraneth&lt;/a&gt; before the ritual can begin.\nOn the way to the Orrery, the Vestige can see &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt; trying to get into the ceremony, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0refusing to leave and\u00a0reassuring his sister, and King &lt;a href=\"Aeradan\"&gt;Aeradan&lt;/a&gt; successfully 'sneaking' into the ceremony.\nThe Orrery itself is a large &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruin&lt;/a&gt; with a spinning orb in its main room, where the ceremony takes place. Dareneth is directly across from the orb, on the stairs when the Vestige goes to meet her. Dareneth recalls seeing the Vestige in &lt;a href=\"Southpoint%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt; and tells them how to activate the Orrery. The Vestige needs to use &lt;a href=\"Rajhin%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Rajhin's Mantle&lt;/a&gt; to be in more than one place at once. However, a mage warned Dareneth not to let anyone keep the mantle on for too long\u2014one wearer went insane.\u00a0\nThe Vestige activates the pillars behind the Orrery while thinking they will \"never be held in place\", the key thing to remember when wearing the mantle. The Queen, her brother and King Camoran enter the Orrery's main room while the Vestige does so. Prince Naemon dismisses the Orrery, calling it a heap of moss and rubble. King Camoran is excited to see it work since he often snuck into the Orrery to see it spin.\nDareneth gives the Vestige the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Anumaril\"&gt;Heart of Anumaril&lt;/a&gt; to place in the pillar next to the royal observers. The Orrery awakens, which brings stairs up from the ground. However, Prince Naemon won't allow Queen Ayrenn to go first and tests it on himself. He is transformed into a huge monster, and the Vestige is forced to kill him. He freezes the group in place, but the Vestige uses Rajhin's Mantle to escape. He has a lot of Area of Effect attacks, so dodge them.\nOnce he is defeated, his body transforms back into its regular form. The Vestige apologizes to Queen Ayrenn, and it is her turn to use the Orrery. She emerges from the Orrery in a blue-green light as herself. Inside the Orrery, she saw a vision of peace. She asks the Vestige to stand at her side and help her build the future."}

But I've begun to see the wisdom in her decision.\nSimply put, the High Elves don't know how to handle werewolves. I suppose it's just not much of an issue on this island, given its isolation. As long as we play it smart, we should be able to keep out of the public eye for quite some time.\nThere's also the lack of competition. Packs are notoriously territorial, after all. We've lost so many to past conflicts. But I suspect there are few other werewolves here, much less an entire pack. We're more likely to gain numbers than lose them.\nSpeaking of gaining numbers, I'm glad our den mother is finally listening to reason. We need to strengthen our pack, and the only way to do that is through force. There are few here who would freely accept our blessing. Capturing and turning travelers may be risky, but we must fortify our numbers in case of attack.\nOur newest acquisition should do nicely.

It seems she was implicated when one of her friends stole a sword from the leader of the gang.\"\nWalkthrough.\nTo begin this quest, travel to Frostmere Crypt to find a group of &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt; attacking one of their own, a female named &lt;a href=\"Eisa%20Blackthorn\"&gt;Eisa Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;. If Eisa survives on her own or through any intervention, the Dragonborn may speak to her and find out that one of her comrades stole a sword from the leader of the gang. She tells the Dragonborn that they can go find the stolen sword inside the crypt. After this, she offers no further dialogue options. If she dies or is found dead, her body can be looted for her &lt;a href=\"Eisa%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;, which gives the Dragonborn the quest upon reading it, as well as some background information on the quest. If the quest glitches and Eisa is merely standing outside Frostmere Crypt, the quest can be acquired without killing her by searching Eisa's inventory in sneak mode and reading her journal. (It is not necessary to pickpocket the journal.) If she survives, she flees to the &lt;a href=\"Moorside%20Inn\"&gt;Moorside Inn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt; and remains there for the duration of the quest, if she makes it there alive as there will be enemies along the road she will engage before reaching Morthal, and depending on the Dragonborn's level, she may be able to deal with them on her own or need help to make it to Morthal in one piece.\nFrostmere Crypt.\nUpon entering the crypt, there will be a direct line of view looking down at two bandits, seated at a table down some stairs. There is a third bandit (a mage) hiding in an alcove that rushes in from the right. Directly ahead is a gate; pull its opening chain and continue through the passage.\nThis passage forks, off to the right into a barred iron door (which will be passed through after completing the dungeon), so turn left for now and continue on along a precarious walkway, caged in by iron bars. After crossing it, it will lead to a decently sized room with a bandit. To the left is a weapon rack with some loot on it; the path to continue on is to the right.\nOptional objective.\nAt this point, the quest guide should have updated to say that \"In Frostmere Crypt, the bandit &lt;a href=\"Ra%27jirr\"&gt;Ra'jirr&lt;/a&gt; stole a sword from the gang's leader in order to stop the 'Pale Lady,' a mysterious figure haunting his dreams. He fled into the tunnels below the ruin, with the bandit leader in pursuit.\" The Dragonborn is told to follow &lt;a href=\"Kyr\"&gt;Kyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ra%27jirr\"&gt;Ra'jirr&lt;/a&gt; into the tunnels.\nAfter taking the right out of the caged walkway, across from an opening which allows for spying on some bandits talking, there is a room with &lt;a href=\"Kyr%27s%20Log\"&gt;Kyr's Log&lt;/a&gt; and a chest that can be looted. Take the log and exit the room to the left. The room will contain &lt;a href=\"Ra%27jirr%27s%20Note\"&gt;Ra'jirr's Note&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eisa%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Eisa's Journal&lt;/a&gt; (if it was not taken off her corpse). Take this, and backtrack to the two bandits that were heard chatting at the table, just a short distance out the door and to the left.\n&lt;a href=\"Frostmere%20Depths\"&gt;Frostmere Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalk to Kyr. He will explain that he was ambushed by Ra'jirr. After speaking to him, he will die, triggering the gong that signals the dungeon being marked \"cleared.\" Continue down the path to find Ra'jirr fighting &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale%20Lady%20%28Creature%29\"&gt;The Pale Lady&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;wisps&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt this point, the quest can be completed one of two ways: Banish them all by killing them, or loot &lt;a href=\"The%20Pale%20Blade\"&gt;The Pale Blade&lt;/a&gt; from Ra'jirr's corpse and place it on the stand ahead."}

Discover the wreckage of &lt;a href=\"The%20Patchwork%20Airship\"&gt;The Patchwork Airship&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\n\"I found the wreckage of a crashed airship, and read the journal of its captain. It seems the crew had been commissioned to locate and explore Hrothmund's Barrow in search of some magic item. Before they could set down, the airship got caught in a surprise snowstorm and crashed into the mountains. I should get this journal to the man who sponsored the expedition -- Louis Beauchamp, at the Ald'ruhn Guild of Mages on Vvardenfell\"\nWalkthrough.\nIf you have the \"Bloodmoon\" expansion installed, you will find a Breton named Louis Beauchamp standing outside the Ald'ruhn Mages Guild. Talk to him and he will tell you that he built a Dwemer Airship, and he hired a crew to fly it to Solstheim and find Hrothmund's Bane. He has not heard from them in a while and is growing worried, so he will send you to investigate what happened to them. If you intend to do this quest in one go, it is a good idea to use a &lt;a href=\"Mark\"&gt;Mark&lt;/a&gt; spell near Louis Beauchamp, as you will be returning here a number of times and the distance between Ald'ruhn and Solstheim is quite big.\nHead to Solstheim and start looking for the airship. You will find that it has crashed just northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Thrond%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Altar of Thrond&lt;/a&gt;, which is directly to the west of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Fjalding%20%28Bloodmoon%29\"&gt;Lake Fjalding&lt;/a&gt;. The corpses of a number of the crew members can be found lying around the ship. The captain's corpse can be found nearby on a bedroll, with his journal lying next to him. The journal will tell you that the airship was not nearly as sturdy as Beauchamp thought it would be, and it crashed during a blizzard. Take the journal with you.\nShow the journal to Louis Beauchamp back in Ald'ruhn. he will say that he is disappointed that the airship crashed and the crew died, but he really needs the Amulet of Infectious Charm, which is located in Hrothmund's Bane. He will ask the Nerevarine to head back to Solstheim, find the Amulet, and deliver it back to him.\nHead back to Solstheim and make your way to Hrothmund's Bane. It will be just north of where you found the airship. Once there, look for a cave called Hrothmund's Barrow. If you have previously completed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Mead%20Hall%20Massacre\"&gt;The Mead Hall Massacre&lt;/a&gt;,\" you will already be familiar with this location. When you try to enter, a voice will ask you a question. answer \"Ondjage.\" Giving the wrong answer to this question will permanently close the barrow, making it impossible to complete either this quest or \"The Mead Hall Massacre.\" The amulet you are looking for will be lying on the pedestal with Hrothmund's Axe.\nDeliver the amulet back to Louis Beauchamp in Ald'ruhn and he will reward you with 1500 ."}
