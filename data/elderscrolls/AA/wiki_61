If properly prepared, there are no ill effects.\nAnother common potion is that of &lt;a href=\"Restore%20Fatigue%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;restore fatigue&lt;/a&gt;.

The interplay between Anu and Padomay created what is known as the &lt;a href=\"Aurbis\"&gt;Aurbis&lt;/a&gt;. After this, other beings began to form from the Void. The first among these were &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; who were both the birthed souls of Anui-El and Sithis respectively.

With the genesis of time, the turbulent Aurbis began to stabilize and other &lt;a href=\"et%27Ada\"&gt;et'Ada&lt;/a&gt; were able to form their own identities, distinct from each other, and hundreds of other divine beings were formed.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAccording to various sources, the Aurbis is represented as a deity, which is usually associated with implementing the different stages of the Kalpa, and is credited for being the force that enabled other &lt;a href=\"Et%27Ada\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; to form."}

In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane. That act forever sundered the &lt;a href=\"Elves\"&gt;Elves&lt;/a&gt; from the spirit's world of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original &lt;a href=\"Aldmer\"&gt;Aldmer&lt;/a&gt; against the armies of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt;.

He then ascended to Heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\nThe Chantry of Auri-El.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Snow%20Elves\"&gt;Snow Elves&lt;/a&gt; constructed a large temple called \"The &lt;a href=\"Chantry%20of%20Auri-El\"&gt;Chantry of Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;,\" which encompasses many caves and the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The Chantry was reportedly the most significant place of Snow Elf worship for any Elven god, and was the main place of worship for Auri-El. The Chantry has several &lt;a href=\"Wayshrines%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Wayshrines&lt;/a&gt;, which pilgrims are required to visit in order to gain an audience with the Arch-Curate, in the Inner Sanctum of the Chantry. The Arch-Curate is presumably the religious leader responsible for Snow Elf worship of Auri-El. Because of the isolated nature of the location, it is understood that it may be the last location of pure Snow Elves who have not been tainted by the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, however it is possible that there are isolated groups elsewhere in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyranny of the Sun Prophecy.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight-Paladin%20Gelebor\"&gt;Knight-Paladin Gelebor's&lt;/a&gt; brother &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a &lt;a href=\"Vampire\"&gt;Vampire&lt;/a&gt;. Because Auri-El did not cure him as he had requested, Vyrthur believed that Auri-El had turned his back on him, so he vowed revenge on the god. This resulted in Vyrthur writing the prophecy that the Sun would be blocked out by a vampire. He did this to limit Auri-El's influence on &lt;a href=\"Mundus\"&gt;Mundus&lt;/a&gt;, because he knew that he could not actually confront the god.\nDawnguard.\nIn , part of the main questline requires the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; to find and secure &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow\"&gt;Auriel's Bow&lt;/a&gt;. Auriel's Bow is a weapon that supposedly draws its power from the sun, and is part of a prophecy foreshadowing the blocking-out of the sun. &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Auriel's Shield&lt;/a&gt; may also be found in the Forgotten Vale. In &lt;a href=\"Darkfall%20Cave\"&gt;Darkfall Cave&lt;/a&gt;, the Dragonborn encounters one of the two remaining known Snow-Elves (also known as Ancient Falmer), named Knight-Paladin Gelebor. Gelebor gives a brief history of his race, and their beliefs. He explains that Auri-El is known by many names, and that he was the main god for the Snow-Elf race."}

Known as the \"crown jewel\" of the Summerset Archipelago and \"gateway to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;,\" this fair isle is said to have long been home to some of the friendliest and most outgoing &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, who have been hardened by generations of repelling invaders, pirates, &lt;a href=\"Sload\"&gt;Sload&lt;/a&gt;, and plagues.\nBackground.\nAuridon is home to the port-cities of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skywatch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;, and the island is well known for its gleaming spires of marble and glass and beautiful Altmeri architecture. For millennia, the infamous slug-like race known as the Sload, of the island of &lt;a href=\"Thras\"&gt;Thras&lt;/a&gt;, notorious for their mastery of necromancy, have terrorized the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; of Auridon, conjuring beasts of the sea along the coastline, and laying siege to the cities that dotted it. The horrors they have laid upon the land are still remembered today: the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Skywatch\"&gt;Sack of Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"1E%201301\"&gt;1E 1301&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Uvichil\"&gt;War of the Uvichil&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"1E%202911\"&gt;1E 2911&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"1E%202917\"&gt;1E 2917&lt;/a&gt; are among the most horrific events in Tamriel's history.\nBefore the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Aldmeri%20Dominion%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; by Ayrenn in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, internal strife between Skywatch and Firsthold often sparked into full war during the First Era and early Second Era. The &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, an ethnocentric terrorist organization based in Auridon led by a mysterious person known as the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Queen\"&gt;Veiled Queen&lt;/a&gt;, made it their mission to bring down &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Ayrenn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Queen Ayrenn&lt;/a&gt; and make the Dominion an Altmer-only alliance. They believe that the Altmer are the \"rightful rulers\" of Tamriel and that they should be ruling over all other races.\nLocations.\nThe following are locations accessible in Auridon and, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Online%29\"&gt;unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt;, are discoverable on the map. Points of Interest serve as locations with unique side quests, while &lt;a href=\"Cities%20%28Online%29\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; serve as the centralized areas with multiple sublocations and act as a hub for services and &lt;a href=\"Merchants%20%28Online%29\"&gt;merchants&lt;/a&gt;. Explanations of the types of locations are provided in the &lt;a href=\"Locations%20%28Online%29%23Types\"&gt;main locations page&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nAuridon features a series of zone story quests and unrelated side quests. The zone story quests tie into the Aldmeri Dominion's overarching storyline and carries on from &lt;a href=\"Khenarthi%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Khenarthi's Roost&lt;/a&gt; before continuing to &lt;a href=\"Grahtwood\"&gt;Grahtwood&lt;/a&gt;, but it is not necessary to complete the story quests for zones prior to those in Auridon. Side quests are non-sequential and can be completed in any order, except where one carries on from another, and &lt;a href=\"repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt; can be completed multiple times: weekly for arenas and trials and daily for all others. Pointer quests are optional zone quests that send the Vestige to the tarting location of another zone quest.\nItem sets.\nItem sets are related armor and weapons that, when worn together, provide unique benefits. Overland sets can be acquired from world bosses, world events, delves, public dungeons and containers and as quest rewards; dungeon sets can be acquired from within group dungeons; monster sets can be acquired from the final boss of veteran group dungeons and Undaunted Enclaves; and crafted sets can be created at specific locations across the zone.\nSkyshards.\nSixteen Skyshards can be found in Auridon totaling in five &lt;a href=\"skill%20points\"&gt;skill points&lt;/a&gt; with one left over. The zone guide provides clues as to the location of each Skyshard, but many can be found simply by exploring and watching for the distinctive pillar of light they emit. Skyshards will appear on the map and compass when the Vestige is close to one and will remain discovered on the map even if it was not collected.\nAchievements.\nAchievements can be earned by completing specific tasks such as completing quests and discovering locations. Achievements are separated into categories and their progress is viewable from the journal. Earning achievement provides the Vestige a number of points, and some achievements unlock unique rewards such as &lt;a href=\"Furnishings%20%28Online%29\"&gt;furnishings&lt;/a&gt; that can be bought from Achievement Furnishers or &lt;a href=\"collectibles\"&gt;collectibles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShalidor's Library.\nThirty-two books that are a part of Shalidor's Library can be found in Auridon and added to the collection. Books that have already been found in other zones will already be marked as completed in the zone tracker.\nFish.\nFish can be caught from fishing hotspots, ideally with the correct &lt;a href=\"bait\"&gt;bait&lt;/a&gt;. Common fish will be caught most often while rare fish and alternative bait are rare catches. Each zone has unique rare fish than can be caught from hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Slaughterfish%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Slaughterfish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trodh\"&gt;trodh&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from foul hotspots, &lt;a href=\"dhufish\"&gt;dhufish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"longfin\"&gt;longfin&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from saltwater hotspots, &lt;a href=\"silverside%20perch\"&gt;silverside perch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spadetail\"&gt;spadetail&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from lake hotspots, and &lt;a href=\"Salmon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"River%20Betty%20%28Online%29\"&gt;river betty&lt;/a&gt; can be caught from river hotspots. &lt;a href=\"Chub\"&gt;Chub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"minnow\"&gt;minnow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shad\"&gt;shad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fish%20roe\"&gt;fish roe&lt;/a&gt; can be caught and used as bait from foul, saltwater, lake and river hotspots, respectively."}

The witch (after the Hero had kidnapped her great-granddaughter for her) informed them that the Bow could be found in a far-away dungeon, scattered among other rusty equipment.\nThe Bow's location was also offered to the Hero by a mage who had angered &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt;. However, a few moments after the Hero took the Bow from its location, it fell apart, having been little more than an elaborate fake.\n Nearly twenty-five years later, in the year 3E 427, the Bow was found in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Ralyn%20Othravel\"&gt;Ralyn Othravel&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Therana%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Therana&lt;/a&gt; discovered this fact, having smelled something \"like ash yams\" (it must be noted that Therana was rather eccentric) in Othravel's vicinity around the Ghostgate. She then sent the Nerevarine on a task to &lt;a href=\"Auriel%27s%20Bow%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;take the Bow&lt;/a&gt; from Othravel. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Museum%20of%20Artifacts\"&gt;Museum of Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in &lt;a href=\"Mournhold%20%28Tribunal%29\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt; offered the Nerevarine 15,000 for the legendary weapon.\nOnce again, the legendary weapon then disappeared, this time for more than two centuries. In what has turned out to be the Bow's most recent appearance, it was rediscovered by the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Last Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; in 4E 201 within the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, hidden deep inside the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The Bow was the key to the success of the &lt;a href=\"Volkihar%20Clan\"&gt;Volkihar Clan's&lt;/a&gt; plan to fulfill the &lt;a href=\"Tyranny%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Tyranny of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; prophecy, although the Bow was used to kill the Clan's leader &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Harkon\"&gt;Lord Harkon&lt;/a&gt; before it could be fulfilled by the Volkihar Clan.\nPower.\nAuriel's Bow draws its power directly from Aetherius, using the sun as a gateway. The Tyranny of the Sun prophecy had been based on this fact, as the bow drew its power from the sun, it could be used as a tool against it. Despite this direct relationship (which caused the Bow's arrows to appear as if on fire), however, the Bow had also been known to have several other effects, while at other times, had seemingly no effects at all.\nKnown abilities.\nThe Bow is known to have had many abilities, although these varied between its appearances. Below is a list of all known powers the Bow possessed."}

It is central to the &lt;a href=\"Quests%20%28Dawnguard%29%23Main%20quest\"&gt;main questline&lt;/a&gt; and is a &lt;a href=\"Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; which has a unique effect.\nHistory.\nAuriel's bow was said to have been carried into battle by &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; against the forces of &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Ehlnofey\"&gt;Ehlnofey&lt;/a&gt; wars of the &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20Era\"&gt;Dawn Era&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Trinimac\"&gt;Trinimac&lt;/a&gt; defeated Lorkhan and tore out his &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, Auri-El fastened it to an arrow and shot it long into the sea, where &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; eventually formed.\nIts craftsmanship is said to have no equal in all of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The bow draws its power from &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; itself, channeling it through the sun. Therefore, when an arrow is loosed from the bow, it produces a magical effect very similar to being burned by &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Damage%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchantment.\nThe bow enchantment deals 20 points of &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Damage%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;sun damage&lt;/a&gt;. This damage is tripled if the target is an undead.\nIn addition to the enchantment, Auriel's Bow appears to have faster draw speed than a regular bow. Fully nocking an arrow with the &lt;a href=\"Quick%20Shot\"&gt;Quick Shot&lt;/a&gt; perk takes less than a second.\nUsefulness.\nAuriel's bow has a lower damage value as compared to other bows, but its innate ability to inflict fire damage more than compensates for this. Players can sneak up on undead creatures and attack for a total of up to nine times damage if they have unlocked the &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Aim\"&gt;Deadly Aim&lt;/a&gt; perk of the &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; tree. The damage can be further multiplied by investing five perk points to the Overdraw perk in the &lt;a href=\"Archery%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Archery&lt;/a&gt; skill tree, increasing damage output by 100%. Its usefulness is also seen during encounters with &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt;, as they not only possess a weakness to fire, but are also undead.\nAcquisition.\nThe bow is acquired in the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Vale\"&gt;Forgotten Vale&lt;/a&gt;. It is obtained at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Touching%20the%20Sky%20%28Quest%29\"&gt;Touching the Sky&lt;/a&gt;,\" after defeating &lt;a href=\"Arch-Curate%20Vyrthur\"&gt;Arch-Curate Vyrthur&lt;/a&gt;.\nSmithing.\nIt can be upgraded with a &lt;a href=\"refined%20moonstone\"&gt;refined moonstone&lt;/a&gt; ingot at a &lt;a href=\"grindstone\"&gt;grindstone&lt;/a&gt; and also benefits from the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Smithing\"&gt;Elven Smithing&lt;/a&gt; perk, which doubles the improvement.\nArrows.\nIn addition to regular arrows, two special types of arrows can be used with Auriel's Bow, each with their own unique effect:\nSunhallowed Arrows.\n\"Causes sunburst attacks to nearby targets if shot at the sun with Auriel's Bow\"\nShooting a &lt;a href=\"Sunhallowed%20Elven%20Arrow\"&gt;Sunhallowed Elven Arrow&lt;/a&gt; from Auriel's Bow at the sun will cause the sun to undergo an explosion, causing beams of harmful sunlight to rain down on all enemies similar to the effect of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Call\"&gt;Storm Call&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nShooting a Sunhallowed Elven Arrow from Auriel's Bow at an enemy will cause the sun damage to become an area of effect explosion at the point of impact, similar to &lt;a href=\"Vampire%27s%20Bane%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Vampire's Bane&lt;/a&gt;.\nBloodcursed Arrows.\n\"Shrouds the sun in sudden darkness when shot with Auriel's Bow\"\nShooting a &lt;a href=\"Bloodcursed%20Elven%20Arrow\"&gt;Bloodcursed Elven Arrow&lt;/a&gt; from Auriel's Bow at the sun will cause a shroud of darkness around the sun, which will dissipate to reveal a black hole-like anomaly\u00a0replacing the sun. This\u00a0creates a false-night in which a vampire is unaffected by the daylight. This effect will continue for an entire day in-game.\u00a0It can cause vampire attacks to happen inside towns during the day.\u00a0"}

It was fought primarily between the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt; Forces of &lt;a href=\"Umaril\"&gt;Umaril&lt;/a&gt;. The Crisis was the work of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Ayleid\"&gt;Ayleid&lt;/a&gt; Sorcerer-King Umaril the Unfeathered, who, after centuries of imprisonment, was released from the &lt;a href=\"Waters%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Waters&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; to wreak his unholy vengeance on the gods that had masterminded his first downfall at the hands of the Divine Crusader, &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing his servants, the Daedric warriors of &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; known as Aurorans, Umaril launched an all out attack on the established Church of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Nine Divines&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;. The Aurorans' attacks consisted of entering one of Cyrodiil's Great Chapels, killing the staff, and desecrating the altars with bloody runes written in &lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleidoon&lt;/a&gt;. This began at &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Attack on Chapel Anvil drew attention from all around Cyrodiil, and eventually drew the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, Champion of Cyrodiil and hero of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Guided by the words of a mysterious &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero set out on a quest to recover the lost Crusader's Relics of Pelinal Whitestrake. During the course of this quest, the Hero would revive a knightly order dedicated to the Nine Divines, the Knights of the Nine. These Knights, led by the new Divine Crusader, were eventually able to defeat Umaril once and for all.\nHistory.\nIn the First Era of Tamriel, Umaril the Unfeathered was one of the Ayleid Sorceror-Kings of ancient Cyrodiil. During this time, the Ayleids' human slaves rebelled, led by the legendary Slave-Queen, &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Alessia&lt;/a&gt;. Alessia's Rebellion pitted the humans against their cruel Ayleid masters in a bloody conflict that would span many years. Into this fray came &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, who pledged himself to Alessia's cause and, wielding armor and weapons crafted by the gods themselves, led the humans to victory after victory against the Ayleids.\nWhen it was apparent that Pelinal was a truly worthy foe, Umaril called him out to fight. Pelinal answered the call, and the rebels converged on &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the Ayleid kingdom. During the great Siege of White Gold Tower, Pelinal entered the throne room and challenged Umaril. There they fought, and Pelinal succeeded in defeating the great king, denting his helm into ugliness and cutting off his unfeathered wings. In a rage, the other Ayleid kings fell upon Pelinal and cut him into eighths before being killed themselves. Pelinal's head was still alive when it was found, and he foretold the return of Umaril, for though the Crusader's Relics had defeated Umaril's physical form, his Daedric spirit lived on, sustained by the power of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. With that, Pelinal died; Alessia's rebellion was successful, and the world forgot the Whitestrake's final prophecy.\nKnights of the Nine.\nThe Crusader's Relics were not forgotten. Pelinal's armor and weapons that had been made by the Eight Divines were scattered and lost until the early &lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;. In the year 3E 111, &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel%20Lannus\"&gt;Sir Amiel Lannus&lt;/a&gt;, a follower of the Nine Divines, formed a group of holy knights dedicated to recovering and preserving the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%27s%20Relics\"&gt;Crusader's Relics&lt;/a&gt;. They fashioned themselves the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Knights of the Nine&lt;/a&gt;, and together succeeded in reuniting the lost Relics.\nAfter the slaying of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrm%20of%20Elynglenn\"&gt;Wyrm of Elynglenn&lt;/a&gt; and recovering the &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Cuirass of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, Sir Amiel and his Knights rose to fame. The greatest knights of the time were lining up to join. One of the more prominent members to join was &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Berich%20Vlindrel\"&gt;Sir Berich Vlindrel&lt;/a&gt;, scion of one of the great noble families of &lt;a href=\"Colovia\"&gt;Colovia&lt;/a&gt;. After he joined it was clear that the Knights were by far the most prestigious of all knightly orders in the day.\nTheir twilight was to be the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Red%20Diamond\"&gt;War of the Red Diamond&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the nine Knights that had joined the order came from distinct families from either side of the civil war, and it was Sir Berich that first left, taking the Sword and Greaves of the Crusader with him. In his flight, he killed fellow Knight Sir Caius, who tried to stop him leaving. After that, the order fractured. The Knights scattered, either seeking more Relics or entering war with them. In time, the Relics were lost again, and Sir Amiel was left alone in the Priory of the Nine, the last remaining Knight.\nAt some point, Amiel discovered the location of the Helm of the Crusader, hidden in the ruin of &lt;a href=\"Vanua\"&gt;Vanua&lt;/a&gt;, which itself held the Shrine of the Crusader, where Pelinal's head had given its prophecy and died. In 3E 153, Sir Amiel entered the Shrine and attempted to recover the Helm, and there died. 22 years prior, Sir Berich had a decree passed that officially dissolved the Knights of the Nine, and they faded into history.\nUmaril's Return.\nIt would be many years before talk of Pelinal Whitestrake, Umaril the Unfeathered, the Crusader's Relics, or the Knights of the Nine would surface again. As chance would have it, all returned shortly after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. Even as Tamriel celebrated the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Forces%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Daedric Forces of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, another threat brewed behind the scenes that had remained dormant for centuries.\nIt is unknown when exactly Umaril returned. It is possible that the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s gave him the ability to re-enter the mortal plane. But his spirit, which had been rejuvenating in the &lt;a href=\"Waters%20of%20Oblivion\"&gt;Waters of Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; since his death, was imbued in a physical body once more, in the manner that a &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; is reborn. Umaril set up a base in the ruins of the western-most Ayleid outpost, &lt;a href=\"Garlas%20Malatar%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Garlas Malatar&lt;/a&gt;, and summoned to him Aurorans, the Daedric warriors of his mistress &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. Now, returned and possessing both power and soldiers, Umaril the Unfeathered had one thing on his agenda: the destruction of the gods that had caused his first defeat. He set his sights on the Church of the Nine Divines.\nThe first attack was swift, and foreseen by no one. An assault was carried out on the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0in the city\u00a0of Anvil. Aurorans entered the chapel undetected, and killed its staff, and desecrated it. Blood was splattered everywhere, pews and altars knocked about, and around the main altar were set bloody runes in the Ayleidoon:\nThe chapel was discovered desecrated, and panic swept across Cyrodiil. Shortly after the event, a mysterious &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt; appeared in Anvil with no explanation. Across the street from the chapel he began to preach daily to the citizens. Claiming to be a holy man of the Nine Divines, he foretold the return of Umaril and the downfall of the gods unless a hero stepped forward to answer the Divines' call for a champion. Some took the Prophet for a fake, others simply dismissed him, and still others were wary of what he said and took heed of the unholy doom. In time, word of him and the Anvil chapel attack would reach the ears of none other than the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Pilgrim's Way.\nThe Hero arrived in Anvil, seeking after the rumors about the chapel attack. There the Hero beheld the desecrated chapel, and afterwards went to listen to the Prophet. The Hero approached the Prophet and questioned him about the attack. The Prophet told the Hero all that he knew about the return of Umaril and the need for a new &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Crusader\"&gt;Divine Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. When the Hero denounced all his claims to fame, and swore to walk humbly in the eyes of the Nine, The Prophet told him to walk the &lt;a href=\"Pilgrimage%20%28Knights%20of%20the%20Nine%29\"&gt;Pilgrim's Way&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient rite that would determine whether or not the Hero was a worthy knight. The Hero walked the Pilgrim's Way, visiting each of the Wayshrines to the Nine in the wilderness of Cyrodiil. Following a map given by the Prophet, the Hero managed to complete the pilgrimage, and was then given a vision.\n&lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt;, the Divine Crusader of legend, came to the Hero on a cloudy plane above Cyrodiil, and spoke on Umaril's return. Pelinal gave the Hero the location of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Helm of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, and also gave his blessing. After the vision, the Hero proceeded to Vanua, which held the Shrine of the Crusader, which itself held the ancient Helm.\nThe Hero fought to the Shrine, and there found the remains of &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel\"&gt;Sir Amiel&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Amiel%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Sir Amiel's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, the Hero learned that the &lt;a href=\"Cuirass%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Cuirass of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; was in the &lt;a href=\"Priory%20of%20the%20Nine%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Priory of the Nine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"West%20Weald\"&gt;West Weald&lt;/a&gt;. After recovering the Helm, the Hero left Vanua, and proceeded west, to the long-forgotten home of the Knights of the Nine.\nThe Relic Quest Begins.\nIn the Priory, the Hero was able to use Amiel's ring to enter the basement and the undercroft. There, the spirits of the original Knights of the Nine appeared and attacked the Hero one by one. The Hero proved his worth as a knight, defeating them all and gaining access to the Cuirass. Once it was recovered, the ghostly Knights told the tale of their downfall, and from four of them the Hero learned the location of four of the missing Relics.\nLeaving the Priory, the Hero went to each of the locations the Knights had described. At the Shrine and Grove of Kynareth, the Hero recovered the Boots of the Crusader. In Leyawiin, using the Boots, the Hero passed Zenithar's Test of Faith and recovered the Mace of the Crusader. But his actions were not unnoticed. Whether Umaril knew of the Hero's quest, or was merely putting his plan into action, is unknown. But two chapels next came under attack. The Great Chapel of Mara in Bravil was assaulted and desecrated, while the Chapel of Zenithar was attacked even as the Hero emerged with the holy Mace. Leyawiin's chapel escaped undesecration due to the vigilance of the Hero and a knight named Carodus Oholin. After the battle, Oholin, having heard rumors of the Hero's quest, asked to join him, and to become a Knight of the Nine. The Hero accepted Oholin's request.\nThe Hero went on to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Chapel%20of%20Stendarr\"&gt;Great Chapel of Stendarr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Chorrol&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Gauntlets%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Gauntlets of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; had lain unmmovable for years due to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Casimir\"&gt;Sir Casimir&lt;/a&gt;'s murder while wearing them. The Hero repealed Casimir's actions by selflessly taking on the curse that had been placed on Casimir's family. With this act of mercy, the Hero was able to pick up the Gauntlets. Some time later, the Hero succeeded in recovering the Shield of the Crusader from the ruins of Fort Bulwark. There, he also rescued Sir Thedret, a fellow knight, who had been imprisoned and tortured by a group of rogue Conjurers seeking the Shield. Thedret immediately pledged himself to the Hero's cause. Now, with all four known Relics, the Hero returned to the Priory to seek more information on the other two.\nThe Knights Restored.\nAt the Priory, the Hero was greeted by a host of individuals. There was Avita Vesnia, a priestess of Kynareth; Carodus Oholin; Areldur, a priest of Stendarr; two brothers, Gukimir and Geimund; and Sir Thedret, who acted as the Hero's second-in-command. All sought to become Knights of the Nine. The Hero was suddenly at the head of a restored order. The prospective Knights, in the Hero's absence, had restored the Priory to its former glory. Once more, there were true defenders of the Faith.\nYet there was another in the Priory; Lathon, the squire of a knight named Sir Roderic, whom the Hero had met while on Pilgrimage, arrived to inform the Hero of Roderic's fate. After completing his Pilgrimage, Roderic had received a vision from none other than Sir Berich, the one former Knight who did not stand with the other ghosts in the Priory's undercroft. Berich had been overtaken by the evil that had ensnared him when he killed Sir Caius with the Sword of the Crusader. Roderic and Lathon had traveled to Underpall Cave to put Berich's ghost to rest, but it was to no avail. Upon reaching the bottom of the cave, they were confronted by the Wraith of Lord Vlindrel\u2014Sir Berich. Roderic instructed Lathon to flee while he faced the Wraith. Lathon escaped, and went to the Priory. Lathon then gave the Hero the Greaves of the Crusader, which he and Sir Roderic had recovered from Lord Vlindrel's tomb. The last Relic, the Sword of the Crusader, was possessed by none other than the Wraith. Lathon then asked to become a Knight of the Nine, to avenge his fallen lord. The Hero accepted, and together they journeyed to Underpall Cave.\nIn the depths, they found the body of Sir Roderic alongside Berich Vlindrel's tomb. On the shores of a great underground lake, they fought the great Wraith, and succeeded in avenging Sir Roderic and recovering the Sword of the Crusader. Lathon returned to the Priory to deliver the news to the other Knights, while the Hero traveled to Cheydinal to reconsecrate the Sword, which had been dragged into evil with Sir Berich. Umaril, who had remained dormant for some time, chose this moment to &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Chapel%20Cheydinhal\"&gt;strike out&lt;/a&gt;. The Hero was forced to fight through Aurorans to reach the chapel's main altar, where the Sword was reconsecrated by the power of Arkay. All eight of the Relics had been recovered. Now the reborn Knights of the Nine were ready to attack Umaril.\nUmaril the Unfeathered.\nAt the Priory, the Hero was surprised to see the mysterious Prophet who had begun the Hero's journey. The Prophet commended the Hero on the recovery of the Relics, and said that Umaril was based in Garlas Malatar and there he had to be defeated. The Prophet then told the Hero of Umaril's Daedric nature, and that the power of the eight Relics alone would not defeat him. Since the Unfeathered's first defeat, the Eight Divines had become Nine, and the Prophet bestowed upon the Hero the final Crusader's Relic: The Blessing of Talos. Now, with the Prophet's blessing, the Knights of the Nine left for Garlas Malatar and the final battle with the Aurorans.\nAt Garlas Malatar, they attacked on the Hero's orders. Storming the fortress, they fought off the Aurorans stationed there. They made their way past the first level relatively easily. It was on the second level that they met powerful resistance. A Dark Orb there allowed the Aurorans to return to life after being killed. The task fell to the Hero to destroy the Orb before all the Knights were killed. When the Orb shattered, all time fell still, and friend and foe alike vanished. The Hero was left alone in Garlas Malatar, and proceeded to the final level and the battle with Umaril.\nIn the throne chamber, the Hero came face to face with his foe. In a blaze of light, Umaril appeared, and the two . Umaril was a powerful opponent, but the Crusader's Relics, designed to weaken Umaril, gave the Hero a greater power. Umaril died under the Hero's blade. But the fight was not over; the Hero invoked the Blessing of Talos and, doing what Pelinal Whitestrake could not, followed Umaril into the spirit plane. There, the Hero dueled Umaril's Daedric spirit, which was immune to the Relics as a whole, but not immune to the weapons. In the cloudy plane high above Cyrodiil, the Hero slew Umaril's spirit, killing him once and for all. With Umaril's death, the attack on the church, the Auroran Crisis, ended.\nAftermath.\nThe Hero awoke in the Priory undercroft, surrounded by the ghostly Knights of the Nine. Sir Amiel praised the Hero's victory, and the Knights vanished, departing at last to Aetherius. All but Sir Berich, who had been redeemed when the Hero defeated his Wraith form, and now stayed to thank the Hero before departing with his comrades.\nIn the Priory, the Hero was greeted by Sir Thedret, who told that the Knights had found him dead beside Umaril's corpse. Thedret hurried outside to address the other Knights, informing them of the homecoming of the Lord Crusader, the Hero's new title. Word of the Knights' deeds spread across Cyrodiil. The Crisis was over, the Auroran threat beaten back, and the Knights of the Nine restored.\nTactics.\nThe Crisis, which was mainly the work of Umaril and his Aurorans, was truly Umaril's plan of wiping out the gods that had engineered his first downfall. Using the Aurorans, Umaril planned to attack all the Great Chapels of the Nine Divines in Cyrodiil before launching an invasion on Cyrodiil and most likely all of Tamriel. Only four of the nine chapels were attacked, though. Umaril also seemed concerned about the recovery of the Crusader's Relics, as two of the four attacks occurred as an obstacle to the Hero.\nThe task of fighting Umaril fell to the Knights of the Nine. The plan of the Hero, the Knights, and the Prophet was to gather the Relics, then strike out at Umaril. In this way, the war was mostly contained in the battle at Garlas Malatar, as opposed to in the chapels."}

Once a great hall of dwarven construction, Avanchnzel was as much a library as it was a city, built to hold the vast memories of the Dwemer. It was run almost exclusively by strange Dwarven Spiders.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Watches-The-Roots\"&gt;Watches-The-Roots&lt;/a&gt;: \"Avanchnzel is waiting.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Breya\"&gt;Breya&lt;/a&gt;: \"Waiting for what?\"\nWatches-The-Roots: \"No one seems to know. Perhaps the return of the Dwemer. Perhaps the end of the world.\"\n&lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvanchnzel was a citadel built by the Dwemer prior to 1E 700. The smaller nearby ruins of Bthalft were home to the Aetherium Forge constructed by other clans. Rkund was also found along the Jerall Mountains, though is unknown what connection the site may have had to Avanchnzel, and if they were among the Dwemer city-states that were conquered by King Gellir. Curiously, there are no records of Falmer inhabiting the ruins, suggesting they were never enslaved in Avanchnzel. Based on what little is known about the ruin, some scholars of Dwemer architecture believed what could be explored to merely be the outer chambers of a much larger site, access to which had become blocked by the time of the Second Era. The automatons defending the place made it too dangerous to inquire further.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Oscillating Son was deconstructed and his parts scattered across the continent, his leg had found its way into Avanchnzel. Some time during the Interregnum, a group of Argonians delved into the ruins and discovered the hidden entrance to the Dwemer underworks. The spider and sphere guardians swarmed them in the outer chamber, resulting in a few casualties. The survivors reached the central heating plant and other machinery, but insisted on pressing farther in, searching for relics they could remove. Their intrusion into the inner chamber awakened a Dwemer Centurion, named Thzallek Eft according to the inscriptions, and almost all of them died in the assault. Only one survivor reached the exit, but was unable to escape as the doors had been locked by an unseen mechanism. With their food and water back in the outer chamber, her only hope was for other researchers to open the doors from the outside. In 2E 582, a rogue member of the Mages Guild by the name of Malsia traveled to Avanchnzel to gather Dwemer skystones in attempt to open a portal to Aetherius. A bounty hunter named Solvar confronted her outside the ruins under orders of the Guild, but was burned to death by Malsia and she fled the scene. She used the skystone artifacts to successfully travel to Aetherius but the portal collapsed on her, and she'd returned when the Vestige turned the skystones to reopen the portal, losing her soul in the process as her soul gem had broke.\n&lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 4E 201, two Argonians named Watches-The-Roots and From-Deepest-Fathoms led expedition to the ruins to steal the lexicon, hiring Drennen and Breya to aid them in the effort. They believed that if properly controlled, the lexicon had enough knowledge to turn paupers into kings. Journeying through the ruin over the course of a few days, they encountered many automatons, both awoken and dormant, destroying them all along the way just to be safe. The dangers of the ruins gradually began to stress out the members of the party, and by the time they'd reached the Animoncultory, Drennen attempted to flee the ruins for his own safety and died before he could escape. At the doors to the Boilery, Watches-The-Roots unknowingly triggered a pressure plate and was killed by a spinning blades trap. From-Deepest-Fathoms and Breya continued on, finding the lexicon guarded by two centurions within the final chamber of the ruins. Breya died finishing off one of them, telling Fathoms to run out through the exit, who did so after taking the lexicon. Returning to Riften, From-Deepest-Fathoms was losing her sanity from the memories obtained by the lexicon, and begged the Last Dragonborn to return it to \"them\" inside Avanchnzel. When they reached the ruins, the intricacies of the lexicon began to display their powers, showing them memories of the ill-fated journey that preceded them by projecting the ghosts as a resonance, a playback of From-Deepest-Fathom\u2019s previous exploration. Discovering the bodies of the expedition members in the ruins, they made their way back to the final chamber and returned the lexicon to its Lexicon Receptacle, honing a few skills from the ancient knowledge gained by the lexicon. From-Deepest-Fathoms' sanity returned to her afterwards, but she had lost any recollection of the journey to Avanchnzel, seemingly the work of the lexicon's influence upon her."}

There is one ghost encounter at a locked gate that has a chest with leveled loot behind it. Further up the hallway is a small alcove on the right (up a short flight of stairs) with an apprentice level locked chest. Further ahead can be found the campsite where the now-deceased adventurers stayed; another ghost dialogue encounter is seen here.\nThere is a door to the right; it contains a trap which is lethal at a low level (the shout &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; offers no protection here). Open the door and immediately back away to avoid the spinning blades. The trap can also be disarmed\u2014there is a mechanism at the lower right of the door. The door opens to a room that appears to be a spider repair room and contains a single chest.

A stone bed next to the book can be used for rest.\nContinuing on, there is a large store room which has an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt; to the left as part of a table. There is another hallway and, through a door, a small store room with a locked door to the right containing a leveled chest and a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Helmet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven helmet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mace%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;.

Further ahead is another small room with another ghost encounter, which leads to another door and a large chamber.\nEntering the chamber on a raised walkway around the room, there are at least four spiders below that can be carefully destroyed from the vantage of the high ground. There is a wall chest to the right from the entrance. Otherwise, go around to the left to get to the stairs down to the main floor.

The next door leads to the Avanchnzel boilery.\nAvanchnzel Boilery.\nUpon entering the boilery, there is another ghost dialogue encounter. It is possible for a spider to be below the catwalk in the hallway; one tactic is to simply conjure a familiar near it until the spider is dead.

But Aventus Aretino walks a dark path. His actions can lead only to ruin. Now, enough. We will speak no more of this. I am the only friend you need.\"\nUpon entering the house, Aretino chants the prayer to the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Mother\"&gt;Night Mother&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly while stabbing an effigy made up of human parts as he pleads for the Night Mother's help.

The Vampires that attacked the Hall of Vigilants may have been after something in a place called &lt;a href=\"Dimhollow%20Crypt\"&gt;Dimhollow Crypt&lt;/a&gt;. Isran has asked me to find out what the vampires are looking for.\"\nWalkthrough.\nDimhollow Crypt.\nUpon entering the Dimhollow Crypt, a short dialogue between two vampires about recent events will begin (they mention a Vigilant putting up a courageous, yet doomed fight). &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Tolan\"&gt;Vigilant Tolan&lt;/a&gt; will be dead on the floor in front of the large gate. In addition to the vampires are &lt;a href=\"Death%20Hound%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;death hounds&lt;/a&gt;. After defeating them, proceed to the second floor of the tower to the right. A leveled weapon can be found just as the tower is entered along with an &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29%23Urn\"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29%23Chest\"&gt;chest&lt;/a&gt;. At the top of the stairs there is a chain that needs to be pulled to open the large gate into the next chamber.\nAfter proceeding through, the tunnel will open up to a cavern with a vampire and some &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeletons&lt;/a&gt;. Another gate sits on the left with a lever to open it. Through this gate an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20enchanter\"&gt;arcane enchanter&lt;/a&gt; and some &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;soul gems&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nProceed north down the steps where a leveled &lt;a href=\"Draugr%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;draugr&lt;/a&gt; and a few vampires are engaged in combat. There are four gates in this room. The gate to the east leads to a casket from which a leveled draugr will break out. As you face the casket, on both sides beyond the cage walls in this area is a leveled weapon with a random enchantment which can be easily obtained using &lt;a href=\"Telekinesis%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Telekinesis&lt;/a&gt;. Back in the main room, the gate to the north leads to a &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;pedestal trap&lt;/a&gt; with some &lt;a href=\"Potions%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;potions&lt;/a&gt;. The southwest gate leads to a Master locked chest and the one to the west leads to the next area.\nFollowing the tunnel leads to a large cavern with a lake. Several skeletons will emerge from the water along with a vampire. Proceed to the room at the top of the ramp where more vampires and death hounds can be found. In addition, a few &lt;a href=\"Frostbite%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;frostbite spiders&lt;/a&gt; also attack. Sometimes these spiders can be found dead, presumably killed by the death hounds and vampires. Proceed through the tunnels into the next chamber with a large iron gate.\nThrough the gate there is a leveled &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29%23Types\"&gt;boss vampire&lt;/a&gt; and a wounded giant frostbite spider attacking each other. Open the gate via the lever on the left and kill them both before heading deeper into the cavern. It is advisable to stealth kill the vampire after he kills the spider, or he will revive the spider to fight for him.\nDimhollow Cavern.\nUpon entering this chamber, another short conversation will occur between &lt;a href=\"Lokil\"&gt;Lokil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Adalvald\"&gt;Vigilant Adalvald&lt;/a&gt;, after which Lokil kills Adalvald before reassuring the female vampire with him that it was justified. Proceeding forward past the gargoyle statues will bring the large cavern into full view. On the lower platform will be the body of Vigilant Adalvald, and a copy of his book\u2014\"&lt;a href=\"Notes%20on%20Dimhollow%20Crypt%2C%20Vol.%203\"&gt;Notes on Dimhollow Crypt, Vol. 3&lt;/a&gt;\" giving some insight into the structures within the cavern.\nAfter defeating Lokil and his minions, proceed over the bridge onto the large circular platform with a pedestal located in the center.\nPress the button on the pedestal and then push the braziers into the correct places so that their contents are ablaze with a purplish blue flame, as seen in the image to the right.\nStart with the brazier that is in line with the purple flame, and proceed counterclockwise. Each brazier should be placed where the purple flame ends in order to continue it:\nThe floor will lower revealing an ancient sarcophagus containing a woman named Serana. After a brief introduction the quest will be complete and the next quest \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodline\"&gt;Bloodline&lt;/a&gt;\" will immediately begin.\nUpon leaving platform and across the bridge two &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; will attack.\nThen further on into a large room with a few draugr tombs, once the lever has been pulled two leveled draugr will emerge.\nFurther along you will come across a large room centered on a fire pit. Thrones will be dotted around the room with about five skeletons occupying them until you walk past. Directly across from the player as they walk in will be a draugr death lord or a Dragon Priest, next to a master-locked chest filled with random items. As well as this a &lt;a href=\"Word%20Walls%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;word wall&lt;/a&gt; is located to the right of the chest, with a word for the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shouts\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Vitality%20%28Dawnguard%29\"&gt;Drain Vitality&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe way out is located behind the wooden doors behind a gate with the pull chain to the right."}

She will direct you to speak with the Hedgekeeper, who might know more. \nHead into the roots and you will find &lt;a href=\"Hengekeeper%20Lara\"&gt;Hengekeeper Lara&lt;/a&gt; lying on the ground; speak with her and she will tell you that the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Worm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Worm Cult&lt;/a&gt; has invaded this place.

Lara will tell you that in order to fight off the worm cult, you must awaken the Matrons by disturbing the roots of Treehenge. \nHead deeper inside. The roots will have a pillar of green ligh coming from them. The first one is just ahead, then the second one is across the bridge. The third one is deeper into the dungeon, in the room with the puddle on the floor. Once all roots have been disturbed and all matrons have been awakened, proceed through the north exit in to Treehenge proper. There, you will find Finoriell's spirit as well as the three matrons you awakened. You should speak with one of the matrons and she will tell you that the Worm Cult is poisoning this place and using it for their foul plans. \nThe moment you are done talking, the spirit of Finoriell will be pulled away by the Worm Cult. Speak with Hengekeeper Lara and she will tell you of a possible way to draw Finoriell's spirit back. You are to collect Moon-Kissed Droplets and Starry Torchbugs from arounf the area; both can be collected to your northeast. The droplets can be found in the water and will give off a blue light. The torchbugs are just shinier torchbugs. Once you have five of the torchbugs and three of the droplets, head back southwest to an altar just northeast of the map marker. There, use the ingredients you found to cleanse the altar and it will draw in Finoriell's Soul. Finoriell will tell you that the Worm Cult are seeking to corrupt her, and through her all the other Green Ladies. To prevent this, she needs to take root in a seed as quickly as possible. For the time being tough, she will take root in Hengekeeper Lara. \nHead back to the grove and talk to Lara to finish the quest and start the next one, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dark%20Night%20of%20the%20Soul\"&gt;The Dark Night of the Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

{"id": "3319", "revid": "53743443", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=3319", "title": "Ayleid", "text": "The Ayleids, also known as the Heartland High Elves, Heartland Elves, Saliache, or Wild Elves, were a race of elves who ruled over Cyrodiil in the first era. Their appearance was said to have been lighter than that of a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;, but not as pale as that of the Altmer. They had varied skin tones from light tan to bronze.\nAyleid Empire.\nThe Ayleids would occupy a considerable portion of Tamriel, with their main settlements being located within Cyrodiil. The following are each of the Ayleid settlements. Their empire existed from the middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt; until &lt;a href=\"1E%20243\"&gt;1E 243&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nAyleid architecture was similar to that of the &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt;, due to them sharing a common ancestor, though subtle changes did exist between the two. In the late-Ayleid period, cultural changes became more apparent, with certain Ayleids using practices such as flesh-sculpting.\nMagic.\nThe Ayleids believed the world was composed of four elements. These being earth, water, air, and light. This is similar to the four elements of Altmer religion, being earth, water, air, and fire. The reason for the Ayleids replacing fire with light in their elements, is because the Ayleids considered fire a weak and corrupt form of light, primarily identified with magical principles. As such, the Ayleids used lamps, globes, pools, and fountains of purest magic to light their halls. For the Ayleids, Meridia was considered the personification of Light.\nOf the Ayleid elements, the most sublime form of light was considered to be star light, as their power was the most potent and exalted of all magical powers, coming directly from Aetherius. Fragments of Aetherius would fall down to Tamriel from time to time, known as 'shooting stars', often consisting of meteoric iron. While this material can be used for the forging of enchanted weapons and armor, the Ayleids also used the material as the primary component in their Ayleid Wells. These Wells are found throughout Cyrodiil, though they are not associated with any known Ayleid cities or settlements. The Ayleids Wells can be used by those with some magical talents to recover their own magicka reserves. After being drained, these Wells recharge at midnight.\nAetherial Magic.\nAetherial Magic is a form of magic commonly associated with the Ayleids, who were able to manipulate and store starlight in ways which are not yet fully comprehended by the rest of Tamriel. Through the usage of sky-stones and their magical arts, the Ayleids created &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Welkynd&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s from the glass gathered from meteors. Through these stones, the Ayleids were able to harness starlight from Aetherius. Each being used for a variety of uses. Welkynd Stones were used for purposes such as light, or simply storing magicka. Varla Stones were used for recharging enchantments. Some of these stones even held destruction spells as a means of defense. How the Ayleids made these stones is unknown, and any attempts to create new ones have failed, while research on stones which already exist results in the stones turning into dust. This magic was Dawn Magic, and was a kind of magic only preserved by the Ayleids, much like the language of the Ehlnofey. It has been speculated that just before the slave revolt, the Ayleids had started the process of creating the Welkynd Stones outside of their cities, and rather inside of Cyrodiil's natural cave systems. The Ayleids were also able to create pillars which would provide the caster with a new powerful spell when cast upon with shock magic while carrying a Welkynd Stone. Other magic related to the Welkynd Stones, was the ability to bind Daedra to a certain spot. The Ayleids would also be the first of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwardens\"&gt;Stormwardens&lt;/a&gt; in Valenwood, where they created a sphere with powerful shock magic.\nOther stone the Ayleids created were the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Welkynd%20Stone\"&gt;Great Welkynd Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, which were large pieces of enchanted meteoric glass. At the heart of the ancient Ayleid cities, a Great Welkynd Stone was used as the source of the magical enchantments of each of the cities. These stones would gradually be stolen over time, due to their great value, with only few remaining by the time of the Third Era.\nThe Ayleids also created pillars which responded to magical spells, and they are also said to have been the ones who created the school of &lt;a href=\"Alteration\"&gt;Alteration&lt;/a&gt;. The Ayleids also knew magical powers which enabled them to alter landscapes in &lt;a href=\"Rivenspire\"&gt;Rivenspire&lt;/a&gt;, turning the soil around the &lt;a href=\"The%20Doomcrag\"&gt;Doomcrag&lt;/a&gt; from a barren wilderness to a land filled with plants, and slowly becoming more lively, until its eventual corruption as a result of a battle. This kind of magic is also implied to have been in place in the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, turning Cyrodiil into a warm subtropical jungle until their defeat by the Nedes. In turn, the Tower is said to have changed the landscape to a climate which was cooler and more fitting for the Nedic rulers.\nReligion.\nThe religion of the Ayleids consisted of both Aedra and Daedra worship. When the Ayleids came to Cyrodiil, it is said that some specifically went to the mainland to escape the banning of Daedra worship on Summerset. Within the last millenium of the Merethic Era, worship of the Daedra would take hold in the lands of the Ayleids and spread. A number of the Ayleids worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magnus\"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Barsaebic Ayleids. This difference would eventually result in the &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel%20Schism\"&gt;Narfinsel Schism&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn contrast to the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Resdayn\"&gt;Resdayn&lt;/a&gt;, the Ayleids did not make a distinction between either good or bad Daedra with veneration of &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; alongside more neutral princes like &lt;a href=\"Hermaeus%20Mora\"&gt;Hermaeus Mora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt;. This veneration would only further increase as their worship was adopted, and endorsed, by the Ayleid aristocrats and the Ayleid Kings. The Ayleids are known to have worshipped &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Statue\"&gt;Ten Ancestors&lt;/a&gt;, statues of which were housed in the White-Gold Tower, specifically in the Temple of the Ancestors. The Statues of these Ancestors would be moved from the Ayleid capital before it was sacked by the races of Man.\nHistory.\nMerethic Era.\nThe Ayleids would come to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Summerset\"&gt;Summerset&lt;/a&gt;, settling the region of &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, conquering central and southwestern Tamriel. During the late-Merethic Era, the Ayleids would begin worshipping the Daedra. Because of this, they enslaved the &lt;a href=\"Nede\"&gt;Nede&lt;/a&gt;s coming down from &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and would use them for labor centered around the &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Tower\"&gt;White-Gold Tower&lt;/a&gt;, but also for the Daedric-inspired arts of flesh-sculpture and gut-gardening. The Ayleids were said to have been brutal slavemasters. The Ayleid ruins across Tamriel are a testament to the might of the Ayleids, and during the middle &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, Ayleid society flourished around the White-Gold Tower. Technically serving as a tribute-land to the High King of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, the long lines of communication from the &lt;a href=\"Summerset%20Isles\"&gt;Summerset Isles&lt;/a&gt; isolated the Ayleids from the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt;. At the height of Ayleid society, the city of &lt;a href=\"Varsa%20Baalim\"&gt;Varsa Baalim&lt;/a&gt; was built, housing &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes' Razor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst Era.\nOver time, the source of the power of the Ayleids, which were pacts with Daedra, would also be the cause of the decline of the Ayleids. Pacts with the Daedra granted the Ayleids power, with the Ayleids thinking themselves in control, while their society weakened. Originally being resisted by &lt;a href=\"Shezarr\"&gt;Shezarr&lt;/a&gt;, the races of Man were secured, but when Shezarr vanished, these pacts would be used to provide the Ayleids with armies of Daedra, which were used to enslave or slaughter the races of Man at their whim. The Daedric cults within their Empire began bickering and backstabbing one another, causing the Ayleids to weaken in ways which would be exploited by the Nedic slaves.\nCivil Conflicts.\nThe bickering and backstabbing among the Ayleids would also result in the &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel%20Schism\"&gt;Narfinsel Schism&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic%20Ayleids\"&gt;Barsaebic Ayleids&lt;/a&gt;, who worshipped the &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt; instead of the Daedra, were driven out of Cyrodiil by the mainstream Ayleids who worshipped the Daedra in the &lt;a href=\"Scouring%20of%20Wendelbek\"&gt;Scouring of Wendelbek&lt;/a&gt;, taking place half a century before the slave revolt of Alessia would take place, in &lt;a href=\"1E%20198\"&gt;1E 198&lt;/a&gt;. King Glinferen of Atatar assaulted the Barsaebic Ayleids with an army of Daedra, forcing the Barsaebics out of the Heartland of Cyrodiil, bringing an end to the opposition of Ayleid daedra worship.\nAnother conflict would take place between the Ayleid city of &lt;a href=\"Delodiil\"&gt;Delodiil&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by King Cenedelin, and &lt;a href=\"Abagarlas\"&gt;Abagarlas&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by King Anumaril. Delodiil worshipped Meridia, while Abagarlas worshipped Molag Bal. The forces of Abagarlas were planning an assault against Delodiil, but the soldiers of Delodiil struck first. Fighting inside the city while their king attacked the walls. Abagarlas was entirely destroyed, and the family of King Anumaril put to the sword, but despite this victory, they could not return home, as they were followed by the minions of Molag Bal. Other minions of Molag Bal had started making their way towards Delodiil, and besieged the city, killing all those outside its city walls. &lt;a href=\"King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;King Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt; was visiting the city, and manned its defense, ultimately defeating the forces of Bal, after which the city was transported to Coldharbour.\nDownfall.\nDue to the Nords uniting the province of Skyrim as Nord land, the slaves of Cyrodiil under &lt;a href=\"Saint%20Alessia\"&gt;Saint Alessia&lt;/a&gt; were inspired, and revolted, successfully taking over the province in 1E 243. When Akatosh created the Amulet of Kings and gave it to Saint Alessia, the Daedra lost their ability to send over armies of Daedra, weakening the Ayleids. Likewise, the Alessians had the support of a number of Ayleid kings, most of which were Aedra-worshippers, which is part of the reason why the Aedra were incorporated into the Eight Divines. While traditionally the success of Alessia is attributed to the aid of the Nords, the aid she received from Ayleid Kings played equally as much a role.\nThe role of &lt;a href=\"Pelinal%20Whitestrake\"&gt;Pelinal Whitestrake&lt;/a&gt; is also not to be ignored. Pelinal was said to have been sent down by the Divines, and aided Saint Alessia in fighting against the Ayleids. When Pelinal and &lt;a href=\"Morihaus\"&gt;Morihaus&lt;/a&gt; were sent to aid Alessia, they marched through Cyrodiil, fighting and killing their way through the province, and quickly killing the eastern Ayleid kings of Cyrodiil. Pelinal would destroy Ayleid cities during his campaigns, following up with the eastern cities by defeating the kings of Tor, Ninendava and Ceya-Tar. When a hoplite who Pelinal held dear was killed by an Ayleid Lord, Pelinal went on his first madness, and destroyed the cities of Narlemae and Celediil. The Ayleids now made a pact with Meridia in order to gain the aid of her &lt;a href=\"Auroran\"&gt;Auroran&lt;/a&gt;s at the White-Gold Tower. &lt;a href=\"Umaril%20the%20Unfeathered\"&gt;Umaril the Unfeathered&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to be their champion, and he challenged Pelinal in battle. Before Pelinal would answer his call, however, he would continue on with his campaign, now claiming all the eastern lands of Cyrodiil. He also granted the slaves of Vahtacen their freedom, and liberated a group of men captured by the Ayleids of Sedor. With this success, Pelinal called upon the Nords to aid him in battle. With Nordic aid, Pelinal would slowly take over western Cyrodiil, driving the Ayleids to the heartland of Cyrodiil. When the Nedes and Nords had come to the point of besieging the Ayleid capital, however, they were fearful. Due to this fear, Pelinal left the army of Alessia, and made for the Tower himself. He would fight his way to the Tower, where what remained of the Ayleid Kings were gathered with their Daedric minions, alongside Umaril. After having fought waves of his soldiers, Pelinal faced Umaril himself, greatly weakening the Daedric Champion, whose was struck down during the fight, his helm dented and his wings broken off. Pelinal mocked the ancestors of the Ayleids, which enraged the Ayleid kings present, who attacked Pelinal and cut him into eight pieces. The next morning, however, Pelinal had killed most kings, only sparing those who had already started to flee. The Kings had left Pelinal's head to prove their deeds the day before. When the White-Gold Tower fell to the Nedes, the Ayleids fled Cyrodiil and ran in the directions of each of the eight towers of Tamriel, while some Ayleids would flee to the north of Black Marsh, most Ayleids fled to &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, and were willing to adapt to the wills of their Bosmer cousins. Especially the clans of eastern Cyrodiil would flee to Valenwood. \nBefore the Ayleids truly fell, &lt;a href=\"King%20Anumaril\"&gt;King Anumaril&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Towers\"&gt;Staff of Towers&lt;/a&gt;, segments of which would be hidden by White-Gold knights. These segements would be chased by the Ayleids fleeing Cyrodiil afterwards. Within Cyrodiil, one of the last regions to be conquered from the Ayleids would be that of County Bravil, due to the Ayleids using both levitation and waterbreathing magic to attack the Alessians in the night. These Ayleids would, however, be discovered eventually, and killed.\nIt has been argued that the fall of the Ayleids was a result of their worship of the Daedra and underestimation of their slaves, which became a part of the late-Ayleid culture and resulted in their weakening. Because of this, those humans who challenged the Ayleids took advantage of the situation to orchestrate the successful slave uprising. It has also been argued that such an attempt at the height of the Ayleid power would have been utterly crushed by the forces of the Ayleids. Due to bad relations between the Aedric and Daedric worshipping Ayleids, the Barsaebic Ayleids of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt; refused the call to arms from King Glinferen of &lt;a href=\"Atatar\"&gt;Atatar&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the slave rebellion took place, the Ayleids had been greatly weakened, while the slave rebels were inspired by Saint Alessia. When the revolt was over, many of the Daedra-worshipping Ayleids were exterminated.\nPeace with the Nedes.\nBy the time none of the Nedes who suffered from enslavement by the Ayleids were still alive, there was an uneasy peace between the two peoples. A servant of &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Culanwe\"&gt;Culanwe&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with brokering peace between the Ayleids and the Nedes. At first the negotiations did not yield positive results and Culanwe feared the Nedes will break off negotiations. At some point during the negotiations an Ayleid messenger was murdered and the Ayleids suspected the Nedes were responsible. Realizing escalations between the two peoples might lead to another war, Culanwe used her voice to adjust reality to forestall conflict. Around the same time a Nede and an Ayleid joined together to solve the mystery, they discovered that a servant of Molag Bal murdered the Ayleid messenger in an attempted to ruin the peace negotiations. After the mystery was solved hostilities between the Nedes and the Ayleids ceased, and peace was established when the two heroes wed.\nThe Late Ayleid Period.\nA number of Ayleid Lords would still be permitted to rule after the fall of their Empire, being recorded as still owning their lands as vassal kings as late as &lt;a href=\"1E%20263\"&gt;1E 263&lt;/a&gt;, which would last during the Late Ayleid Period from 1E 243 until 1E 498. Some of these Lords would even be granted some territory from slain enemies. Humans would continue to dwell in these cities, though how they were treated at this time is unknown. Resentment for the Ayleid Lords of Cyrodiil would increase over time, however, and played a part in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Alessian%20Order\"&gt;Alessian Order&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Marukh\"&gt;Marukh&lt;/a&gt;. The Ayleids of the late-Ayleid period were a bitterly divided people with warlords constantly vying over power with one another. It has been said that their demise was about equally as much their own undoing as that of the Nedes.\nWhen the Alessian Doctrine took place, an event known as the Ayleid Diaspora would occur. Here, the Ayleids sought new homes in Tamriel. The ones fleeing to the lands of the north, which were once ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, were slaughtered by the Nords led by &lt;a href=\"Vrage\"&gt;Vrage&lt;/a&gt; the Butcher. The citizens of Atatar, known as Atatarics, attemped to settle with the Barsaebic Ayleids of Black Marsh, but were refused admittance. Most of the Atatarics would find their end during an expedition into &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. A number of Ayleid clans set out for the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, moving through &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Those who made it joined with the &lt;a href=\"Direnni\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most prosperous clans of the Ayleids in High Rock were the Erokii, a clan which would find its demise during the infighting of the Ayleids, as their princess, known as Anurraame, had cheated on her lover. \nIn the early years of 1E 300, Ayleid kingdoms would be gradually obliterated, with its survivors fleeing as refugees to the other Ayleid kingdoms which managed to survive. It is also during this late period that the Ayleids would be forced to follow an economy without slaves, and be forced to adopt the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Eight Divines&lt;/a&gt;. A growing sense of doom and futility arose among the Heartland Elves. In the year 371, only Nenalata would remain as an Ayleid Kingdom within Cyrodiil, with the other Kingdoms dwindling in numbers since the year of 332. The Nenalata Ayleids were then provided with an ultimatum, resulting in their retreat from Cyrodiil, and their settling in High Rock. Those who refused the ultimatum would later be massacred.\nWhen the Ayleids of &lt;a href=\"Nenalata\"&gt;Nenalata&lt;/a&gt; were forced to relocate, they built the city of &lt;a href=\"Bisnensel\"&gt;Bisnensel&lt;/a&gt;, within High Rock, where the Ayleids would worship Hermaeus Mora, after forcing its noble family to flee to the Direnni. Some Ayleids would survive further into the First Era, such as an Ayleid tutor of &lt;a href=\"Rislav%20Larich\"&gt;Rislav Larich&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite the heavy persecution of the First Era Ayleids, some managed to survive into the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;, with sightings stating that they had lived in a reclusive tribal society. One of the members of the &lt;a href=\"University%20of%20Gwylim\"&gt;University of Gwylim&lt;/a&gt; was a civilized Ayleid, &lt;a href=\"Tjurhane%20Fyrre\"&gt;Tjurhane Fyrre&lt;/a&gt;, who was one of the finest sages at the University. He wrote a text on his people, called \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wild%20Elves\"&gt;The Wild Elves&lt;/a&gt;\", though he died in &lt;a href=\"2E%20227\"&gt;2E 227&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last known surviving pure Ayleid was &lt;a href=\"King%20Laloriaran%20Dynar\"&gt;King Laloriaran Dynar&lt;/a&gt;. Dynar remained in Coldharbour after the Hollow City, known as Delodiil, was transported there. He would be rescued by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and took command of the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;, but died in &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt; after defending the city. He gave the Vestige his sword as a symbol of trust and friendship in his dying moments.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20Era\"&gt;Third Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Third Era, Umaril the Unfeathered would return to Tamriel, alongside his Aurorans. He brought death and destruction to the followers of the Nine, killing the followers of Dibella in the &lt;a href=\"Chapel%20of%20Dibella\"&gt;Chapel of Dibella&lt;/a&gt;. Until he was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero of Kvatch&lt;/a&gt;, who had become the new Divine Crusader by collecting the Crusader's Relics. An &lt;a href=\"Altmer\"&gt;Altmer&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Umbacano%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Umbacano&lt;/a&gt; would also attempt to rebuild the Ayleid civilization through proclaiming himself the King of Nenalata, though his journey to Nenalata would result in his death.\nThe Great Welkynd Stone of Miscarcand would also be used by the &lt;a href=\"Blades\"&gt;Blades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Septim\"&gt;Martin Septim&lt;/a&gt; to create a portal to &lt;a href=\"Mankar%20Camoran\"&gt;Mankar Camoran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Paradise%20%28Location%29\"&gt;Paradise&lt;/a&gt;."}

One will need access to the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20University%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arcane University&lt;/a&gt; and three things to get the Ayleid weapons. First, a 100% &lt;a href=\"Chameleon%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;chameleon&lt;/a&gt; (Spell or enchanted wear. The spell will need to last a long time (30 \u2013 60 seconds) and the Hero will need to be a Master of Illusion). Second, a custom &lt;a href=\"Charm%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; (100 points for at least 10 seconds on touch 20 seconds would be better). Third a powerful (enchanted) weapon or &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spell that can kill them instantly.\nWalkthrough.\nAfter shooting the Arrow of Extrication, (in &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; mode if using spell) jump down (activated the Chameleon Spell if the Spell route is chosen) and walk up to the Guardian with the weapon one wants and try to talk to them.\nThey will draw their weapon, then run to a corner and sneak until they sheathe the weapon and stand down.

Pluribel emphasizes, quite rightly in my belief, the &lt;a href=\"Narfinsel%20Schism\"&gt;Narfinsel Schism&lt;/a&gt; of the late &lt;a href=\"Merethic%20Era\"&gt;Merethic Era&lt;/a&gt;, which pitted the more conservative &lt;a href=\"Aedra\"&gt;Aedra&lt;/a&gt;-worshiping Ayleid clans against those decadent yet undeniably vigorous clans that had adopted &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-worship. This conflict reached its climax in &lt;a href=\"1E%20198\"&gt;1E 198&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Scouring%20of%20Wendelbek\"&gt;Scouring of Wendelbek&lt;/a&gt;, when King &lt;a href=\"Glinferen\"&gt;Glinferen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Atatar\"&gt;Atatar&lt;/a&gt; led a combined force of Daedraphile warriors against the traditionalist &lt;a href=\"Barsaebic\"&gt;Barsaebic&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ayleidoon\"&gt;Ayleidoon&lt;/a&gt;. The Barsaebics were driven out of the &lt;a href=\"Heartlands\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt; into northwest &lt;a href=\"Argonia\"&gt;Argonia&lt;/a&gt;, and thereafter organized opposition to Daedra-worship in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; was effectively over.\nIn any event, by most measures Ayleid civilization had been in decline for several generations by the time the White-Gold Tower fell to the savagery of the &lt;a href=\"Nede%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nedes&lt;/a&gt;. Standing amid the ruins of a great &lt;a href=\"Mer\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; culture, the victors concocted a justification for the blood on their hands by painting the defeated clans as vicious Daedraphiles who reveled in torture and cruelty. An exception was made for those clans, mainly Aedric adherents, who had thrown in their lot with the hordes of the &lt;a href=\"Alessia\"&gt;Slave-Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, this only delayed their extermination, for the barbarous Nedes inevitably came after their former allies once the other Elves of Cyrodiil had been hunted to extinction.\nThus began the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Diaspora\"&gt;Ayleid Diaspora&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Heartland Elves sought to find new homes elsewhere in &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to decidedly mixed success. Those who fled north into the lands once held by the &lt;a href=\"Falmer\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt; were slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nords&lt;/a&gt; led by the infamous &lt;a href=\"Vrage%20the%20Butcher\"&gt;Vrage the Butcher&lt;/a&gt;. The Barsaebics, by that time well established in Argonia, refused admittance to their former persecutors the &lt;a href=\"Atataric\"&gt;Atataric&lt;/a&gt;s, and most of that clan died on an ill-fated expedition into the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Cat-Men&lt;/a&gt;. Several clans set out on the long march through &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and some actually made it, where they joined with (and were absorbed by) the long-established &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Bloodline\"&gt;Direnni&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Balfiera\"&gt;Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost successful\u2014and they were more than a few\u2014were the clans that fled southwest beneath the canopy of Valenwood. The clans of &lt;a href=\"Anutwyll\"&gt;Anutwyll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vilverin\"&gt;Vilverin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talwinque\"&gt;Talwinque&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bawn\"&gt;Bawn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varondo\"&gt;Varondo&lt;/a&gt; all escaped largely intact to carve out a new life under the trees. These clans all worshiped &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Princes&lt;/a&gt;, but they seem to have done so with less fervor after their enforced migration to Valenwood\u2014possibly due to the fact that the Princes, when called upon, had offered little or no help to the forsaken clans. Fortunately their new hosts, the Bosmer, were remarkably generous in welcoming the Ayleids into their realm, so long as the Heartland Elves agreed to adopt aspects of the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Pact\"&gt;Green Pact&lt;/a&gt; and refrain from harming the forest. Having little choice, the Ayleids agreed, and this probably contributed to the dilution of their culture.\nFor diluted it was, absorbed over time, and eventually forgotten. I have walked the great Ayleid ruins of Valenwood\u2014&lt;a href=\"Hectahame\"&gt;Hectahame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rulanyil%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Rulanyil's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belarata\"&gt;Belarata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laeloria\"&gt;Laeloria&lt;/a&gt;, and a dozen more\u2014and none of them, not one, was still occupied only two thousand years after the Diaspora. For some reason, once the Ayleids were under the great &lt;a href=\"graht-oak\"&gt;graht-oak&lt;/a&gt;s they, and their distinctive culture, simply melted away.\nIn explaining the extinction of the Valenwood Ayleids, my predecessor &lt;a href=\"Gelgarad%20the%20Velaspid\"&gt;Gelgarad the Velaspid&lt;/a&gt; was very attached to his \"&lt;a href=\"Theorem%20of%20Disheritage\"&gt;Theorem of Disheritage&lt;/a&gt;,\" which held that for some reason the Forest Ayleids became unable to breed with each other and could only generate offspring by mating with the local Bosmer. This would certainly account for the Ayleids' gradual disappearance, but unfortunately Gelgarad's theorem is supported only by old stories and legends, and absent facts it cannot be proven.\nIt is worth mentioning here the competing theory of Doctor &lt;a href=\"Thetis\"&gt;Thetis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmerene%20Academy\"&gt;Shimmerene Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Her explanation blames Ayleid decline on over-consumption of the unusually potent beverages of the Bosmer. Doctor Thetis believes the Ayleids, vulnerable in their grief over their losses, fell prey to the Wood Elves' paralyzing brews and simply gave up trying. In this they may have been encouraged by the Bosmer themselves, who often seem insulted by others' displays of industrious effort.\nAnd what did our forest-dwelling cousins learn from the Ayleids? Precious little, apparently, other than some advanced techniques of stonework and masonry. Heartland Elven culture seems to have made little lasting impression on the culture of the Wood Elves. Their attitude seems to me summed up by the statement of &lt;a href=\"Fonlor\"&gt;Fonlor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Yorethane\"&gt;Yorethane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt;, whose response when I asked him about the Ayleids was as follows: \"The Ayleids? Oh, yes. Nice fellows. Took themselves too seriously, though, and what did it get them?\""}

{"id": "26033", "revid": "32045548", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26033", "title": "Ayleid Traps", "text": "Throughout many, if not all of the &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid ruins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;, there are a variety of different &lt;a href=\"Traps%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;traps&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Hero%20of%20Kvatch\"&gt;Hero&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate. Many of these guard entrances to important tombs or a particular stash of treasure with valuable items in them. All are extremely dangerous and need to be tackled carefully if the Hero is to survive.\nFeatured traps.\nGas traps.\nThese particular traps throughout the ruins are most commonly found around individual tombs, on each corner of the plinth the tomb rests on. They are characterized as a square grille that when stood on by the Hero, give off a toxic gas that causes their health to drain as long as they are still standing in the gas.\nThis can be dangerous to lower level characters or those who do not have a lot of health through class or previous encounters with traps/enemies. However, they are easily avoided so should not pose much of a problem or cause unexpected character deaths. In some select ruins, a larger form of the gas trap may be found, where it is one large grille in the center of the room that when stood on emits gas like the smaller versions.\nAdditionally, walls come up to surround the Hero, trapping them and forming a kind of gas chamber so there is no escape from the fumes. This form of the trap has a wider effect radius and stronger potency, so must be avoided at all costs if their health is low.\nFalse floor traps.\nFeatured in most ruins, a false floor trap is an entire section of the room's flooring, generally the center, that falls down into a pit of spikes when the player stands on it. These traps are characterized by having many holes in the floor, giving the Hero an indication that it is actually a trap. Avoiding them can be difficult, as the trap takes up the entire pathway that leads to the next room or passage.\nThankfully, there are always alcoves to either side of the trap, each one containing a tomb. These allow the Hero to jump horizontally across the corners of the false floor, avoiding touching the trap and allowing them to proceed without being harmed. However these traps can also come in handy for them. If there is an enemy on the other side of trap and they attack, they will seemingly not know that there is a trap there and walk across it, activating the false floor and falling onto the spikes. If they are a lower level enemy, such as a &lt;a href=\"Rat%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;rat&lt;/a&gt;, they will probably be killed instantly.\nCrushing floor traps.\nThese traps are a variant of the false floor ones, as they contain the same principle of a section of flooring in the center of a room that cannot be avoided without jumping across the corners and into the alcoves. These ones however, upon contact with the Hero, quickly rise up and attempt to crush them on spikes that are built into the ceiling, drastically reducing health and even killing lower level characters and enemies.\nIt is recommended that the Hero does not have reduced health when tackling these traps for this reason. Spotting them can be tricky as they do not have the characteristic holes of the false floor traps, but occasionally there will be a dead body or a splatter of blood in the center of the trap, indicating that someone has been crushed there. It is best to err on the side of caution just in case.\nFalling blades traps.\nThese traps feature heavily along the walkways of most Ayleid ruins, rising and falling intermittently as the Hero activates them. Dangerous and hard to avoid, it is best that they tackle the blades one at a time, allowing it time to rise high enough for them to walk under it but not so high that it comes straight down again.\nWhen they are on the ground, they can be jumped over if one has a high enough &lt;a href=\"Acrobatics%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/a&gt; skill, but if not completely cleared with a jump can still cause massive damage to the Hero's health. Lower level characters are recommended to be patient as being hit by one or more blades may result in the character's death, and certainly running blindly throughout the entire section of blades can result in the death or severe injury of higher level characters.\nSweeping blades traps.\nFound most commonly in narrow passages, the sweeping blades are very dangerous traps that are moderately easy to avoid. They usually consist of two separate sets of blades that sweep independently from each other, offering the Hero an opportunity to avoid one set, wait for the other to sweep, then walk past that one.\nThe reasonably long gap between each sweep means there is plenty of time to avoid getting hit, so negotiating these traps is not too difficult. However, if hit with one of these blades they can cause severe injury, if not death in lower level characters.\nSpiked grille traps.\nNot as common as the other traps, the spiked grilles are found on the walkways like the falling blade traps. It consists of a spiked, metal grille that is suspended from the ceiling, and that every so often slides across the walkway to knock off or impale whatever is in its way. The only way to avoid this trap is to jump up onto the ledge at the edge of the walkway, walking along that so that the grille misses the character completely.\nModified Ayleid Ruins.\nIn some occupied ruins, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Bandits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt; have added their own traps, such as the spiked iron ball on a chain and the spiked logs that are activated by pressure plates. These traps are only in the first section of the ruin (if another section is applicable) and can be expected to be found around the entrance to the ruin or certain rooms.\nCompared to the Ayleid traps, these are generally unsophisticated and easy to spot; just look for the metal plate on the ground. The damage done by these traps is also minimal."}

Ayrenn's life has held significance to the higher powers of Summerset, as her birth and times were foretold by the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20Praxis\"&gt;Scrolls of Praxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly Years &amp; the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth.\nAyrenn Arana Aldmeri was born in &lt;a href=\"2E%20555\"&gt;2E 555&lt;/a&gt;, on the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very peculiar date that held an abundant amount of significance to the High Elves, causing them to celebrate for fifty-five days, likely playing into her birthdate. Ayrenn was born from &lt;a href=\"King%20Hidellith\"&gt;King Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Tuinden\"&gt;Kinlady Tuinden&lt;/a&gt;, who ruled from the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;. She may be a princess by birth, but she is a warrior by heart. It was foretold that her childhood would reflect the restless and chaotic times that she would be born into, and it certainly shows. Ayrenn was a quick-witted and nimble child, having the ability to adapt and overcome anything easily. Her methods would be unorthodox at best. According to rumors, whenever she returned from her field trips, she would acquire different knowledge and mastery of varying skills. As time went on, her parents would have a second child named &lt;a href=\"Naemon\"&gt;Naemon&lt;/a&gt;.

It was an Altmeri College where she would study &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Regal%20Praxis\"&gt;Altmeri Regal Praxis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;Ceremoniarchy&lt;/a&gt; for the required thirty-five hundred and fifty-five days, coincidentally playing onto her birthdate. However, she had disappeared, not even the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor%20Justiciar\"&gt;Thalmor Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s were able to find her, she had escaped the Summerset Isles and begun her travels across the world. On the day of her escape, several events occurred, including the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Orrery\"&gt;Great Orrery&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; spinning backward and &lt;a href=\"The%20Lover%20%28Birthsign%29\"&gt;the Lover&lt;/a&gt; constellation seemingly riding &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt;. A little eaglet sat atop of a statue depicting &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Explorer\"&gt;Topal the Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, foretelling future event to come. In her place, Prince Naemon went to the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth and took the procedures of becoming the King of the Blessed Isles. Ayrenn began her travels with the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Balfiera\"&gt;Isle of Balfiera&lt;/a&gt;, located in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt;, where she met the &lt;a href=\"Direnni%20Clan\"&gt;Direnni Clan&lt;/a&gt;, who taught her the art of war. From there she continued her journey, out drinking &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt;, the High Queen of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Skyrim\"&gt;Eastern Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, and becoming the First Mate of &lt;a href=\"Fortunata%20ap%20Dugal\"&gt;Fortunata ap Dugal&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention dancing with the &lt;a href=\"Nereid\"&gt;Nereid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Ilessan%20Hills\"&gt;Ilessan Hills&lt;/a&gt; and stealing the &lt;a href=\"Indigo%20Scrolls\"&gt;Indigo Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; of the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;. Ayrenn set forth, seeking her destiny, without looking back.\nUntil in &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;2E 580&lt;/a&gt;, King Hidellith had passed away from old age, prompting Ayrenn to be called back to the Summerset Isles, to claim her birthright. By then, Naemon had completed his time at the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth and was supposed to assume the throne. The Isles got word of her arrival when she traveled to &lt;a href=\"Port%20Velyn\"&gt;Port Velyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; and set sail for the Summerset Isles. When she arrived, she assumed the throne as the Queen of the Isles. Because of the constant strife plaguing the world, she would create an alliance that would rival the great powers of Tamriel. The &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;First Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was created, with the combined powers of the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20Elves\"&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/a&gt; of Valenwood and the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. The city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; became the capital of the Dominion, considering its proximity to the battlefront of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt; and its location in the Dominion. Ayrenn's ritual as the Queen of the Isles was not complete; she needs to travel to &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, to commune with ancient spirits of the island.\nThe Veiled Heritance &amp; Ayrenn's Visit to Vulkhel Guard.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Ayrenn and her entourage traveled to the island region of &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, where they landed onto the township of &lt;a href=\"Vulkhel%20Guard\"&gt;Vulkhel Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Their arrival had brought a wide spread of attention to Auridon, especially when &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlord%20Rilis%20XIII\"&gt;High Kinlord Rilis XIII&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Firsthold\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Kinlady%20Estre\"&gt;High Kinlady Estre&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; made appearances in Vulkhel. By order of &lt;a href=\"Watch%20Captain%20Astanya\"&gt;Watch Captain Astanya&lt;/a&gt;, security at Vulkhel grew tenfold, but suspicious activity had begun to arrive onto the town. An &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;estranged traveler&lt;/a&gt; arrived onto Vulkhel Guard sometime after Ayrenn reached Auridon. With the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Norion\"&gt;Advisor Norion&lt;/a&gt; and Astanya, the traveler investigated the strange occurrences. The traveler uncovered the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Heritance\"&gt;Veiled Heritance&lt;/a&gt;, a radical group of High Elves that are opposed to the Aldmeri Dominion. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Fasion\"&gt;Fasion&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Eyes%20of%20the%20Queen\"&gt;Eyes of the Queen&lt;/a&gt;, the warrior learned that Watch Captain Astanya planned to assassinate Ayrenn at the Temple of &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. The warrior was thrown in prison and was encountered by &lt;a href=\"Razum-dar\"&gt;Razum-dar&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the Eyes. Who freed the warrior, who would then defeat Astanya with the help of &lt;a href=\"Battlereeve%20Urcelmo\"&gt;Battlereeve Urcelmo&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Auridon%20Marines\"&gt;First Auridon Marines&lt;/a&gt;. Ayrenn was impressed by the warrior's ability, so she asked them to be an elite agent, aiding her in her journey to Tanzelwil and uncovering the Veiled Heritance.\nAyrenn's Spiritual Inauguration at Tanzelwil.\nAyrenn's entourage traveled to the ruins of Tanzelwil where the Queen would interact with the ancient spirits of Auridon so that they can consent and acknowledge her rule. The Veiled Heritance has made their mark on the people of Auridon, raising suspicion and tension throughout the land. When she prays at the first altar, she is attacked by an enraged spirit, proclaiming that the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Queen\"&gt;Veiled Queen&lt;/a&gt; is the true ruler of the Isles and that Norion will end her reign. The Elite Agent was able to defeat the spirit, but it caused the Dominion to go on high alert. With the help of the Elite Agent, &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Aranwen\"&gt;Priestess Aranwen&lt;/a&gt; was continue the ritual with Ayrenn. But with Advisor Norion escaping, Ayrenn and the Agent were forced to kill the Heritance Agent before finishing the ritual. In the end, Ayrenn emerged with the blessing of the ancestors. They decide to leave for &lt;a href=\"Skywatch\"&gt;Skywatch&lt;/a&gt;, to meet with High Kinlady Estre and the Festival of Defiance.\nThe Veil over Skywatch &amp; the Plot against the Queen.\nHigh Kinlady Estre hosted the Festival of Defiance, an annual event in honor of the &lt;a href=\"Sack%20of%20Skywatch\"&gt;Sack of Skywatch&lt;/a&gt; from long-ago. It was at this event, Ayrenn was going to elevate Estre into a higher-rank in the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. All the while, the Veiled Heritance was revealed to be hiding within the walls of Skywatch, and Razum-dar is going under investigation. The Khajiit tasked the Elite Agent with the mission, giving them a phrase and the location of a Veiled Heritance recruiter named &lt;a href=\"Palomir\"&gt;Palomir&lt;/a&gt;, who was waiting at the &lt;a href=\"Barbed%20Hook%20Tavern\"&gt;Barbed Hook Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. With enchanted earrings, the Agent was able to infiltrate the Veiled Heritance at &lt;a href=\"Errinorne%20Isle\"&gt;Errinorne Isle&lt;/a&gt; and learn that High Kinlady Estre was the leader of the Heritance. Once the Agent and Ayrenn confronted her, Estre escaped Skywatch amidst the celebration and her army began to attack areas throughout Northern Auridon, specifically in the region of &lt;a href=\"Vafe\"&gt;Vafe&lt;/a&gt;.\nEstre, the Veiled Queen &amp; the Battle of Firsthold.\nHigh Kinlady Estre and the Veiled Heritance had spread across the region of Vafe and attack various settlements with the army of Daedra. Ayrenn and had begun to wage war against the Heritance and advance into Northern Auridon. The Veiled Heritance had razed the township of &lt;a href=\"Dawnbreak\"&gt;Dawnbreak&lt;/a&gt; and infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Aldmeri%20Propriety\"&gt;College of Aldmeri Propriety&lt;/a&gt;, terrorizing non-Altmer students of the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, the Heritance captured the large town of &lt;a href=\"Greenwater%20Cove\"&gt;Greenwater Cove&lt;/a&gt; until the First Auridon Marines were able to retake it. Eventually, the Veiled Heritance were able to capture Firsthold, the capital of Auridon. Inside the city, the Daedra were overrunning the city and opening &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate\"&gt;Oblivion Gate&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the &lt;a href=\"Diceto%20River\"&gt;Diceto River&lt;/a&gt;. High Kinlady Estre escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Deadlands\"&gt;Deadlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Plane of Oblivion for &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;. Ayrenn's forces led by Battlereeve Urcelmo had surrounded the city, preparing for an attack. The Elite Agent traversed into Firsthold and reunited with the city defense at the local guildhalls. Ayrenn and the Elite Agent were able to defeat the Heritance and corner Estre at Castle Firsthold. The Agent entered Oblivion, where they killed Estre. Ayrenn and Naemon mourned the lost of Estre, who was Naemon's fiancee. After the unfortunate incident, Ayrenn and the Aldmeri Dominion gathered at the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Elden%20Root\"&gt;Elden Root&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt;, to finish Ayrenn's transition as the Leader of the Aldmeri Dominion.\nTrip to Elden Root &amp; the Orrery.\nThe high-ranking officials of the Aldmeri Dominion gathered at the city-state of Elden Root, where the gathering was hosted by &lt;a href=\"King%20Camoran%20Aeradan\"&gt;King Camoran Aeradan&lt;/a&gt;. By order of Ayrenn, the Dominion had established an &lt;a href=\"Altmer%20Embassy\"&gt;Altmer Embassy&lt;/a&gt; on the outskirts of Elden Root and were in the works for a Khajiit Embassy. But it was revealed through a plot that the Khajiiti Embassy was not going to be constructed. As time went on, the Court of Elden Root had begun to prepare &lt;a href=\"The%20Orrery%20%28Elden%20Root%29\"&gt;the Orrery&lt;/a&gt;, so that Queen Ayrenn can truly be named the leader of the Dominion. Prince Naemon, mourning the loss of his ex-wife, Estre, sends the Elite Agent on a quest throughout Grahtwood, to retrieve the following items, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Anumaril\"&gt;Heart of Anumaril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rahjin%27s%20Mantle\"&gt;Rahjin's Mantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daraneth\"&gt;Daraneth&lt;/a&gt;, a conservator who operated the Orrery. Each of these items was located in the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Reliquary of Stars&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Falinesti%20Winter%20Site\"&gt;Falinesti Winter Site&lt;/a&gt;, and the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Southpoint\"&gt;Southpoint&lt;/a&gt; respectively. The Elite Agent traversed the land, obtaining each item and bringing it to Elden Root, where they prepared for the ceremony. Once everything was in order, the Orrery was activated. According to legend, the Orrery of Elden Root will reveal the user's worth as a leader, ideally an Emperor or Empress. Once it was activated, Prince Naemon had rushed passed everyone and entered the Orrery, turning him into a vile &lt;a href=\"Ogrim\"&gt;Ogrim&lt;/a&gt;, cursing his sister's name once he was finished. The Elite Agent was forced to destroy Naemon so that Ayrenn can continue her ratification. Disheartened, Ayrenn entered the Orrery where she saw Tamriel under the banner of the Aldmeri Dominion, a utopia she hopes to build. Ayrenn had fully-established herself as the leader of the Aldmeri Dominion. But problems would soon arise when the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Magnus\"&gt;Staff of Magnus&lt;/a&gt; had disappeared from &lt;a href=\"Marbruk\"&gt;Marbruk&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Vicereeve%20Pelidil\"&gt;Vicereeve Pelidil&lt;/a&gt; and Naemon's corpse.\nThe Lunar Champions of Elsweyr &amp; Javad Tharn's Invasion.\nAs time went on, Vicereeve Pelidil was defeated and the Heart of Valenwood was saved from this revived form of the Veiled Heritance. Out of it came the new &lt;a href=\"The%20Silvenar\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bosmer\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Indaenir\"&gt;Indaenir&lt;/a&gt;, who protected the Heart of Valenwood from &lt;a href=\"Hectahame\"&gt;Hectahame&lt;/a&gt;. Ayrenn was present at the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Silvenar%20%28City%29\"&gt;Silvenar&lt;/a&gt;, where the Silvenar and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Lady\"&gt;Green Lady&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gwaering\"&gt;Gwaering&lt;/a&gt; were having their ceremonial wedding. But during the event, &lt;a href=\"Akkhuz-ri\"&gt;Akkhuz-ri&lt;/a&gt; was possessed by unnatural magic reminiscent of the &lt;a href=\"Dro-m%27Athra\"&gt;Dro-m'Athra&lt;/a&gt;, and he fled to &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;Reaper's March&lt;/a&gt;. Worst of it was when the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20of%20the%20West%20Weald\"&gt;Legion of the West Weald&lt;/a&gt; invaded Reaper's March, near the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Arenthia\"&gt;Arenthia&lt;/a&gt;, under the command of &lt;a href=\"General%20Lavinia\"&gt;General Lavinia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Javad%20Tharn\"&gt;Javad Tharn&lt;/a&gt;. At the Battle of Arenthia, Akkhuz-ri had lost his position as the &lt;a href=\"Mane\"&gt;Mane&lt;/a&gt;, leaving it to the Lunar Champions, &lt;a href=\"Khali\"&gt;Khali&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shazah\"&gt;Shazah&lt;/a&gt;. Ayrenn was present throughout the steps of becoming the Mane, as each sister partook the first step at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Two-Moons%20Dance%20%28Rawl%27kha%29\"&gt;Temple of Two-Moons Dance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Rawl%27kha\"&gt;Rawl'kha&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, when it was time to seal the Dark Mane at &lt;a href=\"Moonmont\"&gt;Moonmont&lt;/a&gt;, the Elite Agent, named the Moon Hallowed, must seal the spirit with one of the Lunar Champions. In the end, the Dark Mane was sealed away with one of the Lunar Champions. Ayrenn, the new Mane, and the Aldmeri Dominion had retaken the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Dune\"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt; when Javad Tharn captured the city. The New Mane and the Elite Agent defeated Javad Tharn at the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Lorkhaj\"&gt;Den of Lorkhaj&lt;/a&gt;. With the Dominion fully-united, Ayrenn had continued into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War\"&gt;Alliance War&lt;/a&gt;.\nMessage across Tamriel &amp; the Weight of Three Crowns.\nAfter the events of Dune, &lt;a href=\"Vanus%20Galerion\"&gt;Vanus Galerion&lt;/a&gt; approached the three leaders of the Alliances, including Queen Ayrenn of the Aldmeri Dominion. The &lt;a href=\"Mages%20Guild\"&gt;Mages Guild&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt; hosted a summit between the Three Alliances on the island territory of &lt;a href=\"Stirk\"&gt;Stirk&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href=\"Abecean%20Sea\"&gt;Abecean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, west of the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast\"&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt;. It was here the Alliance War had temporarily ended so that the &lt;a href=\"Planemeld\"&gt;Planemeld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; would come to an end. Amidst the meeting, Molag Bal had intervened and sent his Daedric Forces to attack the three alliances. In the end, the Elite Agent was able to defeat the Daedric Leaders, and the Alliance Leaders returned to continue the summit. &lt;a href=\"Countess%20Hakruba\"&gt;Countess Hakruba&lt;/a&gt; gives the plan that the guilds will handle the attack on Coldharbour, but the Alliance must hold their advances onto the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nThe Second Aldmeri Dominion.\nThe Alliance War had halted temporarily for the Guilds when they invaded Coldharbour. In the end, the Elite Agent stormed the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Stair\"&gt;Endless Stair&lt;/a&gt; in Coldharbour with &lt;a href=\"Meridia\"&gt;Meridia&lt;/a&gt; by their side and fighting Molag Bal. The Planemeld had ended, but the Imperial City was still under Daedric control. The Aldmeri Dominion had advanced into the Imperial City along with the other alliances. But as time went on, the Alliance War had ensued into the Interregnum. It is unknown when the Alliance War ended, but each of the alliances was no longer active, including the Aldmeri Dominion. The idea that Ayrenn had dreamt years ago had left an impact on the Elves of Southern Tamriel. In &lt;a href=\"2E%20830\"&gt;2E 830&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Second Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was created by &lt;a href=\"Camoran%20Anaxemes\"&gt;Camoran Anaxemes&lt;/a&gt;, the Wood Elven King of Valenwood. The Dominion consisted of the Summerset Isles and Valenwood when Anaxemes established ties with the High Elves when they entered Valenwood and driven out the &lt;a href=\"Colovian\"&gt;Colovian&lt;/a&gt;s. This alliance rivaled the rising power of the &lt;a href=\"Septim%20Empire\"&gt;Septim Empire&lt;/a&gt;, battling them throughout the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20the%20Blue%20Divide\"&gt;Cape of the Blue Divide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Colovian%20West\"&gt;Colovian West&lt;/a&gt;. Once &lt;a href=\"Tiber%20Septim\"&gt;Tiber Septim&lt;/a&gt; had unleashed &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt; onto the Summerset Isles, the Second Aldmeri Dominion had fallen, ultimately uniting the continent and establishing the Third Era.\nThe Third Aldmeri Dominion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"3E%20433\"&gt;3E 433&lt;/a&gt; had ended, the provinces of Tamriel were in a dire-state, the Septim Dynasty had ended with &lt;a href=\"Potentate%20Ocato\"&gt;Potentate Ocato&lt;/a&gt; taking the position as the leader of the Empire. Amidst the strife, the &lt;a href=\"Thalmor\"&gt;Thalmor&lt;/a&gt; had risen to power in the Summerset Isles, establishing a totalitarian regime in the Summerset Isles, forming an alliance with the Wood Elves. Supposedly, the High Elves had ended the &lt;a href=\"Void%20Nights\"&gt;Void Nights&lt;/a&gt; situation, giving them much praise from the &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elsweyr\"&gt;Elsweyr&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Third%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Third Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt; was created, and it soon rivaled the power of the weakened Third Empire. The Dominion had eventually fought against the Septim Empire at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20War\"&gt;Great War&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in the Empire's Victory, though it was through luck. The &lt;a href=\"White-Gold%20Concordat\"&gt;White-Gold Concordat&lt;/a&gt; was created between the Empire and the Dominion, which included the following: Worshipping of Talos is forbidden, the disbandment of &lt;a href=\"the%20Blades\"&gt;the Blades&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dominion's occupation of Southern &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt;. The Empire was forced to agree, but it cost the Empire, Hammerfell's allegiance. The Great War continued for another five years and ended with the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Treaty%20of%20Stros%20M%27kai\"&gt;Second Treaty of Stros M'kai&lt;/a&gt;. The Thalmor established footholds throughout the Empire, in places such as &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Rock\"&gt;High Rock&lt;/a&gt;."}

Nothing could be further from the truth! We High Elves have a penchant for urbane witticisms and sophisticated wordplay that can sometimes be misinterpreted by individuals newly-exposed to our ancient and refined culture. So I've assembled this brief introduction to our beloved Queen of &lt;a href=\"Alinor\"&gt;Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, intending to tell her story in a simple, direct fashion that can be understood even by our new allies in the &lt;a href=\"First%20Aldmeri%20Dominion\"&gt;Aldmeri Dominion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Altmer, of course, are descended in an unbroken line from &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; who created &lt;a href=\"Nirn\"&gt;Nirn&lt;/a&gt;, and none more so than the royal family of Alinor. Ayrenn's father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Hidellith\"&gt;King Hidellith&lt;/a&gt; of august memory, ruled the Summerset Isles long and well, and exemplified the best traditions of Elven &lt;a href=\"Ceremoniarchy\"&gt;Ceremoniarchy&lt;/a&gt;, basing his every decision on the precedents laid down in the &lt;a href=\"Scrolls%20of%20Praxis\"&gt;Scrolls of Praxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn due time, as ordained by the Scrolls, King Hidellith and his wife &lt;a href=\"Kinlady%20Tuinden\"&gt;Kinlady Tuinden&lt;/a&gt; conceived a child, who was named Ayrenn as the Praxis dictated. Princess Ayrenn was born on the 5th of &lt;a href=\"Second%20Seed\"&gt;Second Seed&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20555\"&gt;555&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Era\"&gt;Second Era&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a very auspicious date, though I will spare you the reasons why, as you lack the context to comprehend its full significance. However, you can believe me when I tell you all Summerset, &lt;a href=\"Auridon\"&gt;Auridon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Artaeum\"&gt;Artaeum&lt;/a&gt; celebrated her birth for fifty-five days.\nIt was foretold that Princess Ayrenn would reflect the restless and turbulent times in which she was born, and so it came to pass. Nimble and quick-witted, she was quick to master the lessons of her tutors, and from an early age often adopted unorthodox approaches to schoolwork. In fact, she sometimes became so engrossed in her independent studies that her whereabouts were unknown for days at a time. She would often return from these field trips with unusual knowledge and mastery of remarkable skills.\nOne day in &lt;a href=\"Evening%20Star\"&gt;Evening Star&lt;/a&gt; of the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;563&lt;/a&gt; the entire royal family of Alinor gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Tower%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Crystal Tower&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate Ayrenn's matriculation to the &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs%27%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Sapiarchs' Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;, where she was to study &lt;a href=\"Altmeri%20Regal%20Praxis\"&gt;Altmeri Regal Praxis&lt;/a&gt; and Ceremoniarchy for the requisite 3,555 days. But somewhere between the Palace and Tower the princess had disappeared, and despite a 17th Degree Inquiry decreed by the &lt;a href=\"Justiciar\"&gt;Justiciar&lt;/a&gt;s, she was nowhere to be found. The &lt;a href=\"Sapiarchs\"&gt;Sapiarchs&lt;/a&gt;, however, reported that the night of her disappearance was filled with signs and portents, the constellation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Lady\"&gt;the Lady&lt;/a&gt; seeming to ride the constellation of &lt;a href=\"the%20Steed\"&gt;the Steed&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Orrery\"&gt;Great Orrery&lt;/a&gt; spun backward, and a young eaglet was found atop the statue of &lt;a href=\"Topal%20the%20Explorer\"&gt;Topal the Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn due course &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Naemon\"&gt;Prince Naemon&lt;/a&gt;, Ayrenn's eldest brother, was named heir to the throne of Alinor, and in &lt;a href=\"2E%20565\"&gt;565&lt;/a&gt; he matriculated into the Labyrinth. Naemon, like his father, was a natural ceremoniarch, who seemed to have a genuine relish for the rites and duties ordained for the heir by tradition. Indeed, when King Hidellith ascended to &lt;a href=\"Aetherius\"&gt;Aetherius&lt;/a&gt; in the year &lt;a href=\"2E%20580\"&gt;580&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Naemon immediately began preparing to speak the eighty-eight day &lt;a href=\"Coronation%20Liturgy\"&gt;Coronation Liturgy&lt;/a&gt; that would elevate him to the throne in his father's place.\nThen, in a day of divine glory, the unforeseen occurred! Word came from &lt;a href=\"Port%20Velyn\"&gt;Port Velyn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valenwood%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Valenwood&lt;/a&gt; that Princess Ayrenn was on her way to Auridon by swan ship! In wonder and haste, the Court of Alinor took itself to &lt;a href=\"Firsthold%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Firsthold&lt;/a&gt; to greet her, arriving just in time to welcome her unexpected return. Princess Ayrenn announced that she was prepared, as the eldest heir, to assume the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Alinor\"&gt;Throne of Alinor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"High%20Justiciar\"&gt;High Justiciar&lt;/a&gt; affirmed that this was, indeed, her right. She was crowned Queen Ayrenn on the 7th of &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Fall\"&gt;Frost Fall&lt;/a&gt; in the year 580.\nNow, some of you may have heard wild tales about Princess Ayrenn's adventures during her time away from Summerset \u2014 that she sailed as first mate with a pirate captain from &lt;a href=\"Anvil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, disguised herself as a &lt;a href=\"Dunmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; in order to read the &lt;a href=\"Indigo%20Scrolls\"&gt;Indigo Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; in the vaults of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;, bested the &lt;a href=\"Dervishes%20of%20Rihad\"&gt;Dervishes of Rihad&lt;/a&gt; at their own sword-dance, and even outdrank Queen &lt;a href=\"Mabjaarn%20Flame-Hair\"&gt;Mabjaarn Flame-Hair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; in a mead-slamming contest. All myths and tales, I assure you, preposterous and absurd. Our queen was merely preparing for Praxis and Ceremoniarchy in her own fashion of independent study.\nSince assuming the throne she has brought some innovations to the rule of our wondrous land \u2014 but this is as foretold at the time of her auspicious birth, and the Sapiarchs, one and all, have endorsed her innovations. So you see, students, Ayrenn is undisputed Queen of the Isles, and all is right and proper \u2014 as it should be."}

After some searching, Modryn was able to track Azani to an Ayleid Ruin called &lt;a href=\"Atatar\"&gt;Atatar&lt;/a&gt;. Once Modryn and the recruit arrived they fought their way in and killed Azani.

He will meet them at his house after dark as he will not talk about this at the &lt;a href=\"Chorrol%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;guild house&lt;/a&gt;. Wait until dark and then go inside his house where he is waiting.\nHe will tell the Hero they are to help him investigate the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;. He believes that they have conspired against the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;. He also says that he believes that there is something not right about the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt;. They accept any contract and do anything to complete it.\nFor instance, in the recent &lt;a href=\"Azani%20Blackheart\"&gt;Azani Blackheart&lt;/a&gt; mission, the Fighters Guild tried to recover an artifact from Azani for a &lt;a href=\"Mage%20%28Class%29\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; named Argoth with the help of twenty men. Five survived. The &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20Company\"&gt;Blackwood Company&lt;/a&gt; then took over and finished the job. However, recently Argoth died, and the artifact went missing, which could mean the company made a deal with Azani Blackheart. He tells them to meet him at the &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20Fighters%20Guild\"&gt;Leyawiin Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce in &lt;a href=\"Leyawiin%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Leyawiin&lt;/a&gt;, he will tell them to go with him to &lt;a href=\"Arpenia%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Arpenia&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruins&lt;/a&gt; north of Leyawiin to see if the two of them can find any evidence against the Blackwood Company.\nArpenia.\nHead to Arpenia, and help Oreyn clear the ruins. There are but a few rats and mudcrabs and he will approach and say that it seems the ruin is empty. Sometimes Oreyn won't talk about Blackheart even after the ruins are cleared. When this happens try going into the room were there is a &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Traps\"&gt;platform spike trap&lt;/a&gt;, there one should be able to talk with him.\nHe will tell the Hero that his suspicions are true, and that the Blackwood Company must have made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Azani%20Blackheart\"&gt;Azani Blackheart&lt;/a&gt; to move his base of operations to &lt;a href=\"Atatar\"&gt;Atatar&lt;/a&gt;, slightly northeast of Arpenia.\nHe tells them to follow him there. When he walks into the room with the platform spike trap, he sometimes steps on it and gets stuck. It'll keep going up and down. Just reload again to save time. Do not run ahead of him as he will stop moving; it's best just to follow him to Atatar. This will take some time, as he walks pretty slowly.\nAtatar.\nHaving followed Oreyn to Atatar, begin clearing it. This ruin is filled with &lt;a href=\"bandits%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;. On the fourth level, Atatar Loria, one will find Azani Blackheart. Kill him and grab the ring. Go directly to Oreyn and confirm his suspicions about the Blackwood Company. Give him the ring to complete the quest and advance to the next rank in the &lt;a href=\"Fighters%20Guild%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fighters Guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternatively, the Hero can run on ahead to Atatar and solo the ruin. The quest update on killing Blackheart will be the same and assume that Oreyn is present in the room and this can be ignored. Oreyn will start walking back to Chorrol, meet him there or on the road to give him Blackheart's ring.\nOreyn doesn't give an official reward, since this mission is off-the-record, however both ruins have plenty of loot in them, especially Atatar. Blackheart wears a full suit of &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Armor%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Elven Armor&lt;/a&gt; minus the helm, and wields an &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Swords%20%28Oblivion%29%23Claymore\"&gt;claymore&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Sinweaver\"&gt;Sinweaver&lt;/a&gt;."}

The townsfolk have their own problems, and few pay any mind to &lt;a href=\"Stendarr\"&gt;Stendarr&lt;/a&gt;'s chosen. I will write what I've pieced together, in hopes it provides some clarity.\nFrom what I've gathered, Fenrik came to &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; to investigate rumors of Daedra worship. There was some thought that this cult was the source of the town's &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Nightmare\"&gt;recurring nightmares&lt;/a&gt;, although it's unclear how much of that is true. Then one night, Fenrik disappeared, without a word to the innkeeper or anyone else in the town. It was then that other patrols started to go missing, also without a trace.\nOf leads I have one. The other day the innkeeper found something curious behind the inn, in the midst of emptying the trash. It was an &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Dagger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven dagger&lt;/a&gt;, its blade warm with blood and upon further examination, tipped with poison.\nThe craft of the blade can mean many things. Perhaps this Daedric cult is Elven in origin. Moreover, &lt;a href=\"Elven%20Weapons%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Elven weapons&lt;/a&gt; are fashioned from &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ingot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt;, and there is a &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; in close proximity. The poison too could have originated from a nearby source. It's also likely that our murderer moves at night, when the eyes of the town are blind to their heathen worship.\nAs such, I suspect three individuals as possible owners of the blade. Vereth the Elf, who complains of the cold and yet seems resolute in staying. Harald the miner, who works the &lt;a href=\"Quicksilver%20Ore%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; from which the murder weapon was fashioned. Lastly, Irvine the traveler, who seems to know more about &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt; than the proprietors of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Mortar%20and%20Pestle\"&gt;Pestle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll three seem to be active in the small hours, but I can only follow one at a time. Still, doing will prove useful, as they will either lead me to their place of worship or eliminate themselves as suspects.\nBut first, I must meet the writer of this note. Perhaps they know more about the dagger, or have information that can narrow down my search."}

First, that's not a sapphire, and second, we're not selling it,\" Pamolwe remarked. \"It belongs with me, in my experiments. You can't even imagine what I can do with that thing and a little time!\"The Nord growled. \"What? There's no way I'm letting you keep that to tinker with. Look at it! It's as big as my head! We'll live like kings!\"\n\"It is worth more in the revelations I'll witness than you can imagine, mead-for-brains!\"\nAzarrid observed the dispute, leaning against the cool stone of the ancient wall as his companions' argument intensified. His gaze flicked down the hallway and his face lit up with a hungry grin as he noticed something interesting. Buffing his claws on his leather armor, he waited for the right moment. \"Khajiit thinks,\" he said during a seething pause, \"that whoever is best to decide is the best adventurer, and that is the one who picks it up first.\" He took off and sprinted past the Nord and Altmer.\nDumbfounded, his companions blinked in surprise for only a moment and then charged forward to catch up, each eager to claim the prize. In their fervor, neither noticed how Azarrid gradually slowed his pace. Magic flew as Pamolwe cast spells to increase her speed, and Lodissar bellowed and surged forward through the dim hall towards the glow of the gem, axe held high.\nAs they overtook Azarrid, they taunted him, but his grin didn't falter as the hallway revealed its true nature to the two frontrunners. Suddenly, concealed blades swung from the walls, slicing in deadly arcs across the hall. A blade sped towards Lodissar and crashed against his armor, pushing him aside. Unharmed, he laughed as Azarrid, keeping pace, nimbly dodged the deadly trap. Pamolwe was not so fortunate or skilled. Her wards shattered under the blows. Frantic, she tried to stop short of a blade in front of her, but her foot became entangled in her robe. She fell headfirst into its path.\nAzarrid did not stop to look back, but jogged behind Lodissar, who continued his shouting. The enormous gem was close now, almost within reach. Assured of his victory, he turned to loose a final insult when the stones beneath his feet crumbled. He tumbled downward, clanging and flailing in his steel armor as it pulled him into a deep pool. Muffled screams sounded from the water as whatever lurked inside stirred.\nIn a quick leap, the triumphant Khajiit stood before the gem, illuminated by its light. Snatching it up, he turned to look back down the trapped hallway. \"Seems Azarrid is the best adventurer today, dear friends,\" he intoned, unaware of the bladed device unfolding from the pedestal behind him."}

There, a woman filled her pockets with stones. When she finished, the woman walked into the river.\nRajhin could not let her drown, so he ran across the river's surface and pulled the woman from her would-be grave.\n\"Why did you save me, my lord?\" she asked. \"Does Rajhin, the Trickster God, not know my intent?\"\n\"I know the what, my lady, but not the why.\"\nThe woman frowned and turned her back. \"You could not possibly understand my plight. Please, let me gather my stones and continue on my way.\"\nBut Rajhin would not let her continue until she shared her story.\nThe woman, Munilli, had a fiancee named Mazaram, and the two were much beloved. But Munilli's step-father Azelit-ra, was a greedy man. Before he would give them permission to marry, he insisted on a bride-price beyond Mazaram's considerable means, and well beyond all reason.\nAzelit-ra was headman of the village in which they lived and none dared speak against him for his injustice. But Mazaram was not cowed by Azelit-ra, which made the step-father hate him all the more. Still, Mazaram would not dishonor Munilli by eloping. Rather than see her fiancee ruined by her step-father's demands, Munilli chose the river.\n\"You say your step-father rules your village?\"\n\"With an iron paw, my lord,\" Munilli replied sadly. \"Those he does not bribe owe him money. Only a few, such as Mazaram, remain free of his grasp \u2026 and he does what he can to ruin them.\"\n\"Do you think your step-father is satisfied ruling a tiny village?\" Rajhin asked.\n\"Satisfied?\" Munilli scoffed, wiping her tears away. \"He does not know the meaning of the word.\"\n\"Then perhaps I can help. Come, let us find Mazaram.\"\nAs they went to the village, Rajhin explained his plan to the young woman.\nThat afternoon, Mazaram and Munilli approached Azelit-ra upon the porch of his great moon-sugar plantation house. Seeing the hand-in-hand angered Azelit-ra, even though they were properly affianced. \"So, my little pauper,\" the step-father greeted Mazaram, \"have you agreed to my bride-price, or shall we finally see the last of you?\"\nMazaram refused to take offense and instead bowed briefly. \"While it is true I cannot meet your bride-price, my lord, I can offer you something better.\"\nAzelit-ra's ears twitched, but he sneered with skepticism. \"Better? Better than the sum I demand for my only daughter? Fine, tell me of this offer. If it is generous, then so be it. But if not, I would see your tail as you leave forever!\""}

He explained that one of his agents\u2014for Mazaram made his money in shipping\u2014told him of a nearby land without a ruler. \"It is far greater than this village, yet shines like a pearl in the darkness. A place to which you can lay claim, but that you'll never reach without my agent's aid.\"\nAzelit-ra laughed scornfully, \"No such land exists! Is this some crude ploy to get me out of the way while you marry my daughter? Fah! I'll not fall for your tricks!\"\n\"It is no trick, step-father,\" Munilli asserted. \"On my mother's honor, I have seen this land\u2014as have you! It is renowned for its beauty in story and song!\"\nAt this, Azelit-ra was taken aback. As much as he knew Munilli wished to marry Mazaram, he also knew her as a truthful girl \u2026 and she valued her late mother's honor as much as her own life. But still he doubted, for an untrustworthy man does not trust easily.\n\"Very well. What is this great land of which you speak, that I have seen yet do not know?\"\nMazaram waggled one finger, \"No, no \u2026 if I tell you freely, how do I know you won't try to conquer it without me? I insist you'll need my agent's help, but you might try something foolish on your own.\"\n\"Very well,\" Azelit-ra harrumphed. \"If you won't tell me, then how will I know you speak the truth?\"\n\"My agent,\" Mazaram replied, \"will take you there tonight. If he does so, will you agree I've met the bride-price?\"\n'A ruse,' thought the greedy step-father. 'They hope to escape while I prepare for my \"journey\" to this land of theirs. Well, I can fix them!'\n\"Agreed!\" Azelit-ra exclaimed, much to the surprise of the servants around him. \"But I insist if we're to go on a journey, we must have your engagement feast beforehand! You, Mazaram, shall sit upon my right and Munilli shall sit upon my left!\"\n'Ha,' he thought, 'try to escape while you're in arm's reach!'\nBut the two agreed. Azelit-ra had no choice but to open his larder and wine cellar to the entire village. They feasted all afternoon. As was his habit, the plantation owner ate greedily, making sure no one else got more than he. The couple ate sparingly and never moved from his side. Soon, Azelit-ra grew sleepy, and then annoyed.\n\"The moons are rising, Mazaram! Where is this agent of yours?\" he asked.\n\"I am right behind you, my lord,\" a voice purred in Azelit-ra's ear.\nThe old man jumped, but quickly recovered. When he turned, he saw what looked like a vagabond in a wide-brimmed hat. The traveler's tail twitched, but whether it was with nervousness or amusement, Azelit-ra could not tell.\n\"Well, then, where is this land of yours!\" Azelit-ra bellowed at the man. \"I'm ready to go \u2026 or to see the back of you and Mazaram both!\"\n\"You are ready?\" the vagabond asked. \"Then let us go now!\" With a flash, the vagabond discarded his wide-brimmed hat. There stood &lt;a href=\"Rajhin\"&gt;Rajhin&lt;/a&gt; the Trickster God in all his glory. Without another word, Rajhin seized the fat man by his stained tunic and the two flew upward like shooting stars. Soon, their glow disappeared into the pearl-wide aura of &lt;a href=\"Jode\"&gt;Jode&lt;/a&gt;, the largest moon.\n\"Truly,\" Munilli mused aloud, \"it is a land we can see from our village.\"\n\"And one that shines as beautiful as a pearl.\"\nWhen the villagers recovered from their shock, the engagement feast turned into a wedding feast. By the time both moons had set, Mazaram and Munilli were married.\nBut as they lay in their bower, a chill overcame both of them. The candles guttered. The darkness grew. Munilli cried out, and Mazaram groped in the dark for his sword.\nSuddenly, there was a flash of light. Rajhin stood before them, brushing moon-dust off his garments. \"Now, then, where are you?\" he mused as the two lovers gaped. \"Ah, there you are!\"\nWith a movement too quick for the eye to follow, Rajhin reached out and grabbed at the air. Then he shoved his hand into one of the many small pouches on his person. The room grew light once more.\n\"What was that, my lord? What did you sieze?\" Munilli asked.\n\"The fat man's shadow! I took him to his new land so quickly, he jumped right out of it!\"\nTheir laughter echoed across the riverbank."}

It is the location of &lt;a href=\"Alain%20Dufont\"&gt;Alain Dufont&lt;/a&gt;, whose death is an objective of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Brotherhood%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dark Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; quest \"&lt;a href=\"Mourning%20Never%20Comes\"&gt;Mourning Never Comes&lt;/a&gt;.\" In addition, it is overrun by &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;bandits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Automatons\"&gt;Dwarven Automatons&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the dungeon, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; may exit to &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. If the DLC is installed, this is also the location of one of the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Shard\"&gt;Aetherium Shard&lt;/a&gt;s for the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Lost%20to%20the%20Ages\"&gt;Lost to the Ages&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSublocations.\nRaldbthar.\nThe first room inside the ruins contains a flame trap blocking the way forward, with a charred &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;skeever&lt;/a&gt; impaled by a pole that is set up so the flames will cook it. Damage can be minimized using &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind%20Sprint\"&gt;Whirlwind Sprint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Become%20Ethereal\"&gt;Become Ethereal&lt;/a&gt; to go through it without getting burned, or it is possible to go around the back (right) side of the post that is shooting fire. Straight ahead is an expert-locked gate with Alain Dufont and two other bandits behind it. With high enough &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; skills, the gate lock can be picked and Alain killed without too much trouble.\nThe alternative is to proceed the long way around. At the flame trap, a hallway leads to the left. Down the hall is a large room with a single bandit towards the left (northeast) side. The right (southwest) end of the room contains two more bandits and a &lt;a href=\"workbench\"&gt;workbench&lt;/a&gt;. The path proceeds down a hall and to the right, where an open gate leads to the same room with Alain Dufont and two other bandits. Alternatively, straight ahead is a master-locked gate can be opened, and through it and to the right are two Dwarven crossbow mechanisms aimed at the bandits that can be used by pulling the levers next to each one.\nAfter the bandits are dealt with, a gate underneath the crossbows leads to another large room with a bandit and many fallen rocks. The room contains more loot, mostly behind a locked gate. Through the next door and around a corner lies a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Sphere%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven sphere&lt;/a&gt; and then another door. The next large room contains loud gears, a spider worker, and two more Dwarven spheres.\nThe next door should be open, and leads to a hallway with a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Spider%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven spider&lt;/a&gt; worker, and then stairs with a double blade trap, which should shut off automatically after the spider worker is defeated. Note that the blades tend to be very glitchy, so a save is recommended before going through the open door. If the blades don't stop after defeating the spider worker, they can be bypassed by getting next to the parts of the wall where they can't reach, then once the blades are past, running to another part of the wall to get to the top. Next is a pusher/flame trap, and two more Dwarven spheres. Up the stairs leads to a hallway with another workbench, a short set of stairs up, four spider workers, and, at the end, an elevator to the Raldbthar Deep Market.\nRaldbthar Deep Market.\nDown the corridor is a ramp down with another spinning blade trap. At the end is a door leading to steps down to a large room with many\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Falmer%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Falmer&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and two skeevers in a pen. On the far side is a set of stairs that lead up to a spiral ramp up to a platform with more Falmer. Another ramp leads down again to a button that drops a draw bridge from back at the previous platform. Back up the ramp, the draw bridge can now be followed up to another platform and another ramp down. From here, the rooftops can be crossed to gain access to a room behind Dwarven metal grates. A hallway leads to a door, then to a set of steps down to a room with many pipes and escaping steam. Be careful of the floor trap at the top of the stairs, which triggers a ballista trap that can kill the player instantly. Within this room is a seemingly inaccessible chest on the floor above.\u00a0There is a series of four large tubes slanting up and to the left. Using jump, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; can climb up one of these slanted tubes. At the top, turn around and use Whirlwind Sprint to access a small ledge. Follow this ledge back toward the ballista trap location and you can access the chest. Another method is to trigger the nearby pressure plate trap with a bow then jump atop the bars as the trap resets, at the right angle to not slide off. Use the small broken stone just past the trap, furthermore you must move over to the other side of the bars to avoid getting pushed off by the pipes above that side. The back of the trap acts as one solid platform, despite appearing as individual bars.\nThe next room possesses a large quantity of Dwemer scrap metal, four buttons and a blocked hall to the left. The first button will activate a fire trap, the third button will open the gate, and the other two do nothing.\nThrough the door beyond the open gate is a room with a gate, a few\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Creatures%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0Falmer, and two\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Chaurus%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;chaurus&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0behind another gate to the left (south) that is novice locked. The chauruses can be shot with arrows or &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;destruction spells&lt;/a&gt; through the opening to the left of the gate. Since they cannot escape the area, they are good for practicing stealth by simply walking around them. If stealth is blown, walk into a yurt on the other side of the pool until they lose track and stealth is re-entered. There is a bridge with a button labeled \"unpowered.\" To lower the bridge, you must clear the large gears around the room of bones that are stuck in there. Clear the right hand gear at the entrance to the bridge pointing on it (you will then see what is stuck in there) and remove it. Clear a second gear on the left hand side of the room past the Falmer hut. Clear a third gear on the right hand side of the room. The final gear is underwater between the two stairs - hard to see. After all four blockages have been removed, head up the stairs to where the bridge will drop and press the button located on a small plinth to the left hand side of the platform.\u00a0After unjamming all the gears, the button on the bridge can be pressed, which drops a draw bridge and activates a &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Centurion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dwarven centurion&lt;/a&gt;, though at higher levels, it may be a centurion master.\nBehind the centurion is a door that leads to a hallway with a lever at the other end that opens a gate. This room contains two Dwarven spiders and a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Mechanism\"&gt;Dwarven Mechanism&lt;/a&gt;, which\u00a0opens a set of stairs down to a door that leads to &lt;a href=\"Blackreach%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Blackreach&lt;/a&gt;. If is installed, the hallway to the right will contain an &lt;a href=\"Aetherium%20Shard\"&gt;Aetherium Shard&lt;/a&gt;. The hallway to the left contains a lever which returns the player to Skyrim.\nTrivia.\nThe piece of &lt;a href=\"Dwemer%20Scrap%20Metal\"&gt;Dwemer Scrap Metal&lt;/a&gt; that falls from the underwater gear cannot be moved by the Dragonborn or taken into inventory."}

Tell her General Gautier's troops are right behind. She is surprised and wants the Vestige to let him know how many soldiers she has left and that they are ready to fight.\nGo back to the main camp to find Gautier and let him know what Mandin said. He is pleased to hear this and now it's time for their plan. They need to take hold of the courtyard, just inside the main gate and we could use some help. The inner gate must be locked, go inside the northwest tower and lock the gate.\nFollow the marker to reach the northwest tower. Fight the werewolves on the way, it can be hard so sneaking a bit might help. When inside the tower, find the lever to look the main gate. Head back to Gaultier and let him know. He also mentions they need more soldiers so they are bringing in more troops before they can make a full assault on the city."}

Together, they own and operate the mill, which is focal to Riverwood's prosperity. Because of this, they are considered the town's leaders.\nDuring the cart ride into &lt;a href=\"Helgen\"&gt;Helgen&lt;/a&gt; during the opening cut-scene, Ralof mentions \"being sweet on a girl\" from there in the past, before the &lt;a href=\"civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;. He also reminisces about &lt;a href=\"Vilod\"&gt;Vilod&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mead%20with%20Juniper%20Berry\"&gt;mead with juniper berry&lt;/a&gt; mixed in, which can be found should the Dragonborn return to Helgen at a later date. \nIt is likely that &lt;a href=\"Hadvar\"&gt;Hadvar&lt;/a&gt; and Ralof knew each other as children. They are from the same small village and their interactions during \"&lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;\" seem to imply they are at least familiar with each other.\nInteractions.\nAfter the Dragonborn becomes settled in Riverwood, with Hod and Gerdur's house as a temporary place of stay, Ralof can be spoken to, further discussing subjects, such as the dragon that attacked, directions to &lt;a href=\"Whiterun%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Whiterun&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stormcloaks\"&gt;Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Ulfric%20Stormcloak%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Ulfric Stormcloak&lt;/a&gt;. By further discussing the Stormcloaks, the Dragonborn has the option of being convinced to join the Stormcloaks, or considering the subject longer.\n&lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of prisoners are being taken to Helgen. Upon arriving, &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; begin calling the names of suspected Stormcloaks with the intent of executing them. However, &lt;a href=\"Alduin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Alduin&lt;/a&gt; attacks Helgen, and Ralof is able to escape. After reaching shelter, Ralof frees the Dragonborn from their bindings and asks for help against the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. Later, the Dragonborn has the opportunity to rejoin Ralof and escape from Helgen.\n&lt;a href=\"Joining%20the%20Stormcloaks\"&gt;Joining the Stormcloaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the Stormcloaks can be obtained by following Ralof during \"Unbound.\" Upon entering with Ralof, the quest is automatically received after leaving the keep. The quest also can be activated either by going to &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; and talking to Ulfric Stormcloak or by talking to traveling farmers or Stormcloak soldiers at their various camps located in the holds.\nIf the Dragonborn chooses to side with the Stormcloaks during the civil war, Ralof is promoted to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Captain\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; and assists the Dragonborn in various missions for the Stormcloaks.

Different encounters can occur at the same location, if it is revisited after some time has passed. Additionally, most encounters can occur several times in one playthrough of the game; even encounters that involve unique characters might occur more than once.\nSome random encounters happen for role-playing purposes only and will not affect the Dragonborn, such as a &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; chasing a &lt;a href=\"Fox%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"M%27aiq%20the%20Liar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;M'aiq the Liar&lt;/a&gt; commenting on the world. Others will begin quests, such as finding &lt;a href=\"Alik%27r%20warrior\"&gt;Alik'r warrior&lt;/a&gt;s interrogating &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; females. There are also encounters that will spawn a hostile group that will attack the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are a total of 95 Random Encounters in \"Skyrim\". Not all can be encountered in the one game, as some counteract each other, depending on choices made during quests. More encounters are included when add-ons like have been installed.\nNotably, most enemies that are unique to random encounters (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Scavenger%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Scavengers&lt;/a&gt;, robbers, &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Assassins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Werewolf%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Werewolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Vampires&lt;/a&gt;, rival adventurers, &lt;a href=\"Bandits%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Bandits&lt;/a&gt; dressed as imperial soldiers, etc.) level with the Dragonborn, and can be unusually powerful opponents at higher levels.\nWhile most random encounter characters disappear once the Dragonborn leaves the area, some random encounter NPCs including the &lt;a href=\"Reveler%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Revelers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Frightened%20Woman\"&gt;Frightened Woman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sond%20%28Child%29\"&gt;Sond&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bottar\"&gt;Bottar&lt;/a&gt; will travel to the nearest farm or mill after the encounter occurs, where they will take up residence as laborers and can be found for the rest of the game.\nRandom encounters are not limited to the wilderness of \"Skyrim\", as they can occur inside various buildings, such as the &lt;a href=\"Vilemyr%20Inn\"&gt;Vilemyr Inn&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "26242", "revid": "5064773", "url": "https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki?curid=26242", "title": "Random Loot (Oblivion)", "text": "Looting in is defined as taking equipment or &lt;a href=\"Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;items&lt;/a&gt; that are not owned (such as items marked with a red hand icon, which would be considered &lt;a href=\"stolen\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt;). Random loot is generally defined as valuable items found in chests or other containers, or taken from defeated enemies. Most of it is &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that gold stacks get bigger, equipment becomes higher-level, and otherwise rare or powerful items become more common as the player reaches a higher level.\nThe most common sources of random loot in \"Oblivion\" are &lt;a href=\"Caves%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;caves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forts%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;forts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ayleid%20Ruins%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Ayleid Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, which very rarely have owned items or friendly NPCs. These areas usually reset every three days and can be looted again (aside from &lt;a href=\"Welkynd%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Welkynd Stones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varla%20Stone\"&gt;Varla Stone&lt;/a&gt;s, found in limited non-respawning supply in Ayleid ruins), and will yield better finds as the player character increases in level. &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Gate%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Oblivion Gates&lt;/a&gt; are also good sources of rare loot, such as &lt;a href=\"bloodgrass\"&gt;bloodgrass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20Heart%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Daedra Hearts&lt;/a&gt;, and a random &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20Stone%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Sigil Stone&lt;/a&gt;, but they disappear once completed and will eventually run out if the player continues to close them.\nPlaces like NPC dwellings, campsites, or other &lt;a href=\"Settlements%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;settlements&lt;/a&gt; are generally poor sources of random loot; they usually have few items of value, taking most items found there is considered stealing, and/or most items do not respawn or level with the player.\nTips.\nWhen attempting to carry a large amount of loot, a good way to bolster carrying capacity is a &lt;a href=\"Fortify%20Strength%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Fortify Strength&lt;/a&gt; effect, which increases the maximum amount of weight the player can carry. It can be achieved with a &lt;a href=\"Spells%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; (purchased or customized using an &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Spellmaking%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Altar of Spellmaking&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;enchanted&lt;/a&gt; equipment, or a player-brewed &lt;a href=\"Potion%20Recipes%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;. Another possibility is &lt;a href=\"Feather%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;Feather&lt;/a&gt;, which has a similar effect. While less expensive, Feather does not have the additional bonuses of enhancing &lt;a href=\"Fatigue%20%28Oblivion%29\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; or melee damage, so Strength is generally considered a better option.\nIf the player cannot carry all the loot found in a certain area, it is possible to collect the items and store them in an accessible place to be carried away in multiple trips. They can be put in a standard container, or body of an enemy (which carries the added benefit of being movable to a more convenient location). However, they must be retrieved before the area resets or the enemy respawns (typically 73 hours later). Players should also be aware that living NPCs may take certain items, particularly food, if they happen across a stash that the player left behind."}

At the back of this room there is a word wall and an empty chest. Just in front of the chest there is a large trap door in the floor. This trap can be avoided by jumping onto the horseshoe-shaped ledge that runs along the base of the word wall, allowing one of the words of power for the &lt;a href=\"shout\"&gt;shout&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Peace\"&gt;Kyne's Peace&lt;/a&gt; to be learned. The ruin can be left by backtracking or by dropping through the trap door to meet &lt;a href=\"Sild%20the%20Warlock\"&gt;Sild the Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, and clear the rest of the ruin. If a &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; is present, to avoid having to do the entire ruin it is best to make them wait away from the wall and trap door before going to obtain the word of power, as the follower may fall through it.\nFalling through the trap door results in being trapped in a locked cage. There are several methods to escaping Sild's Cage, which has an expert lock. There is a key in Sild's assistant's satchel on the floor right next to the cage. Sild will begin a monologue and begin to search for the proper poison to perform experiments on his new subject. During this time the lock can be picked, there are several &lt;a href=\"Lockpick%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;lockpicks&lt;/a&gt; on the bodies in the water. Alternatively, sneak and pickpocket the key off of Sild if he gets close enough. A follower may also be commanded to open the cage door, or Sild's own, dead companion can be resurrected, who will open the door.\nKilling Sild will get his key, black mage robes, and a &lt;a href=\"Leveled%20Items%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled&lt;/a&gt; dagger. Also at higher levels he will have a staff of fireballs. The key unlocks the expert chest which contains &lt;a href=\"Random%20Loot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;leveled loot&lt;/a&gt;. \"&lt;a href=\"Sild%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Sild's Journal&lt;/a&gt;\" describes his trap and his desire to experiment on his prisoners. Dead bodies can be found locked in cages with the key, confirming that these are the bodies of the summoned ghosts roaming the area. The room has many potions and poisons, as well as an &lt;a href=\"Alchemy%20Lab%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;alchemy lab&lt;/a&gt;. After waiting around for a few minutes, another bandit will drop down the trap door and die instantly.\nLeaving Sild's dungeon down the hall to the left will have the Dragonborn encounter a subjugated ghost with a passageway on the left leading to a door that must be raised by the nearby lever. One path leads to the original room with the trapdoor, the other leads upstairs where another lever may be found.\nTaking the upper path first will allow circumventing Sild's trap by opening the gate to the lower levels, allowing them to sneak up on him. The path leads across a bridge over the trapdoor room with a subjugated ghost in the next room along with an apprentice locked chest containing gold and a dead-end.\nLeaving Sild's dungeon down the hall to the right will lead to a subjugated ghost with a dead-end wooden door on the right and an expert locked iron door on the left (can be unlocked with Sild's key). Behind the iron door leads to the way out of the dungeon as well as a chest."}

That's the way I'll return to my original time. And then I can stop all of this from happening. I can stop myself from stepping into that doorway, and into this prison.\nI suspect she knows though. Despite my relative ease moving through this forest so far, so long as I do stay within it, all of my attempts to travel to the Southern stone have been thwarted. This silent battle between me and the Spirit has lasted months now, but I'm determined. I will break free. I will stop this. I must."}

In my father's hall of business in Wayrest I learned of the tracking of shipments, the balancing of accounts, and the fluctuation of currencies, but &lt;a href=\"Pierric\"&gt;Pierric&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland&lt;/a&gt; knew the nature of the world, and he was not content to have his son learn only of the ways of peace and trade. Every morning I sparred with the Cumberland Master of Arms, and every afternoon the weather permitted I rode a warhorse, exercising with the &lt;a href=\"Menevia%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Menevia&lt;/a&gt; Heavy Dragoons.\nIt wasn't just practice: for two months every summer, I traveled as lieutenant of the mounted escort of the &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; Caravan, and a half-dozen times we fought off hill bandits, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28Online%29\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; raiders, and &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachman&lt;/a&gt; war bands.\nI was fortunate to have spent so much time with a hilt in my hand, for in &lt;a href=\"2E%20541\"&gt;2E 541&lt;/a&gt;, when I was but twenty, &lt;a href=\"Durcorach%20the%20Black%20Drake\"&gt;Durcorach the Black Drake&lt;/a&gt; spread his wings in &lt;a href=\"the%20Reach\"&gt;the Reach&lt;/a&gt; and mustered his feral tribesmen to war. Erupting from their mountain lairs like ants from a kicked anthill, the Reachmen howled down into &lt;a href=\"Bangkorai\"&gt;Bangkorai&lt;/a&gt;, burning and looting. After only three days' siege, Evermore fell to this horde. The land was pillaged and its people massacred. &lt;a href=\"Hallin%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Hallin's Stand&lt;/a&gt; held out longer, but eventually it was also overrun by the heathen swarm. Within days, they were across the &lt;a href=\"Bjoulsae%20River\"&gt;Bjoulsae&lt;/a&gt; and bearing down upon Wayrest. Then all were grateful that &lt;a href=\"Gardner%20Dynasty\"&gt;King Gardner&lt;/a&gt; had built new walls and battlements around Wayrest, for the town had grown so that it had burst the bounds of the old walls. Throngs of people swarmed in from the countryside, and soon it seemed that all Menevia, &lt;a href=\"Gavaudon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gavaudon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alcaire%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Alcaire&lt;/a&gt; were within the city walls. But when the Reachman storm burst upon Wayrest, the crowded conditions seemed a small price to pay for protection from the fury of those &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;-loving heathens.\nThus began the epic &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Wayrest%20%282E%20542%29\"&gt;Siege of Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, when for fifty-seven days and nights the &lt;a href=\"Bretons%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bretons&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormhaven%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Stormhaven&lt;/a&gt; manned the walls and repulsed the savage assaults of our terrible opponents. The Reachmen, lacking siege engines, were unable to breach our new walls and take the city by storm, and lacking ships they were unable to blockade our harbor and reduce the city by starvation. Stalemate: was Durcorach's invasion of High Rock at an end? Indeed, no: your Reachman warrior, though fearless and fierce, is not as a rule very patient. The Black Drake left enough troops in the revetments around our walls to keep us bottled up inside and simply marched off west into &lt;a href=\"Glenumbra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Glenumbra&lt;/a&gt;. Taken by surprise, the newly-independent city-state of &lt;a href=\"Camlorn%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Camlorn&lt;/a&gt; fell and was sacked. And then Durcorach turned his eyes south, toward Daggerfall.\nFortunately, King Gardner heeded my advice to use our merchant ships as transports for the Heavy Dragoons. That was how I found myself at the head of the lances of Wayrest's finest as we charged into the rear of the Reachmen massed before Daggerfall's city gates. All Bretons know how the Black Drake's warriors were caught completely by surprise, how I smote Durcorach and tore down his Unholy Banner. They know of the sortie of the Knights of Daggerfall in which King Bergamot finished the work we'd begun, scattering the broken army of heathens like autumn leaves before a gale.\nOnly one fortnight after that I watched, head bowed, as the kings of Daggerfall, Camlorn, Shornhelm, Evermore, and Wayrest signed the first &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Triumphs%20of%20a%20Monarch%2C%20Ch.%206\"&gt;Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Wayrest Besieged.\nEver since my accession to the throne of Wayrest in that momentous year of &lt;a href=\"2E%20563\"&gt;2E 563&lt;/a&gt;, the question of who should become my queen consort was ever on my \u2014 and my advisors' \u2014 minds. &lt;a href=\"King%20Ranser\"&gt;King Ranser&lt;/a&gt; of Shornhelm had a goodly daughter, &lt;a href=\"Rayelle\"&gt;Princess Rayelle&lt;/a&gt;, and her hand was offered to me by my brother of Shornhelm both early and often. Indeed, my mind was almost made up to accept the Princess of Shornhelm when, on a visit to Sentinel, my eyes first beheld the &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Maraya\"&gt;Princess Maraya&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"King%20Fahara%27jad\"&gt;King Fahara'jad&lt;/a&gt;. From that moment, I swore that Wayrest would have no queen but Maraya. Of course, there was another unexpected benefit: as her dowry, she brought a trade agreement between our two states that resulted in great prosperity for all.\nKing Ranser, alas, was wroth that I had not accepted the hand of his daughter, and he withdrew his ambassador from the court of Wayrest. Although Ranser was invited to my wedding to Maraya in the spring of &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;566&lt;/a&gt;, like the other kings of the Covenant, he stayed, seething, in Shornhelm.\nI should perhaps have paid more attention to Ranser's choler, but I was so taken with my new bride and trade issues around the &lt;a href=\"Iliac%20Bay\"&gt;Iliac Bay&lt;/a&gt; that mountainous Shornhelm seemed distant and irrelevant. That mistake almost cost me my throne.\nFor over a year, Ranser had been quietly mustering his troops and emptying his treasury to hire mercenaries. In &lt;a href=\"Last%20Seed\"&gt;Last Seed&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"2E%20566\"&gt;2E 566&lt;/a&gt;, he led his army out of Shornhelm in a lightning strike to the south. Ranser had marched through Alcaire and Menevia almost before we were aware of his approach. The Shornhelm advance guard reached the gates of Wayrest while the local militias we had quickly mustered were still filing through them. This was a moment when history trembled upon a cusp: if the attacking Oldgate Lancers scattered our militia and took the gate, Wayrest could fall to her attackers within the hour.\nFortunately, I was personally present at the gate, along with my Cumberland Guard. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, I had my bannerman sound the charge. I led the gate guards and my household troops out against the Oldgate Lancers. My men wore full armor, and I, though unarmored, bore at my side the mighty &lt;a href=\"Orichalc%20Scalpel\"&gt;Orichalc Scalpel&lt;/a&gt;, an enchanted broadsword of many virtues. The Scalpel, drawn for the first time in anger, flashed and hummed like a blade in a sawmill as we hurled ourselves upon the Lancers. Our enemies, who suddenly found themselves opposed by armored veterans rather than panicky irregulars, were further confounded by the sudden onset of a thunderstorm. Lashed by hail, their horses terrified by lightning, faced with the Orichalc Scalpel scything through their necks and limbs, the vaunted Oldgate Lancers hesitated, then broke and ran, pell-mell, from the gate.\nBy the time Ranser's main forces arrived on the scene, our troops were all within the walls. The gates were shut up tight, but the King of Shornhelm was undeterred. The city of Wayrest found itself once more under siege, and Ranser, with more craft and foresight than the Reachman Durcorach, had come with siege engines in his train.\n&lt;a href=\"Triumphs%20of%20a%20Monarch%2C%20Ch.%2010\"&gt;Chapter 10&lt;/a&gt;: The Summons of Destiny.\nWith the Siege of Wayrest lifted, and Ranser defeated, my story comes to its end. You have read now of my carefree youth in Cumberland House, how my father Lord Pierric saw to my training in the crafts of trade, of war, and of state, of my first great victory over Durcorach at the gates of Daggerfall, and of the vast Orichalcum lode our family struck in the Cumberland Mine. You have heard of the tragic coming of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;, how it took both my father and the entire royal family of Wayrest, leaving our kingdom leaderless in a time of chaos. You now know with what reluctance I was persuaded to assume the throne of Wayrest. You know of the Halo of Gold that outlined the Sun on the day of my coronation. That omen of approval by the &lt;a href=\"Eight%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; dispelled all my doubts and converted even my most envious rivals into heartfelt allies.\nYou have now learned the true history of Ranser's War, and how it led to the Second, or Greater, Daggerfall Covenant, embracing the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguards&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, who came to our aid in our hour of direst need. The free peoples of northwest Tamriel have vowed to stand together against all threats, be they from within or without.\nWe were soon tested: in &lt;a href=\"2E%20579\"&gt;2E 579&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Emperor\"&gt;Emperor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Varen&lt;/a&gt;, with whom I was negotiating a treaty, disappeared from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; once again fell under the pall of the Daedric Cabal. In Varen's unexplained absence the \"Empress\" &lt;a href=\"Clivia\"&gt;Clivia&lt;/a&gt; assumed the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; has fallen into madness, murder, and decay. It is fortunate for our peoples \u2014 indeed, for all the peoples of Tamriel \u2014 that the true flame of the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Man\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; still burns in the Daggerfall Covenant. These are terrible times, but our destiny lies before us as straight and true as the &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; roads: we must march on Cyrodiil, overthrow the false empress and all her brood, and restore the Empire of Tamriel. Then once more peace and justice will rule the provinces, rather than blood and fire."}

Respectively, these three modes of foot travel span from slowest to fastest.\nFast Travel.\nThe Dragonborn, optionally, can use the &lt;a href=\"Fast%20Travel%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Fast Travel&lt;/a&gt; option to move between discovered locations quickly. &lt;a href=\"Unmarked%20Locations%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unmarked locations&lt;/a&gt; and undiscovered locations cannot be fast traveled to.\nCarriage.\nA third option includes the ability to pay a &lt;a href=\"Carriage\"&gt;carriage driver&lt;/a&gt; to transport the Dragonborn to inaccessible or burdensome places to travel. For example, a carriage outside of a may transport the Dragonborn from that city, to a city they have never been before. In , the Dragonborn can have their &lt;a href=\"Steward%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; hire a carriage driver for the Dragonborn's &lt;a href=\"Homestead%20%28Hearthfire%29\"&gt;homestead&lt;/a&gt;. These carriage drivers do not charge for transport and can take the Dragonborn to numerous places that the city carriage drivers will not.\nFerry.\nIn , the option to pay a ferryman for transportation to the coastal cities of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Dawnstar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Windhelm%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Windhelm&lt;/a&gt; was introduced. The price is 50 &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt; for each trip and 500 Septims for transportation to &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Volkihar\"&gt;an island near the High Rock border&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , a &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Maiden\"&gt;ferry&lt;/a&gt; is used for travel between the port of Windhelm on the mainland and &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Rock%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/a&gt; on the isle of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorse.\n&lt;a href=\"Horse%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Horses&lt;/a&gt; can be purchased, or in some instances &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;stolen&lt;/a&gt;, from stables and rode around as a form of transportation. This method of transportation is quicker than walking, but may make navigating mountainous areas more difficult."}

Though on some days, I do not blame them for choosing to remain in the tepid mud-baths of &lt;a href=\"Gideon%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Gideon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Western%20Skyrim\"&gt;Western Skyrim&lt;/a&gt; and its dryskins are not accustomed to travelers from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Marsh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Black Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, it seems. However, they appear more receptive to my kind than they are to their eastern neighbors. \"Milk-drinkers,\" they say, and spit on the ground. What a waste of perfectly good rheum!\nI assumed Western Skyrim was nothing but ice and rock. But there is much variety to be found in the different \"holds,\" as they call them, even if their names are odious to those without round tongues.\n&lt;a href=\"Haafingar%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Haafingar&lt;/a&gt; serves as the skull in the headdress, if Western Skyrim might be thought of as such finery. Icy winds from the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20of%20Ghosts\"&gt;Sea of Ghosts&lt;/a&gt; blasts the land, and much of it is barren coastline. But there is a safe harbor where the hold's rivers meet the sea, and astride it sits the city of &lt;a href=\"Solitude%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Solitude&lt;/a&gt;. If Haafingar is the skull in the headdress, then Solitude is the &lt;a href=\"uxul\"&gt;uxul&lt;/a&gt;-bean in the skull! A &lt;a href=\"Nords%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;'s idea of a metropolis to be sure, with little in the way of flowers or scent-worms or warm mud springs to relax in. Still, this one enjoyed some comforts from across &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;\u2014smuggled through the port, for apparently the people here discourage open trade with outsiders.\nI intended to travel with a caravan from Solitude to &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, but the accent of these Nords confounded me so much that I ended up on a cart bound for another of Western Skyrim's holds. This one they call &lt;a href=\"Hjaalmarch%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hjaalmarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen I saw it, I was for the first time on my journey woeful to be gone from home! Its &lt;a href=\"Drajkmyr%20Marsh\"&gt;bogs and marshes&lt;/a&gt;, though draped with frost, remind me of the fetid quagmires of Black Marsh. The crannogs and mud-huts of this place are pale imitations of those found in my homeland, though. And they extract so little subsistence from the fertile rot! They sate themselves mostly with fishing and trapping, and think nothing of the fermenting roots basting in the brine beneath their feet. I sought to evangelize the locals of &lt;a href=\"Morthal%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Morthal&lt;/a&gt;, the hold's \"capital,\" but to no meaningful effect. Alas. I did find that their sodden log houses make excellent breeding grounds for termite grubs. I am drying some as I write this to make snacks for the village juveniles.\nMy plans to reach Orsinium thwarted, I decided that I may as well visit the third of Western Skyrim's holds. &lt;a href=\"Karthald\"&gt;Karthald&lt;/a&gt;, they call it. Though these Nords also speak of the village of &lt;a href=\"Karthwatch\"&gt;Karthwatch&lt;/a&gt;. Already I have been confused between the two, and each time I see the local dryskins look at me as though I have erected the spine of jubilation at a bone-feast. &lt;a href=\"Sithis\"&gt;Sithis&lt;/a&gt; take me!\nThis far from the frozen Sea of Ghosts, this hold features the best weather to be found in Western Skyrim. The crags, however, rip through the ground and make planting haphazard at best. Though barren, this land remains a battleground between the Nords of Western Skyrim and the stick-loving &lt;a href=\"Reachfolk\"&gt;Reachfolk&lt;/a&gt; to the south.\nMy visit to Karthwatch (could they truly think of no other name-sires than the &lt;a href=\"River%20Karth\"&gt;River Karth&lt;/a&gt;?), the hold's main settlement, was memorable. Arrayed like a fortress upon stone bluffs, its mission was to watch over Western Skyrim's neighbors to the south. This entire hold was only recently egg-hatched, within the last few years, I am told. Though I only refer to its boundaries on the map\u2014 the dryskins here have a deep and profound attachment to the land, with some clans living here for generations. They seem suitable for the role of protecting their homeland, to be sure.\nTomorrow, I finally take a cart that I have thrice-confirmed is bound for Orsinium. My time in Western Skyrim, while not exactly profitable, has been an education. One I will eventually share with my shell-siblings in Gideon!"}

This somewhat follows and contradicts Redguard\u00a0philosophy towards\u00a0Illusion, Mysticism and Conjuration--all of which they\u00a0frown upon.\nDialogue.\n\"I'm Trayvond the Redguard, Mages Guild Evoker. Surprised? Yes, you don't see many Redguards in the Mages Guild. We don't much like spellcasters in Hammerfell. Wizards steal souls and tamper with minds. If you use magic, you're weak or wicked. My family didn't approve of my vocation, so I had to come to Cyrodiil for my education. I admit... I still have strong prejudices against necromancy, summoning, and illusion.

It is said that such a pilgrim would be rewarded with the blessing of &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%27%20Razor\"&gt;Mehrunes Razor&lt;/a&gt;, a vicious blade through which Dagon himself can claim the very souls of those it strikes.\nBenign intent compelled Ayleid folk to seek out the Nefarivigum. Arrogance let them believe themselves capable of disbarring any who would seek the Razor. So was built &lt;a href=\"Varsa%20Baalim\"&gt;Varsa Baalim&lt;/a&gt;, a great, ringed, labyrinthine city, during the height of Ayleid rule.\nSure as death, pilgrims came to Varsa Baalim, and for years the Elves drove back many, until it came to pass that a vampire slipped into the city unnoticed. Merfolk were touched with the foul affliction, throwing the city into a gathering storm of madness and ruin, and soon it seemed none was left to prevent the Razor from being recovered.\nThen, suddenly, Varsa Baalim was gone. Historic accounts dispute whether it happened through some final safety, a natural cataclysm, or by the touch of the &lt;a href=\"Nine%20Divines\"&gt;Divines&lt;/a&gt; themselves. Whatever the cause, history agrees on the result: the mountains of the Eastern Niben swallowed Varsa Baalim, and the Nefarivigum with it, where has remained hidden since the early days of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the tale is true, then somewhere on the eastern fringes of the &lt;a href=\"Niben%20Valley\"&gt;Niben Valley&lt;/a&gt;, where man's rule has scarcely reached through the years, the Nefarivigum still lies in wait, among a city of unliving abominations entombed within the cold bowels of the mountain."}

All types of trebuchets have a long reload timer and cannot shoot targets in close range, unlike the Ballista and the Catapult.\nTrebuchets are ideal for attacking due to their long range and very high damage, but it is recommended for trebuchets to be accompanied by ballistae or catapults when attacking as trebuchets cannot fire in close range."}

After they call for the guards, they may flee out of their home. Stopping them may prevent the guards from becoming aware, but sometimes the guards will hear from outside the home and come inside.\nCharacters may also follow the player around during the warning phase and even after calling the guards, making it more difficult to commit other crimes such as &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;Stealing&lt;/a&gt;.\nSleeping.\nSleeping characters have an increased awareness and will wake up easier while someone is trespassing than in most circumstances.\nFollower behavior.\nAs a character, your &lt;a href=\"Followers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt; will exhibit conflicting behaviors. They will follow you around when you trespass, but when you speak with them they will repeatedly say \"You're not supposed to be in here...\" and you cannot issue them any commands whatsoever.\nThe only way that you can issue commands while trespassing is by holding down the \"Activate\" button (PS3: X; Xbox: A) from a distance that is too far to open up a dialogue menu. You can issue the standard \"wait, sit, attack, take, etc.,\" but be careful not to order your follower to 'wait,' or issue them any commands that will result in them waiting, whilst trespassing as this will very likely result in them being unable to leave the building with you. This is because it is impossible to issue a \"Follow me\" command when you are trespassing, meaning that your follower will be stuck waiting.\nShould you find yourself in this predicament, a possible solution is to have your follower wait near the exit (directly in front of the door is preferable), exit yourself and wait for three days. This will cause your follower to \"become tired of waiting...\" and they will stop being your follower at that point and will begin walking to wherever their default location is, you can catch them and reenlist them as your follower at this point. Note: they will have switched back to their default equipment at this point, but they will still be carrying the gear they had before \u2014 it will just be unequipped.\nPenalty.\nThe fine for committing trespassing is 5 &lt;a href=\"Septim%20%28Coin%29\"&gt;Septims&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, when trespassing, if the owner of the house is still inside they may assault the trespasser. If you refuse to pay the fine the &lt;a href=\"Hold%20Guard\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; will attempt to kill the player. If it is another character, such as a &lt;a href=\"Thief%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;, trespassing, assault and murder is always the punishment. After the guards have killed them nobody will retrieve stolen items from the corpse and you are free to loot it without punishment. If this is the only crime the player has committed, your bounty will be so low that the guards will not pursue you if you can escape the building before they come. They will, however, recognize you as wanted if you speak to them, but you can usually just back out of conversation and they will ignore it. Sometimes there will be a speech option to bribe the guard, or convince them that it is not worth their time. This only works on individual guards to get out of that one conversation. Speaking with the same guard will cause them to recognize you as a wanted person again.\nCommitting other crimes.\n&lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;Theft&lt;/a&gt;.\nOften when performing an act of &lt;a href=\"Stealing\"&gt;theft&lt;/a&gt; you will find yourself trespassing. You may also trespass in &lt;a href=\"Mines%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; where you will &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"Ore%20Veins%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;vein&lt;/a&gt; that is owned, which is considered theft (this is a rare occurrence).\n&lt;a href=\"Combat%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Murder &amp; assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen attempting to murder or beat up a character (occasionally even quest related) you may find yourself trespassing.\n&lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt;.\nOften when trespassing, you will first have to pick a locked door to enter the domicile. After that, inside there may be many &lt;a href=\"Containers%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt;, display cases, and &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;locked doors&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing.\nSometimes, you will find characters in the place you are trespassing, usually owners of the location, their guests or guards that were just called because you have been caught. If they are sleeping, you may pickpocket them with an increased success rate.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Numbers%20Job\"&gt;Forging ledgers&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes, you will be asked to change the records of a store for the &lt;a href=\"Thieves%20Guild%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Thieves Guild&lt;/a&gt;. You may be trespassing while performing this task.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Shill%20Job\"&gt;Framing&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometimes, you will be asked to frame somebody for a crime they did not commit to have them penalized by the guards after they are tipped off about the \"thief\". This is a side quest for the Thieves Guild.\nPros and cons.\nThere are many advantages and disadvantages of trespassing."}

She will then say that she will go to &lt;a href=\"Evermore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Evermore&lt;/a&gt; to request additional support.\nUpon reaching the Imperial encampment, fight through the Imperial forces, consisting of battlemages, infantry, and assassins, and locate Septima's notes labeled \"&lt;a href=\"Directive%20To%20Centurion%20Bodenius\"&gt;Directive To Centurion Bodenius&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"On%20the%20Chamber%20of%20Passage\"&gt;On the Chamber of Passage&lt;/a&gt;.\" Then, enter the Hall of Heroes and speak to the Keeper of the Hall. The Keeper will explain to the Vestige that it is his job to keep the living out, and was unable to stop Septima from entering. She has filled the place with &lt;a href=\"Daedra%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt;, and is in the Chamber of Passage. The Vestige will need to convince the dead heroes within the hall to let them gain entrance through the Chamber of Passage. The Keeper will suggest for them to speak to Frandar Hunding first.\nOnce spoken to, Frandar will tell the Vestige that they need to prove themselves worthy of passage in order to receive his blessing. To do this, he will request for them to retrieve four scrolls from the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Circles\"&gt;Book of Circles&lt;/a&gt; and place them on their appropriate pedestals. After the scrolls \u2013 the &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Mastery of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20of%20Devotion\"&gt;Mastery of Devotion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Mastery of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Mastery%20of%20Discipline\"&gt;Mastery of Discipline&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 are retrieved and placed on their corresponding pedestals, return to Frandar to receive his blessing.\nThen, speak to Divad Hunding, the son of Frandar. He will tell the Vestige that, when &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Hira\"&gt;Emperor Hira&lt;/a&gt;'s soldiers arrested him while he was alive, they killed his mother as well. To gain his blessing, one will need to light the braziers within the chamber with color to honor his mother's sacrifice. The braziers themselves will already be lit; the task is to add the correct color on each brazier to match the memory of his mother's final moments before death.\nAfterwords, go directly to Makela Leki's chamber and speak to her spirit.\nWhen spoken to, she will say that Septima Tharn, by breaching into the Chamber without the heroes' blessings, lacks an essential quality of a true &lt;a href=\"Ansei\"&gt;Ansei&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige must find out what this quality is in order to gain her blessing. To do this, they will need to pick the blade that resembles this quality. Once this blade, the Simple Training Sword, is given to her, she will grant the Vestige entry to the Chamber of Passage.\nSpeak again to the Keeper of the Hall to complete the quest. He will reward the Vestige with the Heroes' Hatchet and 337 ."}

The members of the Tribunal were &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;, and they were worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20Temple\"&gt;Tribunal Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory of the Tribunal.\nIt began with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20First%20Council\"&gt;War of the First Council&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; uncovered a plot by the &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer-architect &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt; to use the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; to construct the &lt;a href=\"Numidium\"&gt;Numidium&lt;/a&gt;, a giant construct and a mockery of the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and the Chimer faith and way of life. War ensued between the two races. &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Chimer, and &lt;a href=\"Dumac%20Dwarfking\"&gt;Dumac Dwarfking&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Dwemer, faced off in battle and were both seriously injured. Dumac is assumed to have died at the location, and Kagrenac disappeared along with the rest of the Dwemer when he used &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20tools\"&gt;his tools&lt;/a&gt; on the Heart. Nerevar lived for a short time and sought out the counsel of his advisors Vivec, Almalexia and Sotha Sil, about what should be done with the Heart and &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac%27s%20Tools\"&gt;Kagrenac's Tools&lt;/a&gt;. He left his close friend &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; to guard the tools while he was gone.\nNerevar and the Tribunal agreed to keep and study the tools and Heart of Lorkhan, but Nerevar's wish was that they should not use the tools for themselves. Nevertheless, they returned to the Dwemer citadel where Dagoth Ur was left on guard. They found him corrupted and unwilling to give up the tools to Nerevar and the Tribunal. Dagoth Ur escaped from the ensuing fight but was forced to give up the tools.\nAfter the battle at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the death of Nerevar, Sotha Sil acquired an understanding of how the tools of Kagrenac and the Heart of Lorkhan worked, and thus how to use them to turn the Tribunal into living gods. The Tribunal then went through the process of stealing its divine essence for themselves. Sotha Sil then angered the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt; by saying that they did not need the Daedra anymore, as the Tribunal were the new gods of the Chimer people. Azura appeared before them and cursed them for their sacrilege, permanently transforming their entire race. The Chimer's gold skin turned ashen and their eyes a fiery red, thus transforming them into the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; intervened on Azura's behalf during the events of (ca.&lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;), Dagoth Ur was defeated and the Heart of Lorkhan destroyed, leaving the gods mortal. Almalexia killed Sotha Sil, and she was later killed by the Nerevarine, leaving Vivec who in turn disappeared during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt; They were replaced by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, who restored worship to the original pantheon of Azura, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. Among the Dunmer people, Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec came to be known as the \"False Tribunal\" and Boethiah, Azura and Mephala the \"True Tribunal.\"\nMembers of the Tribunal.\nVivec.\nOf the three members of the Tribunal, Vivec is the most visible. He is regarded as a poet, warrior, and benevolent king. He is the \"VI\" in \"ALMSIVI\", and his \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Anticipations\"&gt;Anticipation&lt;/a&gt;\" is the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. He also shares some of Mephala's darker characteristics, such as violence, lust, and conspiracy.\nVivec appears in as being half-&lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; and half-&lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt;. Vivec resides at his temple in the self-titled city of &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; island. The player has the choice of attacking and killing Vivec in the game (ca. &lt;a href=\"3E%20427\"&gt;3E 427&lt;/a&gt;). Five years later, Vivec is described as having disappeared, and during the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; rumors talk of him being killed by the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlmalexia.\nAlmalexia is the second most visible of the Tribunal and is regarded as the brave and compassionate queen of the Dunmer people. Her \"Anticipation\" is Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and she is the \"ALM\" in \"ALMSIVI\".\nIn and , Almalexia is still completely Chimer in appearance, and she rules from the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. She has her own &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20Almalexia%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;personal Ordinators&lt;/a&gt;, who bear similar armor to the ones that listen to Lord Vivec. Their armor is heavier and more protective, and they carry special &lt;a href=\"Ebony%20Scimitar%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Ebony Scimitar&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHaving lost her sanity in the events of (ca. 3E 427), Almalexia tries to kill the Nerevarine to prevent her own death after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, even though she is already mortal by that time.\nSotha Sil.\nSotha Sil is the least visible of the Tribunal to the public. He is regarded as an extremely powerful and intelligent wizard. His \"Anticipation\" is &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, and he is the \"SI\" in \"ALMSIVI\". Sotha Sil lives in his &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt; made up of his own machines. In Sotha Sil is entirely Dunmer in appearance (or he could have decayed, making his skin look darker). He appears to have lost his lower body and right arm and replaced it with machinery.\nSotha Sil is killed by Almalexia as part of a plot to destroy the Nerevarine and stop the prophecy associated with the Nerevarine."}

The Tribunal is composed of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, the god-poet &lt;a href=\"Vivec\"&gt;Vivec&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil&lt;/a&gt;. The three gained their\u00a0divine power through their\u00a0use of &lt;a href=\"Kagrenac\"&gt;Kagrenac&lt;/a&gt;'s tools upon the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Lorkhan\"&gt;Heart of Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately becoming the patron gods of the &lt;a href=\"Dunmer\"&gt;Dunmer&lt;/a&gt; people. It was the dominant religion in the province of Morrowind, until after the events of the game , where it was superseded by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeliefs.\nThe Anticipations.\nAccording to the temple the three &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; that recognized the divinity of the Tribunal were &lt;a href=\"Azura\"&gt;Azura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Mephala\"&gt;Mephala&lt;/a&gt;. These three Daedra are known as the \"Anticipations\" because they share the same aspects and spheres as each member of the Tribunal. Each Daedra is an anticipation for each of the Tribune; Azura is the anticipation of Sotha Sil, Boethiah is the anticipation of Almalexia, and Mephala is the anticipation of Vivec.\nThe Tribunal.\nThe Tribunal Temple worships the three living gods: Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec, also known as ALMSIVI. Each god was a patron of different things for Dunmer people. Almalexia was a patron of teachers and healers, Vivec was a patron of artists and rogues, and Sotha Sil was a patron of &lt;a href=\"Imperfect\"&gt;artificers&lt;/a&gt; and wizards. According to Temple doctrine the three tribunes gained their divine power through superhuman discipline and virtue, and supernatural wisdom and insight. Some Tribunal Temple cities are &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20%28City%29\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Clockwork%20City\"&gt;Clockwork City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;. The Tribunal saved the Dunmer from numerous disasters, such as when\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Baar%20Dau\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt; was flung from the sky by &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; and was stopped by Vivec from landing on Vivec City or when Almalexia and Sotha Sil banished &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; after he destroyed &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;. By doing these things, the Tribunal eventually gained the trust of the Dunmer people.\nLife and death.\nThe upkeep of family tombs is often discouraged by the temple as most deceased Dunmer are either taken to the necropolis of &lt;a href=\"Necrom\"&gt;Necrom&lt;/a&gt; or to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Great Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt; to maintain the structure. Many dead temple warriors and great house members are taken from battlefields to the ghostfence for this purpose. Still, old family tombs have temple &lt;a href=\"Shrines%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;shrines&lt;/a&gt; and frescoes depicting the Tribunal and the temple saints.\nThe House of Troubles.\nAccording to the temple the four Daedra that rebelled against the divinity of the Tribunal were Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Molag Bal, and Sheogorath. They are considered holy as they test the Dunmer people for weaknesses but are considered enemies to the people. &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt; tests the Dunmer for physical weaknesses, &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; tries to upset the bloodlines of the houses and tries to weaken the Dunmer gene pool, &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; tests the people for mental weaknesses, and &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt; tests the Dunmer will to survive and persevere. The worship of these Daedra is forbidden by the temple and often &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Legion\"&gt;Imperial&lt;/a&gt; soldiers and &lt;a href=\"Ordinators\"&gt;Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; will hunt down anyone who worships them.\nHistorical events of the Tribunal gods.\nAs the protectors of the Dunmer people, the Tribunal have faced and defeated many dangers to protect their people.\nVivec's fights against the Ruddy Man.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Koal%20Cave\"&gt;Koal Cave&lt;/a&gt; Vivec fought an incarnation of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Prince\"&gt;Daedric Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Molag%20Bal\"&gt;Molag Bal&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Man\"&gt;Ruddy Man&lt;/a&gt;. In the fight between Vivec and the Ruddy Man, Vivec defeated him but spared him. With the exception that the Dunmer people were given his permission to use the hides of the Ruddy Man's worshipers, the &lt;a href=\"Dreugh\"&gt;Dreugh&lt;/a&gt;, to make armor. The battle was said to be so great that it was said to have created the &lt;a href=\"West%20Gash\"&gt;West Gash&lt;/a&gt;. The Ruddy Man then attacked outside the city of &lt;a href=\"Tear\"&gt;Tear&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that Vivec fought and defeated him again.\nVivec's fight with &lt;a href=\"Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;Mehrunes Dagon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the city of &lt;a href=\"Maar%20Gan\"&gt;Maar Gan&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec fought Mehrunes Dagon after he tried to attack the citizens of the city. Mehrunes tried to throw a giant rock at the city, but Vivec taunted him so that he would throw the rock at him instead. Where this rock fell, the people of Maar Gan built a shrine to the Tribunal. It is said that during this battle, Vivec gave his silver sword to Lord Dagon, as he thought it would be dishonorable to fight an unarmed enemy.\nVivec's halting of &lt;a href=\"Ministry%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Baar Dau&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime around the beginning of the Tribunal's godhood. The Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Sheogorath\"&gt;Sheogorath&lt;/a&gt; rebelled against the Tribunal for mocking the &lt;a href=\"Daedra\"&gt;Daedra&lt;/a&gt; and sent the large meteor, Baar Dau, to destroy the then-new city of Vivec. After seeing the meteor, Vivec just raised his hand and the moonlet froze above the city. Vivec decided to keep it above his city to show that faith should be kept in the Tribunal as it was faith that kept Baar Dau afloat.\n&lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sotha%20Sil\"&gt;Sotha Sil's&lt;/a&gt; defense of Mournhold.\nWhen the Daedric Prince Mehrunes Dagon massacred the populace of &lt;a href=\"Mournhold\"&gt;Mournhold&lt;/a&gt;, Almalexia and Sotha Sil, with their combined god-like powers, managed to banish the prince back to &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20%28Realm%29\"&gt;Oblivion&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of this event Almalexia decided to stay in Mournhold, there, a large &lt;a href=\"Almalexia%20and%20Mehrunes%20Dagon\"&gt;statue&lt;/a&gt; was erected in the city to commemorate Almalexia's part in the battle.\nThe defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Kamal\"&gt;Kamal&lt;/a&gt; invasion force.\nThe assassination of the last members of the &lt;a href=\"Reman%20Dynasty\"&gt;Reman Dynasty&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Tsaesci\"&gt;Tsaesci&lt;/a&gt; advisors who took over the reins of power after their deaths, &lt;a href=\"Versidue-Shaie\"&gt;Versidue-Shaie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Savirien-Chorak\"&gt;Savirien-Chorak&lt;/a&gt;, brought the Reman Empire's reign over the continent of &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; to an end. For many more centuries, Morrowind managed to rebuild from its defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Score%20War\"&gt;Four Score War&lt;/a&gt; under the three Tribunes and the rest of the Tribunal Temple's guidance. However, this new peace and prosperity was interrupted by an invasion by the Kamal, a race that inhabited the continent of &lt;a href=\"Akavir\"&gt;Akavir&lt;/a&gt; and were known as the Snow Demons of Kamal, led by their king and general &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. The Kamal forces managed to initially defeat the Dunmer forces under the command of the Tribunal, and they advanced southwards through the province of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt;, a large island in the heart of Morrowind separated by the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sea\"&gt;Inner Sea&lt;/a&gt;, and assaulted &lt;a href=\"Vivec%20City\"&gt;Vivec City&lt;/a&gt;, Vivec's seat of power. Under the guidance of Almalexia and Vivec, the Dunmer inhabitants of Vivec City were taught how to breathe under water. Then, the Tribunal struck a devastating blow to the Kamal forces by flooding the land around Vivec City, drowning the majority of their forces under the water. However, it did not stop the Kamal army, they went further, and began assaulting Morrowind's mainland.\nDesperate to stop the Kamal invasion, Almalexia secretly traveled back into Vvardenfell, now a Kamal-occupied territory, and went to the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient site where the defeat of the Dwemer during the War of the First Council, took place during the &lt;a href=\"First%20Era\"&gt;First Era&lt;/a&gt;. In the ruins of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; fortress, she found the sleeping form of &lt;a href=\"the%20Underking\"&gt;the Underking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysmir\"&gt;Ysmir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wulfharth\"&gt;Wulfharth&lt;/a&gt;, and awakened him. She summoned him to assist the Dunmer in their battle against the Kamal and their leader, the &lt;a href=\"Akaviri\"&gt;Akaviri&lt;/a&gt; Demon, &lt;a href=\"Ada%27Soom%20Dir-Kamal\"&gt;Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal&lt;/a&gt;. The combined power of the Tribunal Temple, Almalexia, Vivec, a &lt;a href=\"Nord\"&gt;Nord&lt;/a&gt;ic army, a group of &lt;a href=\"Argonian\"&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt; shellbacks, the Dunmer forces and Ysmir Wulfharth, the Underking, managed to overwhelm the remaining Kamal forces, slew Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, and drove the Kamal from Morrowind.\nThe persecution of Morrowind's Heretics.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dissident%20Priests\"&gt;Dissident Priests&lt;/a&gt; are a sect that dispute the Tribunal's claims of achieving godhood and the temple's doctrines. As such, they are persecuted and have been driven into hiding due to the fact that they view the &lt;a href=\"Ashlander\"&gt;Ashlander&lt;/a&gt; prophecy of the &lt;a href=\"Nerevarine\"&gt;Nerevarine&lt;/a&gt; as a subject that is worth learning. They also believe that the temple's behavior against the Nerevarine is unjust, as said in \"&lt;a href=\"Progress%20of%20Truth\"&gt;Progress of Truth&lt;/a&gt;\". The Temple does not believe in the reincarnation of &lt;a href=\"Nerevar\"&gt;Nerevar&lt;/a&gt;; as such the &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s deal mercilessly with those that claim to be the Nerevarine and often hunt, imprison or kill them.\nThe devil &lt;a href=\"Dagoth%20Ur%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Dagoth Ur&lt;/a&gt;.\nDagoth Ur the, seemingly, immortal enemy of the Tribunal responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Blight\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Corprus\"&gt;Corprus&lt;/a&gt; curse that plagued &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; for many years. The fall of Ur coincided with the fall of the Tribunal gods \nThe New Temple.\nAfter the disappearance of Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec, the &lt;a href=\"Oblivion%20Crisis\"&gt;Oblivion Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, the Dunmer people went through a period of soul searching and reorganization, which made them return to the old worship of the old Daedra \u2014 Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. This new religion would be called the &lt;a href=\"New%20Temple\"&gt;New Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and would rename the former Tribunal as saints and heroes while naming the three princes as the \"True Tribunal.\"\n&lt;a href=\"House%20Indoril\"&gt;House Indoril&lt;/a&gt;.\nHouse Indoril members are supporters of the Temple, many of the priests and worshipers in the Temple are members of the House Indoril. Due to the fact that the Temple acts like a civil government, House Indoril and their sub-clans dominate the power base and membership of the Temple. &lt;a href=\"Indoril%20Nerevar\"&gt;Indoril Nerevar&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Almalexia\"&gt;Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; are both members of this house and, as such, the members of Indoril are staunch supporters of the Tribunal. And the Ordinators are all soldiers of the house.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20Law\"&gt;Temple Law&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs House Indoril is a staunch defender of the faith and the Tribunal Temple, its &lt;a href=\"Ordinator\"&gt;Ordinator&lt;/a&gt;s are tasked with enforcing the laws of the Tribunal.\nTemples.\nThere are many temples across Vvardenfell, found in large towns and cities. These temples are often the return place of &lt;a href=\"Almsivi%20Intervention\"&gt;Almsivi Intervention&lt;/a&gt; spells, and have shrines dedicated to the Temple &lt;a href=\"Saints\"&gt;Saints&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe shrines.\nInside temples, shrines can be found. All shrines can be used to &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Disease\"&gt;Cure Disease&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Blight\"&gt;Cure Blight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cure%20Poison%20%28Morrowind%29\"&gt;Cure Poison&lt;/a&gt;. They also, all have a unique effect:\nLeadership.\nThe Tribunal Temple is led by a patriarch. Known patriarchs are:\nThe Temple's military organization.\nThe military of the tribunal Temple consists of the highly trained group of soldiers called the Ordinators, who serve as guards to various Tribunal Temples, and the whole of Vivec City. There are four orders of the Ordinators: the Order of the Watch, the Order of War, the Order of the Inquisition, and the Order of Doctrine and Ordination. The Order of the Watch are guards for temples and shrines. The Order of War fights the enemies of the Temple; most War Ordinators are stationed near Red Mountain on Vvardenfell to combat and maintain the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostfence\"&gt;Ghostfence&lt;/a&gt;. The Order of Doctrine and Ordination are military scholars. The Order of the Inquisition identifies and suppresses heresy among priests and worshipers. The head Ordinator on the island of Vvardenfell is &lt;a href=\"Berel%20Sala\"&gt;Berel Sala&lt;/a&gt;. All four orders obey the rules of the Alma Rula. In the city of Mournhold, the &lt;a href=\"High%20Ordinators\"&gt;High Ordinators&lt;/a&gt; guard the capital. High Ordinators are chosen from the strongest most skilled fighters in the Temple and are led by &lt;a href=\"Fedris%20Hler\"&gt;Fedris Hler&lt;/a&gt;. The most strong and loyal of the High Ordinators are chosen to be the personal bodyguards of Almalexia herself. They are called the &lt;a href=\"Hands%20of%20Almalexia\"&gt;Hands of Almalexia&lt;/a&gt; and are bestowed weapons and armors that are imbued with divine enchantments. They are said to be the most dangerous mortal warriors in the &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt;. The Dissident Priests revealed that the Ordinators use terror tactics, abduction, torture, and secret imprisonment to dispel heresy and dissent in the temple. Another military order of the temple is the &lt;a href=\"Buoyant%20Armigers\"&gt;Buoyant Armigers&lt;/a&gt; who keep the blight from spreading out of Red Mountain, to which they have had very little success at. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Galdal%20Omayn\"&gt;Galdal Omayn&lt;/a&gt; and serve Vivec exclusively.\nSaints.\nThe Temple names certain people as Saints for doing great deeds. There is a large number of major and minor saints, each with their own sphere of influence:\nLiterature.\nThe Temple has many books that detail the lives of the three Tribunes, books about how to worship them, children's books, and tales of the temples saints:\nArtifacts.\nThere are many artifacts that hold an importance to the temple. Such artifacts are:"}

He is described as the strongest of the Aedra,\u00a0the champion of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Elven\"&gt;High Elven&lt;/a&gt; pantheon, and in some places more popular than &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt;. Trinimac is referred to as the champion of Auri-El himself.\nThe official view taken by the majority of the leading priests in the second and third\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Orsinium\"&gt;Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;s, put forth by both King &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Bagrakh\"&gt;Kurog gro-Bagrakh&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt; respectively, is that Trinimac still lives and Malacath is a separate entity, an impostor. A handful of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s within Orsinium\u00a0and the majority of the Orsimer disapprove of Gortwog's beliefs and view them as heresy. Malacath is referred to as the reanimated dung of Trinimac.\nHistory.\nDawn Era.\nDuring the climax of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20Manifest%20Metaphors\"&gt;ancient wars&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Auri-El\"&gt;Auri-El&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt;, Trinimac, who was Auriel's greatest knight, subdued &lt;a href=\"Lorkhan\"&gt;Lorkhan&lt;/a&gt; in front of his army of Men and tore out his heart, intending to destroy it. As the Trickster God was finished, Lorkhan's Men dragged his body away from the battlefield and swore vengeance on the heirs of Auriel for all time.\nHowever, when Trinimac and Auriel tried to destroy the Heart, it laughed at them and said, 'This Heart is the heart of the world, for one was made to satisfy the other.' Auriel then attached the heart to an arrow and let it fly into the sea, where &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the island of &lt;a href=\"Vvardenfell\"&gt;Vvardenfell&lt;/a&gt; formed around it.\nMerethic Era.\nDuring the exodus of the &lt;a href=\"Chimer\"&gt;Chimer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Era\"&gt;Mythic Era&lt;/a&gt;, Trinimac, who was one of the most powerful Aldmeri\u00a0deities at the time, tried to stop the movement. The Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Boethiah\"&gt;Boethiah&lt;/a&gt;, mastermind of the movement, confronted Trinimac, and transformed him into the Daedric Prince &lt;a href=\"Malacath\"&gt;Malacath&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0As a result, Trinimac's followers were changed as well into what are now known as the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer\"&gt;Orsimer&lt;/a&gt; (Orcs), some of which worship Malacath as their god.\nSecond Era.\nIn &lt;a href=\"2E%20582\"&gt;2E 582&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20gro-Orsinium\"&gt;Kurog gro-Orsinium&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Orsinium\"&gt;Second Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;, brought in a renewed worship of Trinimac under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Solgra\"&gt;High Priestess Solgra&lt;/a&gt;. The amount of Orcish priests and worshippers of Trinimac reached an extreme surge in numbers, and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ire\"&gt;Temple of Ire&lt;/a&gt; was created to pick either Trinimac or Malacath as the temple's deity.\nThe temple however suffered from a surprise attack, with a number of its priests being killed by Malacath extremists. The temple deity was later decided as Trinimac, and a large statue of the god was erected. The &lt;a href=\"Vosh%20Rakh%20%28Faction%29\"&gt;Vosh Rakh&lt;/a&gt;, a violent and extremist group of Trinimac, was known to have tortured and brainwashed civilians in order to get them to join their group. They captured the Malacath supporter &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bazrag\"&gt;Chief Bazrag&lt;/a&gt;, who was framed for the attack on the Temple of Ire, and had him kept as a captive. It was later revealed that King Kurog had allied with the Vosh Rakh out of desperation and impatience, and orchestrated the attack on the Temple. Kurog was later killed by the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt;, and Bazrag was made the new King of Orsinium. The worship of Trinimac had been badly damaged by these events, and the bright new order had later diminished.\nThird Era.\nThe worship of Trinimac was revived by &lt;a href=\"Gortwog%20gro-Nagorm\"&gt;Gortwog gro-Nagorm&lt;/a&gt;, the ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Orsinium\"&gt;Third Orsinium&lt;/a&gt;. While many of those living in the city agreed with his beliefs, the Orcs outside still devoutly worshipped Malacath."}

However, Karliah warns the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; that, since Mercer was a Nightingale, he is very dangerous. Karliah wants to prepare the Dragonborn to slay Mercer and suggests meeting her at a standing stone just outside the southwest gate of &lt;a href=\"Riften%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Riften&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter proceeding to the standing stone, and discovering that it is the secret headquarters of the Nightingales, Karliah explains that the three will need all the help they can get to kill Mercer. As the Dragonborn makes their way into Nightingale Hall with Brynjolf and Karliah, they begin discussing the Nightingales and the myth behind them. Brynjolf believes that the Nightingales are a religious group, but Karliah explains that it is all about business. Once arriving at the hall, Karliah requests that the Dragonborn go and don the new Nightingale armor to begin the ceremony.\nOnce making it across the wooden bridge and into a room, there will be a stone off to the left with the Nightingale symbol on it. Upon activating it, a full set of Nightingale armor is added to the Dragonborn's inventory. Once the armor is equipped, the ceremony can begin.\nKarliah tells the Dragonborn of some tests that need to be completed in order to become a Nightingale, while Brynjolf displays negative feelings towards this. Karliah explains that the only way to defeat Mercer Frey is to have &lt;a href=\"Nocturnal\"&gt;Nocturnal&lt;/a&gt; on their side. Karliah explains that in order to use the Nightingale abilities whenever possible, the test must be completed for a guardian of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Sepulcher\"&gt;Twilight Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; serves both in life and death. Karliah asks if the Dragonborn is ready for the test and once conceding, the test can begin.\nThe ceremony.\nKarliah opens a gate into a room with three glyphs. All three characters take their place on one of the glyphs, and Karliah calls upon Nocturnal, who then appears. Karliah offers to have Brynjolf and the Dragonborn take the oath to serve Nocturnal in order to gain the strength to take down Mercer Frey. Nocturnal accepts the offer and the three characters become the new Nightingales.\nNow that the Dragonborn is a Nightingale, Karliah reveals the true crime of Mercer. Mercer has stolen a &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Key%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Skeleton Key&lt;/a&gt; from the Twilight Sepulcher which not only unlocks physical locks but also the ability to tap into the potential that everyone possesses. This is the reason that the Thieves Guild is down on its luck. If the key is not returned then its luck will\u00a0go down to the point of non-existence. Returning the key would mean that Nocturnal will align with the guild once again and luck would be restored.\nConclusion.\nBrynjolf then realizes that, because the guild is leaderless, the Dragonborn will need to take over as leader of the Thieves Guild after Mercer has been dealt with. He then mentions that they should head to &lt;a href=\"Irkngthand\"&gt;Irkngthand&lt;/a&gt; where Mercer is likely to be stealing the &lt;a href=\"eyes%20of%20the%20Falmer\"&gt;eyes of the Falmer&lt;/a&gt;."}

The sale of the &lt;a href=\"Chub%20Loon\"&gt;chub loons&lt;/a&gt; recovered some of our fortunes, but not enough to make it worth the annoyance. We bought a leaky ship, and sought some cargo to sell on the coast as we returned to our homeland. I, Zabia-ko, did not truly trust the broker at the docks, and I declined most of his schemes.\n\"But Zabia-ko, you must trade in delicacies!\" the scoundrel said, \"Sugars and rice will only earn you so much, but &lt;a href=\"Dreugh%20%28Online%29\"&gt;dreugh&lt;/a&gt; eggs packed in mud are prized by the rich, fat merchants of Abah's Landing!\" At the time it seemed worth the risk.\nIt was not. Dreugh, who shed their legs after mating and spend their lives in the sea, must have sensed the eggs in the hull, for they attacked our ship soon after leaving &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;. They rushed in with the water when the ship cracked open, and took the eggs. This one lost consciousness before the ship broke apart completely.\nFear not! This was not the end of Zabia-ko. There are still many more stories to tell and creatures to see, like the fascinating &lt;a href=\"sep%20adder\"&gt;sep adder&lt;/a&gt;. To that in a moment.\nWe awoke on a beach in the south-west portion of the land of Hew's Bane, a short journey by land from Abah's Landing. The journey to the city saw many adventures, including an encounter with an Orc who thinks she's a shark, but the best part was the winged snake called by locals as the sep adder.\nLike the chub loon, it is a silly thing to behold. It has no legs, yet moves around the ground like a snake. It has wings, yet cannot truly fly. Unlike the stupid birds, however, the sep adder manages to thrive and be graceful. It always has a means of satiating its ever-present hunger.\nIt is constantly on the prowl for its next meal, gliding along the lush shores of the land's rivers, picking bugs out of the sky and fish from the water. Later, as the land grew dry and the water less common, I saw more of them, plucking small mice from their little arid homes in the ground.\nIt should be good at none of these things, but it is good at many things. It lives in the wet lands and dry. It is like Zabia-ko. This one was not born into money nor especially lucky, but through wit, is able to overcome many misfortunes.\nThe people of this land honor the sep adder, for when approaching Abah's Landing, we saw a great statue of a man wrapped in a giant snake with wings. I never saw one that large, but that's not to say they don't exist in the wilderness. If such a creature can overcome and be honored in such a triumphant way, maybe, too, Zabia-ko can overcome and find a place of honor somewhere. Even if it's only the honor of knowing where her next meal is coming from!"}

You have read now of my carefree youth in &lt;a href=\"Cumberland%20Dynasty\"&gt;Cumberland House&lt;/a&gt;, how my father Lord &lt;a href=\"Pierric\"&gt;Pierric&lt;/a&gt; saw to my training in the crafts of trade, of war, and of state, of my first great victory over &lt;a href=\"Durcorach\"&gt;Durcorach&lt;/a&gt; at the gates of &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Daggerfall&lt;/a&gt;, and of the vast &lt;a href=\"Orichalcum%20Ore%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/a&gt; lode our family struck in the Cumberland Mine. You have heard of the tragic coming of the &lt;a href=\"Knahaten%20Flu\"&gt;Knahaten Flu&lt;/a&gt;, how it took both my father and the entire royal family of &lt;a href=\"Wayrest%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Wayrest&lt;/a&gt;, leaving our kingdom leaderless in a time of chaos. You now know with what reluctance I was persuaded to assume the throne of Wayrest. You know of the Halo of Gold that outlined the Sun on the day of my coronation. That omen of approval by &lt;a href=\"the%20Divines\"&gt;the Divines&lt;/a&gt; dispelled all my doubts and converted even my most envious rivals into heartfelt allies.\nYou have now learned the true history of &lt;a href=\"Ranser%27s%20War\"&gt;Ranser's War&lt;/a&gt;, and how it led to the Second, or Greater, &lt;a href=\"Daggerfall%20Covenant\"&gt;Daggerfall Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, embracing the &lt;a href=\"Redguards%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Redguard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfell%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Hammerfell&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Orsimer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orsinium%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Orsinum&lt;/a&gt;, who came to our aid in our hour of direst need. The free peoples of northwest &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; vowed to stand together against all threats, be they from within or without.\nWe were soon tested: in 2E 578 the &lt;a href=\"Varen%20Aquilarios%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Emperor Varen&lt;/a&gt;, with whom I had concluded a treaty, disappeared from the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20City%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Imperial City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cyrodiil%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Cyrodiil&lt;/a&gt; once again fell under the pall of the &lt;a href=\"Daedric%20Princes\"&gt;Daedric Cabal&lt;/a&gt;. In Varen's unexplained absence the \"Empress\" &lt;a href=\"Clivia\"&gt;Clivia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a descendant of the savage &lt;a href=\"Reachmen%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Reachmen&lt;/a&gt;\u2014assumed the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Throne\"&gt;Ruby Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Empire\"&gt;Empire&lt;/a&gt; has fallen into madness, murder, and decay. It is fortunate for our peoples\u2014indeed, for all the peoples of Tamriel\u2014that the true flame of the Empire of &lt;a href=\"Men\"&gt;Man&lt;/a&gt; still burns in the Daggerfall Covenant. These are terrible times, but our destiny lies before us as straight and true as the &lt;a href=\"Reman\"&gt;Reman&lt;/a&gt; roads: we must march on Cyrodiil, overthrow the false empress and all her brood, and restore the Empire of Tamriel. Then once more peace and justice will rule the &lt;a href=\"provinces\"&gt;provinces&lt;/a&gt;, rather than blood and fire."}

Finding loyal recruits who won't turn on you or run away at the first sign of danger is hard to do these days.\nWe've found the perfect location for a base of operations: the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Sphinxmoth%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Fort Sphinxmoth&lt;/a&gt;. One of my men grew up in &lt;a href=\"Reaper%27s%20March\"&gt;the region&lt;/a&gt; and told us that he and a friend used to explore some caves in the area. After four days of searching we uncovered a large network of underground chambers.

From now on we shall call ourselves the &lt;a href=\"Sphinxmoth%20Bandits\"&gt;Sphinxmoth Bandits&lt;/a&gt;. That has a much better ring to it!\nI've set the men to work refurbishing the old traps to protect our underground dwelling. We've found this place has many old traps, both mundane and magical. &lt;a href=\"Octavia\"&gt;Octavia&lt;/a&gt;, who knows the most about magic, has been poking at some of the more unusual ones and trying to figure out how to make them function again.\nI've discovered an ancient vault deep within the ruins. Unfortunately, someone appears to have cleaned it out long ago, but it will make the perfect location for me to store my personal treasures.\nThe deal I've made with the &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Cult\"&gt;Stonefire Cult&lt;/a&gt; to rob the Temple of Mara will give us increadible wealth. I don't know what they want with the Chalice of Mara and I don't really care. All I know is that it will make me wealthy beyond my wildest dreams."}

Perhaps if I could get my hands on a &lt;a href=\"Flawless%20Ruby\"&gt;Flawless Ruby&lt;/a&gt;...\nI have also theorized that if one were to mix most any of the ingredients in the previous experiments a new discovery is likely to be made.\nUpon further inspection of both a &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;diamond&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Garnet%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;garnet&lt;/a&gt; it seems they don't contain the necessary power required. I know for a fact that a ruby works, as seen in my previous experiments. Next I'll see how the reaction works with an &lt;a href=\"Amethyst%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;amethyst&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;emerald&lt;/a&gt;, or even a &lt;a href=\"Sapphire%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;sapphire&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere must be other types of &lt;a href=\"Spiders%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; out there. Who knows what other kinds of &lt;a href=\"Imbuing%20Chamber\"&gt;imbuing processes&lt;/a&gt; have taken place. We'd best keep our eyes open. The source of the interaction will most likely be nearby, whatever new species we find."}

They function much like regular scrolls, with the only difference being the &lt;a href=\"Spiders%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; is not conjured, but rather alive and held in the hand before it is thrown at an enemy. A maximum of eight can be summoned at one time: five cloaked spiders, one oil spider, one glowing spider and one pack spider.\nHistory.\nThe Spider Scrolls were first unveiled to &lt;a href=\"Tamriel\"&gt;Tamriel&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Servos%20Rendas\"&gt;Servos Rendas&lt;/a&gt; and his sister, &lt;a href=\"Merilar%20Rendas\"&gt;Merilar Rendas&lt;/a&gt;, started experimenting on &lt;a href=\"Albino%20Spider\"&gt;Albino Spider&lt;/a&gt;s that were native to &lt;a href=\"Solstheim%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that the spiders had the ability to harness &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. They set up shop in &lt;a href=\"White%20Ridge%20Barrow\"&gt;White Ridge Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, and together they created several sub-species of the Albino Spider. An &lt;a href=\"Imbuing%20Chamber\"&gt;Imbuing Chamber&lt;/a&gt; was used to create the new sub-species.\nEventually, the fumes from the Imbuing Chamber drove Merilar to madness. She imprisoned her brother in the cage that contained the Imbuing Chamber, and killed him.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20Era\"&gt;Fourth Era&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; came to &lt;a href=\"White%20Ridge%20Barrow\"&gt;White Ridge Barrow&lt;/a&gt;, and discovered the events that were unveiling there. Merilar attacked the Last Dragonborn, and eventually, the Dragonborn was forced to kill her.\nCrafting.\nSpider Scrolls are crafted in a similar manner to the &lt;a href=\"Atronach%20Forge\"&gt;Atronach Forge&lt;/a&gt; underneath the &lt;a href=\"College%20of%20Winterhold%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;College of Winterhold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Imbuing%20Chamber\"&gt;Imbuing Chamber&lt;/a&gt; inside White Ridge Barrow gives the ability to craft a variety of spiders from &lt;a href=\"Albino%20Spider%20Pod\"&gt;Albino Spider Pod&lt;/a&gt;s (either whole or damaged), assorted &lt;a href=\"Precious%20Gems%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, and other ingredients.\nIn most cases, three spiders will be created from a successful combination; however, the amount is doubled if a gem of flawless quality is used instead of a standard gem.\nIndividual recipes may be found on the &lt;a href=\"Imbuing%20Chamber\"&gt;Imbuing Chamber&lt;/a&gt; page, or the scroll page below. The following is a full list of craftable spiders.\nTrivia.\nExploding spiders can be destroyed via magic, including another spider, making a chain of spider explosions. Spiders share this property with &lt;a href=\"Rune%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Runes&lt;/a&gt;."}

Using an &lt;a href=\"Imbuing%20Chamber\"&gt;Imbuing Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, Merilar created several &lt;a href=\"Spider%20Scrolls\"&gt;obedient sub-species&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually the experiments drove her to madness. The player can use the Imbuing Chamber to create their own spiders, which can be used as weapons. Crafted spiders can be found in the Scrolls category.\nAlbino Spider.\nThe Albino spider is the base that every other sub species spawned from. They have no magical properties. They can be found in the following locations:\nGenerally, most locations that contain spiders do not respawn, making it difficult to obtain their pods.\nCloaked Spiders.\nThese spiders are found as enemies in various dungeons, once the &lt;a href=\"Imbuing%20Chamber\"&gt;Imbuing Chamber&lt;/a&gt; is unlocked, they can be deployed by the player as temporary followers and shock weapons. These spiders are crafted by placing an albino spider pod and a salt pile in the Imbuing chamber. Then, place a gem as well. A ruby will make a flame spider, a sapphire will make a frost spider, an emerald will make a poison spider, and an amethyst will make a shock spider. Flip the switch, and you will recieve 3 spiders. Once you equip them, they are thrown. In combat, these spiders make use of a cloak spell and attack enemies with melee attacks.\nJumping Spiders.\nJumping Spiders are basic ambush enemies that basically turn towards their target, move a little bit forward, then jump a large distance, ramming their target. They are easily dispatched by a spell or arrow, and all can be easily destroyed with the &lt;a href=\"Unrelenting%20Force%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Unrelenting Force&lt;/a&gt; Shout. Jumping spiders can be crafted with an albino spider pod, and a gem. See cloaked spiders for gem details. Crafting gives 3 spiders. In combat, they will follow the player until an enemy is spotted. Then, they jump at enemies and explode.\nExploding Spiders.\nExploding Spiders have a very self-explanatory name. They spawn, move to their target and then explode doing large area damage that corresponds to their imbued effect."}

He will tell them to go and check out &lt;a href=\"Jearl\"&gt;Jearl&lt;/a&gt;'s house. The spies won't be there during the night so arrive during the day and kill Jearl and the other spy in her house.\nTake the keys off Jearl's body, then proceed into the basement (through trap door in floor); take the orders before entering the cave. They are on a table in between the trap door back upstairs and the door into the caves. Return to Jauffre.\nIt is also possible to run right into Jearl on the street when first entering Bruma, in which case she may attack the Hero. If this happens, kill her and then go and talk to Captain Burd, who will express shock that she was a spy but give them permission to search her house and tell them to deal with any other spies as they please."}

A guardian spirit might take on a mortal shape when appearing before mortal creatures, but make no mistake: these spirits were never mortal and are as different from the mortal world as the residents of Oblivion. They might imitate mortal behavior, but they neither understand it nor have any but the most tenuous connection to it.\nA guardian spirit might get bored with its routine. It might become curious about new creatures wandering into its environment. It might even become angry at a presumed slight by a mortal visiting its realm. Any or all of these situations might draw the attention of a guardian spirit upon you. Or it might be something else entirely that draws them to you. Who can tell what motivates these strange entities?\nThe guardian spirit associated with the Haunted Wood tends to be curious and mischievous, but has rarely shown outright hostility to mortal visitors. Stories abound of missing objects, strange appearances, and playful teasing, but there are few accounts of the forest turning against mortal visitors. It seems that, for this spirit at least, some kind of connection is trying to be made. Or, perhaps, this too is a misinterpretation of intent. Perhaps this guardian spirit is simply attempting to lull visitors into letting their guard down. And then the spirit will pounce."}

Low, moaning sounds echoed between the trees, and the moons' light dripped down, pooling on the leaves underfoot. Where was the trail?\nShe tried to slow her breathing, searching for any recognizable landmark, but the woods she hunted in every night had changed. They were wilder, the trees were thicker and taller. Unknown beasts cried out all around her. There was no sign of her worn hunting trail, nothing to lead her back home. The moons loomed overhead, ominous and huge in the damp autumn air.\nThe world heaved, and Allice was in a clearing. A form adorned with a hideous antlered mask stared at her, towering over a stained stone altar. Its wicked teeth gleamed in the bloody glow of &lt;a href=\"Masser\"&gt;Masser&lt;/a&gt;. Forms gathered at the trees' edge, scattering every time she tried to fix her eyes on them. The figure reached forward, and an assortment of weapons faded into existence on the altar\u2014a loathsome spear, two serrated daggers, and a black bow.\nShe was drawn forward, compelled to approach. The figure gestured towards the weapons before her, but she shook her head and clutched her own bow even tighter, unwilling to reach out. A deranged cackle rang through her head, and the world heaved again under her feet.\nThe clearing was gone. Regaining her footing, Allice glanced over her shoulder and saw forms writhing in the dark foliage, a jumble of gleaming eyes, moonlight on a slavering maws, and howls of beasts and riders. A low horn blasted and the wood vibrated, rattling her teeth, and the darkness behind her surged. She ran.\nArrows sailed past her as she sprinted. A spear flew over her shoulder. They were gaining, she could hear their mad scrambling draw closer, but didn't dare look back. Desperate, she leaped high, reaching out for a tree limb. She pulled herself up just as a set of jagged teeth closed on the air where she was only seconds before.\nWasting no time, she turned, readied an arrow, and let fly, relieved to hear a howl of pain from the beast below. She targeted another and another, but more arrived, howling and yipping. The creatures and their riders encircled the base of Allice's refuge. She clambered upward into think branches that offered her cover, but she couldn't lean out far enough to take aim. She was trapped.\nThere was one hope. The branches in the canopy were entwined and dense. If she could jump far enough to reach a sturdy branch she might be able to keep moving. Just as she stretched out to test a nearby limb, she slipped as her roost shook violently. Struggling to keep her grip, she looked down to see a mass of thick black fur and shining teeth ram into the base of the bole with its hulking shoulder. Its rider, the antlered hunter, pointed its foul spear at her just as the trunk toppled.\nShe crashed to the ground, grasping at branches and twisting as she tumbled through the gnarled limbs. There was a sickening crack as she landed. She recovered her bow and struggled to stand, falling forward as pain shot up her leg. The monster raced toward her, panting with anticipation. There was no escape. Allice's instincts took hold, and she aimed and shot quickly. Before the first arrow even found its mark, she shot at the rider again, and again. A howl of rage echoed in her mind, and she closed her eyes, waiting for the rending jaws to close on her.\nThe pain didn't come. When she opened her eyes, Allice knew where she was. She could see the stars glimmering through the sparse canopy, saw the torches at her shack in the valley far below. Wincing, she fashioned a rough splint for her leg and reached out for her bow. On its upper limb, inlaid in shimmering red, the outline of a pair of small antlers glistened."}

According to &lt;a href=\"Skaal\"&gt;Skaal&lt;/a&gt; legends, Spriggans on &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; were created when the &lt;a href=\"All-Maker\"&gt;All-Maker&lt;/a&gt; breathed life onto the land and it flew through the trees.\nDescription.\nIn appearance, a Spriggan appears to be made of entirely wood and &lt;a href=\"Magicka\"&gt;magical energy&lt;/a&gt;, the source of which is their &lt;a href=\"Taproot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;taproot&lt;/a&gt;. They are heavily attracted to taproot, and therefore are often lured by &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;hagravens&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"alchemists\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt; into their traps to be sacrificed and harvested for their magical characteristics. Spriggans usually live in sacred groves, where they feel an innate connection to the groves' native animals. Because of this, Spriggans are able to enthrall wildlife such as bears and hornets, but also a multitude of other forest-dwelling creatures. As a result of this relationship, they are often called \"Nature's Guardians.\" Spriggans are female tree spirits and as such are always found in areas that feature trees or other flora, and appear to be connected to the plant known as &lt;a href=\"Nirnroot\"&gt;Nirnroot&lt;/a&gt;. There seems to be two variations of Spriggans as some walk on two legs, while others walk on four.\nPowers and abilities.\nWhen in battle, Spriggans use a &lt;a href=\"Spells\"&gt;spell&lt;/a&gt; that sends a swarm of hornets onto their foe that poisons them, and are able to turn themselves invisible. They are also able to control animals to fight for them. Also, spriggans are able to heal and resurrect themselves.\nBehavior.\nSpriggans in the wild generally remain peaceful, often nurturing and healing wildlife. They are usually seen guarding nirnroot as in the case of the &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Nirnroot%20Island\"&gt;Giant Nirnroot Island&lt;/a&gt;, and protect nature at any cost, often attacking anything that comes into their sacred groves.\nVariants.\nLurcher.\n&lt;a href=\"Lurcher%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Lurchers&lt;/a&gt; are created through the use of dark magic by corrupting a Spriggan, as the Spriggan's spirit remains tortured until it is defeated. Lurchers are not always in service of dark witches and wizards, as many are seen in nature and many are in service guarding the &lt;a href=\"Wilderking\"&gt;Wilderking&lt;/a&gt; in his court.\nBurnt Spriggan.\n&lt;a href=\"Burnt%20Spriggan\"&gt;Burnt Spriggan&lt;/a&gt;s are the flaming variant of Spriggans that live on the island of &lt;a href=\"Solstheim\"&gt;Solstheim&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Year\"&gt;Red Year&lt;/a&gt;, and were believed to be normal Spriggans up to the eruption of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Mountain\"&gt;Red Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"4E%2005\"&gt;4E 05&lt;/a&gt;. In battle, Burnt Spriggans use flame destruction spells and, when close to death, emit a small explosion of fire. They are also more aggressive than the normal Spriggans. Dialogue with &lt;a href=\"Neloth%20%28Dragonborn%29\"&gt;Neloth&lt;/a&gt; indicates that Burnt Spriggans feel less pain than the normal variant as they apparently \"don't twitch as much.\"\nSpriggan Earth Mother.\n&lt;a href=\"Spriggan%20Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Spriggan Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;s are a much more powerful variant of spriggans. They often have a purple coloring and have a more experienced control over nature."}

Spriggans can usually be found underground in caves, or in dense forests. They appear more tree-like than they did in , where they looked more humanoid.\nBehavior and appearance.\nSpriggans are entirely composed of wood and magical energy, the source of which is their &lt;a href=\"Taproot%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;taproot&lt;/a&gt;. Spriggans are attracted to taproot, and &lt;a href=\"Hagraven%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Hagravens&lt;/a&gt; manipulate this weakness by hanging taproots from trees to attract spriggans. Hagravens then sacrifice them for their magical characteristics, and because of their hatred of nature.\nSome spriggans may be encountered hiding in trees, and step from them when the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; comes too close. To overcome this, all spriggans may be found with the &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Whisper\"&gt;Aura Whisper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Shout\"&gt;Dragon Shout&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Life%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Detect Life&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nLike hagravens, spriggans are adept at both magical and physical combat. They have the ability to use the &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell, heal themselves quickly when low on health, and attack their target with a unique novice &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Destruction&lt;/a&gt; spell in the form of swarm of &lt;a href=\"bee\"&gt;bee&lt;/a&gt;s which can &lt;a href=\"Poison%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; their target. Even in close quarters, they can also pose a fatal threat: they can swipe at the Dragonborn with their claw-like appendages, which can also poison.\nTheir most notable ability is their tendency to enthrall the nearby wildlife \u2013 including animals not normally hostile like deer, goats and foxes \u2013 to come to their aid. Summoned animals bear a distinct green aura and the effect cannot be overridden by the &lt;a href=\"Animal%20Allegiance\"&gt;Animal Allegiance&lt;/a&gt; shout or the &lt;a href=\"Command%20Animal\"&gt;Command Animal&lt;/a&gt; power. It can however be countered with &lt;a href=\"Kyne%27s%20Peace\"&gt;Kyne's Peace&lt;/a&gt; or prevented altogether with the &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Voice of the Sky&lt;/a&gt; effect from reading the &lt;a href=\"Throat%20of%20the%20World%20%28Skyrim%29%23Etched%20tablets\"&gt;etched tablets&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Thousand%20Steps\"&gt;Seven Thousand Steps&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, with a maxed-out &lt;a href=\"Illusion%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;Illusion&lt;/a&gt; skill, &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20the%20Mind\"&gt;Master of the Mind&lt;/a&gt; allows the Dragonborn to seize control of enthralled entities and turn them against their masters.

At its basic level, it will take a total of six seconds to deplete the stamina bar while sprinting continuously, and a total of eight seconds to regenerate it again. Increasing Stamina will also increase the duration of sprint.\nSprinting into characters will cause them to become annoyed and tell you to watch where you're going.\nEffect of apparel.\nAlthough sprinting is faster than running normally, this speed difference is based on the type of armor worn. When wearing &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;heavy armor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Dragonborn\"&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/a&gt; will sprint at a slower speed and will deplete stamina faster than they would while wearing &lt;a href=\"Light%20Armor%20%28Skyrim%29\"&gt;light armor&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn causes the player to sprint slower and depletes stamina faster than normal clothing.\nIf one is wearing heavy armor they will be 50% faster, 60% if wearing light armor, and 75% if wearing clothes, if nude, or if perks are used which negate the weight of armors, such as &lt;a href=\"Unhindered\"&gt;Unhindered&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf the player chooses the correct perks from the light and heavy armor skill trees, then their choice of apparel does not affect stamina depletion and sprinting speed will be the same as that of normal clothing. This is especially helpful for players who use heavy armor, as they will be able to sprint further and faster once these perks are taken."}

A pottery kiln with a &lt;a href=\"Redware%20Bowl\"&gt;redware bowl&lt;/a&gt; actually sitting in the blaze suggests that some of the merchandise is produced here.

Not long ago, &lt;a href=\"the%20Stitches\"&gt;the Stitches&lt;/a&gt; were ruled over by a &lt;a href=\"Khajiit%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Dashing%20Dasalzo\"&gt;Dashing Dasalzo&lt;/a&gt;, who under his rule the town saw prosperity and peace. Since his untimely death, however, it has fallen to shambles under the current leadership of &lt;a href=\"Khasda\"&gt;Khasda&lt;/a&gt;, his former lieutenant. Tasnasi wishes to gather a crew to take his ill-gotten wealth from under his nose and, perhaps in the process, clear her name.\nBackground.\n\"I met a traveler who warned me that the Stitches has a new and unpopular leader named Khasda. He also told me that a rival of Khasda's by the name of Tasnasi is offering a job well suited to someone passing through.\"\n\"I met a Khajiiti woman by the name of Tasnasi who is putting together a heist to rob Khasda, the new leader of the Stitches.\"\nWalkthrough.\n&lt;a href=\"Tasnasi\"&gt;Tasnasi&lt;/a&gt; can be found camped out just outside of the Stitches' northern entrance. Accepting the quest, she tasks the &lt;a href=\"Vestige\"&gt;Vestige&lt;/a&gt; with putting together a crew to get into the vaults beneath &lt;a href=\"Meirvale%20Keep\"&gt;Meirvale Keep&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Alfiq\"&gt;Alfiq&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Sereyne\"&gt;Sereyne&lt;/a&gt; can be found just outside the &lt;a href=\"Goiter%27s%20Gulp\"&gt;Goiter's Gulp&lt;/a&gt; in a drunken stupor. Pick up the nearby bucket of water and cast it upon her to wake her up. She will awaken and, belligerently, agree to join but admit that she pawned off her Magicka Focus to the Averno twins to pay off her bar tab. There are three options: pay off Sereyne's dept with &lt;a href=\"Iulius%20Averno\"&gt;Iulius&lt;/a&gt;, use persuasion on &lt;a href=\"Scipion%20Averno\"&gt;Scipion&lt;/a&gt; or steal the Focus from a lockbox behind the counter. Since the tab is quite expensive and the fine for stealing is significantly less, it may be preferable to simply take the amulet barring the lack of the &lt;a href=\"Persuasive%20Will\"&gt;Persuasive Will&lt;/a&gt;. Return the Focus to Sereyne to get her on board.\nThe elderly monk &lt;a href=\"Nazdar\"&gt;Nazdar&lt;/a&gt; can be found just outside the flophouse near the cart. He first asks the Vestige to return his prized lute, given to him by a long lost friend. He was practicing in the canyon below but was run off by beasts. Heading down into the canyon and going north, his lute can be found by a tent and knapsack. Apart from the typical &lt;a href=\"Harpy%20%28Online%29\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; and scorpion, the area near the lute is routinely guarded by two &lt;a href=\"Ruddy%20Fangs\"&gt;Ruddy Fangs&lt;/a&gt; members. Defeating the opponents and returning the lute will convince Nazdar to offer himself over to the job.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bosmer%20%28Online%29\"&gt;Bosmer&lt;/a&gt; mechanist &lt;a href=\"Vole\"&gt;Vole&lt;/a&gt; can be found just outside of Jubani's Junkshop before being lead inside with his hands tied by a &lt;a href=\"Jubani%27s%20Tough\"&gt;Jubani Tough&lt;/a&gt;. The Vestige must break-in and rescue him from the basement. A Jubani Tough will become hostile if they observe them doing this. Freed from his bindings and lead out by the cellar door, he agrees to the heist.\nWith all the members brought together, head to \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Bowel\"&gt;the Bowel&lt;/a&gt;;\" a small cave to the north of the Stitches that leads to the sewers beneath &lt;a href=\"Meirvale%20Keep\"&gt;Meirvale Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Entering the dungeons, the Bosmer applies his talents to the various &lt;a href=\"Dwemer\"&gt;Dwemer&lt;/a&gt; locks throughout, while &lt;a href=\"Spider%20%28Online%29\"&gt;spiders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skeever%20%28Online%29\"&gt;skeevers&lt;/a&gt; attack. Making their way out of the sewers, they come to the courtyard. Now Sereyne uses her magic to transport the crew to the other side of the Keep. However, due to overdrinking, she accidentally sends the Vestige and Nazdar to the other side of the courtyard. Now, the Vestige must escort Nazdar to the other end, with the optional objective of sparing the guards. The best way to accomplish this is to head to the middle and weave around the crates on the lefthand side, avoiding the guards' eye as much as possible. If caught and want to complete the optional objective, just allow the guards to attack and return to the waypoint afterward and try again. Once the gate has been reached, Nazdar will scale the wall and lower a rope allowing the rest of the crew to climb up into the Palace.\nOnce inside, the Vestige must find the three keys that open the vaults below. The palace is guarded by many &lt;a href=\"Khasda%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Khasda Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s who must be defeated or avoid to gain the keys. Once acquired, head to the dugout. More of Khasda's guard can be found below, guarding the torture chambers. Entering, it is revealed that Tasnasi has been captured by &lt;a href=\"Khasda\"&gt;Khasda&lt;/a&gt;. He will make his escape, leaving behind the bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Cud\"&gt;Cud&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the intruder. Defeat him and untie Tasnasi, then head out through the nearby door. Here, Tasnasi confronts Khasda at knife-point and the Vestige has the option of allowing her to kill him or convincing her to spare him and make him confess to his crimes. If the former is chosen, Tasnasi will leave the Stitches for good, but with the latter, she decides to stay and Khasda becomes the one who is exiled."}

When we last saw Eslaf, he was a boy, an orphan, a failed beggar, running through the wildy winter woods of &lt;a href=\"Skyrim\"&gt;Skyrim&lt;/a&gt;, away from his home of Erolgard. He continued running, stopping here and there, for many more years, until he was a young man.\nEslaf discovered that among the ways of getting food, asking for it was the most troublesome. Far easier was finding it in the wilderness, or taking it from unguarded market stalls. The only thing worse than begging to get food was begging for the opportunity to work for the money to buy it. That seemed needlessly complicated.\nNo, as far as Eslaf was concerned, he was best off being a scavenger, a beggar, and a thief.\nHe his first act of thievery shortly after leaving Erolgard, while in the southern woods of Tamburkar in the rugged land near Mount Jensen just east of the village of Hoarbeld. Eslaf was starving, having not eaten anything but a rather scrawny raw squirrel in four days, and he smelled meat cooking and then found the smoke. A band of minstrel bards was making camp. He watched them from the bushes as they cooked, and joked, and flirted, and sang.\nHe could've asked them for some food, but so many others had refused him before. Instead, he rushed out, grabbed a piece of meat from the fire, and wincing from the burns, scrambled up the nearest tree to devour it while the bards stood under him and laughed.\n'Wh\u200bat is your next move, thief?' giggled a fair, red-headed woman who was covered with tattoos. 'How do you intend to disappear without us catching and punishing you?'\nAs the hunger subsided, Eslaf realized she was right. The only way to get out of the tree without falling in their midst was to take the branch down to where it hung over a creek. It was a drop off a cliff of about fifty feet. That seemed like the wisest strategy, so Eslaf began crawling in that direction.\n'You do know how to fall, boy?' called out a young &lt;a href=\"Khajiit\"&gt;Khajiit&lt;/a&gt;i, but a few years older than Eslaf, thin but muscular, graceful in his slightest movements. 'If you don't, you should just climb down here and take what's coming to you. It's idiotic to break your neck, when we'd just give you some bruises and send you on your way.'\n'Of course I know how to fall,' Eslaf called back, but he didn't. He just thought the trick of falling was to have nothing underneath you, and let nature take its course. But fifty feet up, when you're looking down, is enough to give anyone pause.\n'I'm sorry to doubt your abilities, Master Thief,' said the Khajiiti, grinning. 'Obviously you know to fall feet first with your body straight but loose to avoid cracking like an egg. It seems you are destined to escape us.'\nEslaf wisely followed the Khajiiti's hints, and leapt into the river, falling without much grace but without hurting himself. In the years that followed, he had to make several more drops from even greater heights, usually after a theft, sometimes without water beneath him, and he improved the basic technique.\nWhen he arrived in the western town of Jallenheim on the morning of his twenty-first birthday, it didn't take him long to find out who was the richest person, most deserving of being burgled. An impregnable palace in a park near the center of town was owned by a mysterious young man named Suoibud. Eslaf wasted no time in finding the palace and watching it. A fortified palace he had come to learn was like a person, with quirks and habits beneath its hard shell.\nIt was not an old place, evidently whatever money this Suoibud had come into was fairly recent. It was regularly patrolled by guards, implying that the rich man was fearful of been burgled, with good reason. The most distinctive feature of the palace was its tower, rising a hundred feet above the stone walls, doubtless giving the occupant a good defensive view. Eslaf guessed that that if Suoibud was as paranoid as he guessed him to be, the tower would also provide a view of the palace storehouse. The rich man would want to keep an eye on his fortune. That meant that the loot couldn't be directly beneath the tower, but somewhere in the courtyard within the walls.\nThe light in the tower shone all night long, so Eslaf boldly decided that the best time to burgle was by the light of day, when Suoibud must sleep. That would be the time the guards would least expect a thief to pounce.\nAnd so, when the noon sun was shining over the palace, Eslaf quickly scaled the wall near the front gate and waited, hidden in the crenelations. The interior courtyard was plain and desolate, with few places to hide, but he saw that there were two wells. One the guards used from time to time to draw up water and slake their thirst, but Eslaf noticed that guards would pass by the other well, never using it.\nHe waited until the guards were distracted, just for a second, by the arrival of a merchant in a wagon, bearing goods for the palace. While they were searching his wagon, Eslaf leapt, elegantly, feet first, from the wall into the well.\nIt was not a particularly soft landing for, as Eslaf had guessed, the well was not full of water, but gold. Still, he knew how to roll after a fall, and he didn't hurt himself. In the dank subterranean storehouse, he stuffed his pockets with gold and was about to go to the door which he assumed would lead to the tower when he noticed a gem the size of an apple, worth more than all the gold that was left. Eslaf found room for it down his pants.\nThe door did indeed lead to the tower, and Eslaf followed its curving stairwell up, walking quietly but quickly. At the top, he found the master of the palace's private quarters, ornate and cold, with invaluable artwork and decorative swords and shields on the walls. Eslaf assumed the snoring lump under the sheets was Suoibud, but he didn't investigate too closely. He crept to the windows and looked out.\nIt was going to be a difficult fall, for certes. He needed to jump from the tower, past the walls, and hit the tree on the other side. The tree branches would hurt, but they would break his fall, and there was a pile of hay he had left under the tree to prevent further injury.\nEslaf was about to leap when the occupant of the room woke up with a start, yelling, 'My gem!'\nEslaf and stared at him for a second, wide-eyed. They looked alike. Not surprising, since they were brothers.\nEslaf Erol's story is continued in the book &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20%28Book%29\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;."}
